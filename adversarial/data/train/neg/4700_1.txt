My wife and I are retired restaurant owners\/operators from the Chicago area, a well respected white tablecloth establishment for the past 32 years, still going strong. Our first visit to Cafe Monarch, although accidental, uplifted our spirits on this Mothers Day. The greeting could possibly use a hint of sophistication, of professionalism if you will; cute young ladies dressed in black is not synonymous of \"class\". This being said, our main server Richard was a delight to deal with, educated, well travelled, well spoken....his table-side manners are impeccable and well suited to the class the Monarch aims to belong to. Other wait staff members seemed well versed on the menu as well. The setting, outside, was one of the most romantic and classy environment one can hope for when fine dining! The menu selections could be seen as a bit short but considering the menu gets altered every other week or so......good choices. Perhaps I was a bit disappointed to hear the lamb was from NZ.....since the restaurant prides itself on featuring seasonal and local foods as much as possible...well? Colorado lamb is of high quality and somewhat closer than NZ...right? The cuisine was at the level of a 1+ Michelin star in France, not bad from a \"self taught\" Chef if I understood well. This young man has a bright future if he keeps at it and does not burn the stages of betterment. Our bottle of Ruinart Rose Champagne was chilled to perfection, such a pleasurable sensation!\nRichard overheard it was our 50th anniversary; he brought a dessert with a sparkler, a nice touch indeed!\nGreeting: 4 stars       Menu choices: 4 stars      wine list \/service: 5 stars\nFood preparation\/presentation: 4 stars    Service: 5 stars   \nAmbience\/decor\/appointments: 5 stars       Value: 5 stars (not cheap mind you , but worth it!)
