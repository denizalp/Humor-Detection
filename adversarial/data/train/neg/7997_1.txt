We hired Hey Bartender for a private dinner for 100 people. Our bartender was John, who checked in earlier in the day to go over the details, showed up on time and fully prepared. He was very professional, engaging with our guests, cleaned up, put away what we no longer needed for the night and left out what he thought we would continue to use. We were very pleased with Hey Bartender from the time we hired them, the owners communications and our bartenders service. I would highly recommend Hey Bartender! I also appreciated we could include and prepay the tip. This made the end of the evening stress free.
