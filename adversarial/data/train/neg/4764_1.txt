I was here for lunch this past weekend 10\/12\/13 for a bridal shower lunch. We arrived at 12:45pm and left at 3pm. Why you ask? It's NOT because we sat and chatted, no. We had to wait about 40 min between our courses. \n\nThe service was SO SLOW. It's like they didn't care about our group because they knew they were going to get a 18% tip anyways because we had a party of 8. Our water glasses and ice tea glasses were left empty for the longest time and even when we asked for our dessert to be expedited, it still look 40 minutes. I understand if it was a hot dessert but hello, IT WAS GREEK YOGURT!!!! \n\nHow the hell does it take 40 minutes to scoop yogurt into a cup???????\n\nPros: Goodo Tzatziki\nCons: Slow service, Walnut cake no longer on menu, fish was different day of.
