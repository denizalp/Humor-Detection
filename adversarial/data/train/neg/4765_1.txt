Gave it 3 stars because I wasn't too impressed. The food was pretty good but came out just warm not hot. I mainly wanted to come here to eat the \"smorgasbird\" a double decker chicken sandwich with basically every topping they have haha.\nI got a side of loaded large fries, the staff was really friendly but I just thought the food would be better.
