Brendan Cousineau, owner of Flex Physical Therapy, is an excellent physical therapist. He has treated me for various arthritic conditions, which, without his treatment, would have been debilitating. He has a wonderful, positive attitude and always strives for excellence on your behalf. Karen Davis, RN
