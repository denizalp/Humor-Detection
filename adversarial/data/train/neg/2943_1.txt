Ordered Intermatic timer.  Card charged immediately.  In stock, three day delivery.  NOT.  Tried to contact them and email address not valid.  Telephone mailbox is FULL.  They work, so it says, from 9 to 3 whenever.  DON'T order from these guys.  Google search will show you all the ripped off customers they have.
