Bed Bath and Beyond is a great place to shop. I know that I occasionally pay more when I shop here, but there are attentive, kind staff. Great return policy and coupons for 20% (on your most expensive item) available.\n\nThe item I was looking for on the weekend wasn't in stock. The associate ordered it for me and waived the shipping free. It'll arrive in a couple of days and I won't have to go back into the store unless I need to make a return.\n\nBBB makes shopping easy, and they have unusual gifts for the people that are hard to shop for. My next purchase is a banana slicer. Makes the process easier. Love that :)\n\nThey also have a gadget section and a pet section, in addition to everything else you may need for the home. They also have great hours. Open to till 9pm even on Saturday.\n\nI love shopping here and a five minute \"quick trip\" can turn into a hour quite easily. Make sure you check out the clearance section. You can find some great items!
