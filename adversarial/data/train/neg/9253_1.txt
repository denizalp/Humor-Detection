I picked Habourfront Animal Hospital for Rosie's vet mainly because of the location (5 min walking distance from the condo) and I'm very happy with the choice! \n\nDr. Debski has been our vet since October 2016 and has made every visit very pleasant. On our first few visits, he gave us very helpful tips on training and general care (Rosie is always at the vet because of her Giardia (internal parasites)). He gets the job done when it comes to shots but never makes Rosie uncomfortable. Dr. Debski is also very thorough in explaining procedures and always allows me to ask my 10 million questions which I really appreciate.\n\nAshley at the front desk is also very very helpful. I'm constantly emailing them in regards to requesting medical history, pet insurance, etc. And I always get a reply within the day (amazing!!). \n\nI never look forward to the bill but the amazing service here makes things way more pleasant. The staff are kind, knowledgable and patient- I would recommend coming here!
