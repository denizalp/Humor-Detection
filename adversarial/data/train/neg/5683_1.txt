3 years ago, bought a house in Tempe that needed complete new water lines, sewer lines (under house) and hot water heater, etc.  Another words, BIG job.  Plumbsmart did all of the work as promised and at a reasonable rate.  Home is currently being sold and some items came up needing repair under warranty.  Don came out and did the job quickly and without any squawk in a courteous and professional manner.  Robert in the office helped with additional property inspector items - above and beyond the call of duty. I can't say enough good things about this company. Outstanding company with outstanding customer service.  Highly recommend!
