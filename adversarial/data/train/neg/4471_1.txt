Absolutely wonderful! This has been my second stop since receiving my indie coffee passport (look this up) and I'm blown away! As I was approaching this place going North on Broadview there was nothing around then suddenly a bustling patio at Roosters!\n\nThe coffee is wonderful and whether you're inside or out the atmosphere is very neighbourhoody and clearly frequented by regulars.  They seem to offer a weekly espresso roast that changes weekly and always sounds delicious.  This week it's Atomic Roaster with a chocolate and berry tones.\n\nCome check this place out!
