The best Korean BBQ buffet I have been to. You choose your uncooked meat like a buffet then go back to your table to cook it yourself. They also have buffet sides like kimchi, sea weed noodles & fried rice. The service is good and they offered to change our grill pretty frequently. Come hungry! Lunch is only 12.99!
