The plan tonight was to go to Pho Lien a good Vietnamese place which is right next door, but it was packed and my sister in law had a bit of a look of panic that she was only going to have soup to choose from.\n\nWe took a chance and went to Talay Thai and WOW very good.  Having been to Thailand recently I must say the recipe's used tasted traditional and very flavorful.  We ordered about 5 dishes in total that we shared family style, and I only have great things to say about each of them.  The decor wasn't that authentic, but in the end we're there for the food right.\n\nA definite  repeat visit the next time I want to get my Thai on.
