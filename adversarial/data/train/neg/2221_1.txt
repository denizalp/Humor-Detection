Come here whenever my family chooses it, but definitely not my personal cup of tea.\n\nFood is decent, but there are definitely a few dishes that stand out to me. Their BBQ pork are one of the most flavourful if you enjoy ones that have tons of fat and are swimming in soya sauce. The deep fried tofu is also amazing, but not the healthiest. Another amazing dish is the hot pot dishes, with soup, veggies, and pork bone. Best ordered during the winter with a bunch of people. \n\nService is okay, as they always have enough people working. A reservation is advised as they are busy most nights\/weekends.
