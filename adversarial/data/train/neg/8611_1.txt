I was here for lunch last week with a few colleagues. This place was crazy busy and once my colleagues and I filled up six seats, there were a few customers coming in who had to wait for tables. \n\nThis place is also loud and you might have to repeat your order. The guy taking my order didn't hear me ask for pickles so I didn't get any on my burger, which was a shame. \n\nThe burger patty is smashed onto the griddle so they get an amazing char on their patties. I ordered the Prime burger which is supposed to be 6 ounces. I honestly didn't notice much difference between the thickness of my patty and my colleague's 4 ounce Fresh burger. Perhaps it was wider in circumference? I don't know.\n\nThey do smash down these patties to quite a thin size, so there isn't much chance to retain a lot of juiciness, but this patty was in no way dry. It was good and flavourful, thin and well-charred. The bun and toppings (save the missing pickles) were all good.\n\nThe fries were decent. Crispy and golden. Nicely seasoned.
