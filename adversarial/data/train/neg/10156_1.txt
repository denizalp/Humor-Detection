I had booked a spa day while out in Scottsdale with a friend of mine.  Unfortunately the young lady who I spoke with over the phone did not put us on the schedule and so when we turned up for our appointment we were told that no nail technician was available, but they could give us the massages and facials we had booked for.  Apparently there had been some change at the front desk.\n\nAnita was my masseuse and she was wonderful;  normally I am not a fan of massages, but really enjoyed my 25 min. massage with her, felt so relaxed afterwards.  My friend had a male masseuse and said he was very good also.  I believe DeeAnn did both of our facials - I had the Euro facial and my friend had the Quench facial.  Our skin felt wonderful afterwards. \n\nDespite the disappointment of not being to get a mani-pedi, I would recommend Spa Lamar.  The staff were very nice, the spa itself is clean, nicely decorated and very relaxing. We did not use the sauna or steam room, or the pool, but enjoyed sitting in the lounge area and just relaxing.  We did partake of the fruit and juice bar.  If out in Scottsdale again in the future, I would use Spa Lamar again.
