I am already a fan of 800 degrees in LA so when I looked for a late night eatery in Vegas and saw this one I thought yesss, let's do it ! The staff was so awesome and gave us really good suggestions since we were hell bent on making our own pizzas! Mine was all veggie and my new addiction is adding artichoke! It was soooo yummy! Plus you can't end the pizza experience without gelato. All of their flavors are so good! I definitely recommend this spot! We were there late and they did not push us out. We tried to be mindful about them closing so we hurried before they started stacking chairs!
