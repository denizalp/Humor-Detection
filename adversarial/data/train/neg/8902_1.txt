Not impressed.  We have an excellent nanny, but we were lucky.  I feel that the agency only cared about getting the fees, not finding a right match or helping us with the search.  They made an easy $1600 from us and haven't called to see if we are happy, nor have they called our nanny to check on her.  They won't hesitate to call if they need something though.  I expected more. I will say that Beth was super sweet every time we spoke with her.  Her partner is not, nor is she helpful.
