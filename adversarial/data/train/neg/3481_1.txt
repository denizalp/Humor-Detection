Delicious korean food. Very authentic. Very traditional. Great for groups. You get unlimited amounts of rice, water, tea and korean side dishes that includes pickled vegetables, salad, potato salad and kimchi. However, the rice, water, and tea is self serve. Cheap pricing considering the amount of food is given. Small space so reserved a table beforehand. Easy parking and near by chinook mall if you need a walk after eating.
