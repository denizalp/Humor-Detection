3.5 stars. \n\nBeen here a few times, and the food is pretty good ..it would be awesome if they were open late nite.  \n\nThe jerk fried rice, the jade red chicken, and the jen red pork are great and dont disappoint.  The pollo diablo has good kick, and the hengrenade chicken is pretty good too.  The machaca is kinda bland, but the hot sauce helps.
