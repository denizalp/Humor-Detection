I am between a 3 and 4 on this place.  I love the location and sitting on the patio was beautiful.  A friend and I settled for a leisurely evening of catching up, having some appetizers and drinks.  The service was good and it was bad.  They were attentive but maybe too attentive.  It is bothersome to me when they take away a plate when there is still food on it (and don't ask) and take away your drink when it is almost still half full.  Those are just silly mistakes.  Otherwise, the hummus, bacon wrapped dates. lamb meatballs and gnoochi were all worth the calories. Dessert not so much (I think it was the ice cream bar).  I think it is definitely a great place to spend some time and hang out.
