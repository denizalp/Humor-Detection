I had a scheduled service B. $600+ dollars for a glorified oil change is outrageous. They quote $540, but then there is a $35 or $40 fee for disposal (disposal of what? old oil? Shouldn't it be included in the oil change part?). This makes no sense. What a rip off! The only reason you had me there is because of a ransom message on my dashboard that you are able to turn off. Don't tell me service B is \"more than just an oil change\"-Walmart does the same inspection plus synthetic oil change for $50 dollars... Hendrick MB service center are a bunch of dishonest crooks and I will never be back. \n\nThis morning I also found out there is a very simple way to take down the service message on your dashboard-search youtube for it-no tools needed-it's how they do it in the dealership. \n\nI challenge you to take down the ransom message and see how many people would truly come back for service to your location. Also, don't think you are immune to change-Uber disrupted taxi industry, Air B&B disrupted hotels, and Tesla will disrupt the dealer auto service industry.
