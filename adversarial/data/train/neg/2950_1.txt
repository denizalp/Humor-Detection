Decided to use CM for a small move--my son moving to an apartment from our home (SW part of Vegas to Henderson).   We needed to hire a moving company for the heavy furniture (LR, BR, Kit, etc).   They were very efficient & friendly.  Wrapped furniture with drawers and such.    Very reasonable amount.   Ann in the office was super nice.   We had a change of dates (3 days earlier than scheduled) & she was able to work us in on the new move date.    Would definitely use again.
