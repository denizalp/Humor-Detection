This turned out to be a great experience for our entire family. We had our daughters 10th birthday party here and all of the kids had a tremendous time. They had so much to do and all of them had smiles on their faces the whole day.\n\nAs for the customer service. I will give this place two thumbs up. Our party started out a little rocky due to our room accidently being double booked. However, the general manager, made everything great. I was little disappointed at first but let me just say they made everything right! I didn't have to throw a fit or even ask for much. Once the mistake was realized the team was on it to take care of us.\n\nWe will definitely be going back for some awesome jump time. \n\nThank you everyone at Rockin Jump for making this such a great experience for our friends and family!
