I just got back from a trip to NOLA and decided I needed to ween myself off the seafood binge with some of that good New Orleans Takeout. I've come here many times in the past too and tasted most things on the menu. \n\nGet the fried catfish. I get mine with cornbread and red beans n rice. You don't see catfish much on the menu in Madison, so branch out and try. It's fried to perfection, and with some hot sauce on it  . The po-boys are stellar. For smaller entree or apps get anything in the specialties side of the menu covered in the creole or etouffee sauces if you can handle some heat, it's ok to skip the jambalaya, gumbo and dirty rice (they're good but not the stars of the show).
