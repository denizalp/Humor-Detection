Asked for an estimate on getting my pool ready for summer because I am a first time pool owner. They come out while I am at work, which is fine, and provide me an estimate. Estimate seemed high but in alll fairness it could be a reasonable price. I pay them. When work is scheduled to be started (at work again) they told me my filter pump was broke and work couldnt be completed. I flip a few breakers and adjust the timers on the pool subpanel they had access to and pump and filter are working.  Asked for a refund of my money. They told me I will only receive part of it. No work done to my pool but they still get paid. I would have given it 1 star but they did show up. I have to give credit where it is due I guess.
