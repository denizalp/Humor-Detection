Went to Vitner for a lunch meeting.  First impression was the location is strange and a little hard to find.  It is connected to an office building inside a professional park, not where you'd typically find a restaurant.  However, if you work in one of the many office buildings nearby, it is probably very convenienct.   The food was ok - not bad by any stretch but a little overpriced.   The atmosphere is very upscale and we saw a few local Vegas celebrities eating lunch at the same time.
