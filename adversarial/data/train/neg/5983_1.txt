Love La Belle Pro. Classic all-dressed steamies (though unfortunately no longer for 49 cents) and a great poutine, lots of delicious cheese curds and tasty gravy that isn't beefy (like New York Fries). Though the fries are a little thick-cut for me, they are still good (and greasy). I don't think they accept credit cards though, but maybe that changes from location to location.
