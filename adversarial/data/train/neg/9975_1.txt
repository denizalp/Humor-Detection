It is a basic dim sum house. The food is good and there is usually something new to try. This time around the carts were moving kind of slow.We had to ask the manger where the sliced roasted pork was, he had it sent over as soon as it was done. \n\nThey are not really much on service. The food is good. Its great for groups and a sunday brunch. You can eat like royalty for 20 $ a person. \n\nWill demo go back.
