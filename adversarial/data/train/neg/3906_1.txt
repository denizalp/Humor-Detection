I believe in the hype. \n\nStopped by here for a weekday brunch and ordered their slut. As many other reviewers have noted, it's creamy mashed potatoes topped with a perfectly coddled egg, some seasonin's (chive and grey sea salt) in a jar along with slices of toasted and buttered baguette. \n\nThe line was wrapped around the corner and not quite to the restrooms, but the women ahead of me did take a long time in ordering which was a bit frustrating, however, the cashier was manning two registers and my order was taken efficiently. \n\nI don't typically order orange juice but I did here, and it was delicious! Was it fresh-squeezed? Possibly!\n\nI was concerned about seating, but people tend to eat and go since it's not the type of place to lounge, so by the time my order came up (within several minutes), I had secured a spot along their high top. \n\nAt first taste, it was salty, but that's because I didn't mix it up like I was supposed to. The egg yolk had the right amount of ooze and warmth. When I did stir up the whole thing, it was good on its own or spread onto the bread, which was a perfect amount of toasted\/chewiness. \n\nI would say if you were starving, this would not have filled you up. I was feeling a might peckish and this was the perfect amount of food. \n\nI debated keeping the jar, but there was nothing discerning it from any other jar, so I left it in their designated recycling shelf. Otherwise their waste is compostable! \n\nVery happy to have made this one of my last meals in Vegas.
