This is the second time that I've been here. Parking is a little rough, and you may have to park down the street.  You offer at a register, get a number, and find a seat. Now down to the business of the food...Both times that I've been here, the food just blows me away! Everything is so fresh and has some serious flavor! The first time I ordered the cauliflower tacos, and they were so tasty and light, yet filling! This time I got the Tepary Bean burger (Not pictured. Sorry, I was hungry!), and was one is the best vegan burgers that I've ever had! The soft bun, and the one big stewed tomato on top is perfection! I will be back here again and again!
