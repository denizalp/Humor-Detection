I got great service from Itinerante in Banker's Hall.  All I wanted was a little floral arrangement and they could do one up for me in 10 minutes!!   The flowers were fresh and the arrangement was done so professionally. \n\nIf I ever need another floral arrangment from downtown, this is the place where I'd go.
