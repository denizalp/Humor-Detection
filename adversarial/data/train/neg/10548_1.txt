Mmmm....this place was delish! We came with some friends almost near closing time, but their service was still attentive and the food quality and presentation did not seem rushed. \n\nThe Chirashi dish completely satisfied my sashimi cravings. It. Was. Amazing. And surprisingly still filling! We ordered three additional rolls, whose names escape me (because I should've written this sooner), that were also all satisfying. \n\nOur friends ordered one of the bento box meals, which was plentiful. The only complaint was that the plate didn't really look like a bento box - but that's not a deal breaker. \n\nVery impressed with this place!
