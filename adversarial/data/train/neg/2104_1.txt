Very average Italian food for very high prices, 2 orders of spaghetti and meatballs with one soft drink and our bill was $50.00 including tip.  Kept scanning the menu for reasonably priced entrees but there were none to be found, even had to pay extra for a garden salad instead of the offered Caesar salad, wow!  The service was attentive once the waitress arrived but that took quite a while.  Upon entering the restaurant, no one greeted us and after a few minutes, another diner told us they were all in the kitchen but someone should appear shortly.....
