Great place, and great prices.  They have something for everyone on the menu and the portions are fabulous.  Lots of options for everyone to choose from.  One thing I love that a lot of places don't do is when it's listed as spicy it is spicy!  Everything is flavorful and delicious, we've only done take out so far but the service is always fabulous which I find with take out is sometimes forgotten.
