If you are able to stop at this breakfast gem,  do it.  We had 5 different orders,  and all were fantastic.  I had the Eggs Benedict, and WOW. Absolutely amazing.  Portions are ginormous, and super kid friendly. The Southwestern was enough for 2 people,  but my husband lived it so much he finished them on his own.
