This place was a surprise .. I was craving indo chinese food and found this place after a quick yelp search. Portion size - huge , fried rice can easily feed 3 adults , quality is great nothing fancy, flavor- awesome it was bang on in terms of indo chinese flavor, price - super affordable. Huge selection !! Will definitely visit again!
