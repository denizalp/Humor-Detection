Went here for dinner recently during the week, and was surprised to be the only ones there when we walked in. The service was great and the food was excellent! We had the chicken dansak and lamb bhuna. The chicken was nice and tender and lamb perfectly cooked, both dishes tasted great! Will definitely be back here!
