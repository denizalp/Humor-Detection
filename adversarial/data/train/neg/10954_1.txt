I'm from Austin and was in charge of a dinner to cater for 14 girls... Let's say sushi samba far exceeded our expectations! The manager, Jason, truly could have been more accommodating! The wait staff was ON POINT with delivering drinks and clearing our table as well. We did the $50 per person tasting menu and got exactly what we paid for! I will recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone who is traveling to Vegas who is looking for fabulous food, fun atmosphere and a well trained staff! Thanks guys!!!
