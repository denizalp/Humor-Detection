Great Service & Great Food! We visited this place for brunch and it did not let me down! I first tried their \"Flavor of the Day\" Mimosa which happened to be a Watermelon Mimosa for $10. It was so good, but in all fairness I am obsessed with watermelon. Next we ordered the \"Vegas Fries\" for $14.50. Omg, these were my favorite! The waitress told me they were spicy but I didn't agree with that at all! They are perfectly crunchy on the outside, served with great sauces and I can't wait to have these again! The \"Banana French Toast\" for $15 was good just super sweet! My husband had the \"Original Burger\" for $22.50 because he added bacon. Overall my server Brooke was so sweet!  Not a long wait for good quality food and service! I will absolutely have this again on my next visit.
