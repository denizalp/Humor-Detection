I used to joke about this place because of past experiences with restaurants that do many different asian dishes at once. Usually they're  so terrible with food that it'll knock you on your back faster than a kick to the face.\n\nTott's proved me wrong. So wrong that I came back the day after I ate there. Everything i've had has been really good, but I have an addiction to their orange shrimp. The perfect level of spice, the crunchy golden shrimp, and that godly sauce...sorry. I need to clean up my keyboard now. The walnut shrimp was really good, the bourbon chicken was nice, the stir fry is good, and the lo mein was excellent.\n\nWait. All this praise and it's only getting 4 out of 5? Okay, their fried rice isn't all that great (tastes pretty flat) and the won ton soup has some pretty weak won tons. \n\nThe portions are huge though and it compensates for the flat rice. If their fried rice was as good as any other chinese place, i'll happily edit this and give them five stars. The owner is really nice though and is always thankful for your business...so my final score is a 4 1\/2 out of 5.
