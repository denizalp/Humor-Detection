They make one of the best crusts I've ever had, chewy and thin and just right, however, there is hardly any toppings at all, no attempt at a sauce and a micron thickness of cheese. I went several times but gave up, it's only pizza for the kids going to get drunk in the Market area at night. \n\nI tried a panzerotto and the dough is so thick and uncooked, half way through it I just put in the trash. It was a centimetre thick at least. It was like chewing raw rubber. \n\nI caught the asian girl behind the counter going all the way downstairs to get dough and touching the walls and doors the handling change and NOT WASHING HER HANDS before she started making the order! I pointed it out to her and she washed  them, I also told the owner. Bet a few minutes later with a different customer, she did it again. Every time I walk by now, I see her serving customers and think of those fingers....\n\nEnough.\nI gave them a good try.
