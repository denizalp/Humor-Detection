Loved this place! It was a bit of a drive for me (like 30 minutes), but well worth it. The low lighting keeps it sexy, but the low roar of the crowd gives it a cool, casual vibe still. The drinks were excellent (try the Maple Ol Fashioned), and the food was fantastic (brick oven chicken and the shrimp pasta). The service was great, seems like the whole staff does a great job working together, making for a seamless experience. Will definitely go back!
