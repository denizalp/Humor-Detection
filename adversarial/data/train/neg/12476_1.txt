Came here during Epic UGM on a Monday night. Great atmosphere and our server was knowledgeable and courteous. The cheese plate was a great appetizer as it was not too filling and gave our group the opportunity to try some awesome cheeses. The grilled and raw oysters were crowd-pleasers, too. I had the walleye as I'd never had that fish before and was operating on the \"when in Rome\" principle. We tried to do that with the cheese curds, which they were out of - how do you run out of cheese in Wisconsin? They were also out of one of the cheese platter cheese choices, as well as soprasetta. Our server also told us they were running low on filet. Would have been 5 stars, but they clearly had not prepared their food inventory for one of the biggest events of the year in the area.
