Stumbled in to the Terrace POinte Cafe after a a typical vegas night. Shows, clubbing, bodalicious strippers and, of course, excessive alcohol consumption. \n\nThe raspberry french toast was the perfect ending\/beginning to the morning. A very generous helping of stacked french toast, and the raspberry was complementary rather than overwhelming. A perfect balance between sweet and sour. \n\nThe service was also fantastic. I loved our waitress who was friendly and cheerful at 6 in the morning. Needless to say, I definitely enjoyed my breakfast.
