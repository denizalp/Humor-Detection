Ok so it's not like this place has killer Chinese food, but I just like it because I go to Vegas and stay at the Hard Rock Hotel here and there, and this place is a decent substitute for Chinese food while I get a little \"home sick\" for it. If it was located anywhere else, like NYC I would have probably given this place 3 stars in terms of food, but since it's Vegas and I'm in the middle of the desert, this is probably as good as it's going to get. \n\nThe portions are great. The price is reasonable. The service is decent. I like to sit down and eat here to take a break from the rowdiness of \"Vegas\". It seems very clean. \n\nI like getting the pickled green shredded pork noodle soup. It's pretty Chinese, hard to go wrong with it.
