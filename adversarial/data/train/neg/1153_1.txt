My husband and I had dinner there last night. He ordered chicken nachos and I ordered salmon. It took almost an hour to get our food. Last time I checked, it didn't take that long for nachos and salmon. More than half way through our wait, they brought us chips and salsa. At no point, did the manager come out and offer an apology or drinks or anything while we waited. This was some piss poor customer service. It was our first and last time. We'll stick to Cactus Moon.
