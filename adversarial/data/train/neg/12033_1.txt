I've had my teen son enrolled here since September in one-on-one training with Tyler. My son had no previous work-out experience so he was a little nervous. We first met with Courtney - her ability to communicate with kids made him want to join that day! Coach Tyler is fantastic and makes the workout challenging at his level. The owners are super friendly and they go out of their way to create a supportive and fun environment. They and members have given my son a lot of encouragement which has made a big impression on him. In addition to regular Crossfit and personal training, they offer the Life program for beginners. There's something for everyone here!
