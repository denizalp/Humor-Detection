My wife took an item to them to be sewn; the procedure was agreed, and the cost was also agreed. On the delivery day, only one of the items were done. In my opinion, this process took about 5 minutes from beginning to end. The other alteration was NOT done, but now they want more money to do it . $8 for 5 minutes works out to $96 p\/h. Not very customer friendly, and not recommended.
