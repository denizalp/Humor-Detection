Very typical pub style place. The Bartender took some time to explain the beers they make in house and tell me his recommendations. Good music was playing at a nice volume with the music videos on the screens, I LOVE it when bars do that. They had this cool beer flight that has all their beers lined up on a board and they ring a giant bell when someone orders it.
