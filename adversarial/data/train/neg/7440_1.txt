I was sad to be so disappointed!! I really wanted to love my first experience here! On a Saturday night there was hardly anyone there. I should have taken this as my first hint. It took 5 minutes to be acknowledged and seated. And even longer for our waiter to make initial contact with us. I ordered the Cobb salad and was quite surprised when I could barely stab the grilled chicken with my fork. Extremely dry and hard. Not fresh at all. The Mac and cheese was described by the waiter to be \"gourmet\" but it was old and dry. One bite was all it took to not eat the rest. The fried shrimp were very good! The environment was fun with a good live band and a good design energy. The service was overall bad and the food mediocre at best. I wouldn't go back.
