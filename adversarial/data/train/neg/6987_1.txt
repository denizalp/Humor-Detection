We decided to try this place based on yelp reviews.  We stopped in for lunch on Sunday.  We ordered the fried chicken and biscuits, Mac and cheese, salad and cheese grits.  The best thing hands down were the grits.  They are course ground and not smooth which may turn some off but they are terrific.  The salad was on point, it had these thick pieces of bacon that we referred to as bacon croutons.  My least favorite were the chicken and biscuits.  Like I said earlier, I'm a breast man and the chicken pieces were thighs which I did not like.\n\nBottom line, service was solid, food was great, kind of pseudo family style were most everything can be shared.  The grits were soooooo good I was kicking myself for not ordering the shrimp and grits.
