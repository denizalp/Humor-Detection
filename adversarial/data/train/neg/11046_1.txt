The Arizona Diamondbacks may not be an awesome team but in the Air conditioned dome it was a fun experience. \nWe had seats in the all you can eat and drink section. Only hotdogs, peanuts and popcorn plus soft drinks. Hey, what do you expect from an all you an eat section! It was a new experience for both of us, we had never seen so many hotdogs eaten ! We each had one, they were pretty tasty and a really fun day !!
