The owner is polite, friendly, helpful and from Acapulco, Mexico. Why is it important that I mention he's Mexican? It means authentic and delicious Mexican food!\n\nAfter ordering my meal, the owner brought nachos with a red and green salsa on the side to the table, for free! \n\nI got the chicken taquitos which came with 4 small crispy chicken tacos, topped with lettuce, tomato, authentic Latin cream and cheese. It came with a side of guacamole and salsa. That only cost $4.99.\n\nIt was delicious, a nice cozy place and positive vibes. Will definitely be recommending this little gem to family and friends. Already planning my next family outing there :)
