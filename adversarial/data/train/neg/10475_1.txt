Rockin Jump is definitely one of my favorite places to take the kids. They have many great deals especially on the weekends at night when they have family night $15 per child to jump for 2 hours which comes with a slice of pizza and a drink. My kids absolutely love going. My son had his ninth birthday party there back in October and it was a wonderful experience. Nothing but the best helpful staff who put everything together and we had the best birthday party ever. I have been other trampoline places but none comes close to Rockin Jump they are simply the cleanest place and the best staff. They are really conscious of safety and cleanliness which is something that I am highly for. Looking at getting my kids a membership along with their cousins so they can jump anytime. But again on family nights or any night and during the day they have wonderful discounts and so much more I rate this place number 5 but I really think it's a 100% percent the best place for trampoline and climbing fun and safety.
