I love Scramble.\n\nWe were the first people there on Easter Sunday. They open at 6 am & we were there at 6:07.\n\nHow can that cute girl taking orders be so nice & cheery that early in the morning?! And it was the same girl as last time. She makes my Scramble experiences fun. The other shorter girl working didn't seem as nice.\n\nMy gouda brizza was quite tasty. Omg was it hot when I bit in though! I was SO hungry I just wanted to devour it. Yeah, wait a second before trying to chow down, ok?\n\nCould the cinnamon roll have any more frosting? Wow! Luckily, I like them smothered in the stuff. They just pile it on & you spread it around.\n\nI want to describe Scramble as fresh, open, clean, bright, & modern.\n\nThe counter girl agrees with me that they need more than just the cherry flavored Capri-Sun. She said the parfaits are good too. I'm going to have to try 1 some time.
