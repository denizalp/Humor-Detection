I crave this pizza. Get the thin crust and load it up with toppings. Not a fancy place but definitely friendly and very accommodating. I see couples in here on dates and entire extended families with grandpas and babies and everyone in between. The decor is dated, but you don't go for the upholstery, you go for the pizza which I am now wildly craving. BRB.
