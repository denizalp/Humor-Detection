This was a pit stop for us on the way to Banff. It was a cold night in Calgary and pho is always a great idea. I thought it was easy, fast, and good. Satisfying for what it is. \n\nThe portion was just perfect for me, I ordered a medium. I always get the pho dac biet, combination of everything yummy that can go into pho. \n\nIt's good for groups because there were 13 of us and they had no problems seating us. \n\nNothing is special about this pho place that would make it stand out to me, but there's nothing bad that would make me not want to make another pit stop here when I'm back in Canada.
