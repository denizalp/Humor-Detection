We have had Chong Chin on three occasions.  The first time was excellent.  The second time was meh.  We ordered the same exact dishes, but I believe we got a different cook.  The third time was excellent again.  Their delivery guy is awesome.  Super friendly.  He always says helloooooooooo! with a big smile.  He is the only delivery guy I've ever had that walked right into my house.  He actually remembered us on the third visit.  We had just closed on our house and moved to a new neighborhood.  He gave me a hug saying congratulations.  The only bad thing about him is that he never has a pen so make sure you do.  LOL
