I had both the szechuan beef soup and the bbq pork and duck soup and both were absolutely amazing. I wish I had a place even REMOTELY like this in Denver! Super busy place, so expect a wait during lunch time! There was a line out the door every day I walked past it during lunch. This place is another on my do-not-miss in Vegas!
