The servive was great! She very helpful with recommendations and very knowledgeable about the menu. The food presentation was beautiful. But the taste was a major let down!  There was no flavor and very bland. I love seafood! My friend who I ate with me said the same about his food. The reviews say this place is so great. But I am  hesitant to go back and try again feel like I wasted money for the food turn out like that again.
