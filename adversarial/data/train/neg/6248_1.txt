Food mediocre and overpriced. The staff working there are not pleasant at all. The only thing that was good was the chips and salsa.  The chili relleno was greasy beyond belief and had a wierd tasting sauce which made it unedible. The beans tasted like they were straight out of a can and were not at all fresh. The shrimp was tough and had obviously been microwaved.  The margaritas were in a mini-sized glass, yet were $10. Waste of time and money! We will never go back!
