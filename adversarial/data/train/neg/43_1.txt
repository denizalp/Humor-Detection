I came to Sun Valley Stereo last month and had them completely re-do my audio system in my Nissan Z. Im super picky about work done on my car and I must say that Ryan and his team did a flawless job, I had a ton of questions and special requests for my install, Ryan was more than accommodating. The prices here are the best in the valley, and so is the quality of installs and service. Im super happy with my experience and I will definitely be back for my next project!
