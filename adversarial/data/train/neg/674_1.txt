I live about 1000 miles from nearest CONNS store and have never shopped in one. Yet they call me daily trying to collect money from me but won't tell me what I am supposed to owe for. Judging from all the complaints out there, they are an appliance store covering for a pretty shady financial operation. Ignore their calls and don't give them any info.
