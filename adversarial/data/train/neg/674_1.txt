Never again. If you want to pay for an expensive, old, small warehouse, by all means, One-to-One is your place. The gym members and the workers are great. However, the owners do not know how to manage this place and are in way over their heads. I wish I never paid a penny to those two; however, the trainers I have met are friendly and good people. Again, it's wayyyyy too expensive. The guest passes are $12 each per day, and this does not include any gymnasiums, basketball courts, racquetball courts, or pool. Save your money, and go to Anytime Fitness for less than half the price, or go to LA Fitness for a week for free and enjoy a swim in the pool or a movie while you workout. Give your time and money to owners that care for their members and their employees.
