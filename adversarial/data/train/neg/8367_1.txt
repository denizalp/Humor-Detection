This is the bank INSIDE the Smith's store. \n\nWe grocery shop at this store pretty much weekly, so it makes sense to hit up the bank while we're inside. The staff have always been extremely friendly and helpful. We had a couple major issues a couple of times (not due to this location) and they worked everything out just fine with fantastic customer service and dispositions. \n\nOne of the regular gals isn't there anymore (at least, we haven't seen her in a while), and there are a couple of new guys, and I would venture to say they fit in very well. Always friendly and with a smile on their faces, never short with anyone (that we've witnessed), and even if we don't stop in at the bank, they all wave and say hello when we pass by. \n\nThere is a full service bank branch in the same parking lot (why? who knows...), and we prefer to go to the store branch due to their customer service and general personalities. We've been in the full bank one time, and unless we absolutely HAVE to, we will not be going there again over the store branch.
