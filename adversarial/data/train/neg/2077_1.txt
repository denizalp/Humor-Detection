I was so impressed with this mobile service.. \nI called and Robert Silverman was immediately ready to help me. \nI was caught off guard that he was willing to bring the service to my home.. \nWOW!! \nI so happened to be away from my home and he still accommodated me. He was so kind and very professional.\n\nI now have a permanent notary.
