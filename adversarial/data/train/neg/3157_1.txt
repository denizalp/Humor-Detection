Best pizza in downtown Pittsburgh. The place is a hole in the wall so its easy to miss and often gets passed up-do yourself a favor and stop in. Order a specialty pizza and you won't be disappointed. I always order either the greek, which is basically a gyro in pizza form, or the buffalo chicken, which comes with buffalo fries on top. I've also tried the meat lovers, sausage, and mushroom pizzas. I usually hate mushrooms but the pizza itself was so yummy that I didn't even mind the mushrooms.
