The three stars are only bc I don't think the intent of the ladies there were malicious just not professional. The food was mediocre the service was subpar. I don't have high expectations for Waffle House because well...its Waffle House, but this location was definitely not meeting even minimum expectations. No one greeted me, it took awhile before someone would take my order and again the food wasn't good. I'll stick to my regular Independence location from now on.
