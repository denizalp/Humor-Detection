Had a SPECTACULAR time!  Took my friend there for her birthday and we were spoiled.  The server (Al) was engaging without being intrusive.  The food was original and the tastes were out of this world.  We were taken care of beautifully.  I would highly recommend dining at this restaurant and I will return soon!
