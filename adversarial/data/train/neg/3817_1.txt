These guys are awesome!  I was given an old watch that used to belong to my Grandfather recently. The watch had not worked in decades.  I had originally sent it directly to the manufacturer to refurbish but they were unable to do it due to the age of the watch and shortage of parts.  The manufacturer's estimates started at $1,500 and had to be sent to Switzerland for an evaluation, which took several months.  I took it into Bell Towne Alterations and Shoe Repair (they repair watches too!) and within a week it was running.  All this cost less than a 25% of what the manufacturer quoted. They charged me exactly what they said they would and were incredibly fast.  They totally exceeded my expectations!  \n\nThanks guys, I'm really enjoying wearing a piece of my family history with the watch.  I really appreciate your help!
