Came here and tried the cream cheese wheel cake and original milk tea, no ice half sugar. Wheel cake was made fresh to order so expect to wait 10-12 mins. Wheel cake was pretty good, although like others have said the cake part didn't have much flavour but the filling was flavourful so it was a nice balance. Bubble tea had a lot of tea flavour, but I think next time I'll get normal sugar as they're sugar levels are lower than that of chatime or cocos.
