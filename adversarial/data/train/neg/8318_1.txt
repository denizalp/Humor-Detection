I've ordered from PM probably 10 or 15 times and I think I'm finally finished with them. The first few times I had their food I was really pleased with it. Reasonable prices, good flavors, and big servings. But as I ordered more and more times I find that I'm happy with the food I get maybe 50% of the time. Sometimes there's just a weird taste- especially on the pork dumplings which I believe are microwaved. They have sort of a leathery skin on them sometimes. \nThe last straw for me came when I placed a phone order and came in to pick it up. I experienced some truly horrible customer service. I described my order to the guy at the counter, who said it wasn't ready yet (I came at the time I was told on the phone) and I should have a seat. In the meantime, he charges me for the food ($13, sounded low to me) and asks me to have a seat. After about 10 minutes of waiting, he came over to me, and told me that he was going to have to re-do my order and charge me a higher total because he made a mistake. Oh, and my food had been ready since I got there and he didn't realize that either. So I went home very angry, with cold food. Done with this place. I'll miss the wonton soup, but not enough to justify giving them any more money.
