Went last night.\nThe good- the food.\nThe bad- half the seats are very low uncomfortable hard stools. Still no sign so drove by it twice. The prices have risen already from what I saw on some recent reviews. That didn't take long !\n\nThe food being the most important but the stools ruin the experience ! Also no longer better value when compared to other Izakayas.
