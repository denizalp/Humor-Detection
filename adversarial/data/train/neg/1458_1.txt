What a horrible experience dealing with this company These people are unprofessional, and negligent. I can't get anyone on the phone or to return my phone calls. Most of my belongings arrived damaged. Filing a claim is an even bigger hassle because you have to deal with a third party. The two guys that came to pick up my furniture were arguing with each other. they lost the keys to their truck and we're stuck in my community for hours. I had several neighbors complaining because their truck was blocking them in and blocking the driveway. One gentleman even made the comment that he would never allow the company to ship his belongings because he works in the warehouse and see what goes on back there. I was told my belongings would be in Las Vegas the next. 3 days later i called to found out were the furniture was. I was informed they didn't know the address that they were delivering my stuff to. Why wouldn't they call me? On top of that I also received somebody else's belongings. They didn't even care. nobody has ever contacted me to pick the stuff up. I have 2 broken dresser, a broken TV, missing knobs and legs from other furniture. Avoid at all costs.
