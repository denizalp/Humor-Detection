3\/5 stars\n\nWe came here on a Friday night for dinner and this restaurant was very lively!\nThe food and service was OK. Definitely a millennial type a scene. \n\nOrdered:\n1) Chip and Salsa: 3\/5 salsa was good. Chips were okay.\n2) Guacamole: 4\/5 yum!! DELICIOUS. Fresh avocado and you cast taste it!\n3) Grilled shrimp taco: 3\/5 eh, okay, but not for the price..\n4) Braised pineapple pork: 3\/5 again, okay, but not fantastic\n5) Charred skirt steak: 3\/5 eh, okay.\n\nOverall, I probably won't be back.
