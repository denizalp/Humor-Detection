Double boo for this place.\nI've been coming here since they only had 1 place on Mill and the dad ran it.\nBack then it was an awesome fun and tastey place to get a great bite to eat.\nNow it tastes and feels like corporate America.\nI couldn't be more disappointed. \nI guess I'm giving them 2 stars for the memories. \nBut honestly this place might as well be the Dennys across the street.\nThe food is now bland and the quality is mediocre at best. The fruit was old. Maybe frozen and not fresh anymore? \nService took a hit too.\nI'm in business. So I get it. Profits... But at what cost.\nGo back to your old ways....\nI guess with the corporations taking over Scottsdale I was hoping this place would always be the same.\nObviously I was wrong.
