Fried mochi!\nI've been here twice and they have excellent service and a lot of great choices in Japanese Bakery items. The almond cookies, fried Mochi, and coconut bun are my favorites.\n\nYou can buy a whole Japanese cheesecake for $25. They sell an assortment of delicious buns, mousses and cookies.\n\nIt's a 25-minute trip and totally worth it I will continue going here.
