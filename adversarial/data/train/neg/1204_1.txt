Very disappointed with this place. I made an appointment 5 days in advance for Friday morning. I arrived early only to discover they cancelled my appointment. The desk clerk called the manager on the phone and the manager told me she tried calling me the night before to reschedule. I NEVER got a call. She said she tried 3 times but she NEVER  did. I had no missed calls on my phone, nor did I have any voicemails. The manager told me to wait 10 minutes and she would get a therapist for me. After 5 minutes she told me there wasn't another therapist. Poor business practice.
