Food is average. One note flavors. Nothing poor, nothing great regarding the food. Drinks were strong when we could get them. Service was negligent and nearly non existent. Pray you don't get Guadalupe as your server otherwise you will be elbow deep in dirty plateware, which is reprehensible at a buffet. Even after speaking to management the situation remained the same. Definitely would suggest avoiding the buffet.
