My friend turned me on to this place and what can I say but thank you for spoiling my diet!  if your a popcorn fan, I suggest you run to this place and go for it! The Beer Cheddar (#1 seller) is oh so delicious! The milk chocolate popcorn is amazing! We will be making our way through many flavors weekly! What a treat! I learned the owner is from my home town Detroit which makes it even sweeter to support! You have two new fans
