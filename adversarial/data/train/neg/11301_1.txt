Just walking by on this cool morning and felt like some noodles. Was greeted by the noodle maker which was nice . \n\nService was good. No complaints there. \n\nI ordered Beef brisket noodle. The broth was hot and tasty. The noodles were really good and I would say it's up there with some of the best handmade noodle places in the area. \n\nThe only issue for me was the quantity of the beef brisket. I had very small pieces of actual beef. My bowl was filled with 95% beef tendon. That was a big disappointment as I'm was ordering based on what the photo in the menu shows. \n\nOverall I would come back again. I would be willing to try this dish again but really make an issue of the meat portion of I wasn't so pressed for time and hangry.
