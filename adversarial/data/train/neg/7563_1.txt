Do not go here! It's a ripoff! I should have walked out of here the second they told me it would be $20 to replace a spring bar pin (usually I pay around $5 whenever it breaks), but I really needed to get my watch fixed and I didn't know of another place in Fashion Square Mall that could do the repair. I commented that $20 seemed a little steep, but he said that it's an expensive part. No, it's not an expensive part! This place is just ripping people off and I would recommend that you take your business somewhere else. I wish I had.
