Restaurant lied to us when we called saying the order was taken by the driver 20 minutes ago after the order was already way late, and it should be here any minute now...30min later we got a notification saying the driver has now left with our food, and the order took a total of two hours and nine minutes instead of the one hour both othe restaurant and GrubHub confirmed. Sushi was OK, but there are definitely better sushi places with better values throughout Vegas.  Definitely not ordering from here or GrubHub again. Had to fight myself not to give a 1 Star just because the sushi wasn't horrible. Just ok.
