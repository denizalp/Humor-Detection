I've heard great things about there food an my friend had been before . This place knows good food it's a pub but it's not just bar food. We started with the redneck egg rolls yum . It's an egg roll stuffed with collards an I'm a southern girl I know my collards lol They were cooked perfectly tensor an smokey flavor mmmm They serve you 2 cut in half so 4 with a sweet an sour sauce it's so good :)\nI ordered the whiskey chicken sandwich it was awesome. The chicken very moist an great flavor from the sauce an they put crispy fried onions on the sandwich mmm if you are in the area or looking for a hole in the wall great place I can't wait to go back.
