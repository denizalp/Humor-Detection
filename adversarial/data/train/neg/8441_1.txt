Went here on Thanksgiving at noon and only waited 45 minutes! I was fully prepared for a 2 hour wait. After eating we went to the room to nap and then when we came back down closer to dinner time the line was 5 times as long as the line at noon so keep that in mind! Jacob the manager introduced himself as we were eating and was very professional and kind. The lady that got our drinks was also extremely nice! Food was all amazing!! Lamb, crab cakes, crab legs, all amazing! It was a zoo as you could imagine on a holiday but everything in the buffet was kept clean and stocked. Very impressed. Will most likely be back next year! I paid $114 for 2 people before tip
