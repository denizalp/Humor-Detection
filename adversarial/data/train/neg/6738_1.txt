This place is surprisingly tasty!  Another work lunch with a few work folks.  I had the pork souvlaki, and was glad to have been hungry.  The portion sizes are really large.  My DC's are big fans of the spicy chicken dinner.\n\nApparently it's only open during the day, so it's a good place to have lunch.  Ha ha ha!\n\nIt's worth trying, if you are in the area.
