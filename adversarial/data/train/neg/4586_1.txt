Seriously, I\"m surprised by the negative reviews!\nI've had O Premium Waters for 3 years now.  The set-up was easy and the salesman who came to explain everything and deliver was forthright.\nI have an arrangement to leave my gate key hidden and they only missed it once because of a new delivery guy.\nI always get a bottle or two extra each month and my empties are always picked up.\nI get a call every month telling me when the delivery will be.\nFor someone as busy as I am, it's a no-hassle way to get really good drinking water.  The taste is great and, yes, even my animals drink it.\nI've recommended them to several people and will continue to do so.
