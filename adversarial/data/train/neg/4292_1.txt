I came in on a Saturday afternoon and the staff was fast to great me. I needed to put extra links into my watch and and they quoted me 30 minutes. They took my cell number as well. After 30 minutes, I came back and they said they were unable to fix the watch. I don't know why they didn't bother calling. They said the links were not right and needed to have a hole drilled into them, for an additional cost. It was clear that the links were fine and it wasn't until the cashier also pointed it out, that they were able to fix the watch. The watch repair man was condescending, while trying to point out the links wouldn't work. After all the confusion, the cashier was able to easily fix the watch in under 3 minutes.  \nThis place seems like they don't know what they are doing. I would not go back.
