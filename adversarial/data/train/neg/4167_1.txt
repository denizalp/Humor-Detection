Rating: 1.5\n\nDecided to get some breakfast from A&W's. Generally I don't like to come here because I have always thought their food is very dry and gross, but it was like 9:30 in the morning and it was one of the only places opened so I didn't really have a choice. I got the classic bacon and eggs. To be honest, it was meh. The toast was more on the burnt side rather than a nice golden-brown. The bacon was not crispy and very dry. THe only good thing were the eggs. lol.
