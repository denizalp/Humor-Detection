This is a fantastic gem in Mount Lebanon. Not cookie cutter at all!! Fresh ingredients and homemade with wonderful flavor profiles.  Upscale, classy and sexy menu. The steak fillet is amazing and was cooked perfectly medium rare. The ambiance is wonderful and they are always busy so call ahead and make a reservation it's worth it!!
