I returned to this shop after a long hiatus due to having a new born baby. Stepping into that room again was a very pleasing reminder of what I had enjoyed over a year ago, a fine tasting smoke. \n\nChris and I discussed at length the changing cigar market, immigration history, and of course going through some new recommendations based on my budget and tastes. As always, it was a pleasure to be serviced by Chris. I am especially impressed by his honesty, courtesy, and attention to cleanliness and hygiene. The selection of cigars have a good amount of variance from inexpensive sticks to higher end sticks, so there should be something for everyone if you can explain to Chris what kind of smoking experience you enjoy.\n\nLeaving the shop, there were a few other gentlemen waiting their turn to enter the humidor room. I'm glad to see Chris is still doing well.
