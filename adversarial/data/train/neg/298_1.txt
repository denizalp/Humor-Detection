I ate here the other day and it was amazing!!! We were welcomed as soon as we walked in the door and was seated. The hostess took our drink order immediately and brought over a drink menu when I asked about what specialty drinks they have. All of them were very reasonable priced ($9 or below). I ended up getting the Mardis Rita which was excellent. We ordered the Gumbo as a starter which could also be considered a side for the entrees. The gumbo was so good and some of the best I have had in the Charlotte area. For the entrees we ordered the Fried catfish and shrimp and crawfish etouffee. Both were amazing!! The only issue is the menu did not state you got catfish bites for the entree so it was assumed it would be a filet but it was still so delicious there was no reason to complain.\n\nI will definitely become a regular here even if I just come in for a bowl of Gumbo. Can't wait to return!!
