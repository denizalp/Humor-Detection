Save your money and your time. This place blows. I was put on a guest list by a friend of mine who works for this place.  I was told that we would get in for free and receive a few drink tickets to start our night. So I followed procedure and signed in properly, however, when we got into the club the girls were let in for free and the guys had to pay $45 each to get in, and no drink tickets. When I went to the bar I ordered my drinks, however, the bartender did not listen to my order correctly and gave us a drink that I did not order.  I was nice about it and said that I would drink the drink to which he replied,\"Thank you, I will give you a discount. that will be $69.\" I handed him my girlfriends Visa card which he swiped and said that it did not go thru. We thought that was odd, but I gave him another card and he charged me $99 dollars. I told him he said that it would be $69 and he lied to me saying that he told me $99. I signed my bill only to find out later that the bartender had also charged my girlfriends card $99 too.  This club is full of greedy dishonest people who treat their customers like dirt.  The security staff lumber thru the crowd pushing into people and talking down to anyone who complains. To top it off, the main stage barely has any room for a large crowd to enjoy the show.  Stay away and spend your hard earned money anywhere else rather than this place. I feel sorry for my friend who works here.
