Barro's  pizza is always good.\nWhenever, whatever toppings omg just delicious, at least at this location. Recently I ordered a Hawaiian pizza(don't remember name) but it had a light teriyaki sauce instead of pizza sauce and pineapple and teriyaki chicken on top. This was at a Maricopa Barros btw.\n\nThe only pizza I have ever been grossed out by omg it tasted like they put waaaay too much teriyaki sauce on the bread, maybe on accident but it was so disgusting, the sauce was literally dripping off of the pizza everytime I picked it up. I don't think I'll ever order that pizza again but I will definitely not go to the maricopa location ever again.\n\nTempe locations have never disappointed me.
