I sent my kid sister and friend here as a gift.  There was a glitch with my prepayment, just one of those things, and it would really have taken the gloss off the evening.  But the owner, exercising what I would call great personal judgment, made it work smoothly without bothering them.  That is the kind of care you got in Vegas in years past.  They raved about their meals and their service, and got a real kick out of talking with Chris.  I am grateful.\n\nMiker
