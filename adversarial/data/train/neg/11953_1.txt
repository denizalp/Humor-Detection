What a nice little place, and no wait at the door for Sunday Brunch.\n\nMy friend and I had a hard time to decide as there were many desirable menu items; Pancakes, Eggs, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Omelettes, Monte Cristo, French Toast & Eggs Benny were some of the choices. \n\nI had the Eggs Benny with Salmon and my friend had the Hamburger with Fries. We both had a pint of Keith Pale Ale and the tab came to $36. Nice place. Loved the open kitchen and the music was lively and upbeat.
