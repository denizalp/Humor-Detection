It's not a secret. I LOVE subway.\n\nSometimes when I want to \"change it up\" or go to another location by work, this is the place.\n\nThe people are friendly - it does get really busy during lunch.  \n\nSometimes what you would think are the front doors or locked - but the other pair of doors around the corner usually facing Fort Apache are always open.  There are a lot more tables to sit at here, but it does make it seem a little bit more crowded.  \n\nI get the same Subway quality that I expect from all locations here!
