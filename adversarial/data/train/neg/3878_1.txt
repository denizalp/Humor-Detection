Went here for a date night without the kids, because it looked really fun every time we've driven by. We were pretty disappointed with our experience. We were seated next to the kitchen even though it wasn't busy, then had a rather long wait for our server and the service was slow as well. The food was quite good when we got it, but the atmosphere really ruined it for us. Dissapointed.
