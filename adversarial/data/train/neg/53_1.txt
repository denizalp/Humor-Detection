Stayed here with my family back in December of last year, hotel rooms were nice and clean! Now the reason I'm docking down 2 stars is 1- because the casino area doesn't have good ventilation at ALL!!! The place is filled with smoke(of course casinos smell like smoke but this was worse I actually had to cover my nose at times with my scarf because of how bad the cig smell was, I couldn't take it) and 2-the Cafe restaurant they have there is so bad in terms of customer service and not bringing the food out right when it's ready, instead they would bring the food to our table cold ,We gave this Place a second and even third chance and still failed with customer service and bringing the food back cold even after we complained to the manager!!!! Don't go there if u want cold food lollll
