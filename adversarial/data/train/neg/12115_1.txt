This place is goooood. I came with a friend for dinner, and he ordered a pad thai while I chose the pineapple fried rice. The food was served quickly and the ingredients are fresh, and the prices are reasonable.\n\nInside it appears somewhat small, but the decor is very well laid out and there's a lot of open space. The nighttime dining atmosphere is well-lit to ensure you don't accidentally jam food up your nose instead of into your mouth.\n\nThere's not much service here, all they do is refill your water and hand you the bill, but it's likely the quality of the food will make you forgive them for the crappy service.
