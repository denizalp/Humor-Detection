My first time here for breakfast was good, but my second time, not so much. I like the idea of this place, but it's just not what it could be.\n\nWhen we first came a few weeks after they opened, they were out of a lot of things, so we got the beignets and pecan maple bacon and a cinnamon roll. The beignets came out piping hot and were great. Bacon was freshly made and came out hot and was amazing. Once it cooled down, it wasn't very good though. The roll was great too and had some almond flavor to it.\n\nWe went here today and ordered a chocolate croissant, spinach and cheese croissant and cinnamon roll. And two lattes. We were almost done eating by the time we got our coffee. Also, I can get better croissants from Starbucks. Very disappointing to eat dry crunchy croissants. The spinach and cheese croissant was cold - something I would expect to be hot. And the roll was just okay this time around. Also, noticed the bacon was just sitting out this time so we didn't want to get that knowing it wouldn't be hot.\n\nNot sure I'll be coming back here again.
