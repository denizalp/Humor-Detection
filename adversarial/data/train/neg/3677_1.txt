The food was very tasty  ,ordered the veal meatballs and the beet salad. My wife and I enjoyed our meals. Service on the other hand  took very  long  waitresses seemed overwhelmed with the number of customers. My kids waited almost an hour for their food. No explanation from the staff or apologies.  So the only way I had to voice my displeasure was to cut back on my tip from 15% to 10%.  The waitress seemed surprised when she challenged me on whether i had a problem with the service . I replied that the wait for my kids meal was almost an hour. To which she responded that they ordered after us( 5mins after), and that the tip  made up part of her salary . I simply asked if she wanted me to remove it ? The waitress stormed off pissed at my answer. I can understand her being mad but customer care and reassurance that you are being taken care of is part of the job . Moving forward i hope that the restaurant can address this important part of its customer experience. Not impressed but the food is tasty.
