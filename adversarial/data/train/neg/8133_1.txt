DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY ACE Car Rental 877-822-3872 They keep you on hold for a long while as you try to confirm and when you speak to someone they can not find you in the system. We left 2 messages in two days and did not get a call back. They changed the prices and tried to change our contract from Unlimited mileage to charging us the full amount, but then honored it as we had a contract with Hot wire and arguing with them back and forth. Sad to say Hot Wire is working with this company but were able to get us our refund back as they were also having issues with the management. This location was not honoring our car rental contract also asking for larger deposit instead of our credit card hold, plus they wanted two forms of utility bills. She said because we were locals this was their \"NEW\" policy.  We had to call corporate office and spoke to PAM at 844-874-3966 and and she stated that this location had their OWN rules and there was nothing they could or honor the price we were given. As I tried to continue to explain to her, she said YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY and hung up.  She would not give me the corporate manger. As my husband called back, she cut him off and transferred him back to this site and Sabrina @ ACE Car rental 702-739-4711 told him there was nothing she could do either because corporate could over ride their changes.  Basically we were getting the run around as each office was blaming for each others errors and faults. We use Hotwire to get great deals but beware should this company come up, be prepared to be disappointed.  THIS WOULD BE -negative stars!\nBlessed we got our refund back from Hotwire and rented from Alamo with a breeze!
