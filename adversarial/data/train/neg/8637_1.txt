I was in town for a convention and looking for a good place to go to dinner. I loved their diverse menu choices and everything we ordered was delicious. The service was efficient and good. Highlights were the Pretzel with Fondue appetizer and the Sweet Potato Tortelli (yes, The Arrogant Butcher has vegetarian menu options). I ordered the Chicken Stuffed with Crab...it was delicious and, but did not come with anything else...leaving it looking a bit lonely on the plate.
