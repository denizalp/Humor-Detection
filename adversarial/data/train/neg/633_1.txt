This is a pretty decent aquarium. Knocking down two stars for the quality of your visit & price. \n\nPersonally I think this place is completely overpriced for the quality and content you'll experience in your visit. Children's tickets are also pretty ridiculous. \n\nIt takes about 30-45 minutes to get through the entire aquarium. There is a tortoise exhibit and huge tanks filled with a variety of small sharks, fish, turtles, sting rays, etc. \n\nNo flash photography & it's cool to plan around when the divers and workers are feeding the animals!
