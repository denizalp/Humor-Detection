Disappointed. Having heard good things, I ordered a take away lunch for two giving the hostess the honor of choosing the items. Well it did not go well.  The soup was not tasteful neither my guessed or me ate it. My roast beef sandwich had nothing on the giant bread and the broth for dipping was tasteless.  My friend faired better.  And to think I waited one half hour for this disappointment.
