It was Christmas day and we happened upon Yagyu restaurant.  We were hungry, and craving ramen.\nThe Mabo and Champon ramen were both excellent! The broths were authentic,  and perfectly seasoned.\nThe noodles were delish and abundant. ..never ending bowl of delicious ramen noodles!!! \nWe also enjoyed the spicy tuna & CA rolls...SO scrumptious!\nTo find authentic Japanese comfort food in the middle of LV, was incredibly amazing! The service was excellent, quality and quantity of food exceptional. Great value and dining experience.\nWe can't wait to return!!!
