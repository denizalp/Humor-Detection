I took my '09 Prius in when my A\/C stopped working completely per my sister's referral. She insisted that they were \"cool\" and wouldn't \"screw me over.\" She was right. Danny was very helpful in scheduling all of my appointments as well as providing all the different options that they had to finance my repairs. Bob the manager was instrumental in making sure that I left the shop as a satisfied customer. They definitely helped me in my time of need. They gave me hope in what felt like a hopeless situation. Take your car in. They will be up front and honest. They just want to get you back on the road. Thanks Bob, Danny and team!
