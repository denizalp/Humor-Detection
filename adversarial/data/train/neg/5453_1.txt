I had purchased an online coupon quite a long time ago.  I made the appointment to attend the class certification, however I missed the class and called to reschedule.  When I called to reschedule I asked to speak to the manager.  The lady manager said she would have to look into the matter and said she would call me back.  She never did and I called back and left another message and never heard back again.  I would never go here if that is how they treat future customers.  I plan on taking my business elsewhere.
