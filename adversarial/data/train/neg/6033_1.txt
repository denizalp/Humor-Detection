Cool little spot in Downtown Summerlin. We went on a Friday around 7:00 to go play a game of beer pong outside. The outside sitting area is really chill and there were a ton of people having happy hour drinks. It took about 10 minutes to get a drink waiting at the bar. Bartenders just didn't seem to have any sense of urgency. Beer pong was fun, but you have to drink their house pilsner which is the worst. You have no option to change or upgrade\/downgrade your beer. Because of that, we only played one game and high tailed it out to Red Rock for some gambling.
