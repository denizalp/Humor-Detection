We are new to Scottsdale and really love this place. We've been there 3 times, and every time it's been delicious. The servers are cool, food is fantastic, and we even had a server bring out queso for us one night when I mistakenly ordered the queso crisp (a spinach crisp, also delicious). The drinks are also great! Needless to say, we love it and highly recommend!
