I'm torn regarding Hob Nobs.  I almost wish Yelp had half star ratings (even though that would be a cop-out).  Here's the thing, I felt that Hob Nobs was pretty good, but not quite impressive enough for the full 4 stars.\n\nThe building (apparently there's some history to it that I'm unaware if) itself is nicely set up.  I was there on a Sunday to study and try the place out.  I found seating right away, which is sometimes note worthy at places like these.  The setup of the building has it divided into rooms, which is clever.  It allows those in one room to be somewhat separated from the rest of the building.  When you're studying, this can be hugely advantageous.\n\nEventually, I decided that the coffee just wasn't enough.  It's decent coffee, better than other places I've been.  I ordered their turkey sandwich.  About 5 minutes later, one of the very pleasant staff brought it right to my table.  Minus the silverware, but I suppose you can't have it all.  I was pleased overall.  The turkey and Gouda were sliced to the perfect sandwich thickness.  Everything was fresh but, again, it was good, just not impressively so.\n\nLater on, I realized there was live music playing in the main room.  Since we were so far in the back, it drifted in quietly, unobtrusive.  I really liked that.\n\nI'll probably go back to Hob Nobs eventually.  It's certainly worth at least one visit (I've already recommended it to others as such), but since it's almost 30 minutes from me, I don't know if it's somewhere I'll find myself frequenting often.
