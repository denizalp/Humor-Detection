Horrendous!! I'm used to Wegmans which is in my opinion the best grocery store in the United States. This giant eagle is a complete joke. 95% of their checkout is self checkout. Besides the fact their produce is disgusting, you have to look up each vegetable at the checkout line and not in the produce section. Have you ever seen an elderly person use technology like this....slow and painful!! Giant eagles customer service and the lack of clerks is unacceptable.
