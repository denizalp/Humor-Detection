Had lunch here with a colleague the other day. I had their namesake salad which was tasty but expensive. My colleagues had the eggplant parmesan which was incredible. The atmosphere was pleasant but the restaurant smelled like burnt pizza the entire time we were there. I'm not sure if that was intentional. I definitely want to return to try more of their menu.
