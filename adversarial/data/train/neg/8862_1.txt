Visited the Marquis Lounge & Bistro on the second floor. Met a friend staying in the hotel for dinner.\n\nThe menu is rather limited and has a very odd layout. The food was decent, but as a result of the wine, I can't quite tell you what I had. Meals were however very pricey! Service was a bit hit or miss. The bartenders were helpful, but our actual waitress was a bit of a floosie.\n\nThey do carry my favourite with (J Lohr), but had less than a bottle on hand and ran out. We did go back the following night for a glass of wine (they'd replenished their J Lohr stock), but opted to go somewhere else for dinner.
