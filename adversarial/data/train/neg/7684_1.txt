I have been to a lot of places that have some good beer on tap.  I have been to some places that have a good beer special every now and then.  I have never been to such a place that offers 60 HIGH QUALITY craft beers for $2.50 twice a week ( and great $2.50 specials everyday).  Most places dare to even offer Newcastle or Bass for $2.50 and you will not see either one of those beers on tap at Duckworth's.  I'm talkin Founders, Duck Rabbit, Dogfish, PISGAH, and the list goes on and on for $2.50!!  The new location reminds me of Hickory Tavern due to the amount of HDTV's all aorund and decor without the overpriced food.  This place is EXACTLY what South Charlotte (or America) needed.......an unbeievable beer bar with great food and great service.  Now anytime I pay more than $2.50 for ANY beer, much less the quality offered at dworths, I feel ripped off.
