When the wife and I can find a sitter on a Friday night, this is where I like to go.  The main reason I come here is because we like to dance and this is about as \"modern country\" as Phoenix has to offer.  Generally we'll drop in about 9pm and have some food and socialize, then at 10pm the live music and dancing starts in earnest.  The last time we went the band was Georgia Chrome and they play a good mix of country tunes and couple rock tunes (Journey, AC\/DC) as well.  It's nice.  If you value your hearing, you'll wear some ear plugs, though.  This place gets very crowded after 11:30pm - as in \"I can't get to the bar\" crowded.  But once I do get to the bar, I haven't had much difficulty ordering drinks so long as you use good bar etiquette and stay clear of the bar dancers.  My only complaint is that the dance floor could be larger.  But we'll sometimes find a less crowded spot away from the dance floor and get our groove on.  When we leave at around 1am, there is always a full house and a line out front.
