I needed a quote for replacing my tire tubes and snipping a frayed cable on the bike.  It's a friend's bike that she loaned to me.  I brought the bike in and spoke with Carl.  He was really polite and kind.  Total down to earth and honest person.  He filled the tires with air, and said I may not need to replace the tubes, if the tires go flat I can just bring it back and change the tubes. He snipped the frayed cable and lubed up the bicycle chain.   He inspected the bike, spun the back tire and applied the brakes. He tightened the front tire for me. I would definitely come back as a returning customer if I needed a reasonably priced bike shop in the area.  It was 7 minutes from where we live and conveniently located inside Siena Town Center.  If you are looking straight at Smith's it's on your right.  I would HIGHLY recommend this bike shop to neighbors in the area.
