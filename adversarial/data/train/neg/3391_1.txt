Super fun! Great for the family because the adult jokes are not caught by the kiddos. Great daytime show! Totally worth the minimal amount we paid and we got a coupon for a free buffet by the hotel for afterwards! We have our super funny Mac King picture to look back on as a wonderfully memory.   We met him after the show with the others from the audience. We let him know he came highly recommended by the magician at a close by magic shop down the strip. Mac king is a talented and nice guy.
