This place was close to where I was staying in Toronto and as I'm a vegetarian, it seemed like the perfect place to go for dinner. I called in my order ahead at 7:30pm, to be ready by 8pm. I ordered the macro greens with veggies only ($10) and added grilled tempeh (+$2) to my order. This bowl comes with one sauce, so I ordered the one that the person on the phone recommended, which was the peanut lime. \n\nThe macro greens came with steamed kale, broccoli, bean sprouts and and grilled sweet potato. There were two extra tempeh steaks in the box. I enjoyed the dinner overall, especially with the peanut lime sauce. However, I don't think it was quite worth the price, since if I had bought those ingredients and steamed them at home, it probably would have come out to less than $5. I would recommend this place if you're too lazy to cook dinner but also want something healthy and fairly delicious. \n\nAt the restaurant, I couldn't help but order their vegan chocolate chip cookie, which was made of ingredients such as vegan chocolate chips, soy milk, coconut oil and other healthy and delicious ingredients. It was only $2 and definitely worth it! It tasted just like a regular cookie (maybe better!). I'll definitely come back to try more of their desserts in the future! I also really want to try their vegan burgers which sound delicious.
