The best breakfast in chandler......I'm a big fan of the eggs benedict - especially the BLD, the Cali and the Florentine. The best chocolate chip pancake that I've had in AZ. The south of the border omelet is just perfect. The flavors combine perfectly!  Services is great and the server we always have - Jess (blonde), she is the best!!!!!! \n\nI've been for happy hour as well - so affordable, great prices, small plates, easy for sharing.
