One word to describe JJ Red Hots....PATIO.  Their rooftop patio is perfection!\n\nThis lil spot has drink specials every day of the week, including $2 domestics on Friday nights.  How perfect is it to grab a beer and enjoy the rooftop patio in the heart of Dilworth?\n\nWe ordered cheese fries to go with our beer.  They were pretty good.  Cheese fries and two beers were $8.00.\n\nI would suggest coming here for a drink\/app before walking to dinner in Dilworth!
