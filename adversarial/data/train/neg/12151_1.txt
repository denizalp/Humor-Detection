I've been to the Science Center twice in the past two weeks. The first time was with my 2 yr old grandson and then by myself for the Pompeii exhibit. Loved it both times. Or should I say, my grandson loved it the first time and I did the second.  Convenient parking at a great price with validation, was a bonus!
