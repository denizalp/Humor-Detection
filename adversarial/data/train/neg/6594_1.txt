Juice was excellent,  bit too much ice but it's ok.  Price and size was very good too.   Atmosphere was just alright inside however the service wasn't that great.   An older lady at the counter was a little strange and seemed to be coming off a mean coffee high.  Not the wholesome happy vibe you would expect in a hippy juice place.  A beefed up dude behind the counter was a little too serious and not that nice really.  If either people had smiled even a little I wouldnt have taken note but what a sour vibe.     All in all good juice but the help needs work.    I'm not in a rush to return and truthfully almost left before the juice arrived just because the place felt kind of wrong.       I asked the guy about putting a drink in a mug so we didn't waste the plastic cup,  don't ask about this if you are there, it's not going to happen.....
