This shop is amazing with their customer service. They take the time to explain the difference between bikes and options. The mechanics in back explain things to you when you have issues and are willing to teach you if you ask. Tim helped me pick out my new ride and was able to get me into the perfect ride. This is my second bike I have bought from them in the last 8 months. This is my go to shop and I will go nowhere else. Thank you Global Bikes for the awesome experience.
