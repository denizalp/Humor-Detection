The food isn't over dressed or fancy but it tastes good. I don't know if the people who are hating on Noodle Asia don't like Chinese food or are  just confused about the name, but it's pretty authentic.\n\nCame here for lunch and the spicy dumplings are amazing. After a recommendation from a friend, we knew at least two orders were needed.\n\nThe beef noodle soup and HK wonton soup were flavorful and not too salty. The stir-fried Shanghai noodles were extremely oily and seemed a bit too much like noodles I would find in Shanghai.
