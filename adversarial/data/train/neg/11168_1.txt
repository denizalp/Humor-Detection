Arizona Rattlers play at Talking Stick Arena downtown at 3rd St and Jefferson. They are in the Western Conference and have won three of the last four Arena Bowl Championships and five overall. \n\nThe Rattlers are led by Kevin Guy, an outstanding coach with a creative game plan. He calls the plays from the field but when he gets a big lead (which happens often) he lets he OC take over the play calling, giving him the experience. \n\nOur quarterback, Nick Davila, is a multiple MVP and leads the dynamic offense. Jamie Dukes and Jeremy Kellem are the star defenders. We have led the league in offense for five years and are in the top five for defense every year as well. \n\nTicket prices are fair and there isn't a bad seat in the house. Go out and support your local AFL team. You'll witness high powered football and high energy crowds.
