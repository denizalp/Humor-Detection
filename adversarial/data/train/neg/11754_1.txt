Consistency is key in a restaurant so this year during our annual trip to Vegas we stayed at NYNY and decided to eat every main meal at Tom's to see if it was as good this  year as it was last year.  Items consumed included cheeseburger sliders (incredibly juicy, usually at places those little patties are dried out because they're small but these had juice running down my arm.. no lie!).. the spicy fried chicken and cornbread pancake (delicious and definitely spicy).. figgy piggy (lovely combination).. honey bbq chicken sliders (yum).. ginger chicken potstickers (crisp on bottom, soft inside like it's supposed to be & great dipping sauce) and we finally tried some desserts: the pineapple upside down cake (delicious albeit small) and the ridiculously ENORMOUS brownie\/cookie\/s'mores dessert which was decadent over the top but a decent value for $10 (easily would serve 4 people).. service was absolutely fine by 5 different servers (we had 5 meals there) so not sure why I see so many issues on their YELP page about service. We never had to wait long for anything, water was promptly filled, managers stopped by to check in and make sure needs were met.  So, our 2016 visit wasn't a fluke. 5 stars for 5 different meals. The only thing that would be cool is a frequent diner discount. haha\nLooking forward to going back again next year if not sooner!
