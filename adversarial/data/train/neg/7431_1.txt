Let me start out by saying that my husband and I have attended Sushisamba many occasions when we stay in Vegas and have never been disappointed. This time we were celebrating our 20th year wedding anniversary. We had reservations and we're promptly seated. Our server Philip was AWESOME!!! Super attentive, friendly, and all-around great personality. Specialty drinks were concocted just for us and a Happy Anniversary complimentary dessert was served by the manager himself. What keeps us coming back to this place is the truly wonderful vibe, great atmosphere, the VERY attentive service, and of course... The food! Top notch thru and thru!
