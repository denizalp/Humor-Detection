Been driving past the place for awhile now hoping I would finally have a decent All-you-can-eat Sushi joint near my house and this place did not disappoint! \n\nThe quality of the fish was superb. The service level provided by CJ the owner was impeccable! He was very meticulous with his craft and always addressed me by my name so I felt right at home immediately.\n\nDefinitely try their Saba (Mackerel) and make sure to have some of your fish \"torched\" as it adds another dimension of flavor ;-)\n\nProbably not a good idea being so close to my house seeing as I'll probably go broke before each paycheck!
