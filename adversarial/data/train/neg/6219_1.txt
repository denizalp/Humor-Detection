I really wasn't a huge fan of this coffee shop. I had to change my order a few times and I kind of felt like I was inconveniencing the person taking my order. And I got a cold brew which I guess they dilute (probably to save on cost), and honestly there's no need to dilute cold brew, that's the point of it, it should be strong and not diluted, but honestly it tasted like just ok iced coffee, and it didn't give me that same coffee buzz from regular cold brew. Their extremely serious iced vanilla latte my friend got was pretty good though.  I probably wouldn't need to come back here, but maybe if I'm in a real pinch.
