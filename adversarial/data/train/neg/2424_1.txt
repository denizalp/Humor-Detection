This place is awesome! I'm from Hawaii so to get meat Jum especially this good is a plus. The workers here are super friendly and you get hit with aloha and sweet ladies, the food is super ono I love the mini kimchi appetizer you get before you meal. Definitely have to stop by here for a hot tasty meal if you're near the strip
