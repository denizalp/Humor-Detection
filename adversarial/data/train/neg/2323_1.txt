A hidden gem!\n\nHow have we lived here for 10 years and not known about this place?!\n\nSpecials every night of the week; we stopped in specifically for the $3 Build-a-Burger night, and it was great! They have the standard beers on tap with one craft handle, and there were several other crafts in bottles. \n\nThe bartender was very attentive and pleasant. \n\nAtmosphere was cool and calm, and not too noisy. \n\nWe're definitely going to try this place again!
