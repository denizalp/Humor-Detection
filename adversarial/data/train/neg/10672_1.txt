I don't think I could say enough good things about my experience at Beerbistro. \n\nThe food was delicious, and better than I expected based on some of the other reviews. Started with the duck fat fries per the recommendations on yelp and they did not disappoint. Even the ketchup for dipping was extra tasty. Also had the Bavarian pretzel special for another appetizer. You could smell the butter on the pretzel, which if you're a lover of soft pretzels, you know is key. For dinner, I had the Brussels Mussels which I thought were far better than average and plenty to fill myself up for a meal. Loved the gate at the end of the pot so I could easily dip my bread into the broth. Sadly they were out of the rockfish that my dining partner ordered initially, so he settled for the chicken which was fine but not satisfying when he had initially wanted something a little more exciting. For dessert we had the peanut butter ice cream sandwich. It was a little tough to dig into since it was so frozen, but was totally yummy. \n\nMy dining partner is an avid fan of beer. We had fun trying several of the different brews and didn't find one that disappointed. And to add to the experience, our server REALLY knew what she was talking about when it came to the beers. In fact, I really wish I could remember our server's name, because she definitely helped make our night. She was the perfect mix of attentive without rushing us or being on top of us. She had all the right recommendations and told us some great stories about the beers we were having.\n\nThe atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for as well. It's a nice place without feeling too nice to show up in jeans and be relaxed. We were in Toronto for only 2 nights from Washington, DC. We felt like we found the perfect place to get a feel for the local scene. We almost went back our second  night it was so good.
