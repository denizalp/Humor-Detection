Tasty, generous helpings, and very cheap. The first time I got the small shawarma dinner I was ready to argue with the lady when it came time to pay because no way was that the $6 meal I ordered but my god it was. They could EASILY charge $10 for that plate of beautifully assembled incredibly delicious food. The staff are a very sweet Syrian family and the service is quick and I'm just so happy we have such a great middle eastern restaurant in Greektown.
