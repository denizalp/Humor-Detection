Today was my first visit to RRBC. I was satisfied with my meal, but I won't be hurrying back. \n\nWednesday is 3$ margaritas and 3$ chips and salsa. The only margarita that's 3$ is the original house margarita. We tried the pineapple jalape√±o, my absolute favorite. Most places provide no spice at all. The pineapple margarita was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. If I were to go back, it would be for the pineapple margarita, too bad they don't serve by the pitcher... \n\nOnto the food. The salsa is slightly sweet and very tasty. I had a BBQ bacon burger. The bacon was crispy, I love it like that. The burger was cooked perfectly, but it could have used a bit more BBQ sauce. The fries are beer battered, but nothing to rave about. \n\nThe bestie ordered the Santa Fe salad with avocado ranch dressing. The dressing was delicious, but the salad was disappointing. The toppings were skimpy, mostly lettuce in a bowl. \n\nThe service was good, also nothing to rave about. Our chips and salsa were delayed and she seemed slightly overworked. \n\nOverall, the patio and the pineapple margarita are the only reasons I'd go back.
