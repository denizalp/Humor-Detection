My favourite Chinese resto chain has finally arrived in Mississauga! Great service, super tasty food and awesome decor. \nBest dishes to order: spicy salty squid, sweet and sour pork\/chicken and hot pot rice. \nBeware of long lineups, especially on weekends starting on Friday night! Expect to wait about 30-45 min for a table around dinner time, but the service is quick and food arrives within 10-15 min of ordering.
