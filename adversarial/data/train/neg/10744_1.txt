I've been to The Orleans Showroom twice now, once to see Norm Macdonald and the other to see Paula Poundstone.  I have to say that this is a nice little theater.\n\nIt's not very large so you should have a good view of the stage even in the back.  The seats are big and comfortable and the sound and lighting are good.  I can't speak for alcohol prices, but we've purchased a coke and a water and it only came out to $3.  The employees are some of the nicest I've met.\n\nA peeve is that the cup holders are on the seat in front of you in just the right position for you to kick with your feet (gross).  Also, the theater is so dark and the lighting is so bright on the performer that it hurts my eyes after a while.\n\nDefinitely a good place to catch a show.
