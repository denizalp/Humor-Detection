so whats so great about Shawarma Max? \n\nFirst, it opens late! especially during weekends... it would be a great late night snack after a night out at the club or bar. \n\nSecond, it tastes GREAT! so far one of the best Shawarma I have had.. \n\nThird, its reasonable priced!! around 5 bucks get u a full tummy, what more do u expect? \n\nSo what makes it not a 5 star? No side dish and drink is not included. Also, the overall environment is not welcoming for dine in, recommended as a take out place.
