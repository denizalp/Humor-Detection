I was not expecting too much based on what I saw on Yelp but a friend told me to give Grid Iron a try and OMG it was a great experience.  The waitress was super friendly and the food was really good.  My wife and I shared a Stromboli and boneless chicken wings and we had plenty to take home.  Our friends enjoyed their time too and finished their meals.  I will definitely be going back.
