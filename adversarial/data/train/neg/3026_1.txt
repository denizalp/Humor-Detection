Your typical Panda Express. This was the only open food stand in the morning that was not serving breakfast food. \n\nLocated in the Grand Canal Food Court at Venetian. \n\nThey did not have much to choose from at 10 am but they had the basics I wanted. \n\n3 Item Plate - $10.40 - Orange Chicken, Beef Broccoli, and Mushroom Chicken with Half and Half Rice\/Noodles. Always hits the spot when I think of Panda food. Good portion sizes on the scoops.
