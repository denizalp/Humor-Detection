Took my puppy here for the 1st time through a friends recommendation and they did not disappoint! Kathy and the team were amazing! They were friendly and professional as soon as I entered. Great service and services! Wouldn't take my puppy anywhere else in town! You need to come take your dog here to see for yourself!
