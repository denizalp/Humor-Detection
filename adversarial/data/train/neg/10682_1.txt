This place was recommended to me by one of my colleague but she warned me that people their are not very comfortable with seeing people from other ethnic group!! . I went there anyway and I think the food was amazing, the service was excellent but the customers their made me feel really uncomfortable and they kept starring at us from the moment that we entered the restaurant until we left and I think it was because we looked different and we were the only men who were not wearing kipa.I will recommend to order for take away before you arrive if you don't want to have the experience that we had.
