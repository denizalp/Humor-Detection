Stopped in as my hotel was close by while I was in town on business.\n\nStarted off with a great salad. The amount of fresh ingredients was fantastic and did not disappoint. The dressing was not over powering!\n\nFor dinner I had the sea bass off the menu. The presentation was very good but I felt like the fish lacked seasoning. It tastes very plain when eaten on its own. But when comings with the other ingredients on the plate it was better but did failed to deliver a WOW factor for a main course.\n\nAfter the great salad I was expecting the main course to deliver awesomeness. I was disappointed.\n\nWould I be back..meh! Not sure someone would have to twist my arm!
