I started going here when I moved super close. They are so nice and great at fitting you in if you decide last minute to get your nails done. They've even called me after I've scheduled because they can fit me in sooner if I wanted. I get gel manicures and they last for over 2 weeks. They're also efficient and don't take forever!
