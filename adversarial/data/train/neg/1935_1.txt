Dr. Scott and the staff are amazing.  We had to put down our golden over the holiday.  I'm glad it was done here with these people as they are very kind and supportive during this trying time.  I'd never go to another vet in vegas again.  They even sent us a card with all their signatures on it with their condolences.   Very touching.  It meant a lot.  Your pet is in great, loving hands.
