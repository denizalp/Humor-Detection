We had restaurant.com certificate for this restaurant. I called them up almost a month back and told them that i am having restaurant.com certificate - is there any limitations or rules to follow(as there are reviews from customers who had restaurant.com certificate and they had very bad experience). The owner was very rude and told me that don't come on Friday to Monday...I said okay...I was in this area and I had my restaurant.com coupons with me so i decided to go on Wednesday. We were two in number and i told about the restaurant.com certificate itself. So the waiter told us that we can't order thali which we were planning to order. So first order i need to cancel then i went with the second order - this time we were told that for the $25 restaurant.com certificate we need to order minimum of $50 food..that was very ridiculous term..but i thought okay let's do that...but we were told that you can carry out any thing...i was speechless and i decided to walk out. Then this person said that he has already redeemed my restaurant.com certificate, what???? In a nutshell i will say avoid this restaurant..the restaurant was only 20% occupied and these folks have an attitude that you really need to tolerate. On top of it they have made so many rules which will make it extremely difficult for any reasonable guy to deal with them. Just avoid the restaurant.com and avoid this place. Moreover i can figure out there were no indian customers nearby so obviously food is not good and not at all crowded place..why in the world any restaurant will align with restaurant.com or groupon.com if they are good??? Moreover rather than making so many difficult rules and being rude-if they focus some half of this brain into something useful they can increase their sales. This place is definitely not an option - that's it. Because i want my review to be published that's why giving a generous 1 start otherwise they are -ve star place.
