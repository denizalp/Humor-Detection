We had breakfast here on our way out of town. They have specials, a kid's menu and their regular menu. The kid options are flexible enough that there was something for everyone. My husband had the breakfast bowl with the added spice\/salsa blend and I had the breakfast burrito. It was all delicious and more than any of us could eat. I would highly recommend making this a stop should you be in Davidson.
