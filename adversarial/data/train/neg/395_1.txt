This place and the instructors are awesome!  I've been going for 3 years now and can really tell a difference in my body if I take even a week off.  The instructors are amazing and able to give individual attention because the class sizes are small.  There's a great variety of classes offered and even the ability to \"customize\" the workout in any class.  It's super easy to sign up using the app and parking is never a problem.  I absolutely love that no two workouts are ever the same.
