Went there on a Saturday night...paid $168.00 for 4 people. What a waste of money!! Waited in line for an hour. The Kobe beef tasted like shoe leather, snow crab legs were frozen, wonton soup tasted bad, Chinese ribs were super fatty and tasteless, flan tasted like flem, bread was hard, pizza was gross, didn't like any desserts. I thought Vegas buffets were good and cheap..boy was I wrong!!!!
