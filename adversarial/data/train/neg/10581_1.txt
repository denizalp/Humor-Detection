One of my favourites clubs\/bars to go to on a Saturday.  Stampede Saturdays are country night. It's a very relaxed place, which I like. You can smoke outside, wear hats and dress as you please. The dance floor is huge which make it great to move around and not pushed or smushed. Drinks can be a bit pricey but still cheaper than Toronto clubs. Music is great on Saturdays! Top40 and country. Thursdays can get really busy and crowded but drinks are really cheap! Top 40 and hip hop play plus wet tshirt contest lol
