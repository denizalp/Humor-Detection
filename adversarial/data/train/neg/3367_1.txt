I am between a 3 and 4. I am picky and get pink and white powder. I went there for a fill and to get them cut down a lot. The pink powder is really dark and they don't have any lighter so they look artificial. I like a more real, natural look. She cut them down after doing the white part, so the tips look a little unnatural. Brooklyn was great at her job, I'm just used to better services up North.
