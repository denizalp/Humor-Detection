For a chain I have no complaints.  Service is always friendly and uber polite. \n\nThe French toast is delicious, the hash brown casserole savory and let's face it who doesn't love to eat the inside of an apple pie as a breakfast side! I prefer breakfast here but that's just because the bacon is always diner style CRISPY - another WIN.  Oh and did I mention you get your very own warmed bottle of pure maple syrup! \n\nI definitely do not come here often to eat - but I know what I'm getting if I do before I hit the door. \n\nThe gift shop I utilize for unique gifts with that country charm, to purchase my favorite candy on the planet (Goo Goo Clusters) and look forward to the holiday season when the chocolate pecan pie is available to go.
