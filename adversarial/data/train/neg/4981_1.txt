Came here for a hungover brunch on a Sunday.  Somehow was convinced to wait more than half an hour for a table at the persistence of a friend's desire to come here.\nHave to say, it was worth the wait.\nOrdered the benedict with a side of bacon and it hit the spot.  Not as greasy or heavy as other eggs benedicts, which was perfect for a hangover breakfast.  My friends ordered the hot chocolate, which was absolutely delicious.  Another had the waffles, which were great if you like sweet things for breakfast.  I also eyed my biscuits and gravy, which he claimed was delicious but extremely heavy.  Would only recommend ordering it if you are able to food coma immediately afterwards.
