I wouldn't choose to live here again. The office has one nice, helpful person, the rest of them are not very intelligent. They are not quick at fixing things if they ever get around to it. Worst part, my apartment wasn't ready for me to move into which was a huge inconvenience. Even though I'd signed my lease and put down the deposit 3 months prior, I had to wait a week after my initial move in date. The grounds are nice, but don't let it fool you, the community washers are always broken and the spa didn't work for almost 7 months. Very unhappy here - and to top it off, they gave 48 hours notice to do major renovation on my apartment - installing a washer\/dryer hook up I declined to have. They took everything out of my closets and threw it on my bed\/floor. Also when I came home for lunch, my apartment was covered in plastic tarp - I couldn't even use my kitchen! And my front door was wide open with the air conditioner blazing. Thank GOD my cats were hiding in fear under the bed, they could have gotten out. I was so mad, they told me I should board my cats during the WEEK of construction taking place, yes, I'm unable to use my apartment from 8-5 every day and even though I'm paying rent for my pets and I they have to be somewhere else too on my dime. This place is a disaster, get my opinion, DON'T ever live here.
