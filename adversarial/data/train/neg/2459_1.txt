If you're looking here before you buy your tickets, good move.  I didn't do that -- one of those impulsive \"gotta buy it now\" presale moments where I was SO excited to draw 3rd row seats.  What other Yelpers made clear, but I didn't realize until I showed up at the venue is: The. Seats. Suck.  They're behind the really big GA area, so you might as well be watching a simulcast.  My third row seats would have been a million miles away from my beloved David Gray -- all because I believed that, like some other oldschool ballroom venues, that these seats might be on the balcony...  And my thinks-he's-an-old-man husband prefers seated concerts to GA.\nFortunately for us, the security at this venue was more lax than any concert I'd ever been to, so they didn't really police the GA section, and since we were near the front of the line we ended up about 3 people back in GA -- sweet justice, if you ask me!\nThe concert was amazing -- looking at other reviews, it seems like Cosmopolitan hospitality ensures that!  But if you want a good show, I hope you're (a) prepared to stand, (b) taller than me [unless you're as close to the stage as I was!], and (c) don't drink so much that you need to use the bathrooms -- as others have noted, washrooms are a million miles away.\nIf another favorite singer were performing here, I'd go again with my eyes open to what I was getting myself into -- but I definitely would never waste my time worrying about what row of seats I'd pull ever again!!
