Awesome salon and staff! I moved to Pittsburgh from Toronto and struggled to find a salon or stylist I felt comfortable with. Through much trial and error, I ended up at addicted and I couldn't be happier. They are amazing. If you are looking for an awesome stylist, lash extensions, or waxing, all at one location and at very fair prices, you've found your spot. At least I know I have. I'm couldn't be happier! I've had a cut, highlights, low lights, Brazilian wax, and lashes, and every service so far, has been amazing. Love it! Bridgette did my hair and lashes, Christine my waxing. Check them out. You won't be disappointed.
