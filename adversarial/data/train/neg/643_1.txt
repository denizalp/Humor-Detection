Did I just see a Cockroach?  Gross!!!!! \n\nThe store is dirty. You can tell by the smell walking in. If I didn't already have an appointment with Banfield I would have cancelled or just walked out. \n\nThis Banfield location was not very personable. They didn't let us back to watch our cat. Just took her back.   It wasn't a very warm visit. I'll go to the south blvd. Branch a whole lot faster from the amazing, clean visor I experienced there.
