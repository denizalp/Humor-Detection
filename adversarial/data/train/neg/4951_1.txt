I can not say enough good things about this place. The customer service was amazing. Our artist Danny took both my dad and I as walk-ins on a Sunday night. He listened carefully to what we wanted and drew up the tattoo I had been envisioning for years. He made me feel\ncomfortable for my first tattoo and was very down to earth. He answered ALL of our many questions and not once did we feel hesitant about anything. The prices were also extremely reasonable. He is very talented and I highly recommend this shop for any of your tattoo needs. I am obsessed with my tattoo!
