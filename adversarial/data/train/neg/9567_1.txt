Prop always smells better than its food tastes.  It's two-steps up from an East Side Mario's but two steps down from a Ferro.  We've been a few times and it's ok but has never lived up to our expectations.  That may be their fault, that may be ours.  I'm not sure.\n\nI had a great fungi but a very boyardee spaghetti and meatballs.  Penne with a basic bolognese was initially good but in the end so salty that I needed a beer.  The taglatelle with peas, prosciutto and shrimp was excellent in flavour but the pasta was so dente that you had to remind yourself to chew it.\n\nAvoid the fusion dishes.  Expect a portion slightly smaller than you'd like and for the food to be not hot enough.\n\nThe Big Ragu at Lansdowne and St Clair doesn't have as hip a vibe but the food is better.  Choose Prop if the atmosphere is more important than the food, although lately it's been feeling a little tired.  The guys smoking out on the patio pre-supper isn't a particular attraction either.  That's the last thing the St. Clair Strip needs, another patio with sketchy smoking men.\n\nThe saving grace is the brunch - excellent, excellent, excellent - and not your standard greasy sausage fare either.  Interesting that a pasta place exceeds expectations at the one meal where pasta largely isn't present.
