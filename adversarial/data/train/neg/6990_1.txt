The place is completely overrated (maybe people goes for the hype and pictures with desserts) and it's ice-cream overpriced.\nFar below the average. A real waste of time (due to the usual long line) and money. You spend a considerable time in the queue and there is not even a mere menu available to choose what to have in advance. When you finally get in touch with the menu it does not explain anything and you have to ask cashier \"what flavors do you have?\" and there we go... And the biggest negative surprise: an ice-ream do not be worthy the wait and the price: frozen and crumbling ice-cream (yes, can you imagine an ice-cream with ice on it?). No creaminess at all. Do you really expect to get it over and go away as soon as possible. Disappointing.
