This is the only solid Hong Kong cafe that I'm aware of in Toronto - which is shocking to me.  I mean, come on, who doesn't love inexpensive, Chinese-Western fusion food?  Why aren't there more?  I really hate having to go to Markham for a decent selection of HK cafes.\n\nDespite having no other clear competitors (as I believe Red Onion is now closed and Goldstone on Spadina isn't like the Goldstone in Vancouver), it's actually a pretty decent option for Toronto.  Service is good, lots of daily specials and lots of lunch time combos available.\n\nMy all-time favourite dish and standard HK cafe order is the Baked Pork Chop on Rice with a HK Milk Tea\/Coffee on the side.  It's far from top tier, but it's decently represented here - usually lots of onions and mushrooms in the tomato sauce.\n\nWhile this place pales in comparison to the selection available further north of the city, it's a decent Chinese diner option in the core.  Believe it's open until 10PM everyday.
