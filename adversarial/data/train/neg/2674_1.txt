As part-time residents of Montreal, we had the pleasure of introducing friends who've lived in Montreal their entire adult lives to this restaurant. It was an evening of great food, great service and friendship. The menu is diverse and every course is a delight. On our most recent visit, my wife had the beet salad and I had the marinated salmon and we both had the duck magret for our main plate. There's a special price on the tasting available Sunday-Thursday that's a nice bargain if you want a multi-course meal. Wellington is one of our favorite aportez bistros\/restaurants in all of Montreal. Worth a trip to Verdun. Just be mindful that parking can be a challenge.
