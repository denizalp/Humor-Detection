There is nothing more aggravating than to buy food from a restaurant that claims to be great! For starters this place is going downhill quickly, it's already dirty and looking shabby, this is my 3rd time coming in, to buy pies, never slices only whole pies. Was there for breakfast once before, not crazy about their food, specially when things are heated in microwave. To be specific about these slice are TEENY-WEENIE slices and all messed up looking like the cutter ran them over them instead of cutting them. Specially the coconut & silk pies If your pictures show a fairly decent size, I suggest you trained your staff better, it shouldn't be that hard to cut a nice slice of \"PIE\" I expect to get what I paid for. I should have checked before leaving restaurant but I trusted that I would not have an issue wit a slice of \"PIE\"\nAt least the young girl waiting on me was very nice.
