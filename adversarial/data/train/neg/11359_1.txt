The people are nice, but that's about all. Pedicure is not worth the $35 they are charging for it and I know it's a express pedicure but I've paid less for a lot more and a better pedicure and paint job here in Vegas!. Plus I feel $7 on top of the $35 to take of the gel polish which was only the top coat the color polish was regular polish underneath is a little high, this should always be included in your pedicure price. Basically my feet were soaked, nail polish removed, very little work on my toes and feet and then polish added. But I guess that's their version of express. If you can find a different shop for your pedicure. Oh yeah and you have to pay cash before they will even start, so if your not happy with your service you have already paid for it and stuck with it. They probably had a lot of complaints about the job they did and people not wanting to pay full price is for sure one of the reasons they began this practice of pay first. \nToday 6\/1\/18 less then two days since I had my toes done and they have already started to chip.
