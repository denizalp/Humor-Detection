I've seen other Cirque Shows but this one did not live up to my expectation. La Reve was much better and what I expect to see with a cirque show. \n\nPros: \n-Music is great - obviously \n-There are some cool acts - the roller skating and the few acro acts were great\n-Visuals - the screens the showed with the Beatles were really neat \n\nCons: \n-The story made no sense and was jumbled \n-Much less acro - it was a lot of dancing, it was more of a musical? I almost fell asleep\n-There is a scene with Blackbird that started out really cool and could have been emotional - but then they ruined it with the most awkward blackbird cawing and screeching all over the stage. It was so strange. It made no sense. \n-'Let It Be' was not included in the set list\n\nThis was disappointing to me. I wish I would have seen Michael Jackson or O!
