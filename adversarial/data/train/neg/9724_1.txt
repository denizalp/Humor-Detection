So I was new to the state a while back and got my car tagged in NC, but didn't need an inspection until the following year.  So I picked a place close to the NCDMV.\n\nNot much to look at outside, the folks inside are ready to take your car and get the inspection done in quick time.  Even though there were people waiting before and after me, it was done in about 30 minutes.\n\nThey have a few chairs inside and a TV tuned to some Jerry Springer-esk type show which a few patrons were constantly talking back to the TV....so there was no lack of entertainment.\n\nCar was one and done.
