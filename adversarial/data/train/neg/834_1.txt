So it's Veterans Day, and I had already eaten brunch at De**y's (which I will refrain from commenting on because they are honoring our Service members). My brothers wanted to go to lunch here, so I figured I'd ask if they had a discount for Veterans. I was very happily surprised. They provided me a sandwich\/entree of my choice, 1 side, a large drink, and most unexpectedly, a dessert. 100% gratis. \nI got the chicken salad on croissant, and it was better than I thought it would be: cranberries and pecan chunks, the right ratio of sweet to savory, and the croissant was fresh. My side was cole slaw which was decent. They gave me a small bucket to put my drink in (ok, 32 oz). Their sweet tea is indeed all that. If you're from North of the M-D line, or if you just don't like your tea tooth-achingly sweet, do what I did and mix sweet & unsweet. Excellent. \nWhen the cashier said dessert I was thinking chocolate chip cookie, a-la Jimmy John's (which would NOT have been a bad thing - I love those cookies). But what I got was so much better -- NY style cheesecake. I must say, besides the kind service and the Veteran love, this is why I'm writing this review. This is my idea of good cheesecake: dry but not running-for-the-milk dry, not overly sweet, and rich as you like. And a healthy slice! \nNext year I'm skipping the grand slam and hanging out here. Thank you McAlister's: I will spread the love.
