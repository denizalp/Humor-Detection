So this is what it feels like to have beautiful hair! I finally let Perla give me extensions which is her specialty. I did the tape in's which is supposed to be less damaging. They're not too heavy and are so far pretty comfortable. The color she picked and layers she added made the extension blend perfectly with my hair. Thank you, Perla! I feel like a new and improved ME!
