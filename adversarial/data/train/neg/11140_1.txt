My husband and i stopped in for an early dinner. The place was quiet. It is nicely decorated and dimly lit. They had fresh fish and some unique rolls. We ordered the garlic edamame, a screaming o, and tuna poke to start. They were all very good. We ordered a roll called the anthem roll and it was very good as well. The one thing that was a little off putting was how long we were there. It took a decent amount of time between each item to come to our table. Now this isn't a total draw back, sometimes we enjoy taking an extra long dinner but we hadn't planned on it that night. It took about an hour and a half to eat and pay. The last roll we ordered was the Japanese lasagna and I really like theirs.
