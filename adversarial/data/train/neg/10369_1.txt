Today was my second visit to the place after having a good first experience but I am so disappointed with the quality of the food that i can say it has been my worst experience of food in months!! The sun dried tomatoes very absolutely stale to an extent that they tasted bitter, the pizza base was so thick that it was uncooked and soggy, the four cheese blend tasted completely different than the last time and so did the pesto sauce.. No consistency with food quality.. I was starving and wanted to have a good meal but unfortunately it turned out to be a disaster...
