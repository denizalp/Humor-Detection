This would get no stars if possible.\n\nThis is THE WORST management company I have ever experienced. Alex, is very rude, a slob with his baggy jeans and unprofessional upkeep and ignorant. Apparently you are not able to contact the property manager unless you want to write them a letter and give it to him - to not give to the management. \n\nThe upkeep of the property is horrible. The pot holes are unbearable. When asked about it, no actual answer. When there is ice on the sidewalk...it stays there. I slipped and fell on my back with a sheet of ice you could ice skate on. When I called, it was never taken care of. Maintenance is none responsive. The few times I have had them in my apartment (they are nice), they even complain about how the management has gone to hell. My blinds have fallen and broke often. Maintenance told me it's because everything in the apartment is old and out dated and that management does not want to put money into it. I called for plumbing issues...the toilet plunger was left outside my door. \n\nI tracked down the management on line after much searching, to talk about some problems I had with Alex in the office...the owner called me back and told me that Alex is never wrong (another staff member told me that Alex is his favorite and it doesn't matter what he does, the owner loves him) and that I was being a difficult resident. He, the owner, told me that if I have a problem with how things are run at the property to just leave. Really?? Last time I checked the residents are what pay your bills. Last time I checked, it is managements responsibility to take care of the property, both the apartments and the grounds.\n\nThere is so much more. Just stay away. It's worth paying a little more in rent for peace of mind, a management team that cares and understands that an apartment home is your home. And a home is the most important thing to a person, outside of family.
