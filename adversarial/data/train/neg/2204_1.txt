Walnut Street Tea is my favorite little tea shop in existence. It's so cute inside, and their teas are super affordable and delicious. I love all the adorable teapots and accessories they sell too. I often buy stocking stuffers or small gifts for friends here. They have a large selection of chocolates, candies, flavored stir sticks, and other delectables. They do sell a variety of whole coffee beans as well, and they have a good flavor, but the roast date isn't posted anywhere so I tend to get mine directly from the roasteries instead. \n\nAnyways, the woman who I always see behind the counter (I assume she is the owner) has always been super friendly and sweet. I hope this adorable corner teashop is around for a long, long time.
