We stopped ordering pizza for months because were sick of being disappointed every time. Finally decided it was time to try again & I am so glad we did. We have ordered delivery from here twice now and each time it has arrived before the earliest given delivery time and it has been fresh and hot!! That was a huge issue with other places around here. The pizza is so delicious & if you can believe it, it is even more flavorful cold the next morning (if it makes it that long). I honestly can't wait to order another!
