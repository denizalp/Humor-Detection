Got table service at Surrender to see Skrillex. Our host Brandy was awesome and walked us right in with no waiting and no fighting the crowds. Servers and security were very attentive to whatever we needed. Good mix of fun people and the layout was good for mingling with all the cool people. We dropped $4K and had a blast!!! Highly recommend Surrender!!! Can't wait to go back when it's warm for a pool party.
