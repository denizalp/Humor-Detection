The food is pretty good. No real complaints about the food. But the service is sooooo slow and then really just no personality. It just takes forever though. The wait staff as a LOT to be desired. The owner should hire new staff and speed up the cooks. Then we asked for 2 checks. They brought 2 and had everything screwed up on them. We just laid what it was. It would have been another year before the checks came back and I'm SURE it would have been wrong. So 4 stars for food - negative stars for service. Have them 2 stars. If it wasn't for location this place would close. I'd say go 5 more minutes to downtown summerlin.
