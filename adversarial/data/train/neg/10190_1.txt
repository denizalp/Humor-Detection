This is the second and only second review I have ever left on Yelp the first one was for the same business where I get absolutely no response or integrity or any type of considerable salesmanship from this company. These people will post the worst motorcycles available for you in there used Craigslist ads that is where I found my Ducati motorcycle that I paid over $11,000 for cash and broke down less than 850 miles. They claim to have service the bike yet cannot provide any service record and the warranty company refuse to honor the warranty as it was sold to me as a trade in when all actuality it was purchased from auction and a race bike converted to Street use for my displeasure. I have dealt with the store manager who is a lead to a long dead-end alley and promised a call back from the owner several times and never received one.
