I randomly found this place on yelp after looking for places to eat while in Cleveland for a concert. I don't have any complaints about this place. The sauces were amazing, the hotdogs were jumbo (my fav), and the beer was all craft! I got pimento Mac and cheese, Jamaican coleslaw and bacon on my hotdog (sounds crazy) and it was perfect. The staff was great too! Our bartender gave us like 7 sauces to dip our tots in and I did not mind at all! Hallelujah hotdogs!
