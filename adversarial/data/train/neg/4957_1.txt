Nice hotel located a short walk away from University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nCheck-in was easy, staff was very friendly.\n\nRooms are clean and comfortable, all the little perks in place such as a mini-fridge, coffee maker and lots of outlets for your electronics. The only 'con', and a really, really minor one, is that (at least in my room) the water pressure for the shower wasn't phenomenal.\n\nParking at this property is extremely reasonable at $15\/day, interestingly the valet cost is the same as the self-park option.\n\nThere is a plaza very nearby that offers a decent variety of dining options. I hope to stay here again the next time my travels take me to Glendale.
