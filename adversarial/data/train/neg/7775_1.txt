The dentist is Awesome, but it ends there. I had partials made. The partials do not fit. The office made two visits for me to supposedly have the lab tech at the visit to adjust the partials,  both times the lab tech was NOT there. The second visit I was told the tech left for the Holidays (just before Christmas) and the dental office would call me to reschedule. It is the middle of February and I am STILL waiting for their call. But HAPPY DENTAL HAS RECEIVED PAYMENT FROM BOTH INSURANCE CARRIERS, so they don't care!
