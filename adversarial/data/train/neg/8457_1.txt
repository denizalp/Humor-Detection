I REALLY ENJOYED THIS HOTEL!!!\n\nFirst off it wasn't too far from downtown, and you can easily catch a cab downtown for not too much $$.  It feels like there is nothing around the place but there is, you just have to do some exploring.\n\nThe staff here was so awesome and friendly, they were very helpful to tell us everything to do around town, what times, have an amazing map and list of places, were just really all about getting us the ALL we needed and wanted to know.  \n\nThe bar inside the hotel was really nice, TV's were nice because sports were on and the bartender was very cool, and experimented with any kind of drinks we could make up he would try to make them and had some tasty concoctions of his own!  We really had a great time at that bar, almost too good of a time to actually leave and head downtown for the night, but it ranked higher than a lot of the places we went.\n\nI needed a good workout, couldn't ask for a better facility, had an indoor pool too and it was really nice.  The equipment was all new and there was plenty of it, I really enjoyed the gym there and visited it a couple times!!!\n\nIf you're ever in the area, need a nice place to stay, very affordable, great amenities and friendly as can be staff, this is the place your looking for!
