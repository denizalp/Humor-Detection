I tried this place for the first time today, and loved it! It's a revolving sushi bar with a conveyer belt running different types food, dessert, and beverages around the restaurant. The most expensive plate is $2.00, and the cheapest is $1.00. Each plate of sushi is about 3 to 6 pieces depending on how big they are. It's a great way to be brave and explore different types of sushi w\/out breaking the bank. The fun & casual atmosphere is sure to enhance your dining experience!
