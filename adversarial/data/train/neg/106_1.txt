This was my first time here. The Food was good, the service however was a different story. The employees did not smile or greet me walking into the restaurant, and kept throwing things onto my plate. And when is ask if I could try something they gave a distasteful snare.i know it's annoying to be busy and have people ask you stupid questions but still, there should be some type of costumer service. Just saying.
