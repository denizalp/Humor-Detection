I bought my first car over the weekend from Andrew. It was a very professional and awarding experience. Even after the sale, I can tell that Andrew will be there if I need anything or have questions. He was always straight up and eager to help with any questions or concerns. I would highly recommend you to see Andrew if you are looking to purchase a vehicle!
