I can only assume that the other review for this place was written by its owner.   Sure, the decor is colorful but, sad to say, the food leaves a whole lot to be desired.  I tried the only mole dish on the menu and I was very disappointed.  Maybe they do a better job with the standard \"mexican\" food... but, the tortilla that came with my watery chicken mole was crusty around the edges and clearly not fresh.  Go someplace else for your Mexican \"fix\".
