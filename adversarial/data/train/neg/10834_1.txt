You get $1 oysters with the purchase of a beverage on Tuesdays, came here for beer and oysters after work. Probably not the smartest dinner decision I've made (12 oysters and a beer).\n\nThe wait is kind of long and unpredictable even if you're first in line for the next table, but thankfully there are many spots along the bar for you to hang out while waiting for one. You can have a beer and eat some oysters while you're at it as well, I ended up leaving before my group got a table.\n\nThey have some really good beer on cask at times - I had a cherry porter that was super tasty.
