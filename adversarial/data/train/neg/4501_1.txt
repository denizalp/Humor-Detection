I can not believe how amazing and kind the bussing staff are at this specific location. My best friend tore her ACL at a neighboring restaurant and we were sitting outside on a green bench, near where they dispose all of the restaurants trash. They saw my friend crying and immediately ran out to get ice and tape to let me tape her up until I could get her to the hospital. We have been to saddle ranch previously, but never had the opportunity to meet the back of the house staff. These men helped me scoop her into my car so I could take her to the ER immediately. I wish I had asked their names but unfortunately didn't think of it at the time. I feel like management should definitely give them a big thumbs up and some kind of recognition. I am so thankful for these two! \n\nThis food is also amazing! Like I said we come here often. They have a huge menu, with all types, so that everyone can find something delicious to eat. The front of house staff is prompt and fun! The ambiance is great! I would say it's totally kid friendly during lunch! I can definitely say Sat.\/Fri. is so much fun!
