Had an appointment for an oil change, it took and hour and a half, if your in a hurry you may want to go elsewhere.  I was feeling them out, my 1st time for service, it felt like a really stressful time.  I discussed a problem I am having with the Service Advisor.  No help there unless you offer up the Inspection fee, then they will investigate.  They will however inform you that you need to rotate your tires and get new brake pads and rotors.  Cha ching.
