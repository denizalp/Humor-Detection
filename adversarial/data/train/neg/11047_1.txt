I had an emergency: I was in Charlotte for a business conference, and flying the next day for another conference. I did not have time to deal with breaking my glasses frame! At 630 pm Richard looked at the situation, suggested an inexpensive frame similar to what I had, and made great effort to read my prescription from the broken glasses (progressive lenses and funky astigmatism). By 830 pm, I had a pair of glasses I was entirely comfortable with. Thanks for saving the day!!!
