During a fun filled bachelorette weekend of partying, my friend & I left the club early just to try this place out right before they closed at 2am. Thankfully we made it and it was worth running in heels for. We ordered the duck noodle soup. I'm not kidding you, the broth is god sent and amazing and the noodles were delectable! It was worth the $13 price tag. The bowl was large enough to share between us two girls and left us wanting more. The cool thing was that we weren't even drunk to have to enjoy some delicious comfort food!
