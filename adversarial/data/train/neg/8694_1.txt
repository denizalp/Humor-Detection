Generally speaking, Montreal has a problem with pizza by the slice: it's heavy, it's bland and the crust tastes like cardboard. But then there's Adamo. \n\nWith its thin crust, beautiful tomato sauce and fresh toppings, Adamo is the way pizza is meant to be eaten. Sure, if you're hammered after the bars, you can make a case for the other stuff, but if it's mid day and you want a satisfying slice, this is really your only option in town. \n\nI opted for Hawaiian (don't judge, it's delicious), but every option looked just as good. And did i mention that it's only $3.75 a slice? Standard, but given the quality, you're getting way more than you paid for. \n\nDon't waste time with a sloppy slice. Next time you're craving a quick pizza, you know where to go.
