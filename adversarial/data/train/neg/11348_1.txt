Fresh and healthy lunches within a reasonable price.\n\nJaspers Deli has a small self serve salad bar and I recommend the bean salad, vinegar cucumbers and chickpea salad.  I had that with some fruit salad and I was good to go!  The only downside is that they are cash only and do not provide a formal receipt with the items you ordered.
