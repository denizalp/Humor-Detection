A friend and I decided to give this place a shot. And after reading reviews of it on Yelp! I was even more excited to see what it was all about. To make a long story short, place was great, food was amazing and totally affordable. You can easily spend $9 at Wendy's and its garbage and you'll feel like crap after eating it, but at Toh Zan, you get a heck of a lot of good food for $6! I recommend this place. The only cons I noticed was the service was kind of slow. Since its a mom and pop place I can understand that, two people running the whole joint. And its sooooo quiet, they need some music or something playing. You can hear a pin drop in that place. If you're having a conversation, you can bet everyone else cant help but eavesdrop on it.
