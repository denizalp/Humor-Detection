This Chili's location has pretty good service, except if you sit in the bar area. I always feel like the bartender and the waitresses are spread too thin, and service can get a little slow and suffer because of it. Tables are cleared off very slowly, and I've been instructed not to sit down until they are clean. So we are left standing there for quite a while.  Granted it's probably not all their fault if they are scheduled thin to begin with so we don't really hold it against them. We've always been treated nice and they have been very pleasant. The food is generally pretty consistent and we come here often.
