It's much cheaper than other buffets I believe $13 for lunch (or about $17 with unlimited sparking champagne that's pretty good), and $26 for dinner. I stay away from the filler carbs and go straight to the mexican, bbq, italian, and chinese food. Surprisingly the best thing here are the black pepper beef ribs. They are absolutely amazing. I've been here twice and had plate after plate of it. The pastas are good too, mix then with the brisket and ribs with tangy bbq sauce and it's great. Service is very friendly and deserves a tip as well. When you're done the dessert section is to die for. A million flavors of ice cream and yogurt, chocolate covered strawberries, it's fantastic. A great buffet in Vegas that won't break the bank either. I like lunch here most.
