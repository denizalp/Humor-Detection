Located on Flamingo just east of the Las Vegas Strip, this is an all suite hotel. The Platinum is very quiet, so if you are really looking to get away from it all, look no further you have found your place(the Strip is a short two blocks away should you feel the need for civilization. The rooms are great and quite large. The front desk star very helpful. The only bad thing is they have valet parking only. I could go on a rant about how much I hate valet parking (you would too if you once had to wait 45 min for your car).  Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
