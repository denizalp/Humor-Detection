I waited over 24 hours to write this review just because I didn't want to rant about this place enough to get them shut down. My friend and I made appointments for 4:30. We showed up at 4:18 and we were not attended until 5:20! There were three employees and TWO were working on ONE person. Then finally my friend got started and the guy was unbelievably slow, finally when the girl started my nails, even though she apologized, she was ruining nail after nail, she cut my cuticle and ended up digging out a piece of skin and I started bleeding. Instead of using her brain and getting a wet cloth, she rubbed it with her dirty acrylic powered hands! Two customers came in and were told that they wouldn't be attended after another hour and the customer was visibly upset and said \"I'll go somewhere else\". After it was all set and done I noticed that two nails on my right hand are headed towards California! They were tilting to the left! The woman still had the audacity to tell me to go elsewhere next time, I'm so disappointed and will never go there again!
