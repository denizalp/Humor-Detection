All three employees watched me as they stood at the counter while I struggled to bring in an item to return. I was then informed that it is the company policy that chemicals can't be returned (They were less expensive at NPS) This review isn't about the policy. It's about the snotty tone used, the lack of empathy and failure to even open the door as I was leaving.
