While Sweet Home Wisconsin has much in common with its predecessor OSS at the same location, I think it is a better restaurant in almost every regard. It's now cleaner, has a better menu, the food is better and they have plans to expand the seating and improve the beer garden. We ordered the cheeses curds with siracha ranch dipping sauce (great), I had a Chicago style hot dog with fries which better than any I've ever had in Chicago (sorry Portillos). The grilled buffalo chicken sandwich was reported to be very good, as was the burger melt and the dinner salad. Service was great, beer selection was good - our server (who I think is also an owner) was personable and knowledgeable, made helpful beer recommendations including letting me sample one of the beers that sounded too risky to order a full glass without trying it first. Parking is still an issue, but it's definitely worth the trip. I'm looking forward to trying more of their offerings. They even have a potted plant that is named Robert [Plant].
