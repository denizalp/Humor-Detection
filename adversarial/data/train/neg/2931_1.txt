Probably the best new restaurant I have been to in ages (not counting Wicked Spoon since it is a buffet).\n\nSit at the bar for attentive service and recommendations from all the bar tenders and servers picking up drinks. Everyone is friendly and has opinions on everything. \n\nHummus, Brussel sprouts, lamb kefta, grilled octopus, scallops... Absolutely everything was incredible. It would be hard to go back and not order everything I tried already, but will have to remember that anything else is probably equally as delicious. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go immediately.
