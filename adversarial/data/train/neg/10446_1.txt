an AMAZING show!\n\ngreat music (speakers on every seat and in front of you)! great for everyone, whether youre a beatles fan or not (but c'mon how could you not be?!) There is so much to see. Visuals up, down, below, everywhere along with a great cast and great music, you cannot go wrong. You will be surprised and in awe..guaranteed! Such a feel good performance. \n\nOh yes, and not a bad seat in the house. And yes, I was all the way at the top!\n\nCreative genius. A must see in vegas!
