I don't typically stay at a Hilton Garden Inn...not because I don't like them...because I do. I primarily don't stay there because I am a Marriott guy and usually stay at the nearest Marriott. But on this trip my client put me up so I stayed where they said to stay. This is a very typical Hilton Garden Inn. I pretty good shape. I think the layout and design could use a little updating...but overall it was a great stay.
