First, they cooked the steak as I asked - rare. Good job but it isn't hard to toss a hunk of meat on a grill. I cannot say that it was any better than what I would have served at home. The house salad was a disgrace. It looked like it was made a week in advance, wilted, the sorriest looking salad I have ever been served. It also tasted wilted. None of it was fresh or anywhere near fresh. The dressing wasn't bad but it wasn't anything to write home about either. The whole salad was a disgrace that should not have been served. My husband was served a similar sorry looking and sorry tasting salad. The service sucked, as usual, as this place is known for. The waitress smiled but after serving the food, we never saw her again. We never go here unless we are coerced by friends and the group wants steak or, once, we were given a gift certificate.
