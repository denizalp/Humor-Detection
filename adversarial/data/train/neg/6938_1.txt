Came in on a Sunday just towards the tail end of their brunch but we ordered from the regular menu.  Our server was friendly and very welcoming especially since it was our first time here.  I ordered the Torta which was huge and very tasty.  The mix of ingredients balanced out very nicely.  The pork Milanese was perfectly cooked!  My boyfriend ordered tacos: green chile chicken and brisket.  He loved them both but liked the chicken taco a little more.  I also liked the little pinwheel duritos they give you as soon as you sit down.  We will definitely come back and recommend it to my friends.
