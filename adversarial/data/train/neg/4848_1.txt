I swear, every time I come to Wisconsin, I have the best pizza I've had since the last time I was in Wisconsin.  I live in Tampa, Florida, a barren wasteland of thin, New York-style pizza offerings, trying to cater to all of the transplanted New Yorkers who will never think any of it is as good as a \"real pie\" from within the 5 boroughs.\n\nSo, Glass Nickel's thick, juicy Deluxe pizza, with awesome cheese and big chunks of sausage and wonderfully tasty toppings was just what I needed, pizza-wise.  I wish we could get a nice Chicago-style pizza like this in Tampa.\n\nTheir breaded mushrooms were a little underdone, but still good.  The fried cheese curds were 100% delicious.  And the Greek salad was fresh, crunchy and generous.  in fact, all of the sides were generously sized -- I had two full days worth of leftovers in my hotel room fridge after I gorged myself on this meal.
