Snakes and Lattes is my second experience in a board game cafe ambience. The  entrance fee is $5, which is cheaper than other board game cafes I've been to.\n\nThe cafe drinks are priced around $3-5, and adding that to the entrance fee it comes around to ~$8-$10. This is standard fare price in comparison to doing other activities (mini-putt, laser tag, etc.)\n\nThe board game selection is very expansive, and there is no time limit on the time you can stay there after paying the entrance fee.
