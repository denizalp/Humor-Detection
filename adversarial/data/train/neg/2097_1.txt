El Chorro is not a place I'll come back to. The atmosphere screamed 60+, I might even say 70+. My first impression was when I sat on the patio and it was covered with pollen. Not sanitary at all. We decided to move the party inside to their community table instead. It worked for our group. We all ordered the El Chorro Margarita that was on their Happy Hour menu. I ordered mine up (martini style). An epic fail. There's nothing worse than a martini with ice chips in it. We were all also disappointed in the drink's lack of flavor. They did have a good selection of food options. The best dish was the Southwestern Poutine. The street tacos were just ok, the soft taco shells could have been warmed up just a tad. We tried their famous sticky buns. Some really liked them, I wasn't overly impressed. The service was terrible. Our waitress kept disappearing. They added 20% gratuity to our bill because of our party size and it was obvious because she didn't bother to try and earn it. We also had a few dirty saucers handed to us. It was just old and southwestern and not the upscale environment I prefer. This place could use a renovation to modernize and help it live up to their website. You win some. You lose some. I give it a 2 out of 5.
