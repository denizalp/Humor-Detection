I was looking for a keyboard when the power went out. All customers were rounded up like cattle and we were all immediately treated as potential thieves. Yuck. No thanks guys. Maybe come up with a better plan when outages happen instead of alienating your customers. I watched them kick people out and block the entrances. Like, really? There's gotta be a better way to handle situations like this. Never coming back to this location
