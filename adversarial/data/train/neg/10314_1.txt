Yum! Took a friend for a great birthday dinner here a few weeks back. What a great place! Loved the simplistic decor, the wait staff were attentive and very knowledgeable, and the food was spectacular. The sardine salad was refreshing, even though I am not a big fan of sardines. They were topped with oh so tummy deep fried oysters. The beef short rib was tender, falling off the bone goodness. Even something as simple as Serrano ham and cheese worked so well. Will definitely go back!
