Getting tired of St-Hubert chicken? Well come here to eat great fire grilled chicken! This was an amazing experience for me, i really got tired of the rotisserie style of chicken. When I friend brought me here, I really thought I was going to be disappointed. When you walk in the flames are blazing in the kitchen. You can see them cooking on the grill; and you know you are now going to get quality food. \n\nThe restaurant might be a hole in the wall, but its quite cozy. When I went, there was almost no one there. People are really missing out here. There is different dishes for everyones tastebuds. Just remember there is a lot of meat that they will cook on a real grill.\n\nI can't wait to go back.
