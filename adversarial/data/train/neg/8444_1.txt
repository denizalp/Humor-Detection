This is a great store for people who enjoy living a hippie or gypsy life.  Lots of incense, eclectic jewelry, leather journals, and tie dye.  The prices range from reasonable to \"you've got to be joking\" and everything in between.  \n\nWhen you first enter you're greeted by a small room full of jewelry, the employees, and a heavenly aroma.  The next two rooms hold clothing, knick knacks, and accessories.  The racks hold mostly the same clothing design in different colors.   I go mainly for the jewelry.\n\nTwo problems:  the employees will follow you around like you're going to steal something and I'm crossed on this.  On one hand I understand they lose a lot of inventory due to shoplifting but on another hand it doesn't make one feel welcome.  \n\nSecond problem is the store hours.  They open later than the other stores on the street which means if you like to go there right after rush hour traffic died down you still have to wait another hour for them to open.\n\nI do love this store and hope they stay in business a long time.  Try it you might like it.
