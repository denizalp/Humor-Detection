We were part of a 16 person bachelor party on Memorial Day weekend. With working with Darrilyn we were able to make a custom menu for the party to choose from.\n\nThe service was incredible, we had a great waiter. Our drinks were always full, and he kept complimentary bread on the table at all times. \n\nOur food came in a very timely manner and everyones steaks were cooked perfectly--all 16 meals arrived at the same time and were all hot. The general concensus was \"this is the best steak I've ever eaten\". We all agreed it was worth every penny (of their very reasonable menu prices). \n\nI would definitely recommend TENDER to anyone looking for a great steak at a nice restaurant while in Vegas.
