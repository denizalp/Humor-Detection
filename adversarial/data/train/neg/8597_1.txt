I can be patient for most of things, but this time I wanted to post my comment.\n\nI used Alamo. It was good for me since Alamo provide us with online check in system and we didn't have to wait at all. Car was also good.\n\nThe problem was the person at the exit gate.\nShe was talking on the phone. I waited for the ending. But she continued to talk. I could hear the talk, which seemed a private one.  After the end of phone, she just rudely said \"credit card and drivers license\", without facing to me.  \n\nI handed over them. She received them without facing to me.  And started the phone again...\n\nWe waited 5 minutes. During that time, I saw several cars passed the other gate.\n\nThe phone ended again, she turned to me, glazed at me, and gave us a piece of paper.  It needed my signature. But she did not do anything.  Just said thanks.\n\nI can't never understand why she could be so so much rude to the customer?  It was crazy.\n\nWe came here to enjoy our trip. But we were forced to feel very disgusting.
