Went here for the first time this morning. Everything was amazing! I got the corn beef hash and my husband got the bacon avocado omelette. Both entrees are very good. And oh my god their banana bread is to die for seriously! The food came out hot and fresh and the servers were sooo nice and friendly! I'm giving this a five star cause they deserve it! I will be coming back probably every week now lol.
