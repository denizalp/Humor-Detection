Since I'm not sure how to start I'll go in order of the services I got done. I got a gel pedicure, got seated quickly on a massage chair that didn't work (no biggie), the girl who did my toes was great, professional no complaints about her. I will say that 40 dollars for a gel pedicure is a little crazy! I just moved here from SoCal and a gel pedicure with a design or rhinestone bow is anywhere from 25-30...is 40 the norm out here? I will mention that a lady was sat next to me and the lady who was doing her toes pretended to throw in the little blue thing they put in your soaking water but didn't put one in..I thought it was crazy.  I had to wait to get my nails done because the girl that did my toes didn't do nextgen nails...again no biggie. Turns out little miss pretend to throw the blue thing is doing my nails. Hardly said a word to me aside from confirming  next gen, color and shape. Whatever I'm not the talkative type either...I understand. She shapes my coffins nails horribly, rushed, all different shapes all crooked! I let it go initially thinking she will do them and then shape. The whole time she is super rough, almost jerking my hand around and is very rushed! She finished my nails which are all crooked and gets all sassy when I ask her to fix them! She starts speaking and laughing with her coworker in her native tongue, I couldn't understand but she kept saying crooked! She somewhat fixes them but again is rough, literally cutting my fingers with the file and digging her nails in my hands while she is \"fixing\" them! Don't go to kellie!!!! She's the one who did them, very rude unprofessional, sloppy and a waste of money. \n Will never come back here\nEnded up spending 78 dollars here and regret going here
