Typical Pier 1 location. My only complaint - and this seems to apply chain-wide - is that they NEVER have more than one of the products that we're purchasing. I feel like every piece of furniture that we've purchased has been a floor model. I'm not joking.\n\nRegardless, the staff here is very nice.
