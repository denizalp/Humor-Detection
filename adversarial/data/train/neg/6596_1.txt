Good food, reasonably priced, good service. These are important factors when I consider if I will return to a place of business. \nHour wait time was not too long on a Saturday morning. There was coffee and water outside for those waiting to be seated. When we got inside it was a little crowded but the food was good. I ordered the Cook's breakfast (might be called something else... this was a couple days ago).  It came with pancakes, eggs, sausage, and the mini muffins. The mini muffins are my favorite part-like most people's, specifically the zucchini ones.  I will come back!
