I recently had one of the best banking experiences I've ever had at this branch. My tellers name was Maria and she was very helpful with the problems I was having on my account, everyone at this branch is really friendly and I was even offered cookies and water on my way out. I'm really happy with the customer service here, will definitely be back.
