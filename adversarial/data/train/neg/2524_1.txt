The owner of this place would not stop harassing me. I already blocked her phone number before but weeks later she decided to private message me on Yelp and asked me to confirm my address...why???? There is absolutely no need for my personal information, and I do not want any communication with her. Also, she kept reposting pictures of me on Yelp even though it was taken down multiple times. Enough is enough! It has been almost 5 weeks since my touch up session and my eyebrows are still horrific. I have to apply concealer over the eyebrows so it can appear less noticeable. Also my eyebrow hairs that she trimmed down to almost nothing still hasn't fully grown back yet!! I'm extremely upset. This is such a horrible experience and it's important for every potential client to read this. Everything written in the review is 100% true.
