Hands down, best deli in Cleveland. Better than most places I've had in LA too. \nI know, everything is the \"best\" in Cleveland but Jack's is the real deal. Melt in your mouth corned beef sandwiches, great potato pancakes, lox, knishes! You'll get a great plate of two styles of pickles, maybe tomatoes too if you're lucky(!), from some of the nicest bussers in town. I could eat here every day. It's pricey but it seems that most quality delis are, the difference is at Jack's, you don't feel shortchanged like you might at um, other delis.
