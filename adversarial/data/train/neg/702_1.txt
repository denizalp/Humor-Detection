I visited Lon's last night for Restaurant Week with Kristin S. If you don't know where you are going, it is definitely a tricky place to find. It does add to the appeal because it gives the feeling of seclusion which would be appreciated if you were dining on the patio. We decided to sit inside because there was a wait for the patio, but it looked very relaxing and romantic with soft candlelight. The inside is large with many different dining rooms and the decor is all Southwestern. I'm not really into the Southwest as a decorating style, so it was a bit much for me.\n\nFor my starter, I had the cucumber, tomato and blue cheese salad...the tomatoes were very fresh and the blue cheese was a nice compliment and did not overpower the salad at all. I had the sea scallop entree. It was a very generous portion as the three scallops that came on the plate were really large. They were not the best scallops I have had (they didn't have that melt in your mouth quality), but they were cooked perfectly and were not gritty. The chocolate truffle tort was a perfectly sized as a dessert, but I didn't eat more than four bites of it because it was much much too rich for me.\n\nOur server Chris was very nice and provided good service. We did sit for awhile while they ran our credit cards, but we found out that was because their credit card machine broke. It would have been nice if they had come over and said it was taking awhile because of machine problems, but that's just a minor complaint. There is complimentary valet which was very quick and polite. Overall I enjoyed Lon's and would go back to sit on the patio and try the regular menu with my husband on a special occasion, like our anniversary.
