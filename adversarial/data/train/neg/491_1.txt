We had a late dinner (restaurant was closing within the hour) on 7\/16\/17. I had their cheeseburger and fries. LOTS of fries, cooked crunchy. Meat in burger was medium-rare, and flame grilled. Tasted great!\n\nStaff was obviously more focused on closing side-work, and not really focused on customers.\n\nFood was tasty for what it was, but the staff who had already \"mentally checked-out for the night\" means they only get 3 stars. Might be a better experience earlier in the day - the food WAS good.
