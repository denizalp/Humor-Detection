Very little alcohol!  My friend had 2 @ 30 ounce drinkseach, which server said had 3 shots a piece +the added shot of 101 on both =8 shots. NO WAY!  Wasted sugar calories. Fruend poured 10 ounces into my cup (=1 shot), before emptying the extrs shots into her 50 ounces of  drinks.  (Neither of us drinks as much as once a week). I did not feel a thing. I usually feel tingling nose or face - nothing.      My friend had supposedly 7 shots in 1-1\/2 hours. No New Year Eve buzz. )-:
