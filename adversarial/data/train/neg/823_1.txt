I don't know why anyone would sell their house the old fashion way with a realtor that charges 3% when you can save thousands of dollars with MJD Group.  Their flat fee structure is the modern day answer to how to sell a house.  Mike and Shirley and both professional, knowledgeable and fun to work with.  I'll never use anyone else.
