Meatless Monday special was outstanding! Our server was Sundey and she was very helpful finding items that fit our new diet. The appetizers were so good! Green corn tamale, Quinoa Fritters, and a Plantain Empanadas. Our entrees were the  Portabello mushroom and spouse had the market vegetable quesadilla. So flavorful and fresh. Followed with a nice light sorbet......try the coconut sorbet! Mmmmmmm.\n\nSundey was extremely pleasant and made our dining experience perfect. We will be back.
