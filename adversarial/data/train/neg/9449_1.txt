Talk about yolk porn!! \nEggslut surpassed all my foodie dreams! This place is super hyped, with a line out the door (and around the corner), thanks to a heavy social media reputation.  But they definitely lived up to expectation.  Gooey golden yolks of dripping perfection!\nLocated in the Cosmopolitan, this modern and edgy breakfast counter totally fits right in.  When we arrived just before 10am, the line was crazy long and almost deterring.  But slightly hung over and craving that glorious yellow, we decided to tough it out.  The line moves fast, so by 10:30am we were placing our orders at the register.\nHere's the scoop--\n*The Slut ($10)\nA quick impulse add-on to our order, but probably the highlight of my meal.  Soft cooked egg over hot and smooth potato puree, garnished with salt and chives and served with baguette slices.  DELICIOUS.\n*Fairfax ($8) +Sausage ($3)\nSoft-Scrambled eggs done perfectly!  Not overcooked or dry like regular scrambled eggs can get. Sirracha Mayo added a nice kick.  And the Brioche bun was soft and buttery.  The sausage add on is a must, as I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much without the added salt\/protein element.\n*Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich ($8.50)\nThis was my husband's order.  He said this was good, but he has had better-- just your basic breakfast sandwich.  He also mentioned that it would have been better on sourdough, and although I am a big Brioche fan, I actually agree.  The sour tang would have paired great with the creamy egg yolk.  But then again, were from San Francisco, home of the famous Sourdough. :)\n*House Made Buttermilk Biscuit ($5)\nThis was served with butter and syrup, but would have been better warmed up.  The piece I had was slightly dry and crunchy.  At $5, I would have skipped this one.\nI should also mention that I purchased a coffee for $5, which was the size of a Starbuck Tall, and nothing but simple brewed coffee.  Definitely overpriced.\nEverything we had at Eggslut was great!  If you ask my husband, it was okay.  But still worth it for the IG pics. :) If nothing else, definitely get The Slut!  Pictures and descriptions do not do it justice!\nWe will be back again, Eggslut!
