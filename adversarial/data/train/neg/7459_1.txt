I enjoyed my first experience at this salon.  I was there on a Friday evening and happened to be the only customer in the salon.  It was very peaceful, relaxing and the manicure services were wonderful.  My only challenge was getting in to this salon for a booked appointment.  I must have called 4 times on different days, each day they were all booked up.  The key is to get on their schedule and book in advance.  I can't wait to go back for my next appointment!
