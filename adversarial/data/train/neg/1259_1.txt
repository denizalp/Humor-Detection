Nearby and hungry and wanted to try something new, the bf and I popped into this cute restaurant that had art of bunnies all over.\n\nI love risotto, so any time I see it as an option on the menu, it's a must have for me. It was the biggest plate of risotto ever served to me. The portion was enough to feed two people. It didn't taste bad, but wasn't the best I've ever had and it was a bit too runny. The runniness resembles a porridge like dish rather than a hearty risotto. Having absorbed most of the liquid, consuming the left over the next day tasted better than the original.
