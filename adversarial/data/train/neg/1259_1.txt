This was the best experience I have ever had buying a used vehicle. Charlie was great to work with,  and the vehicles are beautiful! \nTrade in values are actually based on what kbb.com considers appropriate, as are the prices on their inventory. \nI will not hesitate to buy here again, and would highly recommend this place anyone looking for a car.
