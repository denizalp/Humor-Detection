As much a part of my Vegas experience as the dancing fountains at The Bellagio. \n\n   10:30 am on Sunday morning in Las Vegas. I call it \"The Hole\". You've pushed your senses as far as they will go all Friday and Saturday. By the time you land in The Hole, the mere mention of alcohol will induce a geyser from deep within your guts. Some fat girl is drinking a yard of beer at this hour and I have to look away. A group of hommies looks and sounds like they haven't been to bed yet. The cashier hollers out my order as if he has turrets. Ah, back to normal. \n\n   The medicine is a XX cheeseburger , add the egg please and a massive Diet Coke. Last stop is the gas station for Tylenol, Jerky and a lot of water. It's a long drive back to San Diego. There will be plenty of time to do the post game wrap up of the weekend on my 4 + hour drive. \n\n    Ah Vegas, till' next time.
