This ER is HORRIBLE! I'd give it negative 5 stars if I could. My daughter had a weird episode of high blood pressure, dizziness and chest pain while at cheer practice, she's 10 and very fit. I brought her at 8pm on a Monday night. It took 4 and 1\/2 hours before a doctor saw her. That is ridiculous! The staff was unfriendly, not helpful & just horrible. I wouldn't come here again if my life depended on it...literally!!
