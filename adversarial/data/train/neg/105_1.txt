Came here the second I turned 21! Literally. My friend and I got the VIP treatment which was awesome. Didn't stay in the VIP area that much cuz there were a few creepers in there. Gross.\n\nDespite the cockfest (yes, I'm a girl and I didn't like it) and the random mix of hip hop and past 80s songs, I had the BEST time ever!! I b**ched about the music maybe for like 20 minutes or so and then the 5 Washington Apples in a row happened. ANYTHING they played after that was good to me!!  I loved the decor and chandeliers too!! Definitely will come back for another round!
