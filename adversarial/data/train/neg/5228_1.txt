Love the healthy options but a little on the pricey side (as is all healthier food options). But it's worth the money and they don't skimp on the stuff. My wrap was stuffed and made me feel very satisfied and full. \n\nYou can make your own by checking off a little order form with what you want. Or pick from their choices on the menu. \n\nSoups, rice bowls, wraps and salads. Delicious.
