I got a pedicure 4 days ago from this place and ended up in the Emergency Room. I have Cellulitis and taking heavy duty antibiotics. They used dirty tools and didn't sanitize them. I contacted the Cosmetology Board and Health Department. I contacted them to pay for exactly what I had to pay in my medical expenses and they were rude and hung up the phone on me. I will contact an attorney if they don't want to resolve it in a simple manner.
