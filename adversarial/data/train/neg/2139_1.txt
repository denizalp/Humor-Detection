I just moved to PA and It's been couple years since I got a hair cut last time. I found this place on Yelp, the reviews seem to be ok, but decided to walk-in today anyway. I didn't know there's the front door on the other side, this place is huge! You can spend all day here doing head to toes. Men and women walking by all the time, clean and look professional. Mandi was my stylist today. I told her that I want it very short ( my hair was longer than middle of my back) she was very friendly and talking to her makes me less nervous. She did a good job, not exactly what I wanted at first but I'm happy with the result.
