Delicious and obviously fresh food - fantastic flavor combinations for the tacos.  Incredibly fast and courteous service.  Menu is based solely on taco combinations - so don't go looking for a large array of american\/mexican entrees.  \n\nOne drawback:  Manager should go over cleanliness policies with staff...one young gentleman was playing with his hair constantly while rolling silverware\/napkins out on the deck.
