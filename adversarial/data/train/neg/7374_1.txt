I've been coming to Sweet Nails for about 6 months now. I usually get a polish change on my feet and a gel polish changes on my hands. Every once in a while I'll get a manicure and a pedicure. Almost Every time I come in they start doing my nails and proceed to do a manicure and a pedicure even though I tell them no! I just want a polish change. Today was no different, the lady started to fill the tub for my feet and I said I just want a polished change. She stopped what she was doing and waited for someone else to come do my change. For what?! Is because it doesn't cost as much? Is she too good to do polish changes?! A costumer is a costumer. From her body language and tone of voice she was talking to her co workers she seemed very irritated. Not my fault you didn't \"hear\" me correctly. Im huge on customer service and I feel like I was an inconvenience. Looks like I'll be finding a new nail place!
