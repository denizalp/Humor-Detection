a very disorganized service. not given a menu after waiting 15 minutes on a non busy nite told i have to see the fish first. not explained you have to buy the whole fish so I settled on a limited choice as most  fish were quite large. then given the menu. the first fish wasnt  filleted as they promised I had to request a second time for the server to discuss the wine. It was all room temperature. nobody asked me how was it. I had 5 different waiters and never saw them a second time except the original rather bored server. What a pity as the seafood was a good quality. My family is in the restaurant business and for the over  100 dollar price for 2 dishes, potatoes and one glass of wine, I would have expected better. By contrast the service in the other restaurants in the cosmopolitan hotel were excellent service a good variety of dishes for a single person and outstanding service. I rated it  1star only because the quality of the fish was good.  otherwse it would get no stars.
