Arguably my FAVORITE of the Cirque show's I've seen.\n\nThe best way to describe it... I very much didn't like the Beatles, but after the show, I cannot get enough. I will say I laughed, and was wowed, but I really cried quite a bit. This show is just an experience and has a lot of great statements about the past but also about this time. My review will never give this show justice. Please go watch and support, you WILL NOT be disappointed.\n\nThis is my favorite Cirque show, and it's coming from a guy who really didn't like the Beatles beforehand. GO WATCH NOW!!!!!!! WATCH THIS SHOW IF THERE'S ONLY ONE THING YOU DO IN VEGAS!!!!!
