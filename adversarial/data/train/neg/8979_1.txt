Even though I haven't purchased any equipment yet, we have inquired and have been impressed. \n\nThe store itself seems well stocked for any adventurist! Different verity of Bows available including ranging in price. \n\nStaff is very helpful and seems very helpful, not pushy at all. \n\nLove the Friday night beginners class for learning!
