I don't know what the hype is all about this burger place. The fries tasted stale, the burger meat was so thin. The burger itself had just bunch of lettuce and no meat. I would have to say the sauce was tasty. Tasted like their homemade mayo or something. The service was quick, which it should be for a fast food restaurant. There are limited seats and they are not sanitary. It would be a great drunk food burger but shake shack is much better from NY area.
