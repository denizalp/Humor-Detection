I made the mistake of eating at this restaurant when I arrived at Cleveland Hopkins airport. I sat down because the employee on the Togo line assured me that ordering at the table was most efficient. I order a simple meal of hot dog fries and a mixed bevrage. Except I had to place my order 3 times with different employees. Some of which were intoxicated. 35 minutes in i get my mixed drink things are starting to look up and I expect the food to come shorty... wrong. Another 30 minutes go by and in a rush I see them making my food. 5 minutes later I get my food and immediately ask for the check because people in airports usually have flights to catch and don't have 55 minutes to wait for a hotdog. Honestly this is the worst customer experience I have received I'm my life and I wish to never return to this sad excuse for a sit down restaurant.
