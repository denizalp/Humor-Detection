Hop Central is a great little neighborhood bar. These guys really have a nose for beer! 36 beers on tap, much better than places that only have 27 or 28 if you ask me.\n\nUnlike some other bars, they never play music too loudly and that is something i can appreciate. Speaking of music, it's always stuff i like. No grandpa's tunes at this hip place!\n\nService is polished and quick. They have a discount for Intel employees, and they will gladly stack it with happy hour prices. How cool is that?\n\nHop central doesn't have a kitchen, but they don't mind if you bring outside food. There are several great restaurants in the same plaza you can order from.
