Solid hotel with clean and spacious lobby. Check in was quick and straightforward. Room was spacious, clean and fairly modern. Good desk space and comfortable working chair. Bed was comfortable with soft sheets and above average pillow. Air circulation was good and view was above average. Bathroom had good lighting and space. Shower had solid water pressure. Towels were below average with poor sizing and worn feel. This is something the hotel should consider upgrading in the near term. I advise staying here if you can get a rate below $210. \n\nEnjoy Toronto!
