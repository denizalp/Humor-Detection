Went to see an Elvis impersonator this past Saturday night. Overall enjoyed the performer but fair warning you don't want a seat in the back of the theatre. There are bars set in the back. Their talking and all the noise behind you can be a real distraction. The casino is nice with a large assortment of games. Food court was ok but so overly crowded and understaffed it was frustrating. The pizza place had six or seven pizzas and we're running out quickly. We were told take what's there not fixing anymore.  When it's gone it's gone. That was at 7pm. Really?  Overall a decent night out but don't go with high expectations.
