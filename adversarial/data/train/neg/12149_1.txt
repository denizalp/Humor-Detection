Lola Rosa is delicious- even for non vegetarians!\n\nHi there, I recently visited this place with a group of vegeterian \/ vegan friends. My fiancé and I are not vegeterians , I am a GLuten Intolerant tho. \n\nWe were very positively surprised with the quality and taste of the food, also of the gluten free options.\n I have gone to quite many vege places but this one seems to get the flavors quite well. \n\nMy fiancè had \n-burrito, he quite liked it even tho it did not have any meat as his usual burritos, \nand I had \n-the curry -which we both loved. We also tasted : \n-Nachos -great- but could come with the option of non vegan cheese tho.\n-Chick pea fries- interesting - underspiced- they would taste so much better with garlic & salt n pepper. \n-deserts all utterly delicious, especially the gluten free ones I had- coconut chocolate brownie- so good - for the raw kind- \nWe were really impressed. My friends tried all the other deserts and they loved it all. \n\nI recommend this place for a family and friend gatherings- the service was superb!!!\n\nFood great.\nDrinks great.\n\nThe only thing that was not satisfying was the fact that some things were under and some over spiced- for example- one day curry was medium the other super salty- and shirley temple- tasted very artificial, and had way too much sugar, to the point you couldn't drink it unless you split it in to parts and mix with water in 3 other glasses. (4 full glasses all together and still too sweet).\n\n\n\nTip- try not to eat several hours before going there portions don't look big but all that fiber will fill you up so much , really to the limits! Eat slow, for real.
