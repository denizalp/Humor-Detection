I've been to surrender a few times and it was always different. When the pool area was open, when it had a greenhouse looking structure, when they closed off the pool and cabana areas. The club is pretty small and the dance floor is tiny. It gets so overcrowded in there that it gets congested. The other side has tables for gambling and also another bar. That area is usually less crowded. We never stay very long here because of all the people.
