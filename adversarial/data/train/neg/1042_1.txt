Los Olivos is a quiet resturaunt in the Old Scottsdale city near the SF Giants spring training site. That is how I happened on this wonderful family style eatery. Arrived to the area to meet a Good HS friend and was way early. Used the Yelp app on my phone and soon I was here! Seated with out any wait. The place was just picking up since the ball game was not to far off and it was Dinner time as well. Service was very efficient and pleasant. I'm partial to Chicken what ever in these Mexican style resturaunts, and had a 'Chimi'. Arrived shortly and enjoyed it emencely.\nI would recomend Los Olivos to anyone. Looks as if they can handle most any size group as well! Everything is reasonably priced as well. Enjoy! Holla!
