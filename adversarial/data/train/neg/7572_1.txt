I don't have kids so I don't know about them. But I definitely enjoyed it! As you know it's hard to find obstacle courses in Arizona yet. I hope there will be more obstacle courses soon. Anyway it's a small gym but has a lot of things to enjoy. If you're an active adult or want to have fun physically this is the place! Clean, nice staff, not too crowd!\n\nYelp offered me $2 off when I checked in.\nSo don't forget to check in before you pay it.
