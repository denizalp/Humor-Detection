I'd like to start this off by saying the staff were very nice here. Also, the place looked very clean. Now, let's move on to the food:\nWhole wheat bun - dry\nEgg - dry\nTurkey burger - dry\nAvocado - bitter\nSharp cheddar - NOT SHARP!\nBacon - dry to the point where it was hard to bite - cooked the goodness right out of it :-(\n\nAlso, the soda fountain had some issue where the diet soda was not carbonated enough. The raspberry seltzer is also awful. I've let them know about the soda fountain, and that's usually a temporary issue anyway.\n\nThis place had three stars as of my review. I am sorry to say this was a harsh lesson in what happens when you dip below 3.5 star places and try to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt. There are plenty of places within a couple of blocks that have 4+ stars and offer similar fare. I would suggest you try there first as I know I won't be trying this place again (which is a shame because I'm only a block away).
