This dealership is horrible. I've been having my vehicles service here for years. And through that time, they've always nickel and dime me with \"recommendation\" fixes. My friend is a mechanic and he told me there was nothing wrong with the stuff that they recommended fixing. The last straw for me was when I had my breaks replaced here and it was supposed to be genuine Honda pads. But it didn't last 6 months. I came back and they say it was my driving habit that I break too hard. I told them with 2 little kids in the back, how do you think my driving would be? They say it doesn't matter, the problem was with my driving. They just want to place the blame on you instead of owning up about giving me stock parts. Genuine parts from Honda last a long time even if you abuse it. Which I don't. My friends sometimes make joke about my driving like an old lady. I was just appalled after that incident. David was the guy that was handling my appointments. \n\nSave yourself the trouble and DO NOT COME TO THIS DEALERSHIP!
