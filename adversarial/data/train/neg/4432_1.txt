Dude.. authentic Japaneese in a crappy strip mall.. it even has a tree growing inside. Its an oasis of goodness in a crazy world.. evrything i try is awesome but the bento is my fave.. the gamazio dispenser is an unprecedented discovery! even i cali i'd not seen one.. This is so awesome! I'm a habitual vistor.. its just that freaking awesome!
