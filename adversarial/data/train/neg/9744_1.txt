We were passing by, and the hot dogs aren't our favorite, but we decided to try the fresh made donuts.\nI ordered a dozen (a little expensive $6.00 a dozen, but whatever)\nI got the lemon curd ones, he centre of each mini donut is filled with lemon curd, then the donut is dusted in powdered sugar.\nThe result was very good, not sure how good they would be once they cooled off, but we had them hot, it was really good.
