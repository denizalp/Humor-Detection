I called the Queen Creek location to see if I could get \"tons\" of rock delivered to my home on very short notice & not only were they able to fit me in & help me complete my project but their staff was awesome! I worked with Kranston & Jessica & they were both efficient, polite & helpful. The price was a lot lower than I expected as well which is always a plus :) I would definitely recommend to family & friends.
