Not too bad, but not awesome.. Had a half chicken, rice and potatoes with a pop for $11. The potatoes as others have said we're really good - nice parisian style. Tons of rice that was OK. The chicken was nice and crispy but the beast was very dry, to the point of almost inedible. Had the spicy sauce, which is flavourful and not overpowering.
