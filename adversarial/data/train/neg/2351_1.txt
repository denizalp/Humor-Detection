For the price, I expected a big, tasty burger.  Instead, it was really small and average tasting.  The fries were good, but they charged extra for vinegar, which is ridiculous.  The music inside was obnoxiously loud, so we sat outside, even though it was hot and humid.  In Mentor, there are too many other places to get better burgers for less, without having to listen to music that's turned up to 11.
