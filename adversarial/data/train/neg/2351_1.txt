I'm visiting for just this week and caught a movie here last night. The seats are super comfortable (leather reclining) and there is quite a bit of space between the seats. Ticket purchase was straightforward using the kiosk. It helped us get our tickets quicker than if we had waited in line.\n-1 star for the process to get snacks. We ordered a kid popcorn combo and it took several minutes to get our order. I think we waited for about 6 or 7 minutes.
