This wasn't what I was expecting when I picked it, and I was a little disappointed it was \"fast food,\" but then pleasantly surprised to see the menu options and taste the food. It was a great combination of pretty authentic, fresh Mexican, served in a quick manner. The chips (chips & salsa) were hot, fresh and crispy!! Best I've had in a long while. I had the crispy grilled taco salad and it was very \"fresh\" as well. I tried a bite of another member of our groups shredded beef burrito and it was fantastic. First visit was a success, and if we lived in the area or find ourselves visiting again, I'd definitely return!
