I recently met a group of friends at Higher Ground in Kensington and the experience left me quite impressed. \n\nI love that there's a lot of room at Higher Ground. The 6 of us monopolized a few tables and between all of us, we had a good assortment of the fare they offer. \n\nI'll start by saying that their coffee is delicious. I especially like places that offer organic coffee and yes, this place is one of them. \n\nTheir lattes and hot chocolates were also prepared with expertise and precision. And of course, let's not forget to mention their assortment of teas! Black teas, green teas and herbal teas, OH MY! Higher Ground has got it all covered! \n\nHigher Ground is not your ordinary coffee shop because they also serve cocktails and food! Everything from Piadinas (Italian flatbread sandwiches) to skewers, yogurt parfaits to mac 'n' cheese; Higher Ground truly stands out from the rest of the generic coffee shops in the area. \n\nIf you're in the mood for a 'one-stop shop', Higher Ground serves everything you need to ensure your palette will be completely satisfied. It's refreshingly different and exceptionally good.
