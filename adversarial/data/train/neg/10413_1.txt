Started off with the grilled calamari and a beet salad with blood orange. They were good. Calamari was cooked tender. Beet salad was nice with the blood orange. The main course was disappointing. \n\nI had the Ossobuco over saffron risotto with kale. The meat was tender but had no seasoning. Very bland and I'm not a salt person. The risotto was more like cooked rice. It was not creamy at all and was also bland. The kale was good. Wife had the gnocchi. It was ok. We have had better. We had to keep asking for bread. They would bring it to 2 little sliced at a time. Never had that happen at an Italian restaurant. \n\nFinished it off with the chocolate mousse. That was $10 for a small rocks glass. It was ok and not worth $20 for 2 servings. In my opinion it needs work for that cost. They had no dessert menu the waiter just told you what they had. The meal was $150 plus tip. No liquor. We had iced tea and diet coke.
