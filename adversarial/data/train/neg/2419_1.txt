Ariyoshi is an outstanding sushi restaurant!  We've been there twice in the past few weeks.  One test of a sushi restaurant is to ask the chef to prepare a roll of his own choosing.  First time, we ended up with \"Funny Kiwi\", a roll with excellent mix of interior items and an exterior coating of thinly-sliced kiwi.  So good that we ordered that again the second visit.\n\nThe other items were also excellent.  The \"Black Dragon\" roll had excellent flavors.  Also try the \"Avacado and Peanut\" roll.\n\nOn the second visit, we happened to catch a pre-8:00 price special  ---  any single sushi or sashimi for $1.  We had three each of four different sushi for the four of us, as well as several named rolls.\n\nThere are at least 4 other places for sushi in Cleveland Heights.  Two of them within a stone's throw of Ariyoshi.  Pacific East on Coventry is the best of the competition and we still think Pacific East is excellent, too.  Pacific East also offers a Malaysian menu in addition to the Japanese one.
