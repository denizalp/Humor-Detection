I first tried this place after leaving the club drunk and hungry I asked my cab driver what was a really good place for us to go and eat and based on his recommendation we ended up here. \n\n I had seen this place many times before when in vegas and I decided to give it a try. The ambiance of this restaurant is actually pretty cool the neon lights late at night make it seem really cool inside and out. The staff was very friendly and suggestive as to what type of burger I should get let's just say I wasn't disappointed all the food was really good. Moderate price range. Cab service right outside when you need it. In short, I enjoyed my experience here!
