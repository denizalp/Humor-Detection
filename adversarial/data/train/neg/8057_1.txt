Restaurant has nice setup as fine restaurant with low profile service.Today I had a chance to visit it. Well, they have to update their address on yelp ! Which is at: \n2015 Avenue Rd, North York  \n\nTheir Welcoming service for 2 families was ok as they picked immediately high chairs for the little ones. However, after we seated; we waited for menu's for more than 10 min. \n\nThere were nice 2 small plates of cheese and walnuts with bread baskets no one asked to refill.\n\nStrangely and all of sudden we received big plates where all orders was in !!!! We asked politely to reserve it separately again. They reserve it in 2 sec . \n \nWe had vegetable soup was nice and tasty enough for 2. Skewers size was good . We had kupaidah, chicken, Sultani and especial DarBar skewers. All were amazingly tasted very good and grilled in very highly professional way. Plates comes with nice basmati rice with saffron, grilled tomatoes and grilled jalape√±os.\nchicken and pomegranate stew not really recommended! \n\nAt checkout no one asked to try their dessert menu or to come again as fine restaurant expected good bye greeting. Which make their price more inconvenient. \n\nDarbar Restaurant in all and Washrooms was cleaned. \n\nMaybe will give it another chance for the taste? Not in near future!
