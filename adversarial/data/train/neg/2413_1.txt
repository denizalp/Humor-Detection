Newbie in the hood! This place just opened about a week ago. The ambience and the decor was on point. The restaurant has been carefully decorated to mimic the feel of Gym Khana Club in Delhi, Mumbai or Kolkata. They have tried to pay ode to the \"clubs\" of India in their own way! \nThe service was attentive and timely. The menu has a ton of variety for vegetarians and those who prefer meats\/seafood. \nWe were a group 4 and we ordered 2 apps, 3 mains and a rice with a variety of naan. It was a ton of food! We got their Jalebi chaat and Veg momo's to start and both were delicious. For mains we had their Bengali Shrimp, their Chicken Saag and their Paneer Kofta. Both the shrimp and chicken were really yummy, but the kofta dish was underwhelming. It did not have enough sauce and was too dry. We let them know about the Paneer Kofta dish.. and they took our feedback quiet well. The Naans and the Truffle Pulao were all really good. For dessert we shared their Mango Roshogulla and their Parle G pudding, which is essentially a custard with biscuit bits on the bottom. So nostalgic! Both were good, but I prefer traditional Roshogulla's so the twist didn't really fascinate me. \nThe prices are a bit on the higher side, so maybe a good spot for special occasions or date night. A couple can easily enjoy a dinner for ~$60-70
