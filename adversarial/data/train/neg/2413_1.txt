They should change the name $5 Cafe! Nothin here is in the $5 range! The food is mediocre n it's locate inside the smelly rundown Aztec casino. With questionable clienteles n rude ass unhappy employees! U will probably feel more comfortable go in across to the Stratosphere or the surrounding businesses!
