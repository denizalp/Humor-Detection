Authentic Jamaican food in Pittsburgh, me and my husband were thrilled. I wish I had known this place years ago. We ordered beef patties, jerk chicken, brown stewed chicken. Portions are generous.The food is incredible, I was so upset because I was full, wanted to try the fish (Oh well, surely there will be a next time). Cecilia and her husband are the owners. We got the chance to talk with her and I just need to say this, the world is a better place with people like her in it. Cecilia, you are a treasure! Impressionz is a secret gem.
