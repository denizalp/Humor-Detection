We tried Crabby Joes recently for the first time and were very quite impressed. Hubby and I both had the T Bone steak special for $15.00 each. We didn't have high expectations because of the low price (where can you get a steak dinner for $15???), but to our delight, the food was amazing! It was juicy and perfectly cooked. My husband had some chocolate dessert ( can't remember the name) and loved it do much, he ordered a second plate of it! Our kids both enjoyed their kids meals and the waitress, who was very helpful and friendly, brought them seconds of ice cream at no extra charge. We will definitely be back!
