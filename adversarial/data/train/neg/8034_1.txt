Low stars are for low value.\n \nBasic egg sandwiches.  They come in a brioche bun but other than that not much to say.  5 dollars for a biscuit, 5 dollars for small oj, no tap water only 5 dollar water bottles.  The food is good, but 30 bucks for two people and all we are were egg freaking sandwiches.  I used to eat a lot of egg sandwiches in college, so I know they are usually right there with the grilled cheese at about 3-6 bucks. 10 bucks is just overpriced for basic.\n\nI would only go again if forced.  If you love eggs go otherwise pick one of the million other options.
