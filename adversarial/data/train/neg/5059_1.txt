The reviews attracted me to this place years ago but it is not easy to get in here. You need to plan ahead, which I can respect. However, sometimes even when you do the ball gets dropped, as in unanswered questions and ignored messages, which results in not booking the appointment. I successfully got it once and the results to my root touch up were alright. The lack of a consistent response has discouraged me from trying again.
