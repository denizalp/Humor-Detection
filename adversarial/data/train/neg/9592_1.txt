I've seen too many arrogant dog owners allowing their LARGE dogs off leash in this park.  They think the law doesn't apply to them.  In public, dogs are supposed to be on a leash.  The park should post rules about pets,  as well as a phone number you can call to report the irresponsible dog owners.   \n\nI wish they'd clean the park better too. I left around 5:00 PM one day and there was a dead pigeon in the children's playground. The lake often looks horrible.  In the women's bathroom the toilet paper rolls do not budge when you try to unroll the paper,  so it's very tricky getting enough toilet paper unwound !  They need to keep up with the soap in the bathroom too, usually there is none.\n\n I've found fishing line just left behind where it doesn't belong,  people who fish at the lake need to be more responsible as that line can be dangerous for the wildlife.
