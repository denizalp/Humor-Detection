I expect just another hotel with basic rooms but what we got for such a low price was amazing. The room was spacious, very clean and comfortable and had it's own kitchen. Most places have a vending machine but this place had a room full of snacks and microwaveable food, also a microwave on the spot. Great thing for when you come back really late and hungry. The front desk also has a big selection of DVDs for rent. Next time I'm back in Phoenix I'm sure I'll be staying at Candlewood Suites.
