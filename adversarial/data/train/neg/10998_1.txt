Delicious, very reasonably priced food. Italy's II is tucked away in a back corner- we've driven by often but only this morning found it online. Our waiter was friendly & courteous. The owners are working alongside with a couple young people- not a hoitytoity place at all! We will definitely come back!\nThe one drawback was the smell of glue that was very strong. This is because a new roof was being put on. It did NOT detract from a great tasting breakfast though!
