If I could give zero stars I would. First off, my daughter had been going through some problems, technically we all had but this is what happened. The first counselor my daughter had seemed to be very good, in fact I think she was, and my daughter was very comfortable with her, only problem was, they kept changing the appointments on us. Well, she left much to our chagrin, and we end up with this other woman, I can't mention names but if I could I would strongly suggest that  this counselor should be fired and never be allowed to counsel again. Tough approach, yes, uncaring, you betcha. We had actually had a house fire but we kept the appointment anyway because they had messed us around so much boy was that a mistake. She talked over us, she pretty much accused my daughter of dressing too provocatively & pretty much suggested she was of \" loose\" morals. Told us she didn't care about our house fire, not to mention before we got there we thought we had a place for our cats and my daughters friend's boyfriend kicked her out and our cats....it gets better, really should of cancelled. She accused me of trying to get my daughter in trouble when actually had told her that things even though stressful had been going pretty well. My daughter said,I think  my  mom thinks I may have started the fire, it went downhill from there. She called me a drunk because my eyes were bloodshot, like I said we had been through a very traumatic time, I had been crying the night before and hadn't had a lot of sleep.She also preceded to tell us about 2 of her friends and their kids that had absolutely no bearing on anything. This woman was imbalanced, I reported her. When I left her office and was walking away she called in my husband , but she told me her approach was tough love or some garbage like that, she apparently had worked in a rough neighborhood, not my problem lady. It was a nightmare. She told him we were going to see her twice a week, blah blah, nut job.
