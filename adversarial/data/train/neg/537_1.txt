This review is for the breakfast\/lunch buffer priced around $35 per person. I must say I was not too impressed for the price.\n\nPros: \n-Fast entrance and seating\n-variety of desserts (delicious creme brulee)\n-typical drinks (soda, tea, coffee, and juices)\n-omelette station\n\nCons:\n-Limited variety of cuisines (typical American breakfast, some sushi, mediocre seafood,)\n-Bland Fish\n-bland Miso soup\n\nWith all the choices in Las Vegas, will definitely not go back
