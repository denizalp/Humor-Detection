I've been going to Norm's since he first opened. The food is fairly priced and very good for filling breakfast food. Lunch is good too. The cafe is a perfect mom and pop shop where you're recognized when you come in and Norm (the owner) is pretty much always there. Working next door I like that I can wander over for a cup of hot chicken noodle soup or orange juice when I'm sick or to get a quick, healthier bite instead of McDonald's down the street.
