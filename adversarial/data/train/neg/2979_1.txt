Ordered to go the other day. I ordered pho to go for my husband with the lean sirloin and brisket. The broth was ok, but I wouldn't say it's anything to get excited about. I also ordered spring rolls and egg rolls. They were were ok. I felt like they were lacking in flavor and the sauces didn't really make much of a difference. Also ordered papaya salad, it was nothing like what I'm used to eating back home and I've pretty much given up trying to find good papaya salad in AZ. I got teriyaki chicken with rice for my son. It was pretty basic, my son didn't rave over it like he usually does. The service I did receive at the counter was pretty good though and they did pay attention to detail. I requested they put the peanut sauce in separately since my son is allergic. They put it in a small bag for me. I can't say much for the waiters since no one greeted me or even approached us when we entered.
