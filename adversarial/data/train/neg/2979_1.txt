Love love love!!! It was very busy when I dined in, but had excellent service. There were only 2 people working, a young Hispanic lady and a young man. Can't remember the names but I know they handled the rush very well. Not sure why only 2 people would work during such a busy time but it was handled extremely well! Awesome service! Will definitely be returning!!!
