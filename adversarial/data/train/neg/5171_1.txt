I am incredibly upset with the way my revocation packet process has been processed. I have to return to pay another $100 because I wasn't told over the phone the conditions on my packet that was never mailed to me. The next day it expired by the time I received my packet it was too late. I feel completely cheated and cannot wait to be finished with this process. I almost rather move out of Arizona than deal with this kind of unfairness. The people who are good citizens have to deal with this while actual drug addicts get away with murder.
