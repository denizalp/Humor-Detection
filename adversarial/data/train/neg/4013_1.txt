I was so happy with my service here today! I came in from out of town with a ruined tire and no appointment. Stephen answered all of my questions thoroughly and honestly, gave me two options at two price levels and explained the pros and cons of each choice, and was able to get me in and out in an hour even though they were full for the day. The woman at the register offered to change the channel and temperature in the waiting room, in addition to free coffee. If I still lived here, I would never go anywhere else. Thank you so much!
