Literally, the very best ribs I have ever had!!  We started off with the Morcilla sausage app which was delicious and then the cod coquettes (ok but not amazing) and Artichokes (YUM) and the anchovy app, which was good but I don't love anchovies so can't really judge.  But back to the ribs....they were so tender and smokey and amazing!  Great place, will be back soon
