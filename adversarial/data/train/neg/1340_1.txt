For first timers and our experience we will definitely be returning for seconds! Quality, creativeness, and presentation of food was intriguing to say the least! You can feel and see the pride the owner\/chef has to his guests. He personally checked on us and every other table as well, you can tell he genuinely cares for you and his staff as he was hands on helping them clear\/clean tables. (My small reason for 4 stars would be the decor but maybe that's just me being picky). We got SERVED and are happy we did!
