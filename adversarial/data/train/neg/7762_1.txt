$8 for a bud light pitcher that contained 6 full glasses of beer. Nuff said. From the start the experience was great. Patty (not sure if correct spelling) was so welcoming and refused to let us sit at a table till she wiped it down even though it was barely dirty. I feel like that says a lot!!!  Can't wait to come back and try the food. Bc it smelled amazing!
