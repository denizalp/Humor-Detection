The bus service is great.  Customer service, not so much.\n\nI had taken the Megabus to Toronto and Montreal in the past and had great experiences.  Roomier seats than expected and the outlets and wifi are a nice touch.  \n\nI loved that I could get to Pittsburgh in about 4 hours and 20 minutes with a brief stop in Erie.  There were a variety of times offered and many times I was able to have the seat next to me to myself.  \n\nOne of the problems is that the bus was coming from Toronto.  If there were any border delays, the bus could be up to an hour late.  One trip it was almost two hours!And you would get NO information from customer service.  In fact, they were often rude and disrespectful towards you.  In today's connected world there should be no reason that customer service can't be kept up to date about the status of a bus.  \n\nThe Toronto-Buffalo-Erie-Pittsburgh route no longer exists which I don't quite understand because every time I took it, it was at least 3\/4 full.  The worst experience I had was when I received notificaiton my trip leaving Pittsburgh at 11:15 p.m. on a Sunday night was cancelled.  I tried calling to get additional information and was told \"it must be weather related\"  Except the trip was still two weeks away!  It turned out they had cancelled some of the trips between Buffalo and Pittsburgh (and eventually eliminated the route) but again, that is something that customer service should have been aware of.  \n\nLong story short, the bus trip itself is enjoyable and worth the price (especially since the cost of a round trip ticket is generally less than  it would cost to fill up your gas tank) but lots of luck if you actually have to deal with customer service.
