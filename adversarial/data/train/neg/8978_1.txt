08\/09\/2013\n\nWe were there for Dinner, we were seated right away, numerous delicious items were served right away. My wife had the Caprese, I had the Shrimp Oreganata, and it was so good I said wow and I never say Wow! Homemade pasta for my wife, a classic Osso Bucco for me!  Everything was perfect!  Exception job! We will be back!
