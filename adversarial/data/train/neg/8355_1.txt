My sister and I came here for lunch with our elderly parents today, been here before, but it's been a while.  We were basically ignored while waiting for seating, until my sister stepped in front of my parents and glared at every employee on the floor, and someone finally came over.  We were seated at a large round table for eight, when there were plenty of smaller tables and booths available.....very weird. There was still tip money on the table but nothing else, and it remained there until someone finally came over and my sister pointed it out.......also very weird.  My parents both ordered corned beef hash with scrambled eggs.  The eggs were scattered over the top of the hash, and it looked pretty unappetizing. My sister and I ordered wraps, and they were OK, but nothing special, and the waitress wasn't sure who got what, just waved them over the table and waited for us to claim them.\n\nWe needed take-home boxes, and when the waitress brought them, one had a hair on it.......eeesh.  When we went to check out, we were again basically ignored for way too long.  They made us feel like an inconvenience, and unless my parents suggest going here again, it won't be happening.
