This is one of the BEST free zoos that I have ever been to. Though some of the exhibits were under remodel, the zoo was still a great time to spend about the area.\n\nThis is a definite tourist stop if you are traveling through like we were. Try and go during the weekday and avoid the weekend crowds, but either way you will have a great time for FREE!
