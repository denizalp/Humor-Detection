This place really is just so so. Service at 6:30 am is a bit slow & the pancakes had the most horrible consistency I've ever seen in a place. I didn't really see any huge portions from what I saw coming out of the kitchen. I had the basic cakes & eggs with sausage link. The best part of it was the link. Honestly Denny's would've been a better choice but there isn't one in my area. I'll come back ONLY if I can't make my own breakfast.
