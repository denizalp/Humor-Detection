Came here for breakfast with my family! Pretty good service, I'd say it all depends on the waitress\/waiter. Some are faster than others. But the food is absolutely delicious! I had ONE banana walnut pancake and it was very filling! I could only finish half!! There food does come in giant portions. This cafe is really nice though and had a good vibe when you walk in
