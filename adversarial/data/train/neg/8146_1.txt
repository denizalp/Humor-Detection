I always refer to yelp reviews when picking a place to eat, but I've never written one until now so bear with me. \n\nWe're always looking for great sushi places near the house so we were very excited to try this place out as it is around the corner from our house. \n\nThe decor is cute, especially considering that this restaurant sits in a strip mall with a Fry's grocery store around the corner. One look at the menu, however, and it seemed extremely pricey for a restaurant in a strip mall next to a Fry's. I'd expect prices like this at a swanky place in Scottsdale. We tried to be open minded hoping the prices would be justified by awesome sushi. \n\nThe menu is HUGE with pages and pages of special sushi roll options and there is no sheet to write down what you're selecting. The waitress takes your order. We ended up writing down what we wanted on a napkin so we could order without forgetting what we wanted once the waitress came around. The waitress seemed nice enough but knew very little about sushi. We got a blank stare when we asked her about their sashimi and she had to ask someone if they even offered it and where it could be found on the menu. What sushi restaurant doesn't offer sashimi? The rolls were HUGE. By huge I mean a small piece of fish wrapped around a giant fist full of rice. The chefs are also very liberal with the sauces they use. TOO liberal. All you taste is white rice and sauce. One of our sushi rolls had lemon in it and they didn't even bother to take the seeds out. Imagine biting into a 13 dollar sushi roll with lemon seed. If you're into Americanized sushi, aren't into raw fish, and have a fat wallet, this is your place. If you enjoy sushi for the simplicity and flavor of the fish, you'll be disappointed. \n\nIn short, this place was overpriced and served over-sauced, overly-Americanized sushi.  We should have gone to Sushi Eye.
