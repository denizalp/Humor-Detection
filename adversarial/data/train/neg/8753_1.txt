When you add crack to the name of a sauce, that is what you get exactly. Whether you're dipping it on your garlic fries or even on your burger this stuff is legit. \nSize and seating : fairly small for your quick grab and go, but also can seat 15-20 pls max. \n\nRestaurant atmosphere: low key, with some art of Audrey Kawasaki and tv that features anime to Cartoon Network.\n\nFood: the tamago: if you're looking for a burger that changes the game on what a burger should be then this is the way to go. Not only is your meat juicy, it's it constantly hydrated with a sunny side up egg that is just an amazing combination to this burger. The onions and the wasabi sauce are not too over baring and compliment each other really well. \n\nGarlic fries: over all good mixture and seasoning on the fries. Potatoes were fried just enough to have that crispy initial bite while getting an elegant rush of salty, garlic and furikake. I suggest having this with the crack sauce to help mellow out the salty bits. \n\nConclusion: only reason I didn't fulfill all 5 stars was it's cleanliness. But in terms of food and taste it definitely hits the spot.
