This little gem has been open in the Arbo for a long time (at least 15 years I think).  Even though they do not have the most extensive offerings available, I like to support them because they are a small independently owned shop.  Most of the time, the staff is super helpful and seems to know a lot about the various types of vitamins & supplements they sell. \n\nIn addition to vitamins, herbal supplements, teas, and the like, they also have a decent selection of gluten free items, all natural baby supplies, natural cleaning supplies, natural beauty supplies, as well as natural dog and cat foods & treats. \n\nOf course, due to their small size, their overall grocery selection is more limited than what you can find at Earthfare or HHM, but if you are in the area and just need to pick up a couple of staples, this is a nice option.
