Disappointing...both my husband's vindaloo (ordered spicey) and my aloo gobi were insipid.  The chai was not hot and not very tasty. The naan was dry. It was noisey and not the place to dine if you want to enjoy dinner conversation. They automatically added 20% tip to tab. Service was fair .. The pappadam were good.  No kheer on the menu.  Won't go back.
