Dr Haber was my hand surgeon and I have been very happy with him. His surgery went great and his PA is very nice as well. I have been to the tempe location twice, each in the morning. Parking has been plentiful each time I have been here. The first time I waited 10 mins, the second was only 5 minutes. \n\nCheck in staff has been nice and it has been a great, seamless process for me.
