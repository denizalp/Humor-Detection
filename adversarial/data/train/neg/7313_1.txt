Came here for a late lunch\/ early dinner.  Buffet is one of the best I have had. It was worth the $30 or so that I paid. I recommend this place.  Alaskan King Crab legs, Oysters, Kobe Sirloin Steaks, Desserts Galore. I ate so much food here and it all tasted great. The only complaint I have is that I prefer my Crab Legs to be warm, they are served cold at this buffet.
