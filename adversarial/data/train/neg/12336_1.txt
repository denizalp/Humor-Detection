Who knew that the spa experiences I've had would pale in comparison to this oasis in the desert?\n\nThe ambience is literally breathtaking and the massage therapists are extraordinary, especially Dinora (sp).  You can also order delicious meals and drinks poolside.\n\nAlso, there is a spa, hamam services, and deluge, which further pamper one's senses.\n\nOne of my favorite parts was the resting room that includes soft comfy beds you can collapse into and sleep on.\n\nAt the end, we picked up pretty rocks and placed them in the wishing well... a unique touch.
