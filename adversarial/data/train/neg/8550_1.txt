Tim was so easy to work with. We rented the photo booth for our schools 8th grade lock in. He was on time and set up on time. It was a hit at the party and the kids loved the unlimited pictures while he was there. There were tons of props to choose from!  Thanks Tim for being so accommodating and great with our group. We will all recommend you and hopefully use you again soon!
