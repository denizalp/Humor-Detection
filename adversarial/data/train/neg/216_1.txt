Along with the Cal, Main St caters to people from Hawaii, so there are going to be some local kine food associated with it.  This is probably the best buffet in the downtown area and is better than most buffets on the strip.  It is very reasonably priced as well.\n\nAlong with the typical American fare, the Hawaiian\/Asian specialties are a comfort for those from the Islands.  The Hawaiian specialties, although not the best you will find, is probably a touch better than you would find at your local L&L.  There is also a Mexican section and an Italian section.  The dessert selections are also pretty good.\n\nIf you find yourself Downtown, this is a great choice.
