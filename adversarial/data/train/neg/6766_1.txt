We were seated immediately but no one came to our table for over 15 minutes.   I had to go ask if a server was assigned to us at all.   Our order was finally taken.   Food was ok.  Not bad but not the best we've ever had.  We all ordered burgers & fries.   Beer selection was good but they were out of what we wanted.
