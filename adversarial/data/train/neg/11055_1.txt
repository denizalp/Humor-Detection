Really great experience here! Came here on St. Patrick's Day and it wasn't crowded at all when we got there, so we were able to get a table right away. Everything about this place was pretty great, especially the hookah itself. One thing that I will say is that it could be pretty pricy. We selected a hookah that was $16.99 and ordered two drinks (one each) and our bill came out to be just over $50. Unless our drinks were over $15 each, then I'd say that this place charges for coal replacements that we weren't told about. Not terrible between two people, but I really wish I knew how our bill came out to be that high.
