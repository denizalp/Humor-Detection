This CVS is one of the lesser customer service oriented pharmacies in Fort Mill. The waits time for prescription refills take a long time and the overall attitude is one of \"not my job\". The store isn't that clean and up to date. The hours for the pharmacy are short, so this is not a 24 hour location. Actually, there are few 24 hour pharmacies in the area so really no big deal. \n\nOverall, there are friendlier, cleaner, customer service oriented pharmacies around and I would definitely recommend those any day. However, there are certain products that may be on sale here and that's what keeps me coming back.
