Definitely get the urban\/metropolitan feel in this restaurant. I liked the presentation of food (my usual bag of crawfish and side of rice both served together in an industrial style bowl) but the flavors don't match up to the restaurant's other competitors. I originally wanted o rate just three stars but that wouldn't be fair to rate based solely on my preference. They earned an extra star for the unique drink menu (and of course the happy hour drink prices). You definitely don't see drinks like that on the menu of other Cajun inspired restaurants, but then again there's the urban inspired theme so to that!
