I had never been here before and I was really craving hibachi for lunch. I was really impressed with the variety of food they had. Like I always do when I go to a new place, I grabbed just a little bit of each of my favorite items. I was really excited about the hibachi. When I got to my table and started trying everything I was so disappointed. All of my normal buffet items tasted bad. The chicken on a stick was basically fat with a little meat on a stick, the shrimp in the hibachi was off. So much I spit it out. The whole time I was trying to eat, there were 3 waitresses standing about 3 feet from my table and pouncing on tables that had finished eating. I let my waitress know that the shrimp in the Hibachi was bad. She said she was sorry, left, and when she returned she had my check for $12. You could tell I didn't eat my food. I had a bit of pudding and a little piece of cake, with a Coke. Yep that was $12. No discount for a good portion of my food being discussing and uneatable. Needless to say... I told everyone I work with, everyone on my Facebook, about this place. Be wear... Do not have high expectations. Oh yeah, sushi... That's a joke. It was all fake crab combinations.
