This is in response to Suzan's comment. You never drop your car off at bowser, it's your job to take it to enterprise so someone there misinformed you. I've had to get rentals plenty of times through bowser and if it was a car through enterprise, it was my responsibility to return it. Plus I know a guy from enterprise and it doesn't work like that. You're responsible for the car no matter who is paying for it.
