Prologue:\nFollowing a truly wonderful New Years Eve performance by the Phoenix Symphony, my fiancee and I found ourselves in search of a nice place to have a late dinner.\nWe did not have any specific plans and, after spending a few minutes discussing our options, my fiancee suggested we have a look around downtown Chandler.\nAfter a stroll around Chandler Park we settled on this restaurant, which was more our style and, therefore, more inviting than most of the other establishments nearby.\n\n\nThe Plot:\nWe started by sharing a order of Onion Rings (primarily because I just happened to be in the mood).\nThat was followed by the Lobster & Turf entree, which consisted of a garden salad (with blue cheese dressing and crumbles), a broiled lobster tail, and 8oz filet mignon, thin cut french fries for my fiancee, and a baked potato for me.\n\n\nThe Scene:\nWe were delighted to be seated immediately upon arriving despite not having made reservations on New Years Eve.\nWe had a cozy side table for two fairly close to the front of the restaurant where it was less crowded and more comfortable.\nThe atmosphere was quite festive yet refined, rather than debaucherous, which made for a nice continuation of an evening that began at the symphony.\n\nService was quick, prompt, courteous, and plentiful.\n\nThe appetizer and salad were both very good, plenty for the two of us, and succeeded in getting us in the mood for our entree.\n\nThe portion sizes for the entree were perfect for us as well.\n\nWe ordered the steak medium rare, however and it was prepared closer to rare although not a bit bloody, which was perfectly fine with us because it was more tender and flavorful that way.\nThe lobster tail was nicely presented and properly seasoned for surf & turf.\n\nThe sides were both spot on with plenty of butter, sour cream, and chives for the baked potato.\n\nThe Rest of the Story:\nA standard up-charge was applied for sharing the entree, however it was well worth it because we were served considerably more food than a single diner would have been.\n\nThe lobster was just a little overcooked, however plenty of melted butter made up for it.\n\n\nEpilogue:\nMy perspective on New Years Eve dinner is that it is more of an experience than an meal and this restaurant delivered exactly what we were looking for that night.\n\nThe food on its own deserved 3 stars; however the availability of a table on short notice with no wait along with the great service warranted another star.
