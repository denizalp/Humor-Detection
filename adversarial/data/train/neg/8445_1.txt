Meh.  Met up with a few friends here and sat on the patio on a Saturday night around 8.  There are no heaters, which would be ok if it was a nice fall day or a summer night, but i was a bit cold towards the end.  There is indoor seating as well so this shouldn't be a deal breaker.  I ordered a few nice glasses of red, one pinot noir and one petite syrah.  I ordered the tuna salad and the bf ordered the grilled cheese.  It was just ok, and so was the service.  Our plates sat on the table for over 20 minutes after we were finished before they were cleared. Cute place, good music, not a huge variety on the menu, just salads and sandwiches.  I would likely go to humble pie next door next time while in the area which is how we spotted The Main Ingredient in the first place!
