This restaurant was extremely cool on the inside. My boyfriend and I went on a date here for an early two year anniversary dinner. We were staying at the Cosmopolitan and thought that this would be a fun start to our week of celebration :).\n\nWe order a very large array of food to kick off the excitement. My absolute favorite was the fish we ordered off their grilled menu. We could actually go to a seafood iced counter and pick our food. We chose the most glorious fish with the coolest presentation as you can see in the photo! \n\nThe only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is that they did our bill wrong .. but they did fix it.\n\n- Forever Foodie - Ela
