Best burger in Vegas! I wanted to try the banana dessert but we decided to share the burger and let me tell you that everything was housemade and delicious. They split it for us and it was plated nicely and cooked to a perfect juicy medium rare . The bread held up to the juiciness of the meat. The meat itself was good enough to eat alone . The condiments were all housemade and I was thoroughly satisfied although I wanted my own burger after eating that ! Will be back ;-)
