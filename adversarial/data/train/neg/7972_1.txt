Ate dinner at the Stone House tonight. It was our first visit and we took our young kids with. Food was very good-prime rib and lamb both cooked exactly as we asked. The homemade bread was excellent and the libations were well executed. Service was pretty good but she seemed overwhelmed at times. All in all a solidly good meal in beautiful ambience at Christmastime.
