I think this is an under estimated Nail salon. I remember coming here awhile back and today I went and was helped by Candy. She also did my nails the last time I was there but I'm not sure if she remembered me. I did the special that they have (shellac manicure and pedicure $45.00) and she helped me right away. Her aura is very friendly and cute. I like the way she filed my toes and she gave me a compliment with the choice of color. \n\nI had a colour picked out for the shellac but changed my mind last minute. I picked up a bottle w a color I thought I would like but she gave me the colour nail wheel and showed me how it really looks. Good thing she showed me because I changed my mind again lol. \n\nShes very careful doing the nails and makes sure to wipe off nail polish that got outside the nail. She even made sure I was satisfied with the coating in which I answered one more.\n\nThis place is in the same plaza as sunrise caribbean and dollarama. \n\nAlthough the salon is clean and well kept, I noticed they reuse the tin foil that they wrap around your finger to take the shellac off. \n\nI will still come here again because the price is decent and the service is great!
