Went to Milos in Vegas as a buddy of mine was recommended to go if in Vegas. Apps were great octopus& sashimi were delicious . The bread basket was weak just regular bread that was toasted on a grill that was burnt on the edges. Entrees were 2.5 lb lobster and lamb chops . Both were very good. The reason for 3 stars is due to the subpar service . The waiter staff helping us was not friendly and seemed uninterested in their jobs. They were no fun and although we went at 9pm they were ready to rush us out of there . Food great , service horrible. I should of complained to the manager on how terrible the service was.
