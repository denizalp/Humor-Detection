The halls look like the halls from Inception (but apparently they're not)! The suite was nice. The pool was nice. LOVE Evening Call downstairs near the casino. \n\nDON'T love how far it is from everything!! I had to walk here from CVS in the summer and I wanted to die. We even took the Excalibur to Mandalay Bay tram and I still thought it was far. Maybe because it was like 100 degrees... But even still, ugh. Too much walking. Too many taxis. Still a nice place to stay though
