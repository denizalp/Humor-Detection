Wow! Such an old \"Vegas\" atmosphere with excellent food, service and vibe! Salads are awesome and BIG! Saved this Vegas landmark meal for last, best one this trip! There are so many mediocre, overpriced strip restaurants, but this one is tops fit salads, breakfast and burgers! Casual but swanky and fun! Ask for Al at the counter! It's all yummy!
