My husband and I are so thankful to have found this clinic. I honestly feel like all of the doctors and staff genuinely care about the animals. We have been taking our chocolate lab Silas Jones there ever since he was a puppy. They are always really caring a patient with us. Silas is a chocolate lab so it's hard to keep him calm in any instance.
