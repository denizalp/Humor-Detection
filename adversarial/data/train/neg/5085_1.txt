This was an amazing meal. My wife and I left so happy.\nWe sat down our waiter was so friendly and nice.\nWe ordered the meatballs and A salad.\n The presentation on the dish was amazing. And it tasted amazing.\nSo main course I did the rack of lamb ... Christ this was the best lamb I've had in a very long time it was just perfect and melted in my mouth. \nIt was on bed of veggies and finger potatoes. My wife had the BURRATA AGNOLOTTI I wrote it like that because it was remarkable! And just she loved it and even took the bread to soak up the sauce which is unlike her. \nWe had an after dinner drink and expresso. \nShe did the 3 scoops of ice cream. Her face when she tried the strawberry was priceless \" you havta try this now\"  and it was amazing the ice cream.\nI did the tiramisu which was a huge piece. I could barely finish. \nBetween the waitstaff and the food it was perfect! \nAnd the cost wasn't to bad for what we ate and for the quality.
