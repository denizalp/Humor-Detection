I wasn't sure if my last review went through. I called and got a quote over the phone and the price never changed and there were no hidden fees. Carlton showed up early this morning even though I called last minute and got to work. We have toddlers and our carpets were terrible. He stayed for hours until every stain including chocolate milk, heavily soiled traffic areas, and even lipstick was removed. Very nice guy and very thorough with his work. Looks better now than when we first moved in. Best price I found in the area too. Awesome company ill definitely use again next time.
