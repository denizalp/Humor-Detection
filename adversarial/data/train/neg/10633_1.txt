Sequoya is an amazing school community, where teachers, parents, and the administration all work together to create the best possible well rounded experiences for our children. Students are given incredible experiences to learn and grow. My kids have thrived here and we couldn't be happier. Teachers and the administration are always accessible and receptive to discuss our children's needs. The school also has amazing technology, leadership opportunities, lessons in responsibility, great academics and a general small town community feel... and a rock climbing wall for PE - making it super cool!!! And best of all - it's a public school!
