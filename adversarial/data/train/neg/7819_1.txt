Gimme Some Sugar designed and made my wedding cake and it did not disappoint. I was a destination bride so everything was done via email and I couldn't be happier with the service and the cake. They sketched several designs based on very few ideas that I provided and they got it spot on. When I finally saw the cake I couldn't believe how great it looked and found that it tasted even better. The flavor combinations they offer are spectacular, we went with the chocolate-raspberry and my guests are still talking about it. I would recommend Gimme Some Sugar to anyone looking for a custom cake, they really made my vision a reality and I couldn't be happier.
