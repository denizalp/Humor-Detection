Really enjoyed my meal here, will definitely be back.  Most flavorful pho broth I've ever tasted, a rich yellow color, and piping hot.  It was not too oily at all, a very light broth with a light amount of natural fat.  That little bit of oil is FLAVOR, it's a good thing, and fat is very healthy for you.  But this is nothing like ramen broth, so if you hate heavy broth, don't worry.  It is a good level of salty, too, so remember to drink lots of water for the rest of the day.\n\nWay more meat than I expected, too, very happy about that.  I was actually unable to finish my bowl, the size is huge.  My husband couldn't finish either.  I was full for hours.  By the way, a pot of tea is complimentary.  Service is fast and friendly.\n\nAlthough it was empty when we first got in for early lunch, it was super slammed, with people waiting for tables, when we left, so if you're in a hurry you may want to time your visit at an off-hour.
