First time here, thought the decor and theme was very fun. The atmosphere was great too. We all enjoyed our food very much, very flavorful and lots to choose from. \n\nHOWEVER... service----- SLOW SLOW SLOWWWWWW!!! Hence, the 3 star review. What's the deal!!??!! The waiter was nice but very forgetful. Drinks seemed to take a very long time. The drinks were in my opinion overpriced.. this isn't the strip, it's freakin Summerlin.. why do we have to price gouge the locals? My Jack Daniels and water was somewhere around $20. Come on! \n\nMy grilled salmon was absolutely delicious. It was $21 but it was worth it. My friends enjoyed the deviled egg appetizers and tater tots. Again, food was very good but service, they need to improve. Couldn't tell if it was the waiter, the kitchen, the bar or all of the above that made everything seem so slow. Not sure that I will come back anytime soon.
