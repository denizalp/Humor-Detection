I generally am disappointed by the quality of food in the Pittsburgh area but I have found North hills little hidden gem. Great fresh food.  I have eaten here numerous times so far and am very impressed. Nothing I have had is frozen or from a bag. I love their steak sandwich. I was shocked to find it was real steak. I have also had their crab cake sandwich. It had lots of crab and very little filler. Delicious!!! Their salads are very fresh and not lacking in the taste department. I would def recommend this place for a good bite to eat. Serving sizes are huge and prices are very reasonable for what you get too!
