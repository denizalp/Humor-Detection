The new Thai River Noodles are a must try! I like the fact that Pei Wei is a less expensive version of PF Changs. Is it Americanized Asian food? Most definitely, but I still like it. The crab won-tons have real crab and are served in a very flavorful sweet and spicy sauce. The fried rice is deliciously fresh with chunks of fresh al dente veggies in it. The new Thai River noodles are my current fave. It is sort of like Pad See Ewe with chow fun noodles instead. The beer is always ice cold and the prices are very reasonable.
