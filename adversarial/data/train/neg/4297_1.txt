30 Years in fine dining and Milos proved to me, once again, that great food is about the quality of ingredients. Here the ingredient is the star. The Olive Oil they used was extraordinary, the fish as good as if it was caught right there. I actually think it was one of the best prepared pieces of fish I have had anywhere in years. We did a 3 course lunch that is only $20.12 and I would have paid 3 times that and not felt ripped off. This is UNDOUBTEDLY the best lunch value on the strip period! This restaurant which specializes in fish is worth running to. With all the talk today about local and farm to table it truly proved to me that what matters is the ingredients and the hand that prepares them. From our servers who helped us supplement our menu with some spectacular choices to our manager, Kirk Perry, every thing about this meal was stellar. By the way the room is simply stunning as well..\nMickey B\nCharleston SC
