Had a root canal with Dr. Pace.  He spent quite a bit of time doing various tests ahead of time to ensure that it was the correct tooth that I was having pain on since the xray didn't show my problem.  I was comforted when he said, \" I want to be sure that we don't do anything that won't help you and I want to be sure we get to the exact area of the problem.\"  The root canal wasn't much different than a filling.  Took while but no pain.  Was very impressed with the office and the Dr. Had my root canal today and numbness is worn off and didn't even fill pain prescription as Ibprofen is good enough.
