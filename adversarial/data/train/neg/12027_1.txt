NASCAR is my husband's thing not mine. This was my first and last race. That being said it was nice enough; the event seemed pretty family and fan friendly. Several options for food, pricey but most sporting events over charge for their concessions expect to spend about $15-20 per person if you purchase a drink, something to eat, some chips and maybe something sweet. On the bright side you can bring in a soft-sided 14\" x 14\" x 14\" cooler and lots of plastic bottled beverages and your own food. Noise reducing headphones are definitely needed if you want to save your hearing. Do yourself a favor and pay to park otherwise leave early or it can take 40-60 minutes to get out of general parking.
