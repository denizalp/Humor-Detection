I don't typically leave, or feel the need to leave reviews when I head out for drinks with some friends, but felt compelled to after my experience last night. \n\nA group of friends and I stopped in to Local after leaving a concert, and apparently everyone else had the same idea as us. The room was packed on a saturday! Not seeing an open table in sight, we ventured to the bar, which was completely surrounded. We started to chat about heading elsewhere, since the team behind the bar were moving fast, but had many other customers to get to. \n\nA bartender with LOCAL written on his shirt noticed us, while making what looked like 20 different cocktails going out to tables, waved us over, and took our groups order while continuing to make other drinks. While making our drinks, another bartender promptly brought over our bill, just in time for all of our drinks to be ready to go. I usually don't get service that fast at any bar, let alone one that is packed shoulder to shoulder.\n\nTo sum it up, polite and friendly staff, great atmosphere, clean (for a pub), and one of the better margarita's I've had in a long time. Thanks LOCAL, will be back.!
