Absolutely loved this place!! We visited 2 locations while on vacation in AZ and wished I could've gone every day. Awesome selection ,wanted to try everything.\nI had the superfood salad at this location and it was amazing!! My daughter tried the mixed grill sandwich and it was really good too. We tried the layered chocolate cake and strawberry rhubarb pie and loved them both. Puts panera to shame...Please come to Florida!!!!
