We've always been there on a Sunday so we were hoping that Saturday dim sum would be less busy. No such luck. We were surprised that some of the dishes were cold because it was so packed; I could understand if it was empty and the carts weren't circulating but every table was full. It took a while to get drinks and other items (napkins). The dishes were not of the same quality as they had been on other visits, but they were acceptable.
