We have done several escape rooms before and this one was ridiculously hard.  It was so difficult to the point where it was more frustrating then fun. Part of the room malfunctioned and the employees didn't assist us till we were stuck for near 10 mins! You get 3 hints and when you need them you have to wait.  It's almost as if they are distracted and are not attentive to your room when you need help. The guy who assisted us out said we did \"a really great job\" because the over all percentage of people that complete the room successfully was \"south of 4%\".  If a room has that poor of a success rate, they need to reevaluate the room! I recommend escape the room, especially if this is your first time. Much more doable and they are quick to help if you get stuck.  Bad experience.  The employee also told us the other room was more difficult and the success rate was less than 3%.  Needless to say, we won't be back for the other room.
