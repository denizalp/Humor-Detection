You've changed bro...first thing I thought when I walked in after not going for about a year. \n\nThis placed is rammed, the service is iffy at best and the dim sum is just meh...it's not uncommon to see diners get up out of their chair and walk over to a cart with their dim sum sheet, grab food off the trolley and force the server to sign their bill. Friggin chaos and mayhem. \n\nThey either need better staff, or more staff. Something's got to change. \n\nI grew up eating dim sum and as far as the food is concerned, the selection is sparse and slow coming. We were there for about an hour and a half and saw the same thing over and over again. We paid our bill only for a variety to start coming out the kitchen. \n\nThe reason for the 3\/5 is the hot sauce. I know it's a weird way to rank a restaurant but it's THAT good. \n\nI'd only go back if I was forced.
