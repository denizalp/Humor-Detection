I've lived in the area for 20 years and just went in today. Pissed off at myself for not eating here while growing up. Great chicken sandwich and because I skipped lunch I bought a Hungarian salami sandwich (I Mean you're not going t buy Genoa salami at a Hungarian joint right? Chicken was a cutlet and hot and delicious. the mustard was different and definitely of European style.\n\nI also bought a raspberry flavoured soda drink called Marka which was nice. Ibought a salad with two full eggs on it and enjoyed that too. I'll definitely go back to try some other hot table options and I like how they carry European chocolates that you don't see except in Roncesvalles or Polish Mississauga.
