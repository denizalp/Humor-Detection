Still paying for the furniture -- after reading other reviews it appears Mor Furniture's extended warranties are worthless and that they definitely do not stand behind their products. May I suggest choosing Sam's Club or Costco to purchase furniture?  They sell for Mor better quality for Mor Less :)  ... as of 4\/2018  furniture is just getting worse and worse.  Leather is peeling despite our best efforts to rarely use this furniture.  Giving up and going to American Furniture Warehouse (great furniture by the way) Or Sam's Club.  Because at least they will stand by what they sell.
