Great food & drinks, service was a little slow but it was worth the wait. They have a huge selection on the menu. I had the lettuce wraps...very good! My friend had one of the burgers & they said it was amazing. Good sized portions for the price. We will definitely hit this place on our next visit to Vegas.
