I have dark brown asian hair with medium-fine texture. It's all virgin and it goes down to my mid back. I booked with Jessica and we went with beige blonde babylights while leaving my roots natural. The process took 3.5 hours from beginning to end - foils, wash, tone, wash, blow dry and style. \n\nI am thrilled with the overall experience and outcome. I knew I'd go lighter but was still surprised at how light Jessica was able to get me! The cost of everything was $280 before tips. I expected this price - you get what you pay for: assurance and quality! Everyone was very friendly and Lisa is very personal and attentive, despite being the owner. She walked by and saw some colour on my face and wiped it off for me, asked me if I wanted a refill for my tea and more.\n\nNotes\/recommendations:\n- shop for your shampoos (Jessica recommended: Loreal silver shampoo, Joico purple shampoo and Shimmer lights purple shampoo...but keep in mind I am not trying to maintain grey hair. If you're going grey, go with Fanola purple shampoo) before your appointment so that you're not scrambling afterwards.\n- Buy a wet brush! (the brand \"Wet brush Pro\" is amazing) And buy a detangler. I was quite surprised how tangled my hair became when it got wet, despite it being quite smooth when dry. \n- Buy your shampoos and brushes from Winners..they have an abundance of Joico products and they are the cheapest. \n- Maintaining your hair will be $$ and effort! Products alone could add up to another $100
