I am torn on this late night pizza joint. Great pizza, but absolutely the worst service I have experienced in a long time. Not only was the staff unable to correctly do their job, but they were rude to the customers and to each other. A supervisor ran around the restaurant screaming at customers about last call acting as if his paying customers were nuisances. His staff behind the counter talked about him and the customers while cursing as if no one could hear. After a staff member screwed up my order, she screamed at me that I was to blame and she was too busy to help and it wasn't her problem. Her supervisor did not help the situation. \n\nNeedless to say, I am happy that I do not frequent Charlotte enough to be tempted by their great pizza as I refuse to give them another one of my hard earned dollars due to their awful service. Suggestions: Clean up your unprofessional and rude staff!!
