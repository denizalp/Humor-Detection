I'm definitely a fan of this place! It's a little bit further away from the capital that I would like, but thats part of the charm. Located on the bottom floor of a new apartment complex is Stone Creek coffee. it has the aesthetics of a hipster coffee shop, but with a modern twist. The space is open like an art gallery but also packed like a museum. I loved it. \n\nThe wifi is great, the soy lattes are good, and the staff is super friendly. what more could you ask from a coffee shop?!\n\nhappy studying\/working\/afternoon pickmeup session-ing
