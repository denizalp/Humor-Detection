These donuts are great! I have gone twice now to try out multiple items on the menu to get a feel as to what is good here. I tried the apple fritter, maple bacon, strawberry and cream croissant donut, and chocolate custard or cream filled (don't really know which one it was). All of which were great. Came in for my first visit and they were out of a lot and found out that they make fresh to order and so I got a few like that. The donuts are good. They are the best local donuts near where I live so I don't have to drive far. I think I enjoyed the cream filled one the most. The fritter was a bit to doughy to my liking. I'm more of a crisp fritter kind of guy. But all that to say that you should try this place out since they are new in town and it is good here. I also will try their breakfast at some point.
