I have unremarkable hair. It's thin and straight and the natural color can only be described as blah. But Allison designed a cut that's cute, flattering and easy to style. When she was done the first time I went in I told her \"this is the cut I want for the rest of my life.\" \nHer balayage skills are on point too. She takes the time to chat and make sure she's giving you what you want and then works her magic until you walk out feeling like a million bucks. Highly recommend.
