I went to the Everyday noodle last night with my boyfriend and my other friends. The restaurant was packed and we had to line up for tables. We thought the food should be good since it is a new place, and I have already heard a lot of people talking about it before I decided to go and try. \n\nMost of the people kind of go there to have the soup dumplings, which made us looking forward a lot to have that. There was a big window at the entrance, in which the chefs were showing how to make noodles. It looks fun and interesting, and which makes the place very \"sexy\". \n\nWe ordered jellyfish and beef tender. The half of the dish of the jellyfish was cabbage. I could say the jellyfish I make at home is way much better than that. Then, we tried the soup dumplings. Actually, there is no soup in the dumpling, and the meat in the dumpling is too smashed. I was very disappointed. The taste was only so so. \n\nMy friend ordered a Wonton Men. It tasted like only wontons,noodles and oil. The Wonton Men tasted very BLAND, and my friend could not even continue to eat that after her first bite. My boyfriend ordered beef tender noodle, which has the broth came out with it. The broth was okay, but the noodles tasted not like the noodle made by hand. It tasted like INSTANT NOODLE instead. \n\nThe service was good though. The owner of the restaurant was very nice. He brought the food out to us and explained everything. The decoration is cool, but the tables and seats are all fixed and settled on the floor. They could not be moved, so it' was very hard for us to sit in.
