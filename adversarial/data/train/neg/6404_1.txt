Let's get over ourselves.\n\nThe decor achieves a warm and cozy ambience, however if you look at it a little closer you'll see that it's all a little tacky and almost homely. \n\nAs far as downtown Chandler goes, they attract less riff raff however if I didn't live so close I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.
