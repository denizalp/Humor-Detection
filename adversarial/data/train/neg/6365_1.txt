I stopped in with my partner for dinner recently before going to a retro 80's concert that Mandalay Bay was hosting. Having dined here once before, I was looking forward to coming back. The first experience was fantastic. This latest visit though was a disappointment. \n\nWe ordered the Empanada's as a starter, and they were amazing. Full of flavor, the filling had a soft, almost delicate texture while the outside had wonderful color!\n\nFor mains, my partner and I both ordered the chicken enchiladas. I suspected from the moment that the server put them in front of us that they had died in the window, and I was right. Only a couple of bites in and it was clear --they were stone cold and flavorless. I called the waitress over, and she apologized and offered to have them remade. But, as I mentioned, we were on our way to a concert and now didn't have time for that --even though we had sat down to eat an hour before the show. She offered to talk to her manager to see what could be done, and I truly believe that she was as disappointed in the situation as we were. \n\nWhen the bill came, the manager, who never came over to the table to either apologize or inform us as to how he was making things right, had deducted a meager 15% from the check --a nominal fix for what was for us a huge and unnecessary disappointment.  This could've been prevented so easily: First, by whomever was expediting at the pass (assuming that anyone was), and second, by the server. If I can see that the food has died even before my plate hits the table, they can too. \n\nI now have a better understanding of why, for so many years, I've seen Gordon Ramsay and other highly accomplished chef's push their teams as hard and as constantly as they do --standards, standards, standards. If that was the chef and\/or server on my plate, then the chef and\/or server didn't really seem to care about what they were serving me. They were just cranking it out, and I was next in line.  What a shame.\n\nI won't hurry back.\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nThe manager has reached out to me personally in response to this review, and I greatly appreciate her earnest, professional and thoughtful follow-up. I will be giving the Border Grill another try based on this. Happy to do so. I've also updated my review from two to four stars to reflect this outreach. Thank you, Border Grill, for your response.
