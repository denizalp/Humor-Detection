My dogs needed a groomer while we were in Phoenix and I found Doggie Doo's. The shop was clean; staff friendly and after a brief discussion left my dogs with confidence.  Both dogs were expertly groomed by competent, friendly staff in just under 3 hours as promised. If I lived in the area I would make this a permanent spa date for the dogs. Fair price and quality service - can't beat that!\n\nWell Done!
