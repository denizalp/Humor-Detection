STAY AWAY! Ifinity Hospice is a JOKE! I read a review of one woman who believes her mother was overdosed and I can believe that as well! My friend had been with Infinity for almost a year. In that time, her husband left her and she had to find a new place to live. Charlie, her social worker, does NOT know what her job entails! She was asked repeatedly to help find a group home or facility to which my friend could go. Charlie tells her that there are at least 30 places in the Las Vegas area which she could check out and that she should go online and do a google search for them. This is Charlie's job! When asked for a list of these 30 places, she was given ONE. Really? One place? That's all she could find? Time was of the essence and she needed to get out of her marital home ASAP. She ended up moving in with a friend, still expecting Charlie's help. There was NONE. During the time she was living with her friend, she had checked herself into the Infinty IPU twice. They had tried to overdose her also! Plus, they tried to give her another patient's meds! It's a good thing that she was very alert and knew what she was to be taking. The nurses were argumentative not only on this issue, but others as well. They sent her home without resolving the issue for which she went in. Infinty eventually discharged her and told her she needed to find another hospice to care for her, or hire a full time nurse. Who can afford that? Within a month of being with another hospice company, they not only found several group homes, but one that could take her immediately! That's what a social worker is supposed to do, Charlie! Not just go around and visit people!                             The CNA that she had has NO concept of the privacy act! She spoke of other patients and their issues ALL THE TIME! There is also speculation as to whether she fully relayed issues with the nurse. The nurse would not look at wounds that she repeatedly spoke of and wanted them looked at! The CNA director (not sure of her title) would consistently LIE about things and encouraged her staff to do the same. This we know of because of the CNA. AND her CNA would become involved in her homelife business. She was always interfering with what was going on in the home! This is NOT a company that I would recommend to anyone! Please, save yourselves the hassle and heartache!
