This is a small coffee shop, they do like to have their music a bit loud. Maybe because there's not that many people here? It's an OK place. I ordered a dark chocolate ice blended since it's my favorite drink at any coffee shop, it's lack of taste here. I couldn't drink it even after I tried fixing it. Maybe I'll get something else next time? The service is ok. That's why I give a 4 start.
