This place has been a great experience thus far.  I have only been there a handful of times, but on each of those occasions, the food has been wonderful, and the staff somehow manages to keep on top of things with a positive attitude even with the large size and crowds that Hollander commands.  I've also only just begun to explore their vast beer selection, but for the few I have tried, I have not been disappointed.   There are some minor downsides to this place (patio furniture seating in some sections due to the style and atmosphere of the place) and high noise level, but overall, eating at Hollander Cafe is an enjoyable and recommended experience.
