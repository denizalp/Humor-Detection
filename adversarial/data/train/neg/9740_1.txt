I have stayed at the Hyatt Place Tempe several times in the last year and was quite happy.  I recently was at the hotel last week and left my retainers in a cup.  After coming home I realized they were missing. I took a chance by calling the hotel, just in case housekeeping turned them in. So grateful to the staff for sending them back to me.  \nDaniel at ihefront desk was so kind and walked me through the proper paperwork to get a shipping label, so he can send off my retainers. 2 Days later and they are back with me!!  A plus to housekeeping and Daniel!!!!!!
