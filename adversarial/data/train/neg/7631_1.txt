Well as promised, I went back and made a purchase. I walked in earlier in the day and asked about 35 questions about the G19, then walked out with nothing in my hands. Again, zero attitude, great service and extremely friendly. I went home and was going to spend some time shopping around until I was sure that I found the lowest price and then I came to my senses. Spartan Arms prices are very competitive AND you get customer service free of charge. Drove back over and made the purchase. Local people like this deserve the support. BUY HERE.
