I am still speechless.  Just called to cancel my service starting in January and when I stated I was changing providers and did not have time to go into why, the customer service representative yelled at me saying, \"fine, your service is cancelled\" and hung up on me.  I called back to speak to a supervisor and verify my service to be cancelled starting January and to finish asking my other questions.  In speaking with the supervisor, it turns out that the initial service rep who hung up on me had also cancelled my service starting today.  Goodness...
