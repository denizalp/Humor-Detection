A Phoenix tradition sine 1930 so how bad can it be????   Outstanding sticky buns and wonderful outdoor seating with plenty of umbrellas and heaters along with views of Camelback mtn.  couple of items they have  changed that they need to change back.  bring back the relish tray and put the french fried lobster back on the menu as an entree and not as an appetizer served as lobster  fried nuggets.  Places come and go in Phoenix but there is comfort in the tradition of El Choro.
