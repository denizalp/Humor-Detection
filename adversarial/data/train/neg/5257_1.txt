I found Pink Cherry through Yelp and I'm so glad I did. I needed to get my eyebrows done and it had been awhile since I had gotten them done so I figured I would be in and out of there quickly. But from the moment I walked in I knew I would be taken care of and that they valued their customers. The waiting area is super cute and very inviting with refreshments and comfy couches. They even have coloring books for kids which with two girls in tow was so helpful! The room I was in was even cuter. Whitney did my eyebrows and she was awesome. So easy to talk to and listened to what I was looking for. In all my years of having my eyebrows done no one as taken the time to shape them and clean them up. She even dressed them up which I've never had done. I felt very pretty and ready to show them off. And a few days later I received a call from them asking how I was doing which was very sweet. I know I will be a customer from here on out. Thank you again!!!
