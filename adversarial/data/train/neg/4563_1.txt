Placed an order at 731 pm for delivery online and at\n840 pm  called to find out why it was not delivered. Guy on the phone stated that the reason for the delay was the traffic was so bad that from they \"just left\". 40 minutes later after no delivery yet I called again and the lady stated holding her laughter stated it was delivered to another apartment and stated that I put the wrong address. One thing is I know both were lying and the only two things saved it was the manager that called me saying the driver assigned to deliver went home with an apology and the food came hot. Food for thought. Don't lie to your customers when they live a mile and a half from you because worse advertising you can have is an upset customer.
