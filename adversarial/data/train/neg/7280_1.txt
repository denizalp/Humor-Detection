This Rosati's pizza lacked the quality I've had at other Rosati's pizza. They overcooked it and it had a slightly charred flavor to it, both times I went to this place. The customer service was poor both times because I felt rushed and the employees did not care to help me and seemed like they would rather be someplace else. I'm not saying all Rosati's are bad because I also frequent the Rosati's at 28th and Thunderbird, and it is fantastic compared to this one (Both in customer service and food).
