I started with Carla & Angelo a few years ago when they were sponsoring the well being fair where I work. I was looking into decompression therapy to help me with my low back issues. Everyone has been so helpful and friendly with me, I consider them family. Even with the pet names, Al is a wonderful asset to the team. He puts you at ease and makes sure that all billing processes are handled quickly and efficiently.\n\nI must say that if I hadn't run into these folks, I would be going around life in a wheelchair. These people, from their wonderful massueses (Aimee) to the confident care Carla & Angelo provide for their patients, are truly a unique type of service. You are not treated like a number, but as a valued patient.
