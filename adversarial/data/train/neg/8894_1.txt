Green Pepper is a casual Korean restaurant. That being said, the food is pretty simple but yummy, and the service is decent, but not great. The price point is just about right. This place could be compared to Oishii Bento in Oakland, not to Sushi Kim. \n\nOver all, I really liked the place.  My biggest complaint about most Korean restaurants in Pittsburgh is the cheesy and shabby looking  interior. Unlike most other places, this place is very  neat, cute, and looks more like a cafe, not a traditional Korean restaurant. \n\nI had Dolsot Bibimbop (mixed rice in a stone bowl) and it was really great. Highly recommend it.
