Great food! Service was fantastic! I had reservation and was running behind due to traffic. We told our server that we were in a time crunch because we were headed to the  symphony and she made sure we got our meals quickly. Oysters are great! Sea Bass was delicious! We also ordered the Green chile short rib stew was good, but not enough meat. Highly recommend making reservations. They are busy!
