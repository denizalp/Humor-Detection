I tried Uber for the first time yesterday.\n\nThe app failed to I work. It wasn't me, I checked with people who use Uber and nobody could figure it out. The app would not let me request service. Search for LAX bought up no results. Tried airport... Still no results. Meanwhile the app showed me many Uber cars zipping by.\n\nCalled the support number. No support... Just said send email. I sent email... But no reply.  \n\nNeeded to get taxi and fortunately made mutt flight.\n\nStill no reply to initial email or subsequent emails.\n\nVery surprised at poor service.
