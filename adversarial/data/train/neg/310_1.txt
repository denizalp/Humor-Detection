This is a real gem in a very bland plaza. The signage isn't going to draw you in it might be hard to see from the road. But if you come here, I can guarantee you some good fried chicken.\n\nI'm sure you've all tried fried chicken in one from or another. This is fried chicken with a Taiwanese twist. It's delicious and reasonably priced. And I really like drinking bubble tea with fried chicken. It somewhat negates that greasy feeling you get from eating fried chicken.\n\nAs a comparison, Koo Koo's chicken is made fresh. I presume this means they season and batter it in house. They have a sign that they take up to 20 mins to prepare, which in my opinion is well worth the wait. Whereas most franchises out there probably do it assembly line style. You can really taste the tenderness of the chicken. Best part of all is that it's relatively less greasy than KFC or Popeyes. \n\nTheir batter isn't just batter. It's not quite as crispy as Popeyes but it's more savory. And the tables have various spices like lemon powder, curry, and even plum that you can add to your chicken\/fries. \n\nThe menu choices are excellent. They know many of the more \"traditional\" people don't like fried chicken so they have many Taiwanese dishes like 3 cups chicken and beef noodles. But of course, you want to come here for the chicken as that's what they specialize in. You can get individual pieces or get a combo which includes fries + bubble tea. \n\nPortion wise, the chicken steak is perfect. The #4 combo is worth it as it comes with 3 baskets of chicken steaks! It can possibly feed 3. They call it \"steak\" but actually a few pieces will have bones which is not a big deal for me. Just letting you know. \n\nI'd totally come again. In fact, I need to make an excuse to come here again. I've never had such fresh tasting fried chicken.
