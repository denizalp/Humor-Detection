Really good pizza and apps.  Great service in very cool little \"neighborhood\".  Only complaint is decor is a little sterile.  Tables and chairs have a cafeteria feel to them.  You've gone this far guys, make the place cozy and maybe a little romantic?  Just my 2 cents.  Pizza is a solid 3 1\/2, round up to 4 for the great service.
