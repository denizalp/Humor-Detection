The office could have had better communication. We had to call back and get a confirmation, they switched the pick up and drop off locations, and didn't call to confirm like they said they would.\nHowever, day of the move everything went wonderfully. Moses, Jordan, and James were wonderful, they were speedy yet careful. I would definitely recommend them!
