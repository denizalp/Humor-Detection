This library gets all 5 stars (which I don't know that I've ever handed out to any establishment in the past) for their friendly staff, prompt service, and comfortable atmosphere. Simple as that. For a small library (I moved here from Chicago so I imagine any library would seem small to me...) they seem to have a reasonable mix of genres and the staff does a wonderful job staying on top of \"Holds\" placed online. I don't have kids, but this library offers kid friendly movie viewings and there are several other activity postings to be found there as well. I'm happy to have moved to this area of Madison so I can visit this branch often and always get a smile from the staff behind the desk.
