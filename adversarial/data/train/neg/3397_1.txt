This waiting room is by far the worst I've ever been to. Staff is rude and has attitude, personal questions are asked loudly (social security, personal information). I even heard staff ask a young woman loudly if she's ever had any abortions or miscarriages. Waiting times are extremely long. Charged 150 for a consultation to show the doctor results I already knew the recommendation for....\nHorrible experience.\nNever ever ever go to Becky Gonzales. How she completed medical school I don't know-she gave me incorrect information and was rude. No bedside manner. \nSwitched to dr knapp-so far other than the aforementioned she has been ok.
