This practice is awesome! Dr. Racanelli is fabulous, friendly, detail oriented and a perfectionist when it comes to your dental work. The office itself is beautiful and there is complimentary coffee and water. The dental assistants are personable and helpful. I informed them that I do not and will not floss (yes, I know) and they did not judge me. They told me about waterpicks, asked if a reach flosser would help, etc. I got the waterpick and know that it will help my pockets improve. \nMy husband is going to have major work done in the next month. They worked with our insurance and gave a fair estimate and told us all the options available. Also, it's so cute how after work, they give you scented towels on a bamboo plate so you can freshen up. Worth the drive.\n\nUpdate: My husband's work is awesome! We appreciate that Dr. Racanelli always gives a personal call to check on us after fillings, extractions etc. He even helped us find a good special needs dentist for our son. Also, it is so close to the new IKEA- have taken advantage of that!
