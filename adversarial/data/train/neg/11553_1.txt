Was there 3 months ago and had horrible service. It took forever to get our food then when it finally came it was not only wrong but cold. The manager apologized and comped most of the meal. We went back tonight and had another bad experience. We got our drinks and appetizer without a problem but then sat for over 30 mins waiting for our food. The waitress came over and said they had been having kitchen trouble all day but it would be out in 2 mins. 3 mins later she sits down at another customers table chatting with them. Another lady came over and apologized and said our food should be coming. I told her it had been over 30 mins and the waitress told us 2 mins 3mins ago. She assured me it was coming and another few mins went by before our food came. Everything was cold. The fries seemed like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time and the cheeseburgers were stone cold. I had my 2 and 4 year old children with me who were out of patience and hungry. I told the waitress after waiting that long and then getting cold food we were leaving and not paying. She rolled her eyes at me. The waitress was Francis. I am disappointed and we will not be returning.
