The food is good here but it looks like new management has taken over and the portions are quite small. I ordered a rice bowl and there were about 4 or 5 small pieces of tofu and like two tablespoons of rice. I was ready to have another bowl when I got done eating the first one I paid over $10 for. My husband and I were very disappointed and we will never go back there again. They are way too stingy with their portions. Total rip-off.
