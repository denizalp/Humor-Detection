I was really happy with his place. Another small hole in the wall with a very friendly wait staff and cozy atmosphere. \nI got the Alaskan crepe which had spinach, smoked salmon, and an herb cream cheese. The salmon tasted very good and the cream cheese appeared whipped as it was smooth and airy. The crepe also came with a small salad on the side. The greens were a spring mix with slices of apple and a light vu egrets on it. It went really well with the dish\nI also split a dessert crepe that was covered in nuts, filled with Brie, and had maple syrup in it. I thought it was equally as good as the Alaskan crepe.\nThe menu is loaded with sweet and savory crepes. If you don't find something you like, you can make your own. I really enjoyed running into a spot that is clearly not your everyday spot. Pittsburgh isn't really a hot bed for crepes. If you want something different, I'd suggest it as definitely being worth a shot.
