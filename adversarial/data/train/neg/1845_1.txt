Our experience with Darlene was delightful.  Once we told her our theme and chose our flavors\/fillings, we gave her free reign in the design. She did not disappoint!  Not only was it spectacular, not to mention one of the best tasting cakes I've eaten, she actually attended our reception and took care of cutting and serving it as well.  It just doesn't get much better than that. Thanks Darlene, you were a hit all around!
