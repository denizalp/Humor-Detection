Went to this restaurant to celebrate a friends birthday. Ordered both the Beef Tenderloin and Bison. The restaurant was clean and the ambience was fun although very expensive. We overall initially enjoyed the dinner.\n\nAfter dinner, all members of our parties started to feel ill. 24hours later after a horrible night of fever and chills with vomiting and diarrhea we contacted the establishment of food poisoning. \n\nNo response was given from Management. After spending over $50 per person we expected healthy clean meats. We were mistaken. I'd be weary of anyone thinking of going to this place. There are much better options in the area.
