This is my favorite place to stay in Vegas!! The suites are amazing!! Very clean and quiet rooms, spacious with spa tubs, shower, vanity, gorgeous view, and bathrobes and slippers. Best pools in Vegas, with outdoor running path, plus spa, restaurants, etc. Fabulous customer service and prices are reasonable for such a nice hotel. Tram is available for transportation to other hotels which makes it so much easier than constantly paying for taxi. Love, love this place!!
