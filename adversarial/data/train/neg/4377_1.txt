Friendly and clean so How can you ever go wrong?\nMy favorite is the protein style without the meat and a side of animal style fries. I know, you are thinking, did she just say withOUT the meat??? YUP, I did! I don't eat meat and this is how I can enjoy In-N-Out just the way everyone else does :-) So I just have them fill it up with the veggies and it is super yummy every time, just the way I like it! The best part about it is, that when I order it, they don't even bat an eye at me, they just pop in my order and ask me what else I would like! I love it there, YAY for In-N-Out!
