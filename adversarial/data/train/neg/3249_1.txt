I can not say enough about Euro Cycle and the amazing Finance manager Jacob. After being turned down by sooo many other other motorcycle dealerships here in Las Vegas Jacob was the only person to get me approved for 2017 Moto Guzzi V7 III Stone. It's a beautiful bike and I'm over excited about it. The professionalism of this dealership is amazing. It's a very gay friendly dealership. My husband and I were NOT treated any different from any other customer. The only problem I have is that Jacob had me trying on women's jackets because he thought they were men jackets. Lololol. It was funny. Anyway. Thank you Euro Cycles for making my dream come true. And a special thank you to Jacob for making it all happen. You have a customer for life.
