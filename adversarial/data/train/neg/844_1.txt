I wrote the below in 2014 for Allison when i reviewed her under the salon name. Nothing has changed and shes still amazing.\n\nLiving in another time zone now I don't get to see her as much but she's so good I fly back 2x's a year. She's so good at color my hair still looks good 6 months later (how is that even possible??? I have no idea but it is).\n\nAnyway, go see her. You won't regret it. \n\n2014 review:  I've been getting my hair done by Allison for a few years now and she's hands down the best hairdresser I've ever had.  We've been through a few different styles and colors with my hair and each time she nails it.  She obviously knows what she's doing and she's a blast as well, I feel like I'm going to visit a friend every time.  \n\nThe salon itself is also great, friendly and fun atmosphere in a great location. Really couldn't think higher of Allison or the salon, they're both fantastic.
