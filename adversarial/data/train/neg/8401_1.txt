I've tried this restaurant twice, and it hasn't been okay.  Getting decent sushi in the Valley seems to be based on whether or not the menu has 'Krab' on it or if they call it crab, even though it's that pressed mess that's not really crab.  I've been there once before and was pretty disappointed at the disconnect between the menu and the food that's brought to the table.  \n\nThe california rolls are made with the pressed mackerel that's called crab - definitely not.  There's some kind of weird sauce they bring with the tempura - which seems to be made in panko batter instead of tempura batter - that tastes like apple cider vinegar.  \n\nWhat's worse, though, than the Krabb and the panko tempura is the sauce that seems to be drizzled on everything.  It's an over-done mix of what tastes like Chinese Five Spice and applesauce.  \n\nI know it's tough to find sushi in Glendale, but if you're hungry and in the shopping center where this place is, you're (sadly) better off going to Taco Bell.  \n\nThe service is inattentive, the food is just not sushi, and the price is a little high for a place that serves unripe avocado in their rolls, and imitation crab in their rolls.
