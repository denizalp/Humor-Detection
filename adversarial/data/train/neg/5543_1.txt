Cool \"to do\" item for anyone visting Vegas. I would say its a must for anyone who enjoys the Marvel movies, and is a fan. My 3 star rating is due to the following 2 experiences: 1. Merchandise is over priced. Some items like Funko Pop! Figures are double the price of retail. Not even Disney does this in their parks. 2. They were offering free holographic entry passes that had characters on them such as Iron Man, Thor, etc. I noticed this on a sign while checking in. After the attendant sent me on my way after checking in to sign up for the next show, I asked for my holographic souvenir pass. She replied to me in a condescending manner, \"That's only for people who buy the tickets in the store.\" As if to bash my Groupon. I understand its Vegas, but whoever is running this joint should rethink their tactics for their fanbase.
