I was very impressed with Tony Roma's. I went with a group of 8 adults and three kids under 3 years of age. The waiter was very accommodating and even asked us if we wanted to put the birthday cake we had brought in the fridge (and later provided plates and cutlery for the cake and even brought the cake out with the candles lit). The food was great and nice young waiter was very attentive. We will be returning.
