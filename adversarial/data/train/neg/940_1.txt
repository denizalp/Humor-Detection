Been enjoying Green for years. Sadly since the remodel the food has not been the same. A bit before the remodel when the menu changed the eggless rolls went from being a little but of heaven to being the main thing I detract people from ordering. Today my po-boy was by far the worst if had from green. It is so close & have been proud to give local & vegan my business, I'll give it a few more tries.
