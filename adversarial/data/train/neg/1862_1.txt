I came here for a hydra facial recently. It was my first time getting one done. Nothing was explained to me during the process. I had to ask the technician and she replied only simply to me as if I was wasting her time. The technician did not use gloves when she was touching my face and had long fake acrylic nails which I find absolutely disgusting at a med spa where you are touching people's faces. Not sure if another technician would have been better but I would have rather spent my money elsewhere. The technician I had was Anchita I believe.  \nNot to mention the first time I got booked and was on my way I called them to let them know I would be arriving in 5 mins, the lady at the front desk told me that they had booked me in by mistake so I wasted my time driving and told me to come back another day. Horrible service.
