I was in Phoenix for a business trip recently and enjoyed a dinner here on Saturday, 5\/20\/17; in short, it was fabulous!  There were three of us, and we were seated in a half round booth with a view of the terrace\/patio.  It's clean, modern and the service was fantastic; our server was knowledgeable and his smile was genuine, and since this was our first time there we all had questions which he answered cheerfully.  We started with the Humus plate, and the Humas is made from scratch (as is their bread and pasta) and it was the best I've ever had.  Never had scratch made pita before this, and what a difference!  One gal had the Mushroom Ravioli which she was thrilled with, my other companion had the Sea Bass which she adored.  I had the Shrimp Scampi Risotto; the shrimp was tender and perfectly cooked, and Risotto was creamy, delicious and melted in my mouth!!  Even their Iced Tea was wonderful!!!  The only negative is that it's a bit loud and hard to hear each other which made us all raise our voices.  If you're anywhere near Scottsdale, you have to go to Olive & Ivy!!!
