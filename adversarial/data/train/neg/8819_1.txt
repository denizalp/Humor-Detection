I've been trying to grow my hair out but my bleached ends were fried and it had no style. I called Aly and she set me up with her master stylist, Lori, who did an amazing job giving me a real style with layers! I was afraid to part with some of my length, but now my hair looks so much healthier and has a lot of body and movement. My boyfriend gave me raving reviews when I got home and said I got a fantastic cut! Thank you Lori and Aly, I'll definitely be coming back to The Glam Parlor!
