stars with my experienced for the following reason\n\n1. Customer service experienced - awesome, he explained everything and how it works\n2. Frosted sugar pink cookie - delish ( not too sweet for my taste)\n3. Rebel drink- kinda weird taste for me, but love the after taste and since has monster drink, love it.. keep me awake to study.\n4. Popcorn - just one word FRESH\n5. Location - very accessible and lots of parking\n\n\nLocals and non locals, need to try this place.. IT IS SIMPLE and UNIQUE
