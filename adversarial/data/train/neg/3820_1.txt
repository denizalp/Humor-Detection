Really good. The atmosphere is modern and the facility is very clean. The service was friendly as well. They had many different, interesting and good-looking pastries and cakes there, but I can only judge the soft serve ice cream and chocolate chip cookie, which is what I had at the time I went there. It was GREAT. I think it was some of the best soft serve I had in a long time. They use good ingredients and it actually tastes like what it is described as (if that makes sense)! I also had the chocolate chop cookie and it was great too. Soft, but not too soft and almost melts in your mouth. The only negative thing I would say though, is that it can be hard to find, it's not obvious. Whether you are ordering a cake from them or just stopping by for ice cream, please check them out. I would recommend following them on social media too, since the pictures they post are really nice. They are worth trying out, so give 'em a visit! :)
