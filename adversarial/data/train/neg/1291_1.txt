I am so please with the level of customer assistance I received at Journeys #917.  A huge shout out to ZOE, who assisted me and my little girl with sizing and fitting of a pair of white low cut Converse shoes.\nZoe went the extra mile to recommend socks which were cheaper and more durable than name brand socks.  Zoe did not pressure for sales, she did however suggest we \"check out the in store sale items.\"\nI only wish my shopping experience involved associates like ZOE.  I will be a return customer, thankyou ZOE.\nWilla Smith of Holbrook, Az.
