The food was okay. However, the service was questionable. Burgers and fries were greasy. Perch was greasy. Trout was okay. Group said ribs were good. We got there right as evening meal was staying and the waitress was not very friendly. Lots of scowling at us. Certainly not the Quiveys Grove we remember from years ago. Certainly not our recommendation for a Madison dining experience!
