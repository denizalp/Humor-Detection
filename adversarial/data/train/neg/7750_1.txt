Nick's is a casual diner that takes you back a few decades. My college newspaper editor friends and I would hang out there after stressful deadlines for greasy food, pie and drinks. My memory is that the mood was smoky and the decor saturated with dull greens and dark browns. There is a nostalgic feel there, like it's the last restaurant of its kind in the area, and has never ceased being a great meeting spot for an unpretentious group of friends.
