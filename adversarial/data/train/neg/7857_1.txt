We stayed here for the hubby's birthday weekend and it was amazing!\n\nWhat is that smell? I LOVE it!  they have this scent that spray's I believe it's called seduction.  Every time I passed the lobby my nostrils where in bliss:)\n\nOur room was awesome with a sunken living space to sit and relax.  The tub was a good size perfect for two:)  There was also a tv to enjoy in the bathroom while getting dolled up.  The bed was very comfortable and we basically sunk in after long nights or mornings however you look at it teehee.   The casino was nice and we had the pleasure of meeting cool dealers...although I wasn't very good:(  But thats ok because Club Tao is there to dance away the woe's!\n\nThe Palazzo is adjacent and there are tons of shops to visit.  I was very impressed although I did get lost a fews times but always managed to find way back.  with a little help from the guards...we had a separate elevator we had to find to get to our rooms thats all...by the time we left we had it down.
