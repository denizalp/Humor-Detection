We had some friends in town so we took them to The buffet inside Main street Station. We got sat in Juan's section and soooo glad we did. He was nice, fun, attentive and more. We went for lunch and we had a lot ofgood food. From hot wings (dry spicy rub so your fingers aren't glopped up with bbq sauce), tilapia, turkey, desserts and more. The decor is fantastic! Highly recommend.
