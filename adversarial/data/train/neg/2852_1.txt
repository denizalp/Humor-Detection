I may be biased as a big Beatles fan, but this show is awesome by any standard. \n\nThe show isn't just a tribute; the Beatles were involved in making it.  George Harrison was friends with the Cirque creator and they brainstormed the idea until George died, at which point Paul, Ringo, and Yoko became consultants on the project.  The soundtrack was also personally redone by original Beatles producer George Martin and his son Giles, so the cliche that you will \"hear the music as you have never heard it before\" is literally correct.  Look out for the new strings version of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" - it is just as good as the original, imo.  The way a song like \"Because\" merges with the opening chord of \"Hard Day's Night\" before launching into \"Get Back\" at the beginning of the show is just a clue to how much they really pushed the envelope with reinterpreting the music.  It is pretty risky to \"remix\" songs by a legendary group like the Beatles, but they pulled it off. \n\nThe show itself loosely tracks the story of the Beatles - from their start in Liverpool, to the Ed Sullivan show, their hippie\/psychedelic stage, political phase, through the band's break-up.   Don't expect a ton of the traditional Cirque acrobatics.  There is a good bit, but mostly it is dancing and choreography.  Like any Cirque show, however, the costumes, sets, etc. are pretty impressive visually. \n\nAgain, I'm a huge fan of the group, but maybe the best testament to the show is that I took my girlfriend, who could barely name any Beatles song, and she came away a fan and has since gotten up to speed with their entire catalog.  Whether or not you are a Beatles fan, you will be a fan of \"LOVE.\"
