We stopped in on Dec. 29th for breakfast after we happened to be roaming around the hotel.  Asked the main lobby crew of the best nearby breakfast and we were directed here.  Amazing.  We honestly wanted to get one of everything on the menu.  I had the omelet with asparagus and truffles, my husband had an omelet that I think had bacon and salsa.  Both were great.  Fresh sqweezed orange juice too.  Too bad we didn't have room for the french toast!
