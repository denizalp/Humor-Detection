I recently took my puppy Zahara in for her vaccinations, and to get spayed and microchipped. The entire office was very clean and organized, and the staff was very nice and helpful. They took great care of my little girl and I couldn't be happier with our experience there. This clinic is a clean, helpful, affordable place, and I'll be recommending Homeward Bound to any of my friends with dogs\/cats.
