This seems to be as close as I can get to an original Nathan's dog lately since it's been a while since I've been back out east.  Still, whenever I stay at the MGM, I tend to find myself here at least once scarfing down a dog.\n\nCan't really complain too much about the food court stand.  Everything for the most part is cooked when you order it.  The fries and rings are always hot and crispy.  The Cheese-steaks are decent as well.  Still tastes a bit off from what I remember back east, however it still provides the same artery clogging affects.
