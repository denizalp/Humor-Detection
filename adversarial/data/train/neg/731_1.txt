I loved the massages here so much I got a monthly membership. I don't have insurance, thus this is coming straight from my bank account - so you know it has to be top notch. I'm almost 50 and I have lower back problems and sometimes suffer from severe sciatica. The massages I get from Sam are not fun or relaxing; they're serious. But afterward I feel so much better. My gait is much improved and I can get a night's sleep without pain.\n\nI have had one facial there as well and it was very nice too. Facials, for me, are a 'nice to have', so I don't get them regularly. But when I get around to another, I'll definitely book here again.
