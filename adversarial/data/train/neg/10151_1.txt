\"HAHAHA\" sums it up in a nutshell.  If you haven't been you must visit Absolute Comedy at least once in your life, especially if you missed your ab workout for the day.  We were in stitches the whole time.  The host really knew how to build up a story and deliver timely and witty one liners.  The headliner had the memory of a computer as he took us to the apex of the hilarity while simultaneously tying together almost every joke he told all one last big bang of a finale. 5\/5.
