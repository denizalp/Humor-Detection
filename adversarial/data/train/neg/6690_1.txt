If you want a really good beef, or combo, this is the place to go, I grew up in Chicago and this is by far the best in the valley. They use french bread, not a crummy hogue roll, or some other substitute. I get sweet peppers on mine, and there awesome too.\nThere fries are fresh cut, and very tasty, not soggy and greasy.\nI have also gotten a Vienna hot dog, it comes with fries, but they need to put tomatoes and pickle spear on dog,otherwise, it's yummy.....\nThey only take cash, no cc, so bring some cash.\nThey are reasonably priced, so you can get a good meal for around $10.\nI have not tried anything else, I just go here for the beefs....and occasionally a hot dog.
