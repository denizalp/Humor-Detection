Stopped by here last night to fulfill my ice cream craving. I came just for the Cookie Monster cone, but we got there a little late and they only had enough ice cream to make 1 scoop of it, they were nice enough to substitute the other scoop with Cookies N' Dreams. It's a bit pricey but it's still really good.
