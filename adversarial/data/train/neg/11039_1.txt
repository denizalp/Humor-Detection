My first visit to Fuego Tacos was totally pleasant ... once we actually found it!  It is tucked away at the back of what looks like a corporate building.    \n\nWe were there mid-afternoon on a Saturday and there were only a handful of occupied tables.  The bar seemed very inviting, but alas, we were there with our one-year-old, so no major margaritas for me.\n\nThe food was great.  The tacos were very flavorful and the sweet potato fries were a hit with the babe.  I would definitely go back for another round, whether it be for a mid-afternoon late lunch or for happy hour during the week.
