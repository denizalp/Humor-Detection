We had a very pleasant stay, with one exception we had our car ransacked over night. The room was decent by Las Vegas standards and very quiet.  We had a nice view from room 302, staff was pleasant and the pool was super.  But some how the valet left my car unlocked and it was complete tossed by the time we received it the following morning.  So only 3 stars for that one.
