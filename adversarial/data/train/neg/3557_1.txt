Olive and Ivy is a great place for a tasty meal. The staff was wonderful. Our waiter had recommended the grapefruit mojito. Most of their sangrias are puree based so don't expect any fruit pulp.\n\nI had the homestyle cheddar biscuit off of their breakfast menu. It was very yummy. Scrambled eggs on top of a cheddar biscuit on the bottom.\n\nThe Iced Chai Tea Latte was prime. The only thing that took me by surprise was how heavy the whip cream was on the top of the latte. \n\nOverall, two thumbs up.
