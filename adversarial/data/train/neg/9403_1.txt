I was rear ended a few weeks ago and needed some repairs done to my car. A car dealership recommended these guys, and having no idea where to take my car, I listened. I'm glad I did!\n\nPros:\nFriendly, professional\nEstimate the same day I called\nRecommended\/ assisted with car rental\nRepairs looks great\nCleaned out my car, inside and out!\nCustom Color goodies when I picked up my car!\n\nCons:\nTook a few weeks to get my car in the shop. Not sure if this is typical at body shops. \n\nOverall, it was a pretty good experience and I'll definitely take my car back whenever I need some work done.
