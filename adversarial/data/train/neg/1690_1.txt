We got a living social deal for AC tune up and filter change, so we scheduled for the tech to check on our AC unit. He told us motor was not working and we ended up paying over $500 to change a new motor. He also told us the other unit is bad and we have to pay $3300 to replace it. Beware of this company! Better get a second opinion...
