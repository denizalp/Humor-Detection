Friendly little taco joint with overall tasty burritos and tacos (they have other stuff too but I've only had burritos and tacos)\n\nThey make the flour tortillas in house and they are quite good. Get these and don't get the corn tortillas (which are average) or the whole wheat tortillas. \n\nThe spiciness level is fairly low (even when you ask for spicy), but they have some other hot sauces available that can bring up the heat level a bit. \n\nEnjoyable and good
