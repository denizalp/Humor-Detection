I really like the idea behind Honey Salt - the juxtaposition of the sweet & savory ...but I think they take themselves a tad seriously.  Great for cocktails and you can expect a solid satisfying meal for 1\/2 what you would pay on the strip.  Waiter was slightly uppity...I think that might be where I got the too serious vibe.  I just didn't feel like he was genuine at all - more like he was doing a sales pitch.  The other staff we encountered seemed cool enough.   The mac n cheese was some of the best I've ever had.  They serve Pok Pok drinking vinegars and I appreciated their beer selection.  A little far to go if you do not have a cab and are staying anywhere close to the strip.  If I were a local though I would definitely go back.
