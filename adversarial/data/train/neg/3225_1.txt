Super disappointed in delivery services. Got a broken dryer delivered to me on Saturday. Trying to get it delivered asap on Monday but getting someone on the phone who knows something has proven impossible. Since speaking with several home depot representatives I am even more upset. Apparently their schedule is booked until Friday so I have to wait an extra week for delivery when it was their mistake. Missing 2days of work so far is ridiculous.
