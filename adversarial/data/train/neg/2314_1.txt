Today I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed my Dr.Michel Daccache and without a doubt I also learned today he is the best Oral Surgeon out there. It started with his wonderful staff, who through every phone call and in person conversation, they seemed knowledgeable, professional, and always happy to take care of their patients needs. After a quick and informative consultation session with Dr. Daccache it was finally time to remove all four of my impacted wisdom teeth. Dr. Daccache made it a very quick, easy, and relaxing experience by being very informative and reassuring about the details of my surgery. Afterwards him and his staff were very attentive to me and gave me very reasonable and helpful instructions reguarding recovery and prescriptions. Later that day after surgery I was happy to receive a follow up phone call from one of his staff members checking in on how I was feeling. They all clearly are good at what they do and enjoy doing it. I strongly recommend Dr. Michel Daccache to anyone that requires the knowledge and expertise of the finest Oral Surgeon. Thank you Dr. Daccache.
