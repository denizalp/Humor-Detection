I am the Catering Sales Manager for Charlie Palmer Steak at The Four Seasons Las Vegas. Press, the new coffee\/pastry\/cocktail bar carries Jean-Marie's Honey Nougat with Pistachios...I have been eating two a day since I discovered them! Absolute magic... heading down the hall for another as soon as I post this! The best nougat ever - including my travels all over Europe!
