Talk about brand new.  Costco has to be a good place to work. I don't think I've ever walked into a Costco and had a bad experience with a neg employee. This one only proves my point.  I am in canton and I drove the 30 miles to come by electronics. Again Costco just has the better deal with upgrades at a reasonable cost. (Of course not everything is cheapest here). The lines are a little long and it would be nice if they had their people scanning carts to be prepared for payment like they do in other Costco's but that's a small con to a greater pro. \nThis Costco is big but I'm sure they are expecting the membership to equal its need. \nIf I lived around here. This would be my Costco.
