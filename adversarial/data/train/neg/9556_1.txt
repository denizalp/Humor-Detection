I have a degree in ceramics and have shown in multiple galleries all over the country. Unfortunately, there is not another place in town to get supplies. Everyone there treats their clients like crap. They are entitled assholes. I have never been treated like an equal. Save the trip and your money. Dean has no idea what he is doing and takes \"his cut.\"  He takes a lot of money for him to ruin your kilns. Go someplace else.
