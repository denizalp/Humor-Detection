Updated review:\nSaw Hannah for gel mani and Miley for gel pedi.  They helped me pick really amazing colors for gel mani and pedi!   Classy!  I loved them. \n\nWent back to see Kayo to get my gel mani and pedi today. I love my nails!!! This place has become my go to salon because of Kayo's such high skill level and attention to details. She can give you some amazing hand paint job. \n\nI have referred some friends for gel mani\/pedi and lash extensions.  They are all very happy!\n\nReady for Valentine's Day! (Red mani and pink pedi )\n\nI got Light pink deep French mani and light pink pedi with glitter from Hannah, very friendly and skillful Korean girl while Kayo was out of town last month.
