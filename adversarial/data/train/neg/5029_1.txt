Counter service w\/delivery to table. Wife had avocado big burger, I had big burger w\/ onion strings and guacamole. Nice seating arrangement, very clean rest rooms. Burgers were supposed to be medium rare, but were medium well, They were otherwise o.k. A block west of the 101 on Eliot. For the money you can do better,
