Good food, I like afghani food, but love their spicy sauce\/salsa.  it's always crowded.  so the order always takes minimum 30 mins to prep.  I am not sure on pricing, but I think for about 8 or 9 plates of dinner it costs $150.  1 plate can easily be split for 2 kids. 1 dinner is big enough to feed a hungry Man ;) or 2 females.  I never finish my plate all at ones.  Do not leave food over night to eat next day, it leaves the stales smell, I think it's the salad, but rice and meat smell fine.
