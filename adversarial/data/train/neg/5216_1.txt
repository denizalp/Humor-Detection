Been to this location twice. The service is top notch and everyone is extremely friends from the hostess, to the waitress, to the manager that walks around a greets all the tables. My first meal I wasn't overly impressed, my own fault probably. I get the peppercorn steak and just wasn't thrilled with the overload of real, whole peppercorns covering the steak. My second visit I couldn't have been happier with the evening. The calamari appetizer is by far the best calamari dish I have ever had. The pre dinner bread with the sun dried tomato spread is awesome. I went for a dry aged NY strip and it was fantastic. This place also knows how to pour a drink. My drink of choice, vodka on the rocks - it's a full glass of vodka, no space for mixers. Just the way I like it. We'll done Flemings.
