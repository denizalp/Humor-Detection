This review is based on nothing but sitting at the bar drinking, or getting refills from the walk-up bar.  They have sports on in the secondary bar where I sat watching football while working on my buzz.  I got to witness all the servers and bartenders making fun of people, wisecracking, making silly paper hats for everyone with sayings on them like 'Yes, Yes, I'm a slut.' or 'I give the best head ever!'.  Then of course the 11 year old wearing the questionable hat with the saying 'I'm living proof the pill is only 99 percent effective!'\n\nWhat I didn't really care for was the little kid that looked like a 2 year old having her balloon popped next to her ear when she was not expecting it which started her crying.  Then the guy came back and gave her another balloon and said 'don't worry I won't pop this balloon' then less than 30 seconds later he cut the tie on the balloon sending it floating to the ceiling which started her crying again and then guess what?? Yeah the balloon popped.  Anyways the family seemed to be laughing about it even with the kid crying.  I didn't get it.  The kid still had a face full of tears 30 to 45 minutes later when the family all left.  That didn't seem like fun.  But really none of my business.\n\nI wouldn't bring kids here, it's not their kind of place.\n\nBut if you like smack-talking wait-staff, rude and obnoxious behavior, including birthday mandances for the women-folk, which I warn, has some full face contact involved, and that type of service gimmick, you might enjoy this place.\n\nI really did enjoy the show, but I didn't have to participate.   Mmmm, and the drinks went down so good.....
