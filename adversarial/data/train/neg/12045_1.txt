I just love coming to this place , it's my piece of Zen away from home .I've been coming for months and finally now I'm making the time to write a review .I have been recommending this place to my friends and a few have joined at other locations ( Henderson )! I must say that Everyone here at the Centennial location is so personable they always make me feel at home and welcomed. Not to mention all the treatments they offer my favorite's are the Slim pod( I have lost inches),Hydration station (great for detox and hydrating skin) ,red light therapy( my skin feels and looks much smoother) , chair massage ( relaxing from head to toe) and red light facial( less breakouts )! I can't say enough about this place you have to just check it out !
