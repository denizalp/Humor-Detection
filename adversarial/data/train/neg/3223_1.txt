My expectations were low, I mean #20 on the list? Then \nI saw Mastros was #19, and Mastros is amazing, so off we went. Not disappointed. We had crab cakes that were easily the best I have ever had. Didn't like the sauce, but the didn't need a sauce anyway. Both of us got the petite filet and it each was cooked perfectly. This was my first time eating bone marrow and I thought it would be gross, but it was like meat flavored butter. Put it on top of the steak and it was a winner. The potato sides were so huge we should have split one...the taste and texture were perfect. A neighboring table sent each of their 4 dishes back and seemed super unhappy, but we had no problems at all. The service is average. The atmosphere is understated romanticism.
