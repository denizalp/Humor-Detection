This place is clean and has really great decor but my nails look horrible. When I went in I was greeted promptly, the lady who never told me her name started on my nails right away. When she was filing my nails down I mentioned that the nails looked uneven. She just kept filing down the nails without fixing the unevenness. After mentioning it a 3rd time the lady next to her came over and filed my nails down even more. Still uneven. I figured it must be me and I stopped saying anything because they obviously weren't going to fix my nails. I just finished and now I have 2 very uneven nails and polish on my cuticles. I am really upset that I paid for this horrible manicure.
