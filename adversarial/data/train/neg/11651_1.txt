TLDR: looking for a cool picture to post on Instagram, or to try ice cream made by liquid nitrogen? Here's your place! \n\nI came here with a couple friends in a Tuesday evening. The store was no busy at all. The price ranges between $5-$10 depending on speciality and size. \n\nWe ordered small tiramisu (says coffee all over), triple chocolate (for chocolate fans) and strawberry cheese cake (the ice cream literally tastes like a cheese cake!) \n\nI found all three to be very tasty and flavourful, a bit on the sweet side, but hey, it's ice cream. The portion is also a bit small, but the taste makes up for it!
