I've never been the biggest fan of Outback, so I thought I'd give it another try. The restaurant looked like it had been through a remodel so the ambiance was nice. The server was also nice and was attentive to the table. I ordered their Cobb Salad and a side of Mac and Cheese. The Mac and Cheese was really good I would definitely recommend trying. However, the Cobb Salad was not good. Firstly the presentation was terrible and looked like they used a bag of salad from Fry's and dumped it in the bowl. I honestly could have made the same thing at home. I also didn't realize until I had already left that they forgot to put egg on the salad. Coming from the service industry I know it shouldn't be hard to mess up a salad at a \"steakhouse\", so I'm definitely disappointed. \n\nI would say if you are to eat at Outback DO NOT order a salad, they look and taste like something you can make yourself.
