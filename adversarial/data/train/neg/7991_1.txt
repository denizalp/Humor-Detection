Lied about shuttle service to airport. Need to take a taxi. Three rooms are okay. Customer service is lacking. Specifically booked this place because they promoted airport shuttle. After arriving from a 13 hour flight, arrived to hotel to stay one night before our last leg. Stood in line and receptionist allowed another person to walk up and cut right in. Asked him when the shuttle left for the airport and he told us they were all booked but we could \"call a taxi\". Booked? Seriously? They offer shuttle but have only one shuttle? That's complete BS.  When we arrived at the room was stifling hit. The air did not work. Spent the ni hight sweltering. We fly out of Phoenix monthly. Tried this place for the first and now last time
