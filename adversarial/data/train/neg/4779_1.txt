YES! I have wanted to hit up Scapegoat for maybe a full year now, and I have finally done it!\n\nAfter a wine tasting nearby, a friend and I giddily made our way over. Now, when someone describes this place as \"cozy\", please note that they mean REALLY cozy. As in super intimate, probably smaller than my 500-ish square foot studio. But I guess none of that matters as long as they don't get overwhelmingly busy. The decor and layout of the space has clearly been put together to maximize the small square footage. I really loved the look\/feel.\n\nSince our wine tasting had been predominantly whites and rose, we decided to stick with something light, and settled on a bottle of the Pinot Project Rose. We had definitely missed happy hour by this time, and I honestly could not tell you what kind of deal or promotion it was for, but the bottle was half off. Yay! The wine was a little sweeter than we were anticipating, but it was still good and that's honestly all that matters.\n\nWe sat near the front of the place, and there were little Jenga's on the table. At some point of the evening, Cards Against Humanity was also pulled out out of nowhere. There was some live music in the corner, and in my opinion, it was a little too much for the small space. But it still added some great ambiance.\n\nI wasn't expecting to really eat much here since it's a wine\/beer bar, but they had some delicious looking food offerings. We decided on the meat and cheese board. It was all very delicate. The portion wasn't the largest, but everything was scrumptious. Server rocked, too!\n\nCan't wait to come back!!!
