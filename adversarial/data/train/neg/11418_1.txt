This place looked cute so I've been wanting to try it. The decor is nice inside and they have a good sized patio. I like all the wood. We ordered the Boteco Board with the cheese and meats, the Gorditas, Hummus, Braised Beef, and two flights of wine. The servers seem knowledgeable about the wine. This place has a good variety of selection too. We got the Pinot Noir (my favorite one), Cabernet (paired with the goat cheese), Malbec (least liked for my taste but would go good with spicy), and Soave for the white (interesting Italian wine). I'd come back again! I hope it stays open a long time!
