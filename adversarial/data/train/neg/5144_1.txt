Always on Point with Quality, Product, Service.\n\nI typically get the Five Spot Breakfast Sandwich. It comes on a soft bun\/roll with 2 strips of thick cut-smoked bacon, cheese and 2 eggs cooked over medium. The price is only $5. The Taste is outstanding. Perfect combination of textures to taste. 5\/5.\n\nI also order the hash browns. Its only $2. They are freshly shredded and cooked in organic butter from a local farm. Taste is 5\/5.\n\nI save the best for last. I will eat my Five Spot and Hash Browns then I will order the\n3 stack of pancakes at last. They are very quick to bring it out. It usually takes less than 3 minutes to deliver the pancakes. It comes with organic butter and real organic maple syrup.\nThese pancakes are the best pancakes I have ever had. 5\/5.
