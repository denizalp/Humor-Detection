I purchased a Tag timepiece at this Jared.  I also paid for the watch protection plan that the salesman recommended.  The timepiece stopped working 2 years and two months after I purchased it.  I took it into Jared for repair knowing it needed to be sent to Tag for the repairs.  I was told my warranty expired in 2013 by 3 employees at this location.  I said that's impossible.  I purchased the Tag in 2013.  After several conversations I was told it is NOT COVERED, and it will cost me $1400 to get my Tag timepiece working again.  I paid $3500 for timepiece in 2013 and now they want another $1400!!!!  What a RIP OFF.  I have been a customer of Jared over 10 years, I will not do business with them again!
