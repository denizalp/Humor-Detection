I really wanted to like Mother India but unfortunately I have to agree with some of the other reviewers about their Roti's lack of filling.  I ordered the Curry Chicken Roti by delivery.  At least the other reviewers had some potatoes...mine was mostly sauce.  I had about 4 tiny potatoes and about 4 tiny pieces of chicken... I wish I was kidding.  The roti upon arrival looked flat. This was not a chicken Roti...it was a sauce roti with tiny bits of potatoes and chicken.  The taste of the roti shell, sauce and potatoes was ok but for the price and for practically no filling. I suggest you go elsewhere.  I hope they correct this issue and if they do I will try them again, if not I won't go to their restaurant again.
