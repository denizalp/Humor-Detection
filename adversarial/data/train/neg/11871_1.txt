I had a red bean waffle and a red bean waffle ice cream. The waffle was perfect - crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The red bean paste was also not too sweet. The ice cream was of good quality (I got strawberry and green tea) but it does overpower the cone. I loved having the fish tail stuffed with red bean though :) very small place with only 4 seats so not ideal for big groups
