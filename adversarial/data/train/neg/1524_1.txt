This place was AWESOME!!!! The whole wheat pizza dough was the best I have ever tasted! You can tell the sauces were made with only the freshest ingredients, including the veggies - they were so fresh! The pizza was not dripping in oil which was a plus! My girls got the soy calzone and we got a veggie pizza. My girls licked their plates clean and so did we! Customer service was wonderful and we only wish they had more of these places in Cali!
