My wife and I have been going to King Wah for ten years now.  I can say without hesitation that we have never had a bad meal there in all that time.  The King Wah family knows how to cook and serve, and the results are excellent dishes with unique and delicious sauces, fresh vegetables, perfectly cooked shrimp and beef that they marinate to tender perfection.  Just have their Chinese Steak served to you on hot plate and you'll understand.  It's one of their best dishes.  Like something plainer?  How about Shrimp Chop Suey?  Crispy fresh vegetables, jumbo fresh shrimp which is never overcooked, all in a simple but superb white sauce.  Like Hunan sauce?  Try the Hunan Shrimp.  The sauce is terrific.  What we love so much about King Wah is you can order two dark sauces (say Mongolian Beef and Hong Kong Sizzling Beef and Chicken) and be treated to two distinct and delicious sauces cooked consistently well each and every time.  The food quality there is surpassed only by their service and friendliness.  We feel like family there and have come to really care about everyone at King Wah.  Good people, great service and outstanding food.
