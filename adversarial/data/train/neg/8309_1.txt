How can I not give this place 5 stars. First, it's in Vegas so it's already fun. Second it's clean and offers some great food and drinks. The wait staff are friendly and helpful. Remember to go hungry because the portions are pretty large for the average person. Me and my husband shared the chicken and waffles for breakfast and it was perfect for us two. Try the bloody Mary! Its delicious!
