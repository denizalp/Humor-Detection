Upstream is just ok. Maybe I got the wrong thing. I ordered sushi, which had absolutely no flavor at all. I can't remember the name of it but it had shrimp, cucumbers and something else. I'm no sushi expert, but something was lacking. I enjoyed the open kitchen and our waitress was very nice. Other menu items looked good. Brunch may be my next choice for a visit to Upstream.
