Everyone back in SoCal has been going crazy over The Halal Guys but I don't think these two places are that much different from each other (minus the hot sauce and white sauce from The Halal guys). \n\nI bought a $16 voucher on groupon (paid $7.50 because of a coupon code) and ended up paying $2 out of pocket for a beef and chicken bowl. \n\nWhat's the difference between a bowl and a plate? The girl working told us that the plate separates everything while a bowl has salad first then rice, whatever veggies you put on and then the meat. \n\nThe salad had a light vinegrette dressing on it, not sure what it was but it definitely wasn't heavy. The salad we got looked fresh and not all wilted. I asked the girl working what people can put in their bowls and she said pickled carrots, cabbage, and garbanzo beans. I love their picked carrots!! Ask for them on the side because you'll get more that way. We didn't, and they were so stingy with the carrots!! I was afraid they weren't going to give us a lot of meat because of the way she was cutting the meat but it turned out to be a good amount. They have two different sauces, one is a cucumber sauce and the other is a sesame sauce... Not sure what the names were but I got both sauces. My friend and I both liked the cucumber one more, the sesame one was kind of plain for us. But you can try both and see which one you like better. If you want hot sauce, just ask for it and they'll give it to you. \n\nWithout the groupon the beef\/ chicken plates or bowls would be $8.99. They have some vegetarian and vegan options too and good deals on Tuesdays.
