my wife and I visited Montreal end of march, 2014, and had the good fortune to visit this charming bakery. immediately upon entering, you know you are in someplace special. the air is warm and moist from all the freshly baked pastries. visually the place looks ancient like something out of Charles Dickens. the people who work there are friendly and expert at delivering the goods. the ambience is incredibly intimate without any hint of pretense. it was one of the highlights of our stay in Montreal - perhaps THE highlight. as another reviewer put it, this place is an absolute jewel. I especially loved the almond croissant -  the maple walnut tart and brownie muffin were also wonderful.
