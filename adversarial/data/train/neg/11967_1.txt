Call me crazy but I come here for the broccoli. They have the best broccoli in the valley, as well as an awesome selection of wine and beer! You also can't go wrong with their pizza or seafood plates. As far as service goes, the staff is always very friendly and attentive. The man that owns this place clearly knows what he is doing!
