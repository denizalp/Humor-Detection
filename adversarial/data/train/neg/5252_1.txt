I have been going to New Image for about 5 years!  Cindy is amazing.  She has done an excellent job on several skin laser treatment: IPL, Laser Genesis, and Titan.  I have received numerous compliments on how good my skin looks.  I am told I look 15 year younger. I have referred several friends to New Image after they comment on my skin. \n\nI convinced my boyfriend to go to the clinic for a facial. He left with an appointment for the Myers Cocktail.  I highly recommend the Myers Cocktail to everyone especially if you have bad allergies.  This has made a significant improvement is both of us. We are going to continue with the Myers Cocktail, especially in high allergy season and flu season.\n\nDr. Mall has done an excellent job building up this business. I recommend New Image to everyone.
