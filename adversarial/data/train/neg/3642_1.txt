***OUT OF BUSINESS - GONE - LOCKED DOORS - KAPUT - NO MAS!***  \n\nWent there for dinner tonight and the doors were locked tight with a notice from the landlord for non-payment of rents. Sad, another one bites the dust in a tough Phoenix economy...\n\nApparently the sister restaurant AUTOSTRADA  is also shut down too...shut down in the middle of the night a week ago according to my sources.
