First off, this restaurant has a very unique and romantic set up unlike any other and is extremely clean! The food was different yet tasty, especially the seafood pasta.\nLast but not least, the service is awesome! Get Damon to serve you, he always keeps a smile on his face and is just an overall awesome server (:
