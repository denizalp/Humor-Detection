Awesome place!  Loved the food and the atmosphere.  My girlfriend had one of best original egg sandwiches I've ever tasted.  It was served on a pretzel bun, with an egg, mountains of cheese and Black Forest ham.  It sounds simple, but the taste was superb.  \n\nMy only complaint would be the service.  Our server seemed very annoyed even though he only came to the table 4 times in an hour and half period.  I guess I would be annoyed to if I had to work on St. Patty's, but with that said, he didn't seem so annoyed when the pretty girl next to us smiled at him.  She of course received plenty of good service.\n\nOtherwise, definitely had a good experience and we'll be going back for brunch very soon.
