The place nice, and Frieda is fabulously amazing! The first time I was brought here by my daughter and I believe it was last years Christmas (that was my kids Christmas gift to me!) and today I'm brought here by both my son and my daughter to be treated for this years Mother's Day. Everyone is friendly and the salon is comfortably cool. Now Frieda is so hands on that she can do my daughters hair and mine @the same time. Mikey got hlere before us so he got his hair trimmed\/cleaned up before us. They're reasonably priced and the wait is not too long, altho they can be busy but they all still keep their composure and manage to still be sociably friendly. So if need a makeover, trim, cut or wutever, come on by and get hair done here, you won't regret it. I don't because I'm a very much satisfied customer. Thank u smooches Frieda we love uuuu!!!
