Best spice spot in charlotte, also noticed they have pop-ups at concord mills and south park mall. They have everything you could ask for and the staff is super helpful. You can find things you didnt even know you needed\/wanted for the kitchen! Everything sold by weight so you dont end up buying more than what you need... you can try things out and decide if you like, go back for more, or if you dont you dont end up wasting a whole bottle of something.
