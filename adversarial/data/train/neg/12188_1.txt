Most popular show in Vegas is hosted at The Mirage. This hotel is a Vegas icon because it was developed by Steve Wynn in 1989 which at the time was the largest hotel in the world. \n\nAlright onto the show itself, here's the the price breakdown of seats:\n\n$196 Category A: Section 200s (first row K)\n$168 Category B: Section 200s (middle rows)\n$141 Category C: Section 100s (lower rows)\n$113 Category D: Section 200s (last row R and S) and section 300s. \n\nBased on the pricing chart, MGM thinks section 200s has the best seats. Also never pay full price on a show. Check Mlife, Tix4Tonight, and coupons for deals. \n\nIt's not like a NBA game where the lowest seats are the better seats. Alright m' love?
