Went back here and it seemed different.  I didn't see the manager that use to always be here.  He always added a little something extra with his customer service.  This time we brought a group with us and everyone enjoyed the food.  The menu seems bigger but I was only interested in their Korean and Hawaiian food.  The price seems to be really expensive but the food was still good.  It is good, but too expensive.  I don't think I will be coming back here just due to the price.
