I heard about Donna's through New Times and Yelp. It's not common to have an Asian bakery open up  here in Phoenix but after hearing of the many delights they offer at low prices, I knew I had to check this place out!\n\nMy first visit I tried the bbq pork bun, the pork sung bun, the curry beef pastry, the bbq pork pastry and a slice of the jasmine green tea. The bbq pork bun, the curry beef and the bbq pastry reminded me of the pastries i would eat in Singapore, and in LA at a bakeshop i go to in Rosemead. It wasn't dry, and it was very good. The Pork Sung is pretty much dried pork pieces on a bun so it's an acquired taste something I'm not a fan of, so, I can really comment on that and to be fair I'm not sure if it's really that good. As for the Jasmine Green Tea cake, I think that's what they're good at, cakes. It was delicious, not sweet, and not bland but just right, hence I made the decision that I had to buy my brother's bday cake from their bakery. \n\nWe made a last minute to order his bday cake the day of and I pleaded my case with them if they could make an exception for the black forest cake but they said they were unable to make his cake within a day at such short notice but mentioned that they had 5 types of mousse cakes that they could whip up in a few hours. So we chose a 10 inch Passion fruit mousse cake, it was like $30. Thought it was a tad pricey but when we all had a slice, and when we saw it, it was WORTH it. Simply delicious, simply yummy. Loved the fruit and presentation, and again not overly sweet, just right. I like that the prices are low, and they're not overcharging for their snack items and sandwiches. The cakes are worth it and I'm looking forward to the day when I'll order my birthday cake, and this time I'm ordering the black forest, a week before just to be sure!
