Thank you Hydro Care! I had a flood from my bathroom and needed all of my carpets cleaned. Michael and Gadi came and did an amazing job. My carpets look great and they did not charge me for extra services. My carpet looked nearly brand new and dried very quickly. Prompt, professional, I highly recommend and will use again. Thank you!
