Carlife is the place to go! Very friendly, honest, knowledgable staff. I was prepared to spend some money on new brake pads but was told that they were good and had nothing to worry about! Knowing it was time for new tires, Jeff showed me the balding tires and suggested I looked into replacing them soon. While they were changing my oil, Jeff was able to get me a good deal on some good quality tires and told me they would be in as soon as tomorrow. I will be returning this weekend to get my tires changed out. It is a pleasure doing business with them and will definitely be a regular customer and refer everyone I know!
