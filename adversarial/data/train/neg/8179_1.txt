Our boss brought a group of about 11-12 people for lunch here and the staff working was extremely fast, and to top it off friendly! There was some of us that had never been here before but they took the time to explain everything and managed to moved the line quick. Loved my bowl with tofu and falafels, one of the girls working suggested half and half and was very pleased with that decision :)
