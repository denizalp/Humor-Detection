This one is for joe. I'm sorry that another costumer was to deaf to hear you call her number 3 times when she was standing right in front of you. But when you're a good 4 numbers ahead of her's and the next costumer comes up after hearing their number the first time- at least acknowledge them! I came up to the counter after my number was called once and was rudely talked over by the person whose number you called long ago whining about how she didn't hear you. That's fine, whatever. But you didn't even say anything to me, not a, \"I'm sorry\" or \"can you hold on for a bit\" nothing. \nI shop here often and have had my fair share of being mistreated as a costumer. I'm tried of dealing with people who are clueless about their own products or unenthusiastic about helping their costumers.
