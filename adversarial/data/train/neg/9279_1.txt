I love rubios. Esp on fish taco Tuesday. Since opening my husband and I have eaten here about 4 times. Fish tacos and their chicken burrito are super good. They also have vanilla coke which is a plus in my book. Place is clean, fast, and well staffed. Dinner rush is super crazy. But we have needed a place like this up I  the nw!
