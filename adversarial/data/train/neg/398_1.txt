EBC: beautiful people, awesome dj's and always an awesome time\n\nFive stars to show my appreciation for: not waiting in line (thanks to Julian) upgrades to cabanas and comped drinks (thanks to amazing staff) \nIf coming with guys, I highly suggest arriving early and\/or getting a daybed\/cabana. Ladies, get on the guestlist or look hot enough to cut the line. \n\nTake your own: sunscreen, tanning oil because the bathroom attendants will charge you $5 per use. \n\nThey will search your bags thoroughly, so be careful what you take with you ;]
