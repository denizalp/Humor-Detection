RIP OFF RIP OFF ALERT.. cost 418 with insurance still have the rash.. i want to at least warn people if nothing else comes of this.. PLEASE if you don't  want to lose a lot of money for absolutely  nothing  DO NOT GO HERE .. they are charging so much and did nothing for me.. and i think many doctors are charging themselves out of a  job.. GO to naturopaths or chiropracters .. well that would be my advise.. or at least family practice..
