Where is the negative one star?\n\nI've not been here in years but to say service has been degraded is an understatement.\n\nWe waited 10+ minutes at the bar for service and even then it was sketchy. One bartender spent the entire time fraternizing with two patrons while we and others waited without drinks or service.\n\nThe \"free\" cornbread was stale and dry, worth every cent it cost. The butter was good but limited.\n\nThe bartender recommend the fried mac and cheese which I love but these things were near tennis ball size and tasted horrible, not recommended.\n\nI had to ask for another drink twice and it wasn't even busy.\n\nThe strange thing is the butter that came with the corn on the cob was hard and tasteless, not sure why they didn't use the same butter they had with the cornbread is beyond me, at least that was good.\n\nHorrible experience. Service sucked and the food was horrible, won't be returning.
