Great bar and restaurant. The hummus app was very good. I could taste that it was homemade. Great selection of beer, wine and cocktail fixings. My only complaint was the loud obnoxious party of young men next to us who made it nearly impossible to converse. When I nicely asked them to bring it down one if them spoke profanities to me.
