Delicious Thai food with a comprehensive takeout menu can be found here. I always mean to try new dishes each time, but since I always end up getting the delicious pad thai as one of my courses, I haven't sampled as much as I would like.\n\nThe dining area is a bit dark, since there isn't really a front window (the building used to house the Buduchnist Credit Union before they moved to their current location on the other side of Bloor). So don't feel like you're missing out on ambiance if you get food to go here.
