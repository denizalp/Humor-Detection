We get pizza here a lot because my son loves it. Tonight he was in charge and papa johns is for dinner. We usually pick it up but tonight we got delivery. The delivery guy was nice, the pizza got here fast and was hot. My son is enjoying his specialty no sauce pizza and I am eating the dreaded ham and pineapple. I did try the wings and they were terrible I cannot imagine anyone liking them. If they would have been good then I would have given 5 stars.
