The prices and the quality of food have gotten better here since I've been three years ago. I've been here three days in one week and surprisingly happy that Vitner Grill is going strong.\nI've been here for lunch twice and dinner once last week.\n\nThe lunches are excellent and a good value. They have a three course Power Lunch for $25. They also have many entries and salads at half portions. I've had crab cake, seared tuna salad, pear salad, snapper, salmon, romescu sauce flat bread, and all of it has been great. The flash fried calamari was tasty but the ones on the bottom of the pile were soggy not crispy. The flash frying gives incredibly tender calamari at the price of having them crispy.\nI think they have one a solid tiramisu. Cheesecake is okay. The chocolate tart is good too.\nIt's not as pretentious as some make it out to be. The decor is nice and upscale but if you're more comfortable in jeans, I'd go in jeans.\nIt's mostly people dressed in business attire but I think it could be a Summerlin neighborhood joint as well.\nThe staff isn't consistent. One day they didn't offer us bread. Another day they gave me a used white napkin. Another time, I was sitting at the bar, at the server asked what I wanted because he didn't think I was there to eat. He's right - not a lot of Koreans eating here, but still odd to ask a customer sitting at a bar waiting for the menu. On the other hand the staff were friendly. \nI really contemplated giving them a 3 but I think it's more of a 4.
