Place is very clean. Food is fresh and tastes great. Service is fast. 9$ for a big meal is great price for what you get. You get take out\n\nCons\nLunch size meal is a big dinner place size. Dinner size is one you could feed family of five :) joking of cause. But there is no \"bowl\" or small kids meal size. I guess people who are really hungry come here.\n\nWaiter speak English well, but doesn't speak clearly, took me a minute to customize my order.\n\nRadio plays music a little load for me.
