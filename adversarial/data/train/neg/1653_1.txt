Am I still in Arizona? This place is right out of the University District in Seattle. The garden patio seating is is so peaceful, and not like anything else you are going to find around here.\n\nCome here uptight, eat some fantastic award winning food, get some good vibes, and leave feeling alright out of sight. I was able to substitute grilled chicken breast for the hamburger patty . Had some sauteed spinach and avocado with it. The onion rings were yummy.\n\nI am taking a picture of the back enterance  to the restaurant. It is hot as blazes out here! I guess I'm still in Arizona after all. Do not let  the unglamorous parking throw you off. Be brave, and walk right in. I have to get in my car and crank up the AC before my brain melts.\n\nDon't forget to check out the Amazon birds!
