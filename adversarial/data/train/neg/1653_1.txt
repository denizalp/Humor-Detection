These bath soaps are so cute. Got\nSome for my mom and stepmom for the holidays, nice gift a little in the pricey side but what do you expect for Vegas. I bought 5 and got the 6th free, spend $73 I think. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They have regular bath bombs which I think are cheaper but these are just adorable.
