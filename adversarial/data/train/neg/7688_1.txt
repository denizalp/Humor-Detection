I love this place. It's been on my bucket list for over a year and one day, while driving to a different destination, we came upon this Pinball Hall of Fame.  Not what you think it would be.  Go inside this fairly plain 1-story building and you'll find 100's of operating pinball machines - one giant arcade!  I found the pinball machine I loved in the 80's. The machines have cards describing the pinball machine and its year.  I played some pretty old pinball machines that day. I am definitely going back when I can spend more time there.  Don't worry about being an adult in a pinball arcade - almost everyone there was an adult.  They have a change machine for convenience. Easy parking.
