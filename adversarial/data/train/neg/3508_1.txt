I had only a short amount of time as my hair cut at a different salon in Chandler got delayed.  So, I decided to drop in at Kelly's to see if they had time to do a quick brow waxing for me.  \n\nThey were able to take me in immediately, unlike the time before where I had a long wait.  V did my brows and they were back in great shape again.  And, I was able to leave and get to my hair appointment on time.\n\nThanks!!!
