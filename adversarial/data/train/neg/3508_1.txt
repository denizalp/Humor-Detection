Very cool spot! Friendly staff. Looks like a night club in the restaurant. The food comes in pretty large portions for a great price and it's really good. It's possible that you could run into a celebrity here! Me and a friend ran into flavor flav which was pretty cool lol Definitely worth checking out :)
