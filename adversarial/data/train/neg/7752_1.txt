Nice crowd for a Sunday night .  Service was great, fast and friendly.  Beef ribs were fantastic ... huge portion and delicious.  Fall off the bone tender and a savory hint of sweet barbecue sauce that was awesome in its own right but subtle enough to let the flavor of the meat shine through... and man did it ever!!
