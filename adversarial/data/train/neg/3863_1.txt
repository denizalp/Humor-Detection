I mean, c'mon. It's Barrio. It's really freaking good. When people ask me why I love Cleveland, I just say \"Barrio.\" It's cheap (if you don't get drinks), food comes out quick, and chances are, you will always see someone you know. Barrio is definitely a go-to for pretty much every Clevelander I know.
