This is one the only 24\/7 Urban fresh version of Sobeys I know. They do sell liquor hence the crowd late on a Saturday (with empty beer fridges to boot). However I didn't quite appreciate the layout of this spot. The cashiers looked bored and had uninspiring outlook towards service as a price check was met with disdain and followup questions with a yawn. The variety was similar to urban fresh I have experienced so if you really need to visit a grocery store or make an alcohol run when others spots have closed this will hit the spot.
