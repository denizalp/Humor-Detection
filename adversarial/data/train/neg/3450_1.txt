I'm giving double sushi a 4\/5 stars, for the only fact that they don't have an astounding diningroom, but it's comfortable, clean and they do quite well in a typical Japanese restaurant setting. They are incredibly friendly, efficient and their food is great. Great value. I don't feel that they charge you more than they should. Along with sitting in the restaurant they of course let you do pick up, and they also do delivery. If you live in the neighbourhood and want to peruse a good sushi restaurant, definitely give these guys a try, you won't be disappointed.
