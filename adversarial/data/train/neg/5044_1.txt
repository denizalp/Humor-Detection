I researched all the vegan catering options around Cleveland for a very high-end event we hosted at my office, Cleveland HeartLab.  We had 16 high-earning physicians coming in and needed place that could serve people with expensive taste!\n\nLaura, the owner, worked very hard (and very quickly) to make sure that we had everything we needed for the event.  She even took time to sit down with us when we went to the restaurant to taste some of their food-- the Roasted Summer Salad on their menu, by the way, was absolutely to die for -- and make sure she completely understood our needs.  It was a very cooperative effort and I can not thank her enough for that.\n\nThe day of the event came, and we needed her here very early in the morning to set up breakfast.  Her husband and their staff members arrived promptly and set up all the food for us.  People could not get enough of it, vegans and non-vegans alike.  We not only received multiple compliments on the food, but the decor as well.\n\nI will definitely be using them for next year's event and would highly recommend them to anyone that is considering using a vegan caterer!  They are a bit expensive but their service is worth the price and Laura worked with us to cut serving sizes down to make sure we were paying for appropriate amounts of food.\n\nAnd to add, the favorite things on the menu were the Cajun Potatoes with Homemade Ranch Dressing, and the Lemon and Mint fruit salad.  We even had tofu haters eating the Tofu Scramble!  Very, very pleased with Cleveland Vegan.
