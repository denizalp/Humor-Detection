Be very careful with what you bring to this dry cleaners. They completely damaged the fur in my Moose Knuckles winter Jacket. I've been dealing with them since January and they don't want to take responsibility for the damage caused. If you have an expensive item that needs to be dry cleaned they are not the right people to trust.\nWalk an extra block and bring you things else where.
