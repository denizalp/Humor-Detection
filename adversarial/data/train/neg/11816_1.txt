I was wary about trying out yet another Thai food place - esp one located right on Yonge St.  Most of the time, they end up skimping on quality and flavour to make more profit.  I was pleasantly surprised with So Great Thai.  We had take out Pad Thai (chicken & shrimp), the Penang Curry (beef), Pad Si-Ew (beef).  Everything was tasty and cooked well.  Pad Thai was very flavourful and didn't reek of ketchup (not a drop!).  My absolute fave was the Penang Curry (beef).  Thick, creamy coconut milk, curry, peanuts...it was dreamy!  I still crave it to this day, and we had it at Christmas.  I'm looking forward to eating here again.  Great little place, mellow ambiance.  Good service.
