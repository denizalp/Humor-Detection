Such great pizza which keeps us going back. We have only ordered carry out so we can't speak for the waitstaff but EVERY time we order and take out, the counter staff there seem pissed off and so not welcoming. It says a lot about Their pizza that we go back because I can't stand the employees' attitudes. It's similar to Seinfeld's Soup Nazi... only not funny.
