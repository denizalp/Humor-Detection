This place has made its way into the \"too lazy to check out anything new, and just want something good\" rotation. The highlight is the hand pulled noodles, which are just the right level of chewiness. And flavoured nicely with the beef broth. The meat is good enough to not be distracting from the experience. \n\nWould recommend a small, unless you have a really big appetite. It's quite sizable. I don't understand how anyone can actually finish the mega. I would have to fast for a week to even think about it.
