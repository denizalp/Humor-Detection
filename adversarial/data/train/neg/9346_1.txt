Great selection of delicious beers at affordable prices, particularly given the location and variety of delicious Belgian, Trappist beers they offer. This is definitely my favourite of the chain. (Sin + Redemption, Prenup). They've definitely covered the downtown core.\n\nThe lose one star due to inconsistent service. Food is good, but not incredible by any means. Sausages are an easy standard.
