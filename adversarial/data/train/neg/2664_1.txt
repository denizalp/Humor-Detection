It's Denny's, can't expect much.  First time trying out the new location.  I ordered breakfast online, some pancakes, and the breeakfast meal with eggs, hashbrowns, biscuits and gravy and sausage.  In my notes I said bacon insteadof sausage. I didn't check my order before I left.  Got home and no bacon or sausage.  The receipt shows it on there.  There is also a \"verified by\" section on the receipt that wasn't signed.  Guess that means nobody verified the order
