If relaxation & de-stressing are your goals then The Joya Spa at Omni Resort is the place to go. The massage therapists are fantastic, the amenities amazing & the entire experience revitalizing. From the moment you enter the lobby to the stone of intent and Brazilian crystal-constellation room to the circuit of renewing rooms, your muscles begin to relax & your soul renews. There are male & female areas along with coed. Pool, lunch, drinks all great. A+ atmosphere.
