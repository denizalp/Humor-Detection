I like to consider myself a mediocre golfer, but I do enjoy this course. It gives me a challenge at certain holes (damn you hole #4 and #8! we lost 4 good balls today!) but then other holes make me feel like I might be getting this game down. The Golf cart path are narrow and certain corners with oncoming golf cart traffic feel like a game of chicken, but the greens are well kept. Bathrooms on the course we nice and stocked and the locker rooms in the clubhouse are smaller than what I'm used to but they again are well kept. They have a golf cart ladies\/girls whom have almost anything you could want on a course and came around a few times. The Clubhouse food was really delicious, I love their sliders! Prices are decent and the staff was friendly. I will definitely play here again.
