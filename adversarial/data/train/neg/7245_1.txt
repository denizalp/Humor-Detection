I just moved to Vegas from Los Angeles and was scared to try a new barber shop but so glad I found this place these guys are great at what they do I got exactly what i asked for and they are hilarious as well. These Puerto Rican's made me feel at home with their funny stories, comments, and good vibes. I got the fresh cut look I was looking for. I'm definitely going back again, the fade was $18 but I gave $25 if I had more I would've tipped more! I was in n out in less than 30 mins no appointment needed. Muchas gracias por esos boriquas!
