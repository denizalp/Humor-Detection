Cafe Presse was the main option for a quick breakfast and coffee while attending a conference at the Venetian.  I ordered coffee here on a daily basis during my recent trip (lines were always really long).  They have a variety of lattes as well which were good.  I ordered a parfait and unfortunately the granola was really soggy and it wasn't very appetizing.  Like all places in LV, this is on the pricer side.  There is a decent sized seating area that fills up pretty quickly on busy days.
