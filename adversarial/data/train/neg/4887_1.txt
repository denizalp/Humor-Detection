Second time here but the last. First time combo burrito plate. Burrito was just ok, rice was very dry and refried beans with cheese good. The garbage can by the sliced vegetables and salsa was full and disgusting with food debris on the push top. I walked in today, was the ONLY one in the restaurant and walked to the counter to order. The young lady behind the counter was on her cell phone for about 3 minutes, then walked to the back and completely ignored me. After about another 2 good minutes of hearing laughing in the back while still at the counter I walked out.
