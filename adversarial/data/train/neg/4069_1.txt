Tired of Interstate Driving,  stop here for a burger and milkshake. \n\nGood burgers that a priced reasonably.  Make sure to check out, what type of special burgers they are making that day.  I didn't see the chalkboard and missed out on trying some neat combos.    \n\nAlso get a milkshake, they make them good here.
