I'm not sure what exactly happened prior to me joining the National Dodgeball Organization but this place had their arms wide open when I joined In April 2015. Lots of amazing people and I've made plenty of friends. \nThe league itself is very organized and I encourage people who want to try it out, to come out on open gym nights. \n\nOn open gym nights, we have people who are there to explain the rules to new players. It's a very friendly atmosphere. The music is bumping and everyone is having fun. The balls that are used are foam no-sting dodgeballs \n\nThe league itself takes place on Tuesdays and is organized. It's competitive yet\nFun.\nI'd say give it a try. There are people of many skill levels. Come\nOut and have fun!!!\nI 100% recommend it! You won't regret it. I promise!
