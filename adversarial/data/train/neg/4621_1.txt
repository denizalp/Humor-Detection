A good Asian fusion place at the bottom of the shopping center on Park and Woodlawn. Get the pad see ewe or the green curry. The ginger stir fry is also good.  The Korean dishes are also good. Lettuce wraps- not so much. \nOwners r half Thai half Lao and one is married to a Korean woman so they know their menu. \nYou can eat outside as well.
