If you are considering this company, just stop. All the negative reviews are true. I dropped my car off at a \"terminal\" thinking it was going to be an actual DAS shop, but it was an abandoned warehouse, where a tow truck company actually takes your car. The contract said 14 days, it is now 22 days since I dropped my car off at the California terminal to be shipped to Virginia and I CAN NOT get a hold of a real customer service person. The customer service line just loops you right back to where you started. So, I do not know where my car is at this point. Please, do not use this company.
