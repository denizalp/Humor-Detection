Fun place to eat, order at the counter and quickly delivered are some delicious meats with sides.  Corn puuding, white beans, banana pudding, baked beans were tasty.  Ribs flavorful but only one sauce option.  Cuban pork available as a special was tasty.  Has outside dining and some craft beers and beers on tap.  Only desert were a couple cookies in a case today.  However, banana pudding as a side sufficed.
