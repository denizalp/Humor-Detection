Vegas is blessed with many good Mexican eateries. Some of the best are hole-in-the-wall Mom and Pop places. Even so, I was surprised when walking into Jefe's that it is basically a gas station counter with a few small tables. \n\nBut that is the only neutral thing that I can say about the experience. \nEverything else was stellar!   ...and I mean really **really** good\n\nThe owner, Ben, is a among the rock star elite when it comes to customer service. You won't find a cooler or more positive guy anywhere. You are family the moment you start chatting. \n\nThe food is big, plentiful, and top-notch.\nThe Best!
