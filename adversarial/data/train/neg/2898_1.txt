Alex does a superior job managing this location. She is VERY knowledgeable (as is Anthony) but she really literally knows everything. She is always calm and polite, particularly because they always seems understaffed with 3 or 4 people in line. \n\nAlex goes above and beyond for her clients daily.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nLaurie Malone
