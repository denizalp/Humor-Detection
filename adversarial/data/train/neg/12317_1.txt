I went here last night and was very impressed! My fiance went to Philip Pelushi on Murray and had a very lackluster experience; so I thought I should try another place on Murray. Stephanie was my stylist and was thorough and friendly. She spent an hour on my hair--just a trim and was very precise. I've had a lot of haircuts, obviously, but this one was different. She just actually seemed to enjoy the creativity of it. It's also really cool that they support local artists by having a rotating art gallery of sorts within their salon. That is something I've never seen a hair salon do before, but it makes perfect sense. Online it says the haircut features a wash and blow dry, but she used a few Aveda products too, and my hair looked styled. She also made sure I was comfortable with her ideas, which I appreciated. I highly recommend!
