We came here for a San Diego State University \/ Arizona State University football game. The overall campground is decent, nothing special. The restrooms and showers were fantastic, although the pool is somewhat small. The site is very reasonably priced. Only had two issues, the cable doesn't work without a box (And they wouldn't give us one as we were leaving on Sunday and their office is not open on Sunday), and the Wifi did not work. The light rail was extremely convenient to get around town.
