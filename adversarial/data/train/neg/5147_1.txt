Wish I could give a no star review. Husband and I found a couch set we liked at this store. After a couple rounds of negotiation got the price down to $3400.00 \"today only\" as the manager put it- decided to walk and go to the other Ashley store on west side of town on Bell Road. Worked with Derrick- not enough good things can be said about Derrick- very good to work with. They gave us the same couch set for $1400 less than the other store, and also threw in $200 in gift cards. Fast forward three days later- looking for a rug, and the one we selected was available at the Scottsdale store. Went in, made a deal and go to pay majority of price with the gift cards and difference on our own card. Manager would not let us do it. Said if we were going to use gift cards he would have to charge us full price for the rug. So we walked and went to the Ashley's on Bell. They did it for us. Got the rug at the price we wanted and used the gift cards to purchase. Bottom line unless you enjoy being screwed over and paying full price or damn near it for furniture NEVER got to Ashley's in Scottsdale. They are not willing to make a deal. Ashley's on Bell is the way to go. Ask for Derrick!
