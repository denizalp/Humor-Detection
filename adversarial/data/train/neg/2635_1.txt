The guys at the shop were really chill and super friendly. We had a great guide, Leah, who pointed out the various architecture, history of the city and had awesome dining recommendations.  It was a laid ride along the bike paths that had beautiful views of the Montreal.  Highly recommend booking a tour if you have the time.
