This is the best experience I have ever had in a salon. I saw Kilana. She took my hair from black to purple. Bright bright purple. It took her about 7 hours and she never complained. She was the sweetest person, she even hugged me goodbye. I'm not much of a talker and sometimes stylists can talk your ears off but not her. She was wonderful. Always made sure I was comfortable and she worked some gd MAGIC on my hair. I don't cut it or brush it or do anything with it, which makes it kind of hard to work with. Not to mention there is SO MUCH. I also was expecting high prices because a lot of reviews said it was pricey ... it was not pricey at all. The prices were average. She was lovely my hair is amazing.
