Come on guys! Trust me, I am all about the fight for better wages, I think overall the people in this country are severely underpaid, all kinds of jobs. But, don't give the fight a bad name! We were missing our two potatoes and coleslaw, and one of the pieces of chicken is less than 2 inches in size. Just moved to the area, so now we know- check your bags before driving away. Now dinner is delayed for all, the chicken is getting cold, and I hope they didn't give my husband any trouble at the drive through to get the missing items.
