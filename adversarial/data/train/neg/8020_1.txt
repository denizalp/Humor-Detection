My friend and I decided to try this place for lunch. I was very surprised because just by the name alone I didn't know what to expect. I had the honey shrimp which was amazing! Well, I enjoy Panda Express's orange chicken and this is a few steps above that. The shrimps breading was tangy, sweet and crispy and you can have either brown or white rice on the side with veggies. I liked the place so much I took the family the next day. I was even more pleased with kids menu! My son had the mac n cheese with bacon and ham and chicken tenders which all come with dessert and a drink for around $5. They have a kids program for teacher's, coaches or volunteers to reward children with Honerary kids meal's certificates. The manager was extremely friendly and came out to discuss this with me. Then gave me a very generous stack for the kids! And just because our food came out a little late we received a free dessert. Wow, what a way to end my weekend.
