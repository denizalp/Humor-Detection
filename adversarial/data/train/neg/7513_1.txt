Great authentic Mexican food.  I ate here twice while in Vegas for the weekend. Tacos, hotwings, fried mushrooms,  and burrito was good. My family and I will definitely pay this place a visit in the near future. There's also a bar attached to this establishment in case u want to have a beer or something afterwards. Oh and their rice is good too. When it's late at night and your in Vegas pay this place a visit. They are open 24hrs and they also deliver.
