I must say for the location the food is fantastic. It's authentic and true to what Mexican home cooking should taste like. \nThat being said, I find the prices high for few reasons\nYou're in a strip mall around Vaughan Mills. I know your rent isn't high\nYou require guests to get their own salsa. Sure it's an experience but I have to get up midst my meal just to get sauce. Why am I at a sit down?\nApp, 2 mains, 1 dessert and 1margarita cost $70? That doesn't include tip.... Again steep in my opinion..\n\nSo in short if the pricing was more reasonable of\nI'd go here more. But given what we paid for 2 adult dinners I'd rather go downtown with better ambience and view....\n\nFood is good though.. Just pricey for what you get.
