Well the place was very cool, but I can't say I was impressed with the bartender. Amy, or Jamie, something... I think. Didn't talk to her much though because she never checked on my husband or me. I would say she's a little too b****y to be working behind a bar, but who knows these days, you see everything. I may go back, but I will not stay if this gal is working.
