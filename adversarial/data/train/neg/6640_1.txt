Food is good, especially like the Sriracha dry rub wings and  the adovada. I wish the adovada was hotter like it is supposed to be but I understand you are feeding the calgary market. I have always had great service seated at the bar, terrible service seated at a table, and although the patio is beautiful I hate it up there because of the children allowed. \n\nI love their rasberry and peach beers!
