I had a great experience here!\n\nUsually my nails are weak and fragile so I do shellac which seems to chip within a few days at every nail salon I go to... BUT NOT SJ NAILS! \n\nI requested a marble paint for my nails and not only did it turn out beautiful, but it still hasn't chipped when it's been a week. Definitely will return.
