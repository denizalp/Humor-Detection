Annie is the sweetest lady! This reminds me of the Italian Family Restaurant I used to go to as a kid except now I can enjoy a nice glass of wine! Attentive good service, contemporary comfortable dining room,  and delicious food! \n\nThis new restaurant is B E A U T I F U L  and I love that I can bring my kids AND my fur babies out for a delicious lunch or dinner. \n\n**There is an opening in the wall that opens to reveal  Annie's Lost Weekend Bar and it is a fully stocked beautiful bar and has flat screens all over the room. Perfect comfortable spot for before or after dinner drink ;)\n\nI definitely can't wait to try more on the menu!
