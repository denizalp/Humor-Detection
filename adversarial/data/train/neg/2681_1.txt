I'm having second thoughts of this place being a \"healthy\" place to dine-in at!  Especially if you order Beef + Pork soon tofu, the broth can be greasy - mine was.  And the pieces of pork that were in the broth were quite fatty as well.\n\nIn addition, the soon tofu was overly salty, whereas the bulgolgi dish was a bit too sweet.  So take note of the additional salt\/sugar that can be added to these dishes.
