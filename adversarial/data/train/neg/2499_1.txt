Went to enjoy our friend play drums at a show here with my wife last night. While we tried standing out of the way from of them so they could get by. And one of the security guard said \"you need to s*** not D*** or get out of the way To my wife(not noticing I was with her). I of course addressed the issues and another security guard tried to fight me as I explained how that was just out of line and didn't need to happen. The staff proceeded to yell at us while we were tying to leave as well as threats of physical violence. A man claiming to be the owner sided agreed with the staff instead of even speaking to me about what the conflict was. I strongly advise not supporting this place that hires and is owned by sexist staff that try and fight customers if they won't let them be rude to them.
