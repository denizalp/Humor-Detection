Had a delightful evening with friends at this highly enjoyable new location. We found the service to be sensational. The servers were highly attentive, helpful and friendly. The sommelier could have provided more options than just the single suggestion but, I must say, the suggestion was quite good.\n\nThe food was delicious. The pastas were exquisitely prepared, especially the casoncelli that was flavorful and almost desert-like. The skirt steak was excellent and the salmon was perfectly cooked. We weren't a fan of the cheesecake gelato but the pistachio gelato was scrumptious.\n\nMany will be disappointed in the portion size or claim pricing is high. We didn't find it hugely out-of-line though. We do suggest they stock Bailey's Irish Cr√®me at the bar...especially for a chilly winter evening. Indoors is very loud.\n\nWe'll be back.
