Overall, we had a good experience. The registration staff was nice, clean facility, and very quick. However, we  were very disappointed with the doctor who treated our infant. Dr. Young cut us off in the middle of sentences, ignored things we would say- not even responding, and he is very undermining. I would go back to this location, requesting not to be seen by Dr.Young. I deducted 2 stars for the disrespectful service by the doctor.
