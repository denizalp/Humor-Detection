So the menu is the same as all other Aromas: great coffee, AMAZING DELICIOUS PERFECT steak sandwich -- this is literally the best thing you'll ever eat, free ice water.  So for the menu I give it a 4\/5, because I absolutely adore almost everything I get from Aroma.\n\nMy rating is based on this specific location: atmosphere, lay-out, etc.  It's definitely less \"comfy\" feeling than the other Aromas.  Seat layout is strange - four good booths but the rest of the seating is awkward.  Music they were playing was quite good.  Single stall washroom was clean.  Service was good (I ordered the sandwich and my friend and I each got a coffee; she asked if we wanted the coffees right away or wait for the sandwich to be ready).  I just didn't feel the space was as inviting as the other Aromas.  Felt a little cafteria-ish.
