Had oysters again on this trip.  Very good.  Solid meal with steam clams, seafood pasta (way too salty), and choc flourless cake.\n\nNot sure if I would come back.  Bill was more than expected.\n\n12\/17\nServer was very nice and accommodating.  Had calamari, salmon, Dorade (not good), and surf and surf.  Only the tuna tartare I didn't like.
