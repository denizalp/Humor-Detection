I love this place! Although I have taken kids there and they were so accommodating I prefer to go with just the hubby and I. Everything we've tried is delicious. I love the vodka penne, bruschetta, and definitely get some extra red sauce to dip the bread in. We no longer live in the area but every time we visit we have to go to gaetanos!!!!
