This magic show was the best one I've ever seen, very funny and great magic!!! We sat in the third row center and couldn't figure out any of the tricks, how does he do it? My sons (8 & 10) absolutely loved the show. My 10 year old volunteered to help on stage, he was super excited and as an extra bonus got a magic kit as a thank you at the end. We will definetely come back to this show, it's perfect family entertainment, loved every second of it!!!
