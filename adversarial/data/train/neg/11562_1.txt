I am very happy to have TMI down the street from me, so yes it is my local hang. I usually try to hit up the happy hour when I go. The owners are great and I have to say the servers have vastly improved since it's opening. The artichoke heaven is so good. But too rich for everyday consumption! Not a huge beer drinker, but I like their main ale and they get new beers on tap quite often. They do have mixed drinks here, but not a full bar. And please don't ask for red bull or ranch, it's just not that type of establishment ;-)
