I can understand the rave reviews, but I didn't find the *taste* of the food very good. The selection was amazing however. The quality is also really good. But everything was just a little to bland for my liking. Nothing there stuck out. Might have been arriving there at 9pm, but that shouldn't matter. I do like how there's beef wellingtons and racks of lamb cut to order at a buffet. Not worth the $40 entry fee for me. I rather eat a really good dish for $40 than eat a bunch of \"fancy\" bland food. But that's just me.
