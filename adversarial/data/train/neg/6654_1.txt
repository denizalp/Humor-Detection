They won't book new patients for same day appointments. My dog is sick but it's not necessarily urgent so I asked when I would be able to book an appointment and was told \"new patients book out at least 6 weeks in advance\" so just a heads up this seems like a great vet from other reviews but it'll be hard to get in their system to know
