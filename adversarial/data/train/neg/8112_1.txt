This place is still CASH ONLY, so be prepared. There are signs on the doors, but it's easy to miss... The food is okay, but nothing special. The portions are huge, and the prices are cheap, but the seating is terrible. It's retro in that it literally hasn't been updated in at least 40 years.\n\nWe ordered French toast made from raisin toast, biscuits and gravy, a strawberry waffle, and the corned beef omelette with egg whites. The biscuits and gravy was weird - whole sliced sausage mixed in a gritty gravy with no flavor. Someone here described the strawberry topping as looking like a crime scene, and that's still true (we think it's just pie filling, but can't say for certain). The French toast was really good, but that was the only thing that was.\n\nOur service was slow and inattentive. Overall, there are much better options for breakfast nearby, also reasonably priced, so look elsewhere before going here.
