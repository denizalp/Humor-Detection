I'm giving Chase 0 stars. They don't deserve even one star. Their customer service stinks. They don't even understand the concept of customer service. What they do know is how to play the \"blame\" game. When you call the customer service number to try to fix an issue they tell you that you have to go into a branch to get your issue fixed. When you go into a branch to get the issue fixed they tell you that you have to call customer service. All they are concerned with is going home on time. It was 5:30 when I walked into the bank and all the customer rep was concerned about was the fact that she is about to go home and was just looking to push me into someone else. Every issue that I have ever had with chase has been met with nothing but incompetence. They can't even process and send out a new debit card without messing something like that up. And the whole reason that they had to issue a new debit card was their fault in the first place. This is just one of many issues that I have had to deal with Chase. It just seems that all Chase is interested in is getting you to open accounts with them. Once they have you signed up then they don't do anything to make sure that you stay a satisfied customer.
