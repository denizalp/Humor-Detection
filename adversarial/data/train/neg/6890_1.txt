This was my First time here after being recommended by my brother. Upon entering I had a sense that the food was going to be good judging by how busy and packed it was in here. I Ordered the meat jun, I've had meat jun at other places and this is probably the better ones I've had. I liked how side dishes were served unlike other places I've been to, which I will not mention. Based on their food and service alone, this place deserves 5 stars. Island style has got to be Las Vegas best kept secret since they've been here for a while now and I've never heard of them until today. I will definitely be returning to their other selections.
