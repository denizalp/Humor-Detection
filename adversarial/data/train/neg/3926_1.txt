As far as takeout food goes, this place is a step ahead of the competition. I recently tried the Jun's Special (a variety of meats) and Jae Yuk Bok Kum (a spicy pork dish). Both were tasty and had healthy helpings (rice and two sides included) for about $10\/each. The decor in Jun's is plain jane, but clean, which is the most important feature for a takeout joint. The service was pleasant on the phone, and had my food ready in ten minutes after quoting me 10-15 (ON-TIME service?!). With all this said, it is still takeout, so there is a bit of a drop-off in quality, but it still was very satisfying. For those who may have not tried Korean food, fear not! Jun's is a nice and easy introduction.
