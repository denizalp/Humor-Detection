Our Family went to Madison for the first time, after we visited the Capitol we were looking for snacks.\nWe ordered Cheese curds and also tried the fried Oreos. Both were amazing!\nWe have eaten Cheese Curds before, so I can compare and honestly mention that I loved Fried & Fabulous Cheese curds.\nIt was our first time with the fried Oreos, we tried it as a suggestion from the owner,  are so tasty, really a must try. \nMeals are fried when they take your order,  they work fast and have a great customer service.\nFor sure we will look for this truck in our next visit to Madison.
