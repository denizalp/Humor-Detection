Started off earlier in the evening at Kabinet while the Datcha side was slowing getting busier, and it was great being able to hit the dance floor at Datcha and then retreat to the Kabinet side to drink more Rasputins which was my favorite bourbon based cocktail. Lots of great Djs usually, kind of nice not to hear the same party hits you hear in almost every other nightclubs. \nGood looking crowd ;)
