Fantastic place to eat! Highly recommend not buying the wine, but drinking the complimentary wine given with every meal. The manicotti is TOP NOTCH and made from scratch there. The clams and linguini is fabulous and generous. The menu is simple and on the wall. There is a little guy who plays an accordion who has been there for decades, you must have him playa a song for you. This place is a guaranteed stop every time my wife and I visit. This is also a celebrity frequented establishment. Very consistent service!
