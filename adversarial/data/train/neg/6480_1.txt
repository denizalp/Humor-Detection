We had the fried spring rolls, Bangkok Curry Soup, and Caramelized Pork stew. All of the food was delicious. The Bangkok Curry broth was amazing on the noodles and on jasmine rice. I highly recommend the cucumber concoction cocktail. Best service I've had in a long time. All of the staff were friendly and great at explaining dishes. Prices are very reasonable. Would highly recommend and can't wait to go back!
