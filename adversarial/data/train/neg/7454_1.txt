Went here today to finally get my 3 year old daughter's iPad fixed and they did a really good job in just an hour. Our iPad was beaten up...screen cracked that when you touched a certain area on the screen it would process something else and the corners of the iPad looked like our kid was hungry or something. The iPad looks as good as it can be considering how beaten it was. We can now see what's on the screen and touch it where we want to and it'll respond correctly. Happy with the service and will be back if our kid decides to mess up the iPad again. only regret i have is I wish I would left that original screen protector on since our new otterbox case doesn't come in until Monday! Oh well!
