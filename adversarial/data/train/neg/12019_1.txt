First and foremost the waitstaff and bartender are nice! I mean really nice. They were helpful and friendly and made great recommendations. My husband had the wings and I had the southern fried chicken wrap. Both were great. Along with cold local beer. Sports and great TV options are available. There was even a group doing a fantasy baseball draft. If we lived on Phoenix, we would be there a lot!
