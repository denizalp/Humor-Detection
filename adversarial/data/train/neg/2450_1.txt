I came here with my husband and brother for dinner and we thought this place was just OKAY. Nothing to write home about. I had a burrito bowl that was heavy with rice and beans. It was alright but I couldn't finish it and didn't want to take it home. It wasn't bomb enough for me. My husband said his quesadilla taste plain but tasted much better once he added the sour cream. Customer service was good but I wouldn't come here again.
