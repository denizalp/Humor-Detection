Went here with some co workers. Service was great, margaritas came out super fast.\n\nWe tried all 9 of the margaritas including the house special.\n\nWe had the fresh guacamole and chips (ate way to much salsa and guac).\n\nWe all did 2 tacos, slaw, refried beans with various taco wraps (I had soft corn, one guy had hard shells, other one did soft flour)\n\nVery filling!  Would definitely go back to try other food items.  Probably wouldn't order the guacamole again since we couldn't stop eating it ha.  Need to save some space for the other food items.
