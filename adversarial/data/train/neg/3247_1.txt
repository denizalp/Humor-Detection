The BEST hotel in the local area including Ballantyne area!!!! The Hotel staff are very nice and helpful! There is a restaurant on site and it rocks!! The hotel is in a great area with a lot of restaurants really close and shopping mall within minutes of hotel. I have stayed in the Ballantyne area for years and I travel every week and have stayed at the 2 Starwood properties and the Four Points Sheraton is by far the BEST!! And the price is ALOT cheaper and it's only 2-3 miles from the corp park! So do yourself a favor -and stay here and save $$$ and be treated like you are family!!!!!! Not like a number! They really care about the customer here!! From the cook, check in desk, cleaning crew, the managers they are awesome!! AND this hotel has a shuttle that DOES GO TO THE AIRPORT!!!!! Unlike other corp park hotels!!!_this is a GREAT option--cause it saves on rentals!! 5*** rated!! Cleans rooms and hotel!! Will always stay here along with all of my co workers! Thank you all for the great stay!!!
