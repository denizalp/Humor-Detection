Everything was outstanding with our visit to Border Grill.  Read about this in Vegas magazine and was so happy we decided to go here.  My girlfriend was really looking for a good meal with lots of flavor and this didn't disappoint.  We walked from the Wynn to Mandalay Bay to take in Las Vegas on our last night, so definitely worked up an appetite.  The margaritas were very clean and crisp with a hint of spice and paired great with the ceviche sampler that we started with.   After we demolished the delicious starter, we moved on to entrees - she had the Chicken Mole Verde and I went with the Yucatan Pork.  Both were incredibly filling and so very flavorful.  The Chicken was succulent and the pork was just delicious.  We had eaten enough that we didn't dare eat dessert and ended up taking some of our entrees home with us.  The wait staff topped off the experience by being involved, friendly and attentive.  Would highly recommend and plan to go there again when in Vegas.
