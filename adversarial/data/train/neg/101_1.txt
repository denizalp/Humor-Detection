If you are anywhere remotely close (a Phoenix layover counts because they're so close to the airport!) Little Miss BBQ is a must for lunch, early dinner, snack - any meal just to be able to go here! We were the last to visit to get what was left so I recommend going early! They are opening a second locations lucky for all of you! \n\nMy husband and I travel full time. We're originally  from the South and I thought surely Phoenix can't have good BBQ. Boy was I wrong. I'm so happy I listened to the fellow Yelp reviews because this place is amazing! We got the brisket and all the sides. Everything was incredible. The service was awesome also just to top it off. Definitely recommend - can't wait for the day we get to go back already!! I'll be dreaming about the grits until then!
