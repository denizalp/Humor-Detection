Have been a regular here for the past month. I love all of their food and drink options. If you are vegan, you can request the nut milk in your drink which is house made- made with walnuts and sunflower seeds (I think). It's really flavorful almost addictive may I add?. Try the Mexican hot cocoa for a nice kick from a hint of cayenne- it's a flavor party. Their sandwiches are well crafted with a perfect balance of flavor and texture. I especially enjoyed the breakfast sandwich with pesto, feta, spinach and garlic. Their soups are really delicious, I love the lentil one and I usually get it with rice instead of bread. They source ingredients locally and mention where they get their produce from. Most of their raw materials are from local farms or other local businesses. Great if you want to support the \"buy local\" movement.
