My first day here I was starving so ofcourse I piled my plate full of food and was happily full. The meal is quite inexpensive. Wait staff is nice. Clean setting.\nHad breakfast and I think dinner there subsequent nights and by the last meal I was already bored. But that's the thing with buffets that don't change it up frequently enough. \nFor the price it was okay..def not the best buffet I've ever had.
