This is a build your own pizza place located inside SLS Hotel. It's a bit upscale, so prices are a bit higher than most casual pizza joints.\n\nThey make personal pizzas based on your order. Instead of pizza, I opted for a salad and breadsticks. Their standard breadsticks are covered in cheese and I asked if they could be made  without them. The chef asked what I wanted and made it right there. He was friendly and willing to work with me.
