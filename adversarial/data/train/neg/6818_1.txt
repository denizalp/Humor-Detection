Had a great time in my first pop art your pet class! So much so I bought myself and two friends seats in another PopArt Your Pet Class.... And then it was unexpectedly cancelled... And despite many emails, phone calls and request through PayPal to get my $120 back for our class... I'm out the money. Severely annoyed and disappointed.
