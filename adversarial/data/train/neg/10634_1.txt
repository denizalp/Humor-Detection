My first ever trip to a Five Guys was on 11\/26 at lunch hour. A single patty burger with everything (that's everything on the list in black ink) was $4.09 and $2.59 for a large drink cup. Total with tax came to $7.22 which I suppose includes all you can eat peanuts and refills of pop. \nIt took about five minutes from order to delivery. It took a few seconds to figure out how the weird looking Coke dispensers worked but I finally mastered it.\nThe dining area was clean, people behind the counter were fast and easy to understand. All in all decent service. \nI think their prices are a bit on the high side but you get what you pay for. You could go to McDonalds and pay much less but you're not getting served actual food there but chemical equivalencies (sim food) instead, which is why their food won't rot. Five Guys is not like that. \nAnd compared to next door (Jimmy Johns) the service at 5G's is much much better. You can tell 5G's wants your return business, JJ doesn't. So I'll be back. Thanks for the nice sandwich! I could actually taste the beef and it was good.\n\nUpdate: been back here many times. The service is always about the same, so are the burgers. I still believe this is the best fast food burger in the USA today.
