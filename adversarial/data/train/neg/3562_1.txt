I've rented trailers before from this location and the staff has always been nice and helpful. Showed up today last minute to see if they had a truck available. They were able to get me in and out within 10 minutes since I had an account. When I showed up to the job I quickly found out my items were not going to fit. After having a mini panic attack I called in and Richard (I believe he is the owner) said it would not be problem to come and exchange it for a bigger truck. Big relief! I showed back up to uhaul and thought it would be a crazy process checking my uhaul back in and checking out the new one, but Jason was ready with the new uhaul and Richard told me not to worry about it he would transfer everything for me. I was able to pick up the giant outdoor furniture in time and when I came back to drop off the truck, Richard just transferred my miles from the first truck and didn't up charge me. I wouldn't say I'm an expert by any means, but I've rented moving trucks over 15 times and I can honestly say this is the best experience I have had with a truck rental company.
