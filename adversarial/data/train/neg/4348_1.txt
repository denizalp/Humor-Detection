Simpy the best deli in Vegas; the liverwurst sandwich is my favorite. However, the takeout service can be spotty at times, so be prepared to wait a long time (10 minutes +) or walk out as I did yesterday, Feb 08, at around 2 PM when they had only one guy working behind the counter. And there were 3 other customers in line behind me!
