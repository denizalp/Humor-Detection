A large amount of variety. We went on a Saturday so we had brunch. I wanted seafood, the crab legs shrimp are the cold kind. They were good but i prefer hot foods. Everything else was good especially the desert area!! More on the pricy side  for weekends. But it Vegas you're bound to spend bigger bucks.
