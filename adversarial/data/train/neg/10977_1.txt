The food at this place is amazing!   We had the grilled lamb kabob platter,  Lebanon salad and the vegetarian combo which has hummus, grape leaves, baba ghannouj and falafel. The food is authentic, delicious and fresh, all at a very low price. If you're looking for great authentic Mediterranean food this is the place to visit!
