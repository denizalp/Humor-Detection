So so so good!  I wish we lived closer to this restaurant, so we could come more. We came here for brunch Saturday morning. To start, this place has a super cool atmosphere inside. They also have a really awesome menu going from classic to very adventurous. \n\nMy boyfriend had a bloody and the eggs w\/ oysters. I enjoyed the bacon, corn fettuccine and a mimosa. We both truly enjoyed our meals, i would really suggest either of those. I really  had a hard time also not trying the rice pudding.Many additional options they have, that i would like to try!! Please come, you wont regret it.
