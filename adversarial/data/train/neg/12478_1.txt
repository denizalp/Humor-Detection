I've visited Vegas many times throughout the years and this year was my first time staying at the Venetian.  The Venetian is probably my favorite hotel so far.  The lobby is absolutely gorgeous, although the fragrance they pump throughout can be a bit overwhelming.  The abundance of restaurants available to you within the vicinity (Palazzo too!) makes it impossible to leave the hotel itself - everything is very delicious (Le Bouchon is a must try).\n\nI believe all the rooms are suites at the Venetian so every guest gets the same luxurious treatment and room as the next person.  There's no selling yourself short and settling for a cheap and tiny room because that's just not the case at the Venetian.  Our room was huge, with a living room and office area.  We had 3 tvs available to us, with one being in the bathroom!  And the best part of the room?  Remote controlled shades.\n\nMy only complaint would be the couch that was in our room.  It was very old and uncomfortable - all the cushions seemed to be worn.  Overall, though, I'd book my future stays here from now on.
