I've been here twice now, a couple years apart, and both times I've been very pleased! I've ordered the hot and sour soup, pot stickers, sweet and sour chicken, and the Mongolian beef. All of it has been excellent! It's one of my favorite restaurants and our friends agreed, it was their first time there. Nothing in Vegas is cheap, $20 for an entree is reasonable there. It may not be the most amazing restaurant on the strip but I loved the flavor!
