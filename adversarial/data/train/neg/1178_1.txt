I work at the airport and when I don't bring a lunch, I always go to 360. They are in the B gate and are impossible to miss.\n\nThere is a little seating and counter space to put your luggage. Well lit and smells pretty good. \n\nThe food is pricey but it's aiport food. It's lways expensive. Menu is big and a little confusing but it's not too bad. I get the 360 chicken. It's always good. The cashiers speak fluent English and Spanish. \n\nI'd suggest this to anyone stuck in the airport on a lay over or early for their flight in or around the B gate.
