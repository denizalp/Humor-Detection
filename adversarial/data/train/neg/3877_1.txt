Seriously AMAZING food. My boyfriend and I struggle to find places we can eat out together at, I am vegan and he is not. Not only were we both able to eat here but the food was some of the best we've ever had!\n\nI ordered the vegan portobello burger and the sweet potato tots. The portobello burger had an amazing umami flavor and the (huge) sweet potato tots are nothing short of addicting. They were crispy on the out side and creamy on the inside. Ive never had anything like those before! They had lots of vegan side options like fries and fried pickles and fried portobello strips and a white bean dipping sauce that I cant wait to try.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered a classic burger with the regular hand cut fries. He eats a burger at pretty much every place we go and he absolutely loved this one. His fries were so yummy-- I know because I kept eating them too. \n\nThe other night my boyfriend ordered takeout from here and they package the food in 100% recycled cardboard which made me say to myself, now I HAVE to write a review. \n\nThe guy who I presume is the owner is a super nice guy. Go support this local gem of a place, you wont regret it!
