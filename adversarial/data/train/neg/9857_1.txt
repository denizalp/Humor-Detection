I am an enormous fan of the food and the atmosphere here. I will have to admit that i only order one thing off the menu and it is fantastic every time i get it. \nThis fabulous delight is called the Blue burger, which is a hamburger patty stuffed with blue cheese then grilled to perfection, but it doesn't stop there.\nOnce finished with the grill itis placed on a chibatta bun and served with lettuce and a side of Buffalo wing sauce for dipping, which if your a fan of all things buffalo makes this burger one of the best.\nThrow in a side of fries and a glass of the Malbec and you're on the right road home. \nThe service is basically OK and i have never had a n issue with them, but the food would more than make up for any impolite server as once the burger arrives its just me and the deliciousness in the room.
