Maya did my makeup and I had Aisha doing my hair for my wedding. They did an incredible job!! They came to my hotel on time the morning of the wedding and completed, me, my mother and my 3 bridesmaids. All were very happy with the result. My makeup and hair lasted all evening without any problems at all!! I did trials for both (which I highly recommend as I was not giving very good communication about what I wanted but it allowed us a chance to figure it out). The only criticism I would have is that the communication was sometimes a bit relaxed and as I am a type A personality, I found that a bit frustrating. The important thing is to trust them though, because they deliver!
