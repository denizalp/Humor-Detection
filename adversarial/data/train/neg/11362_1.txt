This place has gone downhill in the past year. Went to Tender last night for Mother's Day. They forgot to make their wine order so the bottle of wine I wanted, they didn't have. Fine. Ordered the cheese board ($35). Had 6 slices of cheese. 7 pieces of sliced meats (venison, smoked something and rabbit??) Awful. We used to come to this restaurant just for the board, now we will never return because of it. Ordered shrimp cocktail ($20) 4 shrimp...smh. Finally we ordered three side dishes. Creamed spinach (Mom said it had soured), Augratin potatoes (they we served in a skillet, guy says careful they are hot...they were warm at best. The dollop of sour cream they placed on top stayed the entire time. If sour cream isn't melting, something isn't remotely hot.) and finally the mushrooms. Out of everything we ordered the side dish of mushrooms was the best part. The service sucked royally. They didn't ask us once how we were doing.  I don't usually write about bad experiences, but I figured with Las Vegas being a vast place with 1000s of places to eat. Be warned about dining here. *Manager took off the side dishes, but by that point the entire experience was already ruined. He made no effort to make it right. We asked for the check with the table full of food and left. Tisk tisk.
