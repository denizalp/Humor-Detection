My air-condition unit was acting up. one of my neighbor recommended AHR Mechanical. they came the very next day. Lee was attending the call. I have all praises for him. very professional called 30 minutes before coming to he house. As he was checking he explained every thing when I asked questions and was not pushing on selling packages. \nI was given a detailed report with his recommendations . As far as the issue was concerned it was a small fix in the thermostat. this service was 75$ worth but due to first time customer it was free for me. I am very thankful to  my neighbor as well as Lee from AHR.
