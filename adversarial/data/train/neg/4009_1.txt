Came here last week it was soo amazing!!! Go on gourmet night-friday Saturday for king crab and rack of Lamb it's worth it. \n\nWhat I like the most is the shrimp cocktail which is juicy and flavorful!!! Sooo good I ate a whole plate. ALL the foods served r high quality and something that you'd pay big bucks for if u ate it alone at a nice restaurant. I sat for two hours just eating and eating.\n\nThe dessert is also amazing they have good huge chocolate dipped strawberries and creamy cheesecake. \n\nOur server was a sweet man who went out of his way to make us feel comfortable. We noticed some tables left only two dollar tips...uh wtf u cheap asses. You're supposed to leave at least 15%. Even if it's a buffet the service is amazing so ppl should really not be cheap. It costs 37 to get in so obviously u can't be that poor if ure willing to spend that much on urself to not leave a decent tip. So rude!\n\nWhat I hate about buffets though is that ppl cut u in line and go all crazy!! Seriously this is a buffet and the food is going to keep coming. Calm down! I literally got man handled by an old lady while getting pasta wtf\n\nDone w the ranting but yes come here when ur in Vegas it's soooo good!
