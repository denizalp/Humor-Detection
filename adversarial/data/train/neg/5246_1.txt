This is our 'go to' spot for a great meal. Service is attentive without being too fawning, food is great, drinks are good - what more could you want?\n\nOur table had prime rib, cauliflower 'steak', jumbo shrimp and Ahi tuna. It was all cooked to perfection and flavourful. \n\nFor meat and seafood downtown - it's your best choice.
