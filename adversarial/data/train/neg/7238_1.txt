I'm really disappointed. We got married May 8th, we were unable too see our photo proofs until a week later (even after numerous calls). We just now received our photos and the quality is horrible! We got higher quility photos from our cell phones. \n\nVery disappointed & we would not recommend this chapel. Vegas or not, they really need to raise their standard.
