Spent some quality time at the bar with Greg the awesome bartender recommending several great Canadian craft beer choices. Also had a Bistro Salad which was very nice and light. Finished off with their homemade vanilla bourbon ice cream topped with a caramel sauce, by far the best ice cream I've ever had.
