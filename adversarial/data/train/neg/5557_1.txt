I am the mirage nail salon is really clean and professional employees I always get my nails done by Tony he is really good at his skills and always does my nails exactly the way I like it. Tony Is amazing he's from the Midwest and he knows how to do nails really well if you come you should ask for help and you won't regret itand I like that when I come in I don't have to wait a long time to get my nails done usually I don't wait more than five minutes before and I never schedule an appointment.
