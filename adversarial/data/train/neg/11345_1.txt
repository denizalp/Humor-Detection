I like their macarons here. I've tried pistachio (they alternate between a green or purple filling though..), salted caramel, chocolate, raspberry, and black sesame. I like the girls because they're nice, pay attention, and fix any mistakes they might have made. I don't like that one guy who's probably just there to look like a pretty boy! I told him THREE times that I wanted 3 pistachio macarons because he kept making me repeat myself. What does he do? He freaking gives me just one. Thankfully, I only got charged for one.
