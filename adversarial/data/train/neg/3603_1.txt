I feel horrible to give a 1-star, but here are my reasons:\n- They forced a $3 'charge tip' on our receipt and we didn't catch it until after the fact! It's so sneaky because the receipt otherwise has another section where you can STILL tip them. I didn't appreciate this at all, especially with their 'ok' customer service. Please see the next line!\n- The customer service is not amazing! I asked the lady at the register (where you order) to remove the artichokes in the Tuscan sandwich and substitute it with another vegetable. She was completely unaccommodating and wanted to charge me for this, so I said nevermind! Otherwise, once you get handed a basket, you're on your own! Nobody will come to make sure everything is ok or the table is clean! Basically no service!\n- It is SO expensive!!! Apparently sandwiches were $10. Now they are $10.95, no sides, chips, salad or beverage included.  Without the groupon, it cost us $29 for 2 sandwiches and 1 chips (which includes $3 forced tip and tax). I would recommend you bring your own beverages and chips next time. It's really not worth it to order food to go from here. The whole point of them charging $11 a sandwich is because of the farm ambiance! So you might as well sit there and enjoy it! \n- They can take VERY long to prepare the food! Which was our experience the first time we went there! \n\nWith that said, keep in mind the food itself is pretty good (in my opinion) and the setting\/ambiance is so nice, relaxing and has an old classic farm feel!
