Frank and Fina's is equal parts delicious and adorable. \n\nThis place is just so cute! I love everything about how it looks in here - the lighting, the high ceilings, the decor. It's just a very nice atmosphere to have a reasonably priced delicious meal while experiencing excellent service. \n\nIt is locally owned and operated which makes my heart sing. When I say locally operated I mean it! Most likely it will be Frank taking your order and delivering your tasty meal. The service here is very family friendly. We have taken our daughter (11 months) and they were very complimentary and accommodating. \n\nThe food is very good! I absolutely love the sweet potato enchiladas. Also excellent are the chicken enchiladas and chicken tamale. I also really love the salsa here and have tried most of the starters. All yummy! You really can't go wrong!
