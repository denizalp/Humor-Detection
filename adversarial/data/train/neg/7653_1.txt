Ate here with my special friend on a special date. The atmosphere was wonderful and the chef came out and greeted us since our waitress told him we were from out of state and this was our first time. This has to be one of the best steaks I've ever endulged in to be matched up with a gorgeous array of asparagus & loaded smashed potatoes.
