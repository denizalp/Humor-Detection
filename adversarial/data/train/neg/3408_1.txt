Nice ambiance, sectioned off eating areas provide good privacy in most areas. Appatizers are To Die For!! We've found that the food is hit and miss, with the garlic used on mains sometimes extremely overwhelming.  But when it's good, it's great! The prices are reasonable. Service is good. The salmon is our favorite. Definitely worth a try, may turn into a favour spot. Make sure you try the grilled eggplant Appatizers,  it's the best!
