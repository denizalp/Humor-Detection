Amazing selection of produce, ranging from anywhere to locally grown to organic. Fruits and vegetables are always stacked neatly.\n\nThey offer a wide variety of fresh meats. The organically raised beef and chicken to appeal to health junkies like me. The cheese department is bound to satisfy any cheese lover. You get great service and great products for a price that's usually cheaper than Loblaw's. \n\nThey also have kombucha here for $3.99\/bottle.\n\nThey used to have organic Italian honey here, but they don't stock any of that yummy goodness there anymore.\n\nThis store puts Loblaw's and Sobeys to shame.
