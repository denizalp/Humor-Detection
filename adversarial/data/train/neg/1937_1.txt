Classic Japanese restaurant. Great deals for food and combo options. Layout is very nice where you're able to sit in more private sections if needing intimacy or you can choose to sit at Counter or  open tables. Service is pretty good, everyone is nice and friendly, sometimes takes awhile but everyone is always polite and fills you in on everything. No complaints here! I like how it borders st james park great location!
