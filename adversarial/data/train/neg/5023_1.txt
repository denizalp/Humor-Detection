The Town Crier Pub is a great place to be adventurous as they have over 50 beers on offer.  The servers and super friendly and helpful with making recommendations based on your preferences.  I love the genuine British pub decor as it makes it feel so cozy and quaint.  I've been here several times for the wide variety of beer but just recently tried their food which definitely didn't disappoint.  I had the cordon bleu schnitzel and my friend had the smoked salmon flatbread.  Both tasted great and the portions were generous.  Highly recommend the Town Crier!
