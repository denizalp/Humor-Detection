It makes me really sad to read these reviews, I have gone to a few different treatment centers  and I promise you that American Addiction Centers is as nice as they get,  As we learn in recovery, rehab is NOT A LONG TERM SOLUTION, it is a temporary one but in my story it was a very necessary one. American Addiction Centers was supportive and stuck to a routine which was crucial. they gave me a SAFE medical detox and they provided an introduction to NA (and many other fellowships) which I am now a member of and picked up my one year on 11-18-2015. I could NOT have done it without the LOVING SUPPORT and education of AAC, I am grateful. PLEASE, IT is a matter of life and death with addiction, they are not a mistake, I was MUCH safer there then anywhere else. if I didnt travel as far as I did i just would have left and came home
