Happy to have discovered this little gem of a place.  Sometimes we have a bit of a sweet tooth and go out for some of the grocery store stuff.  It's good, but this is way better!  Home made ice cream in some pretty interesting flavors.  The young ladies working were very pleasant, an absolute joy to deal with.  Looks like they have plenty of regular customers and think we just might be some too!
