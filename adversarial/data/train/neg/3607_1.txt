Even if you do not plan on having babies, like me, it is worthwhile to consider the Midwife Center for health services having to do with the reproductive system. With a warm environment and a super caring knowledgeable staff who are accustomed to assisting families through that big deal known as childbirth, I feel very comfortable in the competent hands of the midwives. Since their specialty is caring for pregnant women, I think that they are more attentive of subtle gynecological problems, as even minor problems for the average woman can be serious problems to one with child.\n\nOn Friday afternoons, they offer cheap and\/or free services to those without insurance on a tight budget in cooperation with a project of AdiagoHealth; an excellent opportunity to get tested for STIs and an annual check-up.
