We hired this company to help us with finding a lost pet. They responded quickly so that was a good sign, Their prices were not as reasonable as the other competitors but they were prompt to respond so we went with them.  Big mistake. After spending twice as much for flyer delivery, they did not follow our instructions regarding delivery route nor did they deliver to locations marked as delivered. I will never recommend this company to anyone. They will not return our phone calls and we are out the cost of the flyers as well as the cost of delivery.
