Staff was very friendly and helpful with all my vegan questions and requests. And the food was super good my fiance loved his BBQ chicken with smoked Gouda. And the hummus and fries were great. Are server was very friendly also, I couldn't eat it but their HUGE dessert look so yummy made me wish I wasn't vegan haha or that they had substitute everything.
