Amazing staff that helped me when I got my 11 month old cat Danerys spayed ! They were super informative the entire way through and were available to answer all of my questions and concerns post op. The first day she was very dazed and confused but afterwards she has shown 0 signs of pain and the incision has healed perfectly so far. They also have a really cool option of adding a microchip, nail trim, and the post surgery cone that's needed for a discounted price when you pay for their services. Highly highly recommend this affordable and amazing option if your regular vet is out of your price range for spay or neuter.
