Awful! My daughter and I went for the same service and I got charged $5 more. Each tech must make up their own price or something. When I mentioned the price difference, the tech made a comment about me complaining and that price was cheap, in Vietnamese, not expecting me to answer her back in Vietnamese and telling her that they were ridiculous with their prices. Jaws dropping throughout the salon. They aren't upfront with their pricing and I had to have another tech clean up the first ones polish job. So for you Americans that wonder if these folks talk about you. The answer is yes.
