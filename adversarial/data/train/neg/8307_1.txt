Great place to get a cold drink and bite to eat.  There are 2 sections of the restaurant, one down stairs which you don't need to wait in line on the weekends to get into and the upstairs bar, you will need to wait in line forever to get in.\n\nI was just visiting the city one night and stopped by here for a quick drink, I ordered Mackinnon Bros. Hefeweizen.  I love wheat beers so this is one of the drinks that I just had to try as I like to try different local beer products.  The booze was very smooth and easy to go down with.\n\nDefinitely stop by here early if you want to grab a seat and a bite to eat.
