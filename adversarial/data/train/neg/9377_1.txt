Progressive Insurance is a joke. I have had a policy with them for 6 years, then with zero claims on said policy my premium increased. I cancelled the policy 1 day after monthly premium payment was made. Instead of receiving a refund like I should have, I was informed I have to pay another $22. I was told by customer service that the keep 10% of total premium on cancellation. Buh bye Progressive...you lost my business and everyone else's that I can convince to never use you!
