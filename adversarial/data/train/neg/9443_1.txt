Knowing what your getting yourself into at this place is key. They are a raw, vegan restaurant that is mostly gluten free. Gotta be in the mood for a healthy plate of veggies, vs. a carb or meat bomb.\n\nFirst time at the new location and second time visiting and we had a nice experience. Again, cause this time I knew what I was getting myself into. Throughly enjoyed the living burrito with the garden salad. The ingredients are treated with so much respect that your plate of food is almost like a mini work of art. \n\nThe husband ordered the pad thai and thought it was good, although it was a bit of a loose interpretation of the dish. It was however more filling than other plates we have had here in the past. \n\nThe service is a bit slow and the atmosphere a touch on the pretentious side, but I am grateful that there are places like this around that cater to those that like to eat on the healthier side.\n\nOther note is that the unsweet tea was a bit odd, but after I drank a couple glasses, I am rather taken with it now. It seemed to have a hint of vanilla which surprised me at first.
