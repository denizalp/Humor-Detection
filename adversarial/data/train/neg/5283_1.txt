I decided to have a \"me\" day last weekend. I was interested in a 90 minute massage and facial. I checked out all of the spas in the city (Hamman, Stillwater etc) and could not believe the prices. I found Senses Spa at the Sheraton Centre. The prices were literally half of the other spas I was looking at. Exact same service! My massage was incredible. I've never had a facial before so I didn't know what to expect. WOW, talk about relaxing. I actually fell asleep for a few minutes during the facial. I walked out of there feeling refreshed and relaxed. I would highly recommend Senses spa. The prices are affordable. Sure, it doesn't  have the cache of an upscale spa but when you're lying on the table being worked on, who really cares where you are as long as the service is good.
