Yvonne, has a great personality, is very attentive to detail and did a great job fixing my nails! Being in town longer than planned, having broke a few, and way overdue I was a hot mess!! She not only worked me in by staying late, she was wonderful in making my nails pretty again!! Thank you for being so awesome!! Highly recommended her!!!
