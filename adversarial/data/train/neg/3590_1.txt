Okay I am not happy about my visit to sugar factory recently. We've been before, twice in fact, and the food was really great.  But this time, the meat was fatty and flavorless, the scallop potatoes uncooked, and they were out of green beans, which are my all time favorite. The only thing that was insanely good were the fries and Chocolate Milkshake, but that really doesn't warrant a free pass on the bad food. Maybe it has to do with the change in ownership?
