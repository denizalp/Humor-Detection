I celebrated my birthday with a Sunday brunch at the newest Sugar Factory location at Town Square.  From the moment I walked up to the host stand outside, I was treated like a king!  The table I'd reserved was ready and waiting and we were seated promptly.\n\nOur server, Josh, truly made the experience incredible.  He was attentive to every detail of our meal and went above and beyond to make the day really special. The bartender, Kaylie (sorry if that's misspelled!) whipped up a HUGE variety of mimosas and Bloody Marys for the table and even came by to personally make sure we were enjoying some of her signature creations!  Very nice touch!\n\nThe food was awesome and I heard compliments from everyone at the table that they truly enjoyed the dining experience.  The management capped the meal off with a huge birthday sundae surprise, too!  Completely unexpected and VERY delicious!  I couldn't have asked for a better celebration!  THANK YOU SUGAR FACTORY!!!
