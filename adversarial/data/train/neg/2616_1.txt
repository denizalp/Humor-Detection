My wife and I had a late breakfast at Scramble earlier this morning. We live nearby and passed by it countless times, but this was our first time stopping in. The first surprise was the restaurant does not offer traditional waiter service. You order and pay when you arrive, and the food is brought to your table when it's ready. Technically speaking, it's fast food. Our food arrived promptly, and my wife's initial reaction was her omelet was the best she ever had. The potatoes that came with my biscuits and sausage gravy were delightful. However, the biscuits themselves were just okay, and the sausage gravy was merely so-so. The contemporary atmosphere was mostly pleasant, although the numerous televisions were a distraction. The place is definitely not cheap. With one breakfast entree and one beverage each, we paid about $22 for the two of us. It might be good for an occasional splurge with out-of-town guests, but it certainly won't become a regular breakfast joint.
