Just to say, my daughter and I did go to \"The Big T'zz\" for a long time, then one day we went and my daughter got her hair done \"RED\" and we went home. We thought everything was fine, but we noticed that there were patches of her hair had brown patches that didn't get any red on there. My daughter was crying all day. So I called \"The Big T'zz\" and I left a voice message (no one called me back) e-mailed them. Still no one got back to me. I FELTED THAT NO ONE CARED!!!!! In the end we had to find another hair Solon to fix the hack job that \"The Big T'zz\" did. \nNEVER WILL I GO THERE, EVER. \nWe went there for so long, no more. \nThat was about 3years ago. \nNow we go to a better hair Solon.  \nOne that cares a lot about there clients.
