Super young environment. If you like hip hop they play a mixture of old and new. Outside they play alternative and rock which isn't really my thing but it's safe to say they play a mixture of something everyone would like. I think it's cool that there are pool tables inside and a decent size dance floor. It's a great place to go on first Fridays. I'd say check it out.
