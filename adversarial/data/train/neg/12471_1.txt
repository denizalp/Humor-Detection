Good food and cool atmosphere but consistently bad service. All 3 occasions I've tried to overlook the service but tonight I can't accept this. Water refills are a chore. Absent minded servers (all 3 times). Over 45 minutes for our server to take the order. I had to get her at the server station. No exaggeration. Appetizers came in an orderly fashion but we never saw a manager on the floor or touching tables. Basically a cool concept with zero clue about service standards or delivering a guest experience. I figure this starts with lackadaisical leadership at an owner level because the lack of management is apparent here and in their other concepts. That's a shame.
