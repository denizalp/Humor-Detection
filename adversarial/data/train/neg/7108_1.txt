We have to get crepes from La Creperie every time we're in Vegas. Ahhh, how delicious they are. It seems the price goes up annually, but 1 crepe is enough for a meal. The most difficult thing is to choose what kind to have. The savory crepes are just as delicious as the sweet ones. This is a fairly inexpensive way to eat in Vegas, and since it's a casual seat-yourself setting, good for kids and a quick meal without having to pay tips or wait to be served. Did I mention these crepes are absurdly delicious?! My favorite - the Napoleon; lemon custard with berries. Now I'm hungry...
