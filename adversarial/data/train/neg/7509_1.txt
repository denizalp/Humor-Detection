WARNING!!!  I was prepared to write a nice review regarding our experience with Beltmann.  Mark Rankin who came out and gave us the estimate was very pleasant to work with.  He explained to me that he was basing our move on time and if the guys got done early then the cost would be less.  BUT on moving day (hottest day of the year so far) our driver who was in charge of the crew informed us that they could go really fast and get our things packed up and into the truck or go really slow and take their time, but either way it would be the same price.  That was very different that was I was told, but at that point, I had budgeted for the cost estimate, and it was hot, so I wanted to get it done as quickly as possible.  (STRIKE 1)\n\nI had two boxes of wine on the floor by the wine fridge that I hadn't moved into my - take with me pile.  They taped those boxes up and took them with them - hmmm I didn't think they were allowed to take alcohol??  (STRIKE 2)\n\nMove-in day...arrived an hour late because they had to take a load to the dump first...then after they left and I got a chance to really look over my furniture, I discovered that 4 of my 6 leather dining chairs were scuffed, torn, ripped from cinching the moving strap too tightly across them.    Now to replace those chairs it will be $550.  When filing a claim with Beltmann, I'll be receiving $50..it's based on weight.   (STRIKE 3)\n\nSO BE WARNED...take out the insurance, read the fine print and even though you are being pulled in 100 different directions, be sure to watch how they put your furniture in the truck!
