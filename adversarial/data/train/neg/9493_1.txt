Four stars for their great food and a very eclectic breakfast menu. FIVE STARS for our server Maria. Hard working, but very friendly and always close by if you need something. ONE STAR for the dumbest policy on refills for \" Iced Coffee\". No acually, NO STARS......Stupid.\nIf your drinking hot coffee, refills are free. BUT, if they have to pour the same coffee into a glass filled with ice, they want to charge you. Also can someone tell me why Iced Tea refills are free but Iced Coffee is not?\nJust think about that for a moment........\nSOMEBODY, at corporate read this....please......Whoever put that policy in place is clueless ,.......sorry. \nActive vibe,  very open,  but always crowded, lots of family's, ( cool).\nGet their early, especially on Sunday. Also\nparking  at this location  can be very tight  on the weekends. Ciao.
