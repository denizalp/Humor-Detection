I like coming to this buffet at the tail-end of Sunday brunch, right when dinner options are about to come out.  Why?  Because I can still capitalize on the mimosas, get my eggs benedict and bacon, and STILL get my dinner options.  It's a win-win, really.  The overall dessert bar is better here than at the Wynn, but they don't have a gelato bar (fail).
