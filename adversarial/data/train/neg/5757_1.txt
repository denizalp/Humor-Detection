Best meal I've ever had in Vegas. \nBeen to Vegas over 10 times in the past 15 yrs and have seen Vegas go from great cheap eats to highend style-over-substance restaurants. \n\nIf your looking for an honest delicious meal, and great personal service come here.  If ur looking for a subpar meal at a high price stay on the strip. \n\nRecommended: loco moco, Fried mandu, kimchi, combo plate, fried rice (just like my mom used to do it, with spam!!).
