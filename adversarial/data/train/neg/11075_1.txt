I have been here several times and there are things that I like and don't like about this place. \n\nThe Good \nThe prices aren't too bad. You get one Hookah and three hoses and it will costs you like 15 bucks which isn't bad for three people going to smoke hookah. The service isn't bad you can always get fresh coals and the Hookah's come out pretty fast. The location is nice located on the strip in southside which makes easy to get to when you are hitting up the bars on the strip. \n\nThe Bad \nI have been to Hookah bars in the past that are much more luxurious. Low seating with cushions and pillows with curtains making the smoking area's seem more private. Hookah Bookah has none of this. It feels more like a crappy coffee bar that you smoke Hookah in than a Arabian Hookah den. The bathrooms are kind of gross and that's coming from a guy, so you know it's bad. Sometimes is so packed that you can't get a seat and even if you could it's hard to breath in there with so much smoke circulating. \n\nOver all it's nat a bad place to hit up after going to the bar. Next time you are in the area give it a go if you can find a place to sit.
