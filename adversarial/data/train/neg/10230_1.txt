Loved this little place when we were last in Charlotte.  We grabbed an early dinner of small plates while we were walking through the Fourth Ward.  Everything we ordered was delicious, and our server was knowledgeable and friendly.  I'll definitely make a point to come back.\n\nAlthough we loved everything, here's a breakdown on each dish:\nThe Southern Caprese = heavenly.  CC said this mozzarella is what all mozzarella wishes it could be.  This unique twist on a caprese is what every caprese wishes it could be.\nTuna Tartare - succulent tuna, with a nice bite\nSauteed Scallops - perfectly cooked, tender.  The macadamia nuts make a nice variation of texture.\nProsciutto Crostini - the flavors blended together perfectly\nMac n' cheese - delicious, smoky flavor.  However, with how out-of-this-world most of the other dishes were, it falls a little lower on my list.
