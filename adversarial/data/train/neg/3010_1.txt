This place is amazing! We went at 14 weeks and found out we're having a baby boy. So excited!! I waited to write the review once we went to our anatomy ultrasound at 19 weeks to make sure Courtney was right before I shout her praises!! And of course she was. It was very enjoyable experience. Adorable office and the photo opp was a bonus! We are planning to return for every pregnancy and later on for 3D package.
