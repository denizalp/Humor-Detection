I would say, \"you can't come to Vegas and not see the fountains\", but that's an understatement.  I live here and I literally stop to watch and listen every time I pass them!  What a grand and beautiful show in front of the Bellagio - one of those things that's a thrill to watch each and every time you're lucky enough to do so.  As often as I go when people visit, I still always hear new songs.    One of those Las Vegas sites that just never gets old :)
