My wife and I have been to a number of mattress stores all over the valley searching for just the right mattress. All of them seemed very pushy to me, trying to sell us on mattresses that just didn't feel right to us. You know, a good night's sleep is important to everyone, so we weren't going to be pushed into buying something we didn't feel good about, even if they offer 30-day money-back guarantees. That's a lot of hassle to go through.\n\nThe last place we stopped was the Pure Comfort Mattress Store in Gilbert. I sure wish it were the first place we had stopped though, because they were so accommodating, not pushy and actually had several that felt perfect to us. It's been 2 months now and we still love this mattress. They even called to follow up and see how it was working out for us. We highly recommend this mattress store in Gilbert.
