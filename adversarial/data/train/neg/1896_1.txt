Hands down, this place is amazing! Service is great as well as the food. I'm in love with the chicken artichoke pizza. The flavors are amazing and the pizza seems so light. The crust is also something to be happy about. I'm generally not a fan of pizza crust, but Biaggio's has the bet texture. \nI must also add that speaking to Biaggio is always entertaining. He is one of the nicest people I have met and he's always happy to make delicious suggestions!
