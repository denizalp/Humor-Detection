Mediocre at best. Nothing about this place will make me want to return. When I did a yelp search for thia food Gaati was rated #1 and so I assumed it would be great food and the Thia fix I needed. No. My red curry was basically tasteless and my tum yum with shrimp had no lemongrass aromas freshness that I enjoy so much. It tastes like boring sweet and sour soup. Even my Thai tea was a dud. I placed an order online and had to go back because they forgot to add the rice for the curry :\/ \nLike I said, my over all experience  and food wAs Bla  at best. Will not be reordering from here again.
