I was sooo excited to have a new pizza joint open up in my 'hood that does \"By the Slice\".  I am somewhat of a pizza addict,  so I was literally jumping up and down in excitement when I saw this place open up next to my local Depanneur. \n\nBut, alas, even tho the slices taste absolutely amazing,  I have to give this 2 stars to make up for how disappointed I am about the value. I have no problem paying $3.75 for a slice if it would fill me up, but this slice is thinner than the paper plate it comes on.  \n\nThe flavour is out of this world, don't get me wrong, but you need to buy 2 slices to  feel anywhere near full, and at that point you might as well have gotten a more substantial burrito at Tejano or some tacos at the new Frieda place for the same price. This is basically an expensive (albeit mouthwateringly delicious) snack.  Just like a typical  st. Henri restaurant, the prices are wayyy too high for what you're getting.  \n\nThat being said, I'm a pizza freak so I'll probably still get the slices here when I'm having a craving just because it's convenient and it's on the way home.  I'm also looking forward to them being open a bit later than 7pm.
