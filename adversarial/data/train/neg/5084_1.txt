We recently had some incidents around our neighborhood and one at our residence so we decided to install some cameras.  We bought a Samsung system on Amazon and after getting some ridiculous estimates, we went with the much more reasonable estimate from Smart Security.  Smart Security gave us their estimate right over the phone; other companies wanted to come out which just made me feel like they wanted to get a feel for how much they could get away with charging us.  They were able to come out 2 days later which was great.  Tyler and Dalston (sp) showed up right on time.  We took some time to show where we wanted the cameras.  We made some changes based on their recommendations which made total sense.  They got right to work, they kept us informed all along the way, showing us different parts of the install and explaining any obstacles they ran into.  Also have to mention we had a more difficult install than most because we have some odd roof lines but they got it done.  Dalston had another job to get to in the afternoon - which they made us aware of prior to beginning -  but Tyler got the rest done in no time.  He adjusted all the cameras so we got the best view possible, cleaned up any mess made.  He was fantastic, he went way above and beyond, very friendly and trustworthy.  In conversation we mentioned we weren't happy with our current alarm company and he gave us some info on their service.  We have a year left on ours but will be calling them once we're done.  \nIf you're installing a security system, do yourself a favor and call these guys, then... just rest easy.
