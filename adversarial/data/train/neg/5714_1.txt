Definitely a gem of a place, any Nutella fan would love their Mocha with Nutella (the iced is just as amazing as it is hot). I've eaten the Early Bird sandwich twice for breakfast and enjoy it (it's a great portion size). My friends and I ate on the patio and it's awesome for people who like to bring their dogs! A neighborhood friendly place, and it's one of my favorites. I like their bruschetta for dinner too... and of course the Nutella Marscapone Cheesecake for dessert... Mmmm. Their staff is super busy on Saturday mornings, and can get busy during dinner times too, but they are friendly and nice.
