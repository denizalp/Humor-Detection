I have only had one root canal before many many years ago. I had to have it redone due to it getting infected. My Dr was Ethan Baker. I also arrived for a consult and the front desk assumed I was just going to go through with the procedure. The evaluation seemed rushed but after I was sure, everything went great. \n\nNathan knows you cant talk yet he will tell stories and talk to keep you comfortable. That was a nice change from other Dr's who are completely quiet. He also seems to say what he is doing next to keep you informed.\n\nWhile the initial arrival was rocky, it all went well and ended well. I would go back.
