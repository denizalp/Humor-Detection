I did on-line research and interviewed two other realtors before we made our decision to go with the Bill Olmstead team. We went solely on Bill's opinion for asking price for the area\/real estate market conditions. Other realtors wanted to list our townhouse $15,000 lower. We had multiple offers on our townhouse within a few days, and higher than we expected. The staging and professional photos provided by the Bill Olmstead team were stunning. Working with the entire team was a delight; quick to respond to all question. We plan on using Bill in the future when we sell our current home.
