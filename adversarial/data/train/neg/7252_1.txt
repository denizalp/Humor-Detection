This has been a location we've been wanting to try for quite some time to check out their tacos and margaritas. The hostess was very friendly and seated us outside on the little patio. Considered maybe some tequila or a margarita, we decided to opt out because of the service time, water did take some time to get to us. \n\nWe reviewed the menu and decided to get the chicken taquitos and the nachos to start. The water finally arrives, the chips and salsa had to be requested and was served after the appetizers were sent over? The nachos were fantastic but the taquitos seemed too plain for what it was advertised. At this point, it started to get a little chilly and we were out of water and the waitress was no where to be found so we decided it's time for the check. I'm thinking next time, tacos and staying inside the building.
