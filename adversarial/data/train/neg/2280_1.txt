ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. If I could give it zero stars I would. My mother (who will be buying my bridal gown) just came from this store with my aunt. They went in to look at mother of the bride dresses and asked to peek at the bridal gown section. Figuring they could take a look around to see if it was worthy of a  visit for me. It was not. But worse then the mediocre selection was the fact that the sales woman was stunningly rude. My mother asked about a gown and was told rudely 'well? Is 7,000 in your budget?' And without my mother being able to answer the sales woman added ' I thought so'\nFrankly, my mothers budget for my gown is 12,000. And not a penny will be spend in this store. By myself or any women in my family. I will be shopping where my sister got her gowns. She had a beautiful ballgown from kleinfield's for the ceremony and a lovey dropped waist grown for the reception from Amanda Lina's. Save yourself the headache and don't go here. Had I read the reviews prior to the visit. No one would have set foot in that shop. Awful.
