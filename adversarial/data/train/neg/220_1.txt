You can disregard my last review. this place got cocky and went to hell pretty quickly. \n1) service sucked. After waiting 10-15 minutes just to order, the waitress had no apologies. When the food came 5 minutes after that, and was sent back 3 times, she had nothing to say about that. When I went to go pay and the cashire asked about the food I told him it was horrible and he laughed then the waitress next to him said, \"ya we've been having issues with that for a while now.\"\n2) Food was tragic. cold, tastless, and off. \n3) the lounge was very random.  the drinks were weak, service slow, and I never got the money I cashed out! \n\nNot coming back, ever.
