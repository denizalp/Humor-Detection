I booked this hotel not knowing that the area it is in is apparently one of the least desirable locations in Toronto, after learning this fact I was a little apprehensive.\n\nShouldn't have been, it's in a large business area filled with hotels right off the highway, to add more security it's next door to a large police station\n\nThe staff were friendly if not useless ..... Asked for an extra pillow, said no they had none as the hotel was full??? Next day asked again .... They said they would bring one ... Never did ... Third time lucky ... Finally got one\n\nSame with the fridge ... Wasn't working took two days and several reminders for them to change it \n\nThe room was small and quite dark however clean and bed was comfortable enough \n\nRooms can be average and I'll return for the right price however poor service .... I'll give a more deserving hotel my money thanks
