Another Friday lunch mission to Scarborough. This time we decided to see how well Lick's could stand up compared to the Five Guys burgers down the street that we had visited a few weeks back. My opinion is a bit skewed as I decided to have a turkey burger on this lunch time stop, but I had a few people who at the beef \"Homeburger\" to keep things balanced.\n\nThe store itself is pretty clean, and had ample seating. There were only 3 people in line when we got there but it was at least 20 minutes before I had ordered and received our food back. The service was all pretty unpersonable at ordering, but at least while standing waiting at the topping area the woman said some pleasantries.\n\nAs for the food... As mentioned, I had the Gobbler (aka Turkey Burger - $5.49) with cheese (+$0.99), and back bacon (1 slice = $1.49). The sandwich was decent, but in all honesty I buy the Lick's Gobbler burgers at the grocery store and cook at home, and maybe its because Im using a flame barbecue, but I'd take that over the sandwich that was served up to me today. My dining companions who ate the Homeburger said that while being a decent burger, was not as good as Five Guys, and was overall a bit dry. The fries are also a losing situation. The quality was some of the most boring fries I've had in my life. Lots of salt and ketchup required to make it through the order.\n\nIn the end it was a $15 lunch that did provide the sustenance required to make it through the rest of the day, but reminded me to just stick with buying Lick's burgers at the grocery store and cooking them at home and save my dining out money for something better.
