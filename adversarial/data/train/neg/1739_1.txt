Probably the best Chinese Korean food in TO!\n\nPrior to trying this place Song Cook was my go-to place for Jam Pong but after three consecutive weekly visits to Iryewon I am sold! \n\nIf you like jam pong and kampunghi this is the place. Their noodles are made in house and their broth has a rich seafood taste.
