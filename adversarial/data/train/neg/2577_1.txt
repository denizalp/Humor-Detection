I'm really picky when it comes to thai food. I've tried a lot of different places but more importantly have personally known people from Thailand who have cooked authentically for me. The only reason this place gets less than 5 stars is because the service is weird, (sometimes slow) and I question the cleanliness. We've encountered pretty rude servers, but I didn't even care because it's some of the best restaurant thai food I've found so far. They have, hands down, my FAVORITE yellow curry (and I freaking LOVE YELLOW CURRY) it's so delicious. They have an amazing pad thai, that isn't too gooey, just the right amount of vinegary and peppery; all around amazing. So good!
