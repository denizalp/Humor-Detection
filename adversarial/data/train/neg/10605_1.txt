So truth be told, I'm sort of a boardgame lover. And No not like Candyland or Yahtzee. But a little more interesting in my opinion (obviously since it's my opinion). They have the Rio Grande games, and a lot of other ones that you would find up on http:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/ Pretty cool idea. You come with your friends, pay 5 bucks and you get access to their pretty large library of games. That 5 bucks lasts until close so you can really make it count. Granted while having fun you should also try their food as it's pretty good and get a drink or two. This seems like it is a popular spot, as it's pretty unique on it's own. \n\nFeeling like, damn that's too geeky. Well who cares, come anyways, you are surrounded by others who are cool with their geekiness.\n\nFeeling like, those games are too hard? Well they even have game gurus here who are pretty knowledgable and excited to offer help in selecting and even explaining some of the nuances of a lot of the games. Some are translated to English and the game developers are just that, not linguists remember. So the game gurus are pretty awesome.\n\nPersonal shout out to the game guru who suggested Riff Raff to me since I was looking for something out of the box and similar to jenga. Pretty cleverly designed and was just overall fun.\n\nYou can purchase games outside the seating area too. Pretty cool. I wish this sort of place existed elsewhere .. *cough* SF *cough*
