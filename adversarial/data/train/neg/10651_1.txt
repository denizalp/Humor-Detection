This place is most awesome. Where else can you buy 10 pounds of top quality fresh bacon for under $40! After finding out about this place, I make it a point to go at least weekly. Better meat than you can buy in the store. Between the 1\/4 cow we buy yearly and the meat I buy here, there is no need to buy the inferior crap at the big chain stores. Love meat science and so happy this place exists.
