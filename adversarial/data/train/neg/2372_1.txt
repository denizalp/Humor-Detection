I have been there several times.  The first, the restaurant was empty and the service was so poor.  The second, the wait for golf was 45 mins, but here was empty stalls to play golf.  The policy is they need to have servers at all stalls to be active.  I ended up just getting a refund and leaving.  I call and email to make comments, but no response. They simply don't care.  Great place, service sucks.  I think it about food and drinks then about the golf experience.
