Thank you Paul Branco! Fixed my phone with in the first two days of meeting them; came to my location and fixed my screen while using the best quality screen. (I have broken my screen numerous times over the past few years) so I know good screen quality when I see it. The process took 20 min. Very respectful, on time and I definitely recommend @myvanurfix verse any other \"fix repair stores\" \nPS: They also offer screen protectors.
