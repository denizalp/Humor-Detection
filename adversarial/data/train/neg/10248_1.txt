Maybe not one of the top 3 but definitely one of the most popular Vegas buffets.  Bellagio buffet is large, straightforward, not exactly opulent, but certainly nice and consistent enough to make one feel pretty good about paying the high-ish but rather reasonable price.  \n\nI've eaten here twice in two different trips to Vegas, each time pretty satisfied.  The selections are impressive and mostly good quality, though not any particular item stands out as amazing.  The Asian foods are not so great.  Rather than going for a fun or super posh interior, Bellagio chose sort of a nondescript upscale food court look that gets the job done but is in no way memorable.  \n\nSo in sum a solid, if not outstanding buffet.
