We were very pleased with the technician Dominic. We needed a garage door fixed.  He came when he said he would and was diligent in getting the door fixed for us.  The only reason the company did not receive a 5 out of 5 is due to their parts pricing.  The cost for the spring and the cable was 4 times what it would cost at Rona.  The mark up on the materials was overly excessive.
