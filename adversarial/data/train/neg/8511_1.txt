We were in desperate need of someone to fix MAJOR woodpecker damage on our 2 story home.  So glad that we ended up using E&S Painting!  Eduardo Sandoval and his employees were fantastic. They matched exactly the stucco on our house, and there was a lot of stucco repair that was needed.  They came back a few days later after the stucco had dried and repainted the entire west side of our home, plus other areas that had damage.  Our house looks brand new. Eduardo was a gem to work with.  Very polite, very thorough, as were his employees. We highly recommend Eduardo and his company.  We will definitely be using them again! Thanks, Eduardo!
