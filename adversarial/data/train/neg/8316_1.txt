Love this studio! The owners, Lisa and Mike, are amazing. The studio is big! There is a large yoga room that can accommodate up to (approx.) 55 students. The changerooms are big, with individual showers and they have lockers for daily use. The lobby is nice with a seating area. This is the kind of studio where you feel so welcome, it really feels like home. They've been open for 6 years and I think they have earned \"Top Yoga Studio\" in Mississauga for 5 years in a row. They deserve it! Even all of the students are so friendly and welcoming. When someone new comes for class, they are so encouraging and want to help them and give them tips for their new yoga practice. I can't say enough good things about this place. Thank you Lisa and Mike for building such a beautiful studio and amazing yoga community.
