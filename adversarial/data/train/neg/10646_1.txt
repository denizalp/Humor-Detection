I love Wildflower! Perfect place for a lunch date with a friend! Often times I pick up Wildflower bread, salad, or soup and supplement them into my dinner plans at home. I particularly love the service at this location. They are always fast and super friendly! I've had little \"enjoy\" letters in my to-go bag and once forgot a muffin at the register and the cashier ran out to my car. I appreciate all their service with a smile
