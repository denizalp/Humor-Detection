This is a home warranty vendor, and like some home warranty vendors, they are not interested in resolving the actual issue they are dispatched for.\n\nThey will charge rates that are double or triple the standard so that they can invoice your home warranty company for exorbitant amounts, which your warranty company will want to pass on to you, only using the vendor's testimony as evidence.\n\nVendors like this are why home warranty vendors get a bad wrap.
