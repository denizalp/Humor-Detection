When it comes to professionalism, Charles gets 5-stars and beyond!  I first went to him for a Botox fix-up (resulting from another person's technique) and he recommended that we not do the injection, as it might make things worse.  \nWhile others may not have had the same professional objectivity, I completely appreciated his clinical candor.  As a nurse and lawyer, I respect people of such high professional caliber, especially in a cosmetic medspa environment.  \nWhen the time comes to do some \"work\", Charles will definitely be on the top of my list for people to see.  \nHuge praise to Charles and Glo MedSpa!
