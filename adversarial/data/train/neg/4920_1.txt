I rarely give a 5-star rating with a place like Monarch you can't go any other way. Everything from the atmosphere, to service, to food was beyond superb. Price is on the high-end but it's worth it because the whole evening will be a night you won't forget. Every spot in the restaurant was thoughtfully decorated with its own unique charm, even the bathroom! The outside patio had lights to make the space feel intimate and romantic, and speakeasy type music playing to match the vibe of the restaurant. \n\nThe 4-course meal is excellent, I mean truly, every course is mouthwatering good! We started with cauliflower soup with white truffle oil drizzled on top, the perfect blend of flavors to start the meal! The main dish we got steak and Seabass - both are good but if I were to recommend one I'd go with steak, melts in your mouth, perfectly prepared, it'll rock your world!\n\nAll staff go out of their way to make the night feel special, they even brought my mom a cute little gift and free dessert for her birthday! Particularly shout out to our waiter Sam, who really helped enhance the experience for us. Great for a special occasion or nice date... either way it'll be a dining experience you won't forget.
