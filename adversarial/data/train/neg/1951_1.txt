The line is too long. I've been here 3 times and never got to eat because the line was longer than my lunch break. You have to wait an hour and a half just to order. Stay away until they learn how to run a business.\n\nAlso no to go orders over the phone so you can't even plan for your day. There is no way to eat here without waiting perpetually. Good luck\n\nEdit:\n\nI called today at lunch and the wait was only 15 minutes. Not bad! Went there and got a pickup order and it was amazing. They know how to cook.
