They say this is the best Montréal fried chicken you can get. \n\nI must admit it for the price & quality & quantity. Not bad place at all.\n\nI went to this place with most of my friends to try.\n\nTheir chicken nuggets are really good. Only one thing is you pay 1$ to add spicy but you can't taste it. You may see few red pepper.\n\nI specially like their fries. Really good just like the one at Blanche Neiges on street Côté Des Neiges.
