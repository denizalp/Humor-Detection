I didn't really see any evidence of the fresh fruit they claim to use, but my drink was good, so I don't really care. My taro milk tea was just right, and $3.50 for a medium is super cheap. Especially considering that the medium is MASSIVE.\nThere are some tables to sit at, but you won't stay, unless you're getting snacks to eat.. The place has all the ambiance of an old gas station...\nOh, and if you like getting your feet massaged.. Well, just grab your tea and walk through the curtain to Good Feet or whatever it's called... Kinda weird, but again, the drink was good, cheap, and big, and that's all I really cared about.
