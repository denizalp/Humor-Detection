This was a very cool exhibit, with lots of neat movie props, costumes, plus a handful of interactive kiosks! It takes about 45 minutes to walk through. There was a tour guide, but he let the group set the pace. However, I'm not sure it's worth paying full price (plus a $5 ticket fee\/ticket). We had a 2-for-1 coupon, which made the price reasonable for the experience. I'd recommend checking it out, but look for a deal online before going.
