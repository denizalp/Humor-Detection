Had lunch here with my daughter while she was visiting in town.  The food wasn't all that impressive but decent.  The service on the other hand was deplorable.  Although there was a very small lunch crowd and several people on staff they were very slow to attend to us.  Food was delivered with no utensils or napkins, getting water refills and drink orders was impossible and never got the ashtray they said they'd bring.  We sat on the patio and had to go inside to make request several times.
