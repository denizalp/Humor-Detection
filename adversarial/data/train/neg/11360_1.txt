This is our go-to Korean place now. We live nearby and have tried most of the Korean restaurants. The stewed chicken soup is a rare delicacy for a healthful hearty meal. The beef blood spicy soup is amazing for those who are adventurous. The spicy seafood and rice soup is totally rich and delicious. The panchan (the free side dishes) as the freshest we've had on this street. Love Kimchi House
