They have some wonderful things (like the ricotta-stuffed gnocchi and olive spread). The prices really are too high for a lot of the items, but that would be more acceptable if the whole experience were good. I can't give it a higher rating because the service is terrible (and I have been there a few times). It is not that the people are not nice, it is just so unorganized. And if you want more than one thing (like fresh sausage and then a sandwich), you will have to wait in TWO lines. If they could simply organize the flow of the service, I believe many more people would find the experience of going there better.
