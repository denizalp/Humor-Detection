It's sad seeing Blockbuster dwindle down to basically a dvd storage facility. Regardless, I go here when I want to watch a movie that won't buffer every few minutes. They have a decent selection of the newest released movies and the same during-movie snacks I depend on.\n\nAlways a relatively charming experience and a consistent place for me to go for movies... until Netflix and Redbox deliver the death blow.
