My daughter wanted pancakes in the middle of the day, but everyone else wanted lunch!  Great service, great food.  Came with a party of three we had carnitas tacos, carnitas ruban sandwich with garlic fries, and buttermilk pancakes. Everything was cooked well, and delicious!  Our server was on top of our tea refulls and the food was also served in good time. The atmosphere was nice, table and seating was clean. Very glad we stopped in.
