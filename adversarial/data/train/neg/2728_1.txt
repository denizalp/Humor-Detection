I've only ever been here during the Iowa games and I sit at the bar so I guess that makes the differance.  I really enjoy watching the games here, everyone is so nice, although the servers don't seem as happy to be there as the rest of us but hey they had to get up at 8 on a Saturday morning so I don't really blame them as it's not their team.\n\nI can't wait for this upcoming season so hopefully it will a great year!
