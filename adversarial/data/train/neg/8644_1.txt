I've only recently made the switch to vegetarianism, so this is only my second pho sans meat, and only one other experience to compare it to.\n\nThe vegetable to noodle ratio was off -- too much vegetable, not enough noodle. To be fair, my wife (a vegetarian) thought her pho was great. *shrugs*\n\nMy Viet Coffee also had more ice than there was liquid in the cup (as in, the ice had a good half-inch of not being submerged in liquid).\n\nMinor complaints, but I will be glad to get to my regular pho experiences back in Los Angeles.
