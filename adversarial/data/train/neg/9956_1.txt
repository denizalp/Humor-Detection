Normally we come for breakfast, always good, went today and had a specialty burger, bad mistake, husband wanted his med. mine no pink, they both came exactly the same, DRY! He got bacon and pickles I got neither, finally got waitress attention she took plate got bacon and no pickles! Meanwhile frys are getting cold! Had to ask for more ice tea, why is it cloudy?? Suppose to be a bigger burger than regular burger, the meat was barely there! Suppose to have cheddar on it, a sprinkle of cheddar cheese does not make a cheese burger!  So my opinion is NEVER go there for anything but breakfast!
