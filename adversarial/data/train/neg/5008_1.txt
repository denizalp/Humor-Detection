They meet you at one of the casino parking lots where you'll meet up with others who have also decided to join the tour.  You park and then drive their covered and air conditioned Jeep, caravan style, out to the trail and the tour guide does an EXCELLENT job of prepping you and guiding you over what a normal person would see as an obstacle he somehow sees a trail.  So, you climb over the world's biggest boulders, sometimes with a wheel or two seemingly off the ground.  It's bizarre how you end up in the most awkward angles.  We also got the chance to take the Jeeps through the sand and do it \"dune buggy\" style.  We were out for over 6 hours and my wife and 13 year old son really enjoyed themselves, in between the fear and laughing.  Well worth the money.  You get your own Jeep and you can switch drivers when you want.
