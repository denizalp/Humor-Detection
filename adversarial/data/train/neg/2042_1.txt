This restaurant has a cool vibe and is decorated beautifully!! The bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed dates with a red wine glaze is TO DIE FOR! So yummy. Also, the duck tacos and the Caesar salad are amazing! \nThe waitress we had was super nice and the owner was here as well; he is great and makes sure that everyone has a great experience. \nHighly recommended!!!!
