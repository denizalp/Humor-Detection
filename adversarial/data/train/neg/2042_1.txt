We've been Cox customers for well over 20 years.  Every year we have to fight with Cox over their bills. Now, we've had enough.  They just raised it again from $225 to $260 a month and we're about to throw in the towel.  300+ channels of nothing to watch doesn't make up for their fast Internet speeds.\n\nI've been reviewing our options and after much digging, I discovered that there is a way to combine Cox HSI with AT&T U-Verse TV and that would lower the total bill to well under $200.
