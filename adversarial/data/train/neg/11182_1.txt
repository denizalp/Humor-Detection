Went for the first time last weekend with my parents. My mom is a little bit of a Pad Thai snob, so she said it was just alright. I, however, loved it! It was sweet and just a little spicy (because I'm a wimp and asked for level one spice). The sushi was a lot better than I anticipated and it wasn't too pricey. I will definitely be back!
