I organized a night out with family, a party of 8, at Hardy's. \n\nThe staff were very friendly, and they served us fairly quickly considering the size of our group. The wine-lovers were out of luck here--no wine to speak of. But those of us who drink beer had an excellent choice of local beers.  \n\nThe whole party loved the onion rings. I can't speak for the salads, but the ribs and burgers were popular. Ribs had a great smoky taste. \n\nI loved the atmosphere--photos of old Toronto, tables made of bowling alley wood, and barn-style wood on one wall. Rustic but not cluttered. \n\nI consider this a great casual dining option and look forward to returning. I give 5 stars because the whole party, including myself, really liked the place.
