After attending First Friday this month I was excited to realize I could stop by Tammie Co, en route to the office, to grab a coffee and\/or light breakfast.  So I proceeded to do so last Monday and had not a bad latte...  So today, I thought I would give it another chance and try their lunch fare.  That's is the last time I make that choice; a sad little deviled egg sandwich it was... and the 'side' was less than an amuse bouche portion.  Plus, my  bouche wasn't terribly amused.  I say stick to the pastry thing.
