This little gem of a store is around the corner from my house, and I'm embarrassed to say that I just went for the first time. It's been under new ownership for several months, and apparently some changes for the better have been implemented. They have a wonderful and reasonably priced wine selection, some fantastic beers (including Hitachino White Ale, which I'm always delighted to see someone carrying), and some really good-looking cured meats and cheeses. You could assemble one heck of a picnic from this store alone. The only thing I had trouble locating was port; one selection, and it was a ruby. That aside, I definitely plan on being a regular here.
