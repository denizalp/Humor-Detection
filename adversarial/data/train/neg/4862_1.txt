I've lived near this restaurant for seven years and my husband and I finally tried it this summer. We really liked it and were sorry that we waited so long. \n\nWe bought takeout both times and it was ready quickly. We ended up having enough food  to feed us for 2-3 days. \n\nSo far, we've especially enjoyed the green chicken curry, the pad thai and the beef and chicken pho.
