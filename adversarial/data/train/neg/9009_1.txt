If you want a true Italian dining experience in Las Vegas that won't do the same damage to your wallet as the craps tables, go to Il Mulino.  Now I mention the pricing only because I was shocked at how reasonable it was, not to infer that this place should only be visited if money is tight.  I expected (and was willing) to pay $400 for my date and I's meal and was surprised.  Total wasn't even half of that.  \n\nThe service is impeccable.  Drinks and water ALWAYS full.  Knowledgable table captain plus at least three other servers bringing a constant barrage of delicious breads, fresh Parmesan, and antipasti.  All before you have even gotten to look at the menu.\n\nThen the food comes, huge portions of delicious authentic Italian cuisine.  I am a big eater and when I order tortellini or pasta at an Italian place the portions always leave me hungry.  Not here.  I had to take a to go bag.  \n\nMake this a must-eat on your next trip to Las Vegas.  You won't regret it.
