My guest and I walked in to a nearly-empty dining room at lunch and waited quite a while for someone to come seat us. This seemed to happen to every group that came in after us as well. The service was also slow. I am wondering whether the restaurant was stuck in an in-between time on a holiday where it was not busy enough to have more employees working, but it was still too much for a single waitress to handle. Our waitress was friendly, so I don't blame her at all. It just seems like the restaurant management needs to work some things out.\n\nAs for the food, it was a little underwhelming. Both my guest and I thought that the food was fine, but nothing particularly special. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich. The chicken looked good, and it was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The problem was that there wasn't really much spice at all. The toppings sounded good on the menu, but didn't add much to the flavor. The fries had an odd, burnt taste.\n\nI may return if I'm in the area. They have many menu options at good prices, and the bar area is pretty nice.
