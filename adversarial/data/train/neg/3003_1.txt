MANAGEMENT \nI have gone to Jason's Deli every single day for the past 2 years. Their recent change in management at this restaurant was a terrible mistake. Several times the female manager (tall, dark skin, big) has said rude comments to me or other customers. She then turns around and acts extremely, falsely concerned about your experience. She harasses you while you eat. She refused to give me a menu item I asked for even after I offered to pay twice as much for it (it was on the kids menu & since I didn't have my child present I could not order it). I hear her yelling and bitching at the employees the whole time I'm there. If it's not that, I get to hear her loud, manly, evil laugh several times during my visit. She has made this Jason's deli a horrible experience to dine at. \n\nFOOD QUALITY\nThe spinach leaves (which is all I eat from the salad bar) have been very dry & browning lately. If I wanted my food to look like that I would've gone to the 99 cent store. The muffins are always hard, dry, & practically inedible. The ice cream machine is always broken. They've been making the sandwiches and wraps I order very sloppily. Everything just falls out when I pick it up. They're always out of simple menu items such as a type of pasta or their pot pies. \n\nSUMMARY\nI've been an extremely loyal customer to this specific Jason's Deli for the past 2 years, but that has now changed. The new management & poor food quality has disgusted me to the point that I am no longer interested in giving them my business. It was a great thing gone horribly wrong in only a few months.
