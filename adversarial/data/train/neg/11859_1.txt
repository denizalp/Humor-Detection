It's a love and hate kind of relationship, me and Goodlife @ Markville.  It's a great place but when I used to go (2-3 years ago), it was just so packed.  I really hated parking here because I would be competing against shoppers AND the people who work out.  It took me so long to find a parking spot that I felt drained before I even entered the gym.  It's a little better now because people are heading towards the Goodlife by the Cineplex.\n\nDo I like this location?  It's not bad, one being that the classroom is bigger.  I like how the layout is wide and no poles are blocking my view of the instructor lols.  The equipment is relatively new, and staff are generally friendly.  It's honestly a pretty convenient location and my family can wait for me while shopping (though that rarely occurs).  This location always has towels, and that's a plus.  I hate it when gyms run out of towels because they are \"being washed\".  Dude, I come after work, you must know it's your prime time!\n\nThe only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the instructors aren't as skilled as those in downtown.  They don't go through the techniques, just completes the session, tries to hype the class, and repeats.  I prefer when instructors actually provide feedback on correct postures.  Getting hurt in a gym would be the opposite of what I want.
