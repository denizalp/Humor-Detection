My first review was done after my first visit, and shortly after they opened. Since then I've been to Blue 32 many times and it has truly grown on me, becoming one of my favorite places. The food is really good - especially the boneless wings and the onion rings. They even make their own bleu cheese for the wings - awesome. The beer selection is pretty good and the service is usually very good as well. It's a nice alternative to BWW but not as \"chainy\" and not nearly as loud. I wish the place was a bit closer to my house because I'd be there a lot more often.
