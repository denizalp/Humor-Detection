Excellent! We went for amazing drinks and fried chicken I think what really makes it is the amazing truffle gravy sauce that comes with the biscuit and the the fried chicken. An other thing I highly recommend is the kale salad it's really really good! The wine selection is smart and the cocktails solid!
