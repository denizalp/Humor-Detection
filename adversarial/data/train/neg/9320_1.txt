Prickly Pear Plaza is such an adorable plaza, complete with a gift shop (with all types of local items), a Native American Jewelry store (Cimarron River Co.) and an ice cream shop (City Creamery)! The rooms are so great; huge tv's, kitchenette, luxurious bathrooms and scenic views. I'm so impressed with the Prickly Pear Inn, I recommend to everyone! Thank you for providing such a comfortable place for my family and friends to stay when they are in town.... and myself when I want to get away. :)
