Wow! I've been to quite a few buffets, but have to say this is the best one hands down!\n\nKobe beef, lamb chops, lobster stuffed ravioli, filet mignon, alaskan crab legs...you name it!\nThe desserts are absolutely delicious...make sure you try the flan and the cappucino desserts!\nThere's so much food here you won't know where to start- and the best part it is all fresh!\nThe value for the price is amazing...and if you're smart you will do what we did and come in at 3 PM..dinner starts at 4..so we got in for the brunch price of $23.95...started out eating very slowly and by 4PM when dinner started we were still hungry. If you're in the buffet when dinner starts you can enjoy the dinner menu at the lunch price. For $23.95 and all that food...this buffet is a steal! We learned about this get in at 3 pm trick from a fellow yelper..so thank you!
