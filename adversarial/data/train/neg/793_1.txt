Fin and Fino is a great restaurant. It has a modern and casual feel once you get inside the restaurant. The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous. The customer service in the restaurant was amazing. Our waiter knew the menu like the back of his hand which was very impressive. We went during lunch and the restaurant was not too crowded. At the first glance of the menu I noticed that there weren't any simple dishes and I am a simple lady. Everything seemed overly complicated but I am sure that is the purpose of the restaurant...differentiation from others. I ordered the tomato bisque and squash soup along with the salmon. I was sooooooooo impressed. The food was fresh and the salmon was delicious. Overall I think you should at least try this restaurant once. You won't be disappointed.
