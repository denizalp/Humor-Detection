This place is off the hook!  The best street style tacos in LV by far!\nAll tacos we ordered were excellent and topped off properly.\nThe burritos are HUGE and also taste very good.\nSalsa bar is stocked with lots of good traditional items.\n\nWe sat at the bar and got food service from the Bartenders; who were also awesome, friendly, and made excellent drinks.\n\nThe place gets really busy during dinner hours, so be prepared to wait and rub elbows; it will be worth it.
