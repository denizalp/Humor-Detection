I got a cut and color yesterday from Tanya at Flict Salon. Overall, I thought the atmosphere was great! Had a great view of a lake, cleanliness was exceptional and the decor was trendy\/updated. When I arrived my stylist offered me water\/tea\/soda which was nice. We sat down and discussed what I wanted and was looking for her personal opinion, I asked several times and it seemed she was either rushed or uninterested in really reviewing what I wanted done. THREE hours later I walked out of the salon. Quite a long time for a cut and color, I felt like my hair was dyed a bit darker and the balayage I was looking for.. Well I was told it would FADE. I thought to myself, no you didn't do my hair right. I've been getting balayage and ombr√© done for the past 3 years and not once have I ever been told it would \"fade\".. My hair doesn't look sun kissed at all which was what we both agreed on and I even showed her pictures of what I wanted, clearly that went in one ear and out the other. THREE hours later, I was then charged 182.00... What a joke. The prices are outrageous, my hair color wasn't worth 182.00. \n\nI plan on updated this review once my hair \"fades\".\nTo be continued....
