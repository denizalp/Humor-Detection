Veg-friendly, good-tasting, and the service was lovely  :)\n\nMy companion and I just had supper there, and were surprised to find a completely Veg-friendly menu!  Complete with gobo\/burdock root, hijiki, and inari zushi appetizers.  They also have a vegetarian Bento box - $13.95, which comes with about 5 or 6 different vegetarian items.\n\nLoved the burdock root dish, warm and tasty.\n\nThey had plum wine, but didn't know what I meant when I told them that I wanted the carbonated version of plum wine.\n\nI wondered if they had any family in Japan, that were affected by the quake.  Every person working there, was Japanese.  Cute Japanese mannerisms.\n\nWe had a good time, and tipped well.  It's Tuesday night, and business seemed slow.  If they were on Yonge street, their service would be bustling that much more.  \n\nPrices were good.  For 2 ppl, we spent $59 plus tip.\n\nOnly somewhat minor complaint, is that my companion wished for more of the straight sushi filler, and not as much filling gelatinous rice...\n\nI'd go back.  Esp. w\/ some veggie folk, and of course some omnivorous ones  :)\n\n~~~~~\nbtw, wikipedia explains Rikishi as:\nLiterally, Strong man. The most common term for a professional sumo wrestler, although sum≈çtori is sometimes used instead. See  in Japanese.
