Amazing job. Ramsey took care of my BMW in an hour. The result is even better than expected. He was fast to answer my calls\/texts. Showed up at my house the next day. Chips and scratches are gone. He would tell you if he can do something or not. Honest and nice, I recommend his services to anybody who'd like to give his car a second life. Thank you
