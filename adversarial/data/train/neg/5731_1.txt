Amazing job on my 2014 Ford F150!!! I had a pretty large ding in my drivers side door. I texted Kurt and sent him 3 pictures of the dent. I received a quote within 15 minutes and we got it on the schedule.  He was extremely timely to the appointment and it took him about 1.5 hours to fix. His attention detail was second to none. You can't even tell there was a dent there! I would recommend his services to anyone. Very reasonably priced and extremely attentive.  Great job and will use him again if another dent\/ding occurs on my vehicle.
