Good bfast choice. Was $67 for 4 adults and a kids meal. We got the shrimp and grits, omelettes, pancakes and favorite hash. All large portions and all was very good even the coffee, which is often not the case with these diner type restaurants. Not the best food I ever had, nothing mind blowing but all good. Definitely a solid option, we came around 9am on Saturday morning they were pretty busy but no wait and we were seated outside right away.
