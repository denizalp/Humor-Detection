One of the best restaurants in Charlotte. It's worth any wait they have. If you love salt order the Chizu or however you spell it. (pictured) Pork belly falls apart in your mouth and basically melts. I can usually make two meals out of it with leftovers. You would be doing yourself, family, and friends a disgrace by not coming here.
