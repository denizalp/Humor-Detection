Tasty, friendly neighborhood spot, yet a little odd. The decor doesn't know quite what it wants to be: sports bar showing NHL and FIFA on flat-screens , or Italian Ristorante playing a classic soundtrack by Sinatra overhead. The menu is sparse, but flavorful. They make their own mozzarella for their pizzas and have a delicious fire-baked crust. The Lasagne was sweet and meaty. The service is friendly and helpful. The prices are reasonable for the freshness of the ingredients and quality, but you'll pay almost double the cost of a meal at the Chili's in the same strip. It's worth it to support a local business trying to get off the ground.
