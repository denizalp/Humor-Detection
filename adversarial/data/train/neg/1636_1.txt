My husband and I got married Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at Sunset Gardens (absolutely amazing venue btw) and when I booked them I received an email from Joleon offering their wedding services. I booked a hair and traditional makeup appointment with Veronica. When I got to my appointment and met her I was blown away at how friendly she was! I showed her a picture of how I wanted my hair and she exceeded my expectations. And I was completely in love with my makeup look. I'm very fair and can look very orange if the right colors aren't used. She did such an amazing job and made sure that everything she used looked natural. My makeup didn't feel or look cakey and everything went with my skin tone! I felt so beautiful when I left there. I can never thank Veronica enough for the fantastic job she did. I was completely blown away by her.
