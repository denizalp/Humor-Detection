I think I tried almost every buffet in Vegas.  First of all, I typically am not a fan of buffet.  Scooping up average bulk fare that's been sitting in a bin forever is not my idea of good food. But since buffet are popular and easier choice when you're with large groups, I find myself in them every once in a while.  Having been to other buffets, this one is at average at best.  There was nothing great or delicious.  I just cannot see myself coming back unless they make some improvements on the dishes.
