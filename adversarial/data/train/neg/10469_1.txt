I'm a tad biased having a NM restaurant not far away. But, I'm a old customer of the south phx location. I sensed the bartender was related to Cheryl from s central, turns out her daughter. Wow, when u are raised in the business, it shows in a big way. Great vibe, very right on in a low key manner. I'd go for sure
