I decided to visit my sister in Arizona but was in desperate need of a pedicure. My sister booked me a pedicure appointment at this place. I came in an hour before closing. I walked in and absolutely loved the decor! So girly! I choose my color and they sat me on this very comfortable seat\/couch bench. They also serve you with water or tea. I forgot the name of my gal, Teresa?, but she did an awesome job massaging my feet. I loved the pressure she put on my feet. She definitely took her time massaging my feet. If you don't want to read magazines or play games on your phone, they have old movies playing on their tv screen. The receptionist was very friendly. She just moved here from Chicago. I will definitely go back here if I am in the area and in need of a pedicure.
