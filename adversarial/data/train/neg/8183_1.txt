What a GREAT PLACE!! My BFF & I went out to celebrate her B-day & a friend suggested The Mixx...we had the BEST BARTENDER'S EVER!! Their names were G, Phil and Larry they were funny, attentive and made the best drinks My favorite was called...Mixx Elyxx!! YUMMY!!! Strongly recommend this place for a great time out. The DJ was AWESOME, his name was Roman Rosati. He played top 40's & Old School!! What a great night!!
