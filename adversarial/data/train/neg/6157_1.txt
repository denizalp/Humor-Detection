Love love love this place! They have the cheapest prices in town for premium dog food. They have great hours, open 7 days a week. The staff is very friendly and always helps me carry my food to the car. They also have a scale in the back and let me weight my great dane pup whenever I come in. Not just the food is cheap though. All of your other pet products are do much cheaper than petsmart or petco. I found a prong collar for $8.99 that was $20 at petsmart. It was the same thing! I feel very lucky to live right down the street from here.
