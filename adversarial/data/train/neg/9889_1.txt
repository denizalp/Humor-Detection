Walking around Old Town looking for a place to sit and grab a drink. This place was very nice. Small, quiet and not crowded. They had a small but good selection of snacks to compliment the beer and wine. I would have liked more selection in the wine list, but this was a good find. The bartender was very personable and had some great recommendations on beer and wine. They have live music on Tuesdays too!
