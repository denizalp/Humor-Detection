What would have been a 4 star experience when I first ate here back a year and a half ago, seemed lower in quality upon my revisiting. Things were still good, but for some reason my Hawaiian French Toast seemed lacking. What originally was fresh cut pineapple in the chutney mix atop the french toast, is now more of a smaller sliced pineapple. And despite even ordering an extra side of bacon in addition to the main meal itself, the plate it was served on seemed comically small for food that involves cutting up into smaller pieces. I understand for presentation when serving up 2 pieces of french toast that the smaller plates make things look better\/bigger, but I'm a guy whos more into functionality.\n\nAs mentioned, things were still good and I'll probably come back again, but things were not as impressive as my original experience. One thing I will say that did impress me though, is their dessert. We ordered a raspberry brownie and key lime pie square to go to enjoy later in the day, and at only $3.50 they were an impressive treat even without the whipped cream and such that would have been issued if eating in.
