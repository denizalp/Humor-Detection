Probably the worst maintained lanes in the city of Pittsburgh.  Been in a league here for 30 years and have seen leagues leave in droves.  Cant convince our league to leave yet because most of the bowlers aren't here to really bowl. It's kind of a running joke in our league that every week at these lanes is like a box of chocolates.  You never know what you're gonna get.   If you're in the mood to overpay for garbage lanes, this is your place .
