Absolutely the worst staffing and customer service I have ever experienced at a Hilton property.   They should be ashamed.  Either no staff or staff they had very disgruntled and unhappy.   Everyone I have spoken to (even strangers) were talking about how rude the staff was and how there were no staff.  \n\nRestaurant and evening reception tables not cleaned all day.  People bus their own tables.  30 minutes line for complimentary drinks (1 person).  No plates or glasses for evening reception and the few chips they put out were gone in 20 minutes. \n\nI am Hilton gold and told no late checkouts given.  Another lady I know that is not Hilton honors given late checkout. \n\nHotel has nice potential but it is managed very badly.  Scary almost funny badly at times.   Some people really need to be fired!   I have never said that before anywhere. \n\nI do know now why a majority of my nights still go to Marriott.   I was going to try Hilton after I renewed my marriott platinum mid year.  But absolutely not now.  I am soured on the whole brand. \n\nI gave it two stars because it is a nice hotel.  I would have given 4 Star for Hotel and then I subtracted two stars for the staff.  *** actually lowered to 1 Star - I'm downstairs and the staff is being rude to everyone in the restaurant. Every table sitting here is talking amongst each other in disbelief.  I have done hundreds of yelp reviews and I think this is only the second time I have give a place 1 Star (I rarely rate anything less than 3 star).  Be warned.  Don't stay here unless you have to.\n\nI'm piling on here:   Pool interior filthy - hasn't been  been scrubbed in ages.   Hand sanitizer stations all over property.   All empty.  Hearsay-as everyone in this place talking about how bad it is-but this lady said her daughters laptop was stolen from room and she had to complain at desk (and they actually returned it to her).  I mean the list is piling up.
