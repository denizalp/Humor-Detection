I had a great experience at dominoes yesterday. Awesome customer service. I ordered the pizza and they put it in the oven before I paid. The cashier slid my card and it was denied, I had no idea why and I didn't have any other way to pay, later finding out I had to activate a new card.  They gave me the pizza anyway, instead of throwing it out. The cashier was just being very nice and polite saying it could have been a store issue. Anyway, I'll definitely be coming back to this one and also pay them back.
