There's several things I really like about fresh:\nThe list of always-organic foods they use, which is something I really appreciate and one of the reasons why I do visit (I don't really like to eat out too often)\nThey have a big menu, so you can always try something new, which I really like to do!\nThe list of beverages is also huge!\nNice, laid-out atmosphere but with style!\n\nIt's often quite overcrowded (but I think they managed, hands-off, the best use of space for a restaurant) and sometimes you can have loud neighbors (just hope they're done soon), however you're usually seated in 20 minutes at most, even when it's packed.\nI think the service is quite nice overall!
