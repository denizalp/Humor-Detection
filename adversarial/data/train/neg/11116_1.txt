Very limited beer selection. They did not offer the complete menu as posted on their website. Had their burger- wasn't bad, but wasn't anything exceptional either. Very salty fries (which I like, but other people may not). Service was fast: we sat at the bar to avoid the wait for a table. Yeah, the servers are \"dicks\" but in a really uninspiring way. They just seemed tired of their job and looked like they missed their last dose of prozac. They weren't clever, just generally irritating and mean- kind of like the fat kid on the play ground who thinks it's funny to make the skinny kid hit himself in the face.
