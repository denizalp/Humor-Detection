This is the first time i've left a review on yelp because this place was just amazing and deserves all of the stars! I ordered the Sabai fried rice and it was piping hot when it arrived and so delicious. Sweet and savoury, it was exactly like the ones they serve in Thailand and just what I was craving. I also ordered the spring rolls which were good but not as amazing as the fried rice and the Thai iced tea which was also good and tasted authentic but a little sweet. Delivery took less than an hour and the food arrived hot and the drink ice cold. 5 stars. Can't wait to try their pad thai and tom yum soup next time!
