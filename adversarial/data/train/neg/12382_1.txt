One of the best dining experiences ever.  We went to Michael's for our 30th anniversary.  Since we live in the area it was on our bucket list for awhile.  The food and service are impeccable,  As others have said, the table side Ceasar Salad is amazing. \n\n Our steak was cooked to perfection and the vegetable sides were so fresh.  Loved the Hollandaise and Bernaise sauces on the side.  Service is impeccable-every detail is taken care of.\n\nFrom the time you arrive to the time you leave you feel like you are back in the glitzy Bugsey Segal Vegas.  Yes the prices are on the high side but worth every penny.  The quality of the food and the highest level of service make Michael's a unique fine dining experience.  Perhaps the best in Las Vegas.
