Although I am a loyal k-towner, I must say that, out of all my experiences with bike shops in Calgary, this is THE best bike\/disc-golf\/x-country store. Whether it is the same five staff that I keep seeing since I first went there in the late 90s or the owner's chilled-out giant husky-ish dog that shamelessly lies in the middle of the aisles or door, I just love this place.\n\nIn the winter, the place sells x-country skis (not my thing), but still fixes bikes, and an obvious conversion is made in the summer. All year round, this place also sells disc-golf equipment which is esoterically awesome. \n\nDespite being a small business, Lifesport is all around competitive. Unlike many mediocre small businesses, this place does not survive by insulting lobbying to the government and public to somehow forbid MEC from selling bikes, or giving sob stories about how they have the right to over-charge consumers \"because we are a small independent company\". This place gets by because they sell quality products and services at competitive prices. True, you won't pay rock bottom prices (for rock bottom quality), but compared to all the other cycling stores, this place is on-par, including the quality of brands that they sell. Best of all, these people appreciate the value of negotiation: I bundled a $1200 bike with $450 shoes+pedals+fender (and installation, 'cause I'm lazy...seriously) for $1475 all in, simply by asking. This is completely unheard of in Canada. All things equal, go here.
