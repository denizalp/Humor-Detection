I'm so happy this restaurant has come to Madison. Everything about it is wonderful from the vibe inside to the beautiful bar to the friendly staff and incredible food. You should definitely check this place out. The owner came over to talk to us when my friend and I ate here and she told us about how they sell natural wines. I'm looking forward to going back and drinking some of that wine!
