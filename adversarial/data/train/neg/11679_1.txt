Grotto has a great happy hour special. I was really wanting some chicken Parmesan so I skipped the big list of happy hour food on special and went straight for the chicken parm. It was the best I've ever had. I paired it with the happy hour Pinot noir. I told myself I wasn't allowed to eat all of it but i totally didn't. If you're in the Fremont area and want Italian (or great food in general), go to Grotto!
