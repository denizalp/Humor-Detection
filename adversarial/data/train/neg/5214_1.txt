My mother lived here for many years and has since died.  In my opinion it is very expensive and not worth the money.  The staff is not very friendly or very helpful.  It feels more like a business and not a place to spend your retirement years.  You \"buy\" your apartment (in independent living) but never own it. Laurel Lake just sells it over and over again when you die\/move to assisted living or the nursing home.  Plus you pay a high monthly fee. It's all about money.\n\nThe staff got involved with some personal issues that were none of their business and caused a lot of trouble for my family.  They kicked my brother in law off the property because he had \"stayed too long\" despite my mom's failing health and their close relationship.  \n\nEndless problems. Look elsewhere.
