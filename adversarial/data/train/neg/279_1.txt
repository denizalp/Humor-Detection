The one thing that stands out about this dinner buffet is the changing premium selection available during most dinners.  Over by the sushi, you can get nice hand rolls, poke, or beef tartar.  There's also generally kobe beef, prime rib, or both available.  The pesto mash is always good too.\nFood selection 5\/5\nFood quality 4\/5\nService 4\/5\nAtmosphere 3\/5
