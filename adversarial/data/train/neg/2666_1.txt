Tried this place out while meeting friends for happy hour Friday evening. \n\nFantastic and plentiful happy hour drink specials! Had specials on beer, mixed drinks and shots. I was starving so I skipped the happy hour snacks and ordered a burger. I got the Belfast Burger and it was sooo good! The beef patty tasted great. Good quality. Excellent flavor. \n\nService was great. Prices were about right. They even had some ladies going around giving promo shots of whiskey. Great timing on our part! \n\nDef would go back.
