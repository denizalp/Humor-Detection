New favourite brunch place. The food is amazing: a big tasty plateful that is artfully (but not pretentiously) arranged. Great price, too -- less that the other nearby hipster hangouts. Ambiance is welcoming and comfortable, rustic and cool. A place you could hang out in for hours drinking delicious coffee. The service is just the right level of attentiveness, and food\/coffee refills arrive quickly. If you order the Eggs Benny you can have a different topping on each english muffin. Very vegetarian friendly, with tofu substitutions for scrambles\/burritos. I heart this place.
