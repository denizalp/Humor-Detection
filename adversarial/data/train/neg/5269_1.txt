John has been here several times for our plumbing needs. He is thorough, friendly, and does quality work. He always explains everything to your understanding. He also has made himself available for follow up questions. \n\nHe has helped us out with a new dishwasher being installed by the 3rd party installer that we bought from Home Depot. The install work was less than satisfactory. When I had questions about the work that someone else did, John - who had just done some work in our bathrooms that morning- swung by to take a look in the afternoon. We are planning to have John from JB Water come later this week to fix the install. \n\nI would highly recommend JB Water and John to my network!!!
