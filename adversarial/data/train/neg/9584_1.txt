You have to go into this place knowing what this place is all about or else you may get mixed reactions. Well this was ONE spot i knew i had to hit with my friends and it was THE BEST DECISION!! . The service was terribly great! Wait staff was perfectly rude and the hats you get were hilarious. we all laughed so hard our cheeks hurt.\n\nWe actually witness the dance from Taco because the table next to us had a birthday and he did a strip dance for her. HILARIOUS!!! credit to him for wearing a thong! \n\nThe food was great too. I am ready to go back there on my next trip to vegas. We even kept the hats on all night walking around town. Made lots of people laugh. \n\nThank you Dicks for an awesome time!
