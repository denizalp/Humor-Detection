Ok, off for Good Friday so Alley is making the most of her time off by hitting the local craft brew scene. Brian was the first to greet us. He was awesome and brought Alley a fresh bowl of water, which was perfect because she left the house in such a rush she left her bowl at home. \n\nThe beer selection is good and we got a flight of 6.  The alcohol content is high compared other local breweries but Brian's awesome care of Alley earned the establishment that extra star which pushed it to 5. I always want to point out we walked in (ok Alley ran in) at 30 minutes before closing and were treated like we came in with hours to spare. \n\nShe again is chilling on the patio but that's by choice. All the patrons are cool with her and she is enjoying her staycation.  \n\nThe average alcohol content of their beer is 7 with some going as high as 10.4.  Considering the alcohol content the beers were suprisingly smooth.  The growler prices from $13-$20, which seems like a great value to us. \n\nThe decor is unique as is the entire center.  If in the Phoenix area this craft breweries is worth the drive.
