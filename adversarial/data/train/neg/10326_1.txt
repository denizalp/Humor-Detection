Ahhh delicious! Went here with my friends on a cold winter evening and enjoyed every minute of it.  \n\nFood: 4\/5, I got the Tom yum soup with egg noodles and sliced beef and tofu sticks as my toppings (and cold milk tea)\n\nService: 3\/5, nothing out of the ordinary - like most Chinese restos, they just bring the food lol.\n\nAmbience: 3\/5, kind of tight seating between tables so it's somewhat uncomfortable but the actual seating was nice and large.\n\nPrice: 4\/5, about $13 per person with tax and tip.
