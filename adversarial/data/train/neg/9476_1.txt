I have been going here for well over 20 years. They have the best teriyaki chicken around. It is very healthy and it tastes wonderful. They grill the chicken so it has a nice char on it before they put the sauce on. I also really enjoy the sukiyaki bowl. The place is a little old now but it's still really good and very consistent. When I have a craving for teriyaki chicken this is the place I must go to
