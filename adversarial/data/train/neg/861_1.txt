This is a nice spot.  I'd say their prices seem pretty reasonable.  Everyone seemed quite friendly. I've been there twice and not disappointed. Manly for bagels and cream cheese but their sandwiches look pretty good as well. \n\nThere aren't that many breakfast places left, and this one is one of the better, if not the best one.
