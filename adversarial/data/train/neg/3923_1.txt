Simply put this is the best food that has ever entered my mouth. Fatty brisket fatty brisket fatty brisket!!! Jalapeno cheddar grits!! Turkey is amazing too and the sausage is great. I can't stress enough how good this BBQ is and worth every penny. I don't know what else to say really but AMAZINGLY AMAZING!!!!
