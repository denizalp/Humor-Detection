im a big fan of dumplings so i wanted to check it out when i saw that it was a fairly new business. came with a friend, we both ordered noodles and shared 12 steamed pork and chive dumplings.\n\ni ordered the beef noodle. it was probably some sort of stewed beef as it was soft and fatty as oppose to the more rubbery brisket i'm used to. it's pretty much one of the things i order almost everywhere i go, so i have a fairly large sample size to compare to. based on that sample size, i can't say that this was a great entree because i've had better at many other places. again, the beef was more fatty than it was meaty, not a big fan of the (egg?) noodle that they used, and i was left with a starchy\/pasty after texture in my mouth. that being said, i'm being really hard just because i have to compare it to some excellent beef noodle soups from other places, and this just wasn't up to those standards.\n\nthe dumplings were not bad though, they served the steamed dumplings on a plate, which was a first for me. I'm used to having them served in the steamer itself, maybe just the \"xiao long bao\" are served that way. it was pretty good, i prefer my dumplings fried though so I'll give this place another shot before i make a final verdict.
