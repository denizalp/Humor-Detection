Shipped my 2002 BMW M5 from San Diego, CA to Naples, FL. Once I received the car the undercarriage had been damaged on both sides and the front bumper. I understand things happen. I work in the auto industry but the awful part was the claims process...\n\nIt took 2 weeks to get all the paperwork as I had to go get quotes for the repairs....Then I waited 5 weeks to hear back that they were only covering half of my claim because the damage wasn't fully notated to their liking (there is no where to properly notate undercarriage damage on a BOL). After I left a message for her manager I quickly got an email saying they decided to cover the whole amount and I should receive a check within 20 business days. So after another 4 weeks I sent a follow up email to find that the check hadn't been released or processed but now it will be overnighted to me.\n\nOverall an awful experience, worst claims process and poor customer service.
