Once again, I am glad to be off the strip.  Seriously, this place is worth a try for anyone staying downtown Vegas.  The location is great, and food was amazing (appetizers, the main course, the drinks - all of it), and the staff was incredibly polite!\n\nI love the fact that the menu is diverse, but yet feels cohesive.  If you like farm to table, or a unique twist on americana, this should be on your list to try, and you can thank me later.
