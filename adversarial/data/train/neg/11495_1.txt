I was in Phoenix on business last week. My PHX based co-workers are frequent visitors and knowing I like BBQ, they took me to here. One word describes the food - amazing. I've had BBQ from a lot of places all over the country and the food here ranked at the top of the list for me. I had the two meat plate - brisket and pulled pork. Both were awesome. If you are in PHX and like BBQ, you have to come here. The line may be long, but it's truly worth the wait.
