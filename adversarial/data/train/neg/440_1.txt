Love Ling  and Louie's.  Everything we ordered had great flavor!  They have quite a\nfew items with a good amount of spicy hotness to it!!!   For those of you that prefer no meat, they also have choices on the menu where you can choose vegetables instead.  We had great service and our server was spot on with her favorites.  They also have a great happy hour in my opinion. The lettuce wraps and ginger lime margarita, were yummy, and love the outdoor patio and bar area.
