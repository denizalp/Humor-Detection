Good Beer selection, limited food options, good frites.  The restaurant has high ceilings, a bar area in the front with general seating further in, and also kitchen side kitchen seating even further in.  Outdoor seating is on the side.  The beer menu is extensive, and varies in prices.  I stuck with the beer flight for 6 dollars, all were decent.  The food however didnt stack up with the beer.  We both had the mussels.  I had the spicy red thai mussels which was pretty good, we shared the beef and duck fat fries which was a good idea because the fries are pretty massive.  Skipped dessert, too much frites.  Even though the average review, I would say a good place to just grab a pint.  They also serve smaller sizes of all their draft beers (tasting sizes as well as 300mL size) and of course full pints.
