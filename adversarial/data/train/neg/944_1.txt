I was sitting in my office as i do daily...Around 11am,, i start considering my lunch. LOL,,, I go thru all the choices with my co-workers... They wanted chinese i had to have a pizza... This place is close to the office and had a deal for  a 12 inch one topping pizza for 5bucks, during lunch...  I ordered the small cheese, it presented well, looked very good, the first bite.  EHHHHH... Dough was decent, sauce was ehhhh, cheese was ehhh..  Pizza was ehhhh...  It tasted like conveyor belt pizza, not the regular pizza oven that produces the crispy crust...  I think the pizza here is decent, not great not horrible...  I will try the sicilian next time, but the NY style is more Las Vegas style,, not that good...  Is there a place in town that makes a great memorable pizza ??  When i worked in Philly,, i would decide,, you know i need good pizza, hop on the train to NYC and have street pizza, then return to work, needless to say it was about 5 hrs later,, talk about a long lunch...  There isnt a place in Vegas that totally blows me away... Uncle Joes and Verrazano's are the closest to NY Style i have tried in the valley so far... Try it if you are in the area, your opinion may be different than mine.. Hope this YELPS...
