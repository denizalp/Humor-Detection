This was my first visit.  I have recently moved to the area and asked a friend where to go she highly recommended Viva and boy was she right. From the moment I walked in and was greeted by I believe the owner with great hair and his cheerful assistant with good hair too to the moment I checked out I was 110% satisfied.. The women who did my pedicure was fabulous.  I have horrible ingrowns she was so gentle and thorough... The place is beautiful, clean, everyone is very friendly and its so relaxing.. \n\nViva keep being fabulous! You definitely have a very satisfied forever customer right here ... \n\nJenn (stay strong)
