I can't resist. This place is SO good. It is not an eat-in establishment. Calling ahead is a great idea. Basic choices; amazing taste. Tons of calories-every one worth it.\nWe get the chicken planks all the time. The fries are great. There is so much grease, they put white bread in the container. The meals also come with cole slaw. \nWhen you are ready to forego the diet and eat amazing fried chicken; look no further!!
