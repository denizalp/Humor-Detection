I was very hesitant about beginning acupuncture treatments, but Paul made it extremely comfortable and enjoyable. His holistic approach has been extremely helpful during my pregnancy and he has helped me focus and really pay attention to the changes going on during this exiting time in my life. I trust Paul completely, and look forward to continue seeing him during and after my pregnancy.
