This was the best food we had all weekend. Upon our return, we are all still talking about the food. We arrived around 11 and had a wait. We walked around the shops until the table was ready. We revived a text and were seated immediately. Our waiter was knowledge and had a great sense of humor. You cannot go wrong with anything!  We had the granola, which my daughter said can never be duplicated, the chocolate chip, banana pancakes, and the eggs benedict with pork belly!  We will be back!!!
