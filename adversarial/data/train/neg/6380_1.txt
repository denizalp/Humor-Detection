This store has excellent customer service! My sister and her fiance and I we doing their wedding registry, and they were very helpful. They gave them so many options to choose from, telling them the good, bad, and middle of the road items. Very involved with their honest opinions of the items in the store, and never pushy or insistent on getting one thing or the other... just all around excellent service and guidance going throught the store and helping with the registry!
