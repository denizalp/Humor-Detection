The food and atmosphere is excellent here. We had a bit of a strange incident with the people that were there hanging out....I won't go into detail but this place is not for kids. It would be a great date spot as it's quiet and intimate with low lighting and good music. Food was amazing I would definitely go back for the food and wine and hopefully the crowd won't be so crude and inappropriate.
