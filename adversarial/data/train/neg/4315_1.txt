I felt it was necessary to write about Yogurtland once again. I went on a Wednesday afternoon at 3 and was so surprised to see the line was at least 20 people deep. I thought it was going to be a long wait in line but the exact opposite. As a matter of fact it is 3:27 right now and I already enjoyed my tasty treat at the shop and drove back to work! I was pleasantly surprised that there were all new flavors to choose from. I got Dutch Chocolate with Reece's peanut butter cups, Peanut butter with brownie bits and Lemon Lime Tart with strawberries. Every combination was delish and the best part, $1.83! You read that right folks... But one of the main reasons for my update was the feeling of the place today. It had a sense of camaraderie, everyone turning to their neighbor to ask their opinion on certain flavors, taster cups weren't absent just not really being used. I think everyone realized we didn't want to be on the line ride long. The staff was as friendly as ever and everything was very clean. Even with that many people there still was seating. Me being a lone traveler in Yogurtland that day I shared a 4 top with a family of 3. It was a moment that reminded me of small town life where everyone gets to know their neighbor. Very nice.
