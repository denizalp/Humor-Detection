The bowl of pho arrived to the table as if it was half eaten, half a fish ball, half a squid, 1 shrimp. Another large size pho came with small piece of shredded beef, half the bowl was empty with the equivalent noodle portion of a small. Did they run out of food? \nBesides that, the broth only tasted of sodium, not that deep and complex broth found in authentic pho. There is definitely much better places in the neighborhood. Cannot recommend.
