Romados has amazing Portuguese \"crack\" chicken as well as desserts all at an excellent price point. Cuisse 1\/4 combo comes with a big piece of dark meat (leg\/thigh) and a side salad and ton of fries.\n\nThe restaurant has a divey vibe and is great for a quick dinner with friends or family or even takeaway because it is a lot of food for your money.\n\nI recommend Romados, especially the chicken with the spicy oil marinade.
