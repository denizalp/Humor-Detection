I knew Aerial Silks class was going to be fun. I mean, you can just look at the pictures and tell that. But I had no idea just HOW fun it would be. \n\nI got a chance to visit AerialCLT on Sunday as part of the Yelp Fit Club. I had no idea there was an aerial place IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. How did I miss that?!\n\nWe were paired up when we got there, which was nice because I had a friend with me. The class was very well organized, starting with the basics and working our way up in a way that didn't feel confusing or disorienting. Taking it each step at a time made it feel easy and I felt like a pro by the end of class! \n\nI loved the feeling of being upside down. In addition to feeling exhilarating, it also helped me to stretch my back and neck out ... I have sore shoulders from sitting in front of a computer all the time, and I felt like this provided some relief!\n\nThere were nice, cushy gymnastics mats under our silks just in case of a tumble. No one in class fell, but I find this worthy of mentioning because I've had friends tell me they went to other aerial classes where either a wooden or concrete floor was the only thing to fall on. Now that doesn't sound like fun! I was glad to have a soft place to land, even if we didn't fall.\n\nI liked it so much that I bought 4 classes while there. I cannot wait to go back! After class, my friend and I were on such an adrenaline high that we were talking really fast and excitedly at dinner ... everyone was laughing at us. What a rush!
