Pancakes were excellent, Sammy and his daughter were delightful. My boyfriend and I both ordered breakfast specials and our total was only 17.77! Great food for a fantastic price. They now accept visa and MasterCard as payment!! Side note- they stop serving specials at 10:30, so be sure to get there before then to enjoy pancakes or French toast!
