Chuck did such a great job with our shutters. We called him to get a free estimate and he was not pushy at all. Such a friendly and professional guy. We ended up going with him because his prices were very reasonable. Our shutters were delivered and installed within the time frame that he gave us. We are very pleased with the quality and service.
