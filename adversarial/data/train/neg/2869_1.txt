If you're in old town and in need of good Mexican food and great service. This should be your stop. Whether it's just for their great happy hour with their bartenders (make sure you say hello to Michael Ann, she makes a mean Margarita) or joining them for their great taco Tuesday, you can't go wrong. My favorite is their burrito and a nice cold Dos Equis.  Love this place.
