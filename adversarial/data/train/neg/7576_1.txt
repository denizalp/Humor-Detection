You guys suck.   Your oil guy sold me the top-of-the-line thing without telling me there was another option and then that there was a $10 charge for a filter on top of it!   And when I went to check out the check I did clearly had no sense of customer service and just kind of shrugged her sellers and said sorry!!    So instead of going to the closest carwash to my house I'll be finding another one.  Unless of course you decide to respond to my review and do something about it!
