Holy shit!  This place makes me feel like I walked right the fuck into Italy!  There's gondola rides, for $80, they have tons of shoppes, even one dedicated to fucking whiskey!  Ok so that last one isn't very italian, but goddammit you can SAMPLE the whiskey FOR FREE. There are tons of delicious, yet overpriced, restaurants,  including chipotle!  So the service was fucking great, we had 2 seperate bookings, why? Don't worry about it, that's why. Anyways, one was booked for a king bed, the other for two queens. Mind you, I'm here with my wife, why the hell would I want two queen beds???? They ended up being able to \"downgrade,\" yea...like being able to sleep in the same bed as my sexy wife is a downgrade...to allow us to have a king bed for the duration of our stay. The room itself was awesome, there are 3 tvs, sunken living room, comfy ass beds, etc. We also partook in the canyon ranch spa, which was definitely worth it, the massages were great, don't ask me about happy endings...perverts.  Oh, and let's not forget the casino. Can anyone say Blackjack??? Well, lemme tell you, the fucking dealers sure can. Ok, it wasn't that bad. I did win about $60 playing for a good 10 minutes. Cocktail waitresses are quick on service at the table games, not so much on the slots. If you have to ask why, get the fuck out of the casino. You're the reason I lose at blackjack. Who the hell splits on 20 with a dealers up 6....christ. this hotel was great, a little pricey, but definitely worth it. You could stay on the property the whole time and be content with the stay, if you're not, stop being whiney and learn how to have some damn fun. Don't stay anywhere else, unless you're cheap as shit, and if you're cheap as shit, what the fuck are you doing in Vegas in the first place?  You're the reason I fucking lose at blackjack....but I digress. Stay here, stay at the flamingo, stay at Mandalay bay, I really don't give a shit. Just don't play blackjack with me
