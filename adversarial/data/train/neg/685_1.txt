DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY if you care about your car or want professional service from it's national office in Mesquite, Texas.  This is the worst company I have ever had to deal with both personally and professionally.  It took 16 weeks and three different customer service representatives to respond to my complaint about scratches on my car that were not there when it was shipped. Two of the client reps (during this time) quit the company along the way.  No one would respond from their corporate office time and time again. They didn't care and basically said the SCRATCHES on my car were my problem and not their issues.  Now, I have a $2,000 car repair bill to repair the scratches on the side of my car.  I will be formalizing a complaint to the Better Business Bureau.  Please also see the comments on the (BBB) site.  There were over 243 complaints and now I'm 244.  AGAIN, I don't say this lightly and I don't usually add feedback but DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY or their affiliates if this is the level of service and concern they have about their customers. Unacceptable.
