Note: I visited the garden in July of 2016. The Chinese garden was closed and they where doing major renovation. So we heard chainsaw throughout our visit.\n\nAs a local, I know how superb this place can be. Opulent flowers, gorgeous trees, zen garden everything to feast your eyes on.\n\nBut I was so disappointed! Only the green houses exhibition where good.
