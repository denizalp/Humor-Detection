Wow! My family had the best mixed grill meal thanks to Tina's. We had the bratwurst, Hungarian sausage, and the German loaf meat. The kraut and German potato salad were also excellent. The owner talked to us for a while and gave us samples to taste things when we asked. My Hungarian mother was excited to read the labels and see the products from Hungary.
