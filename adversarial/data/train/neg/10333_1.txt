I have came here 3 times since opening for 2 brunches and a dinner.  Everything I've had here has been good: open-face breakfast sandwich, short rib benedict, pork chop.  I think the breakfast pricing is a little steep ($15+ with entree and coffee).  The dinner pricing is more reasonable but still over $25 for entree and 1 drink.  I guess I just do not feel like this restaurant is very special.  I'm not sure if it is the cold setting as another review suggested or the impersonal staff.  Somehow, I am not drawn to go back.  If you are in Chandler and need a clean restaurant with reliable food, BLD is still a good choice.  Just don't expect to be wow'd.
