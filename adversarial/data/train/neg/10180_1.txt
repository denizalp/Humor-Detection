I have been to Ru San's for dinner a couple of times. Their specialty rolls are absolutely delicious. I don't remember a single thing I have ever ordered there, but they were all eaten with delight. They have a selection of basic sushi rolls which are really cheap. The service here is great, even when they are busy. On busier nights, expect to wait quite a bit for a table.\n\nI tried their buffet the other day with my brother. It didn't quite live up to my expectations that I have come to expect from Ru San's. Every single sushi was pretty much bleh. He didn't like the buffet sushi much either. Can't complain about the price though (less than $12 per person). \n\nRu San's is definitely one of my favorite sushi spots in Charlotte. I'd totally pass on the buffet though.
