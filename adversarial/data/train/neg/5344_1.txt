I will give this establishment credit for their outreach. They do care about their reputation, and any potential discourse surrounding this. That said, the service standard was substantially better, in that the drinks were prepared well, and that the staff was much more attentive to patrons. There is a very nice bottle service area as well, and (during summer) an outside terrace. The security inside still seemed a bit 'intimidating' but you need this to mitigate any unsavory situations, I'm sure. The only point of contention here was that the bouncer (not the manager) at the entry point was still a bit rude, but that seems to come with the territory. All things considered about service, it is a very decent atmosphere, with great decor.
