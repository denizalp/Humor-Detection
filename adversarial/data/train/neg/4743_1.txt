Great service!!!\nOur server came by often to check on our drinks & recommended what's great from the kitchen. Don't let this place fool you with it's looks (looks dirty). Food is awesome...great presentation & great portion for it's price.\nLive entertainment on top! The band was awesone. Playing the 70-80's music & they were great. Out door patio for smokers too. Thank you for a great night Jolie!!!
