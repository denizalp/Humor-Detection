This place was the spot when I turned 21 a few years ago... The place to pre-game and neet up for a Mill night.\n\nBut we eventually grew out of it... It's too crowded of people who are there for their cheap but strong drinks... Mmhmm those pineapple long islands tho.\n\nAnd they blast the music soooo loud! You have to yell at the person next to you... But they do have good music so it's okay..\n\nAnyways... We recently went here on a Sat night... Still crowded and loud but we went all the way to the back to play pool.. It was way better because it was less crowded in that area... And the crowd thinned out a lil bit after 1 am.\n\nPool tables 12 per hour on Sat nights after 7pm...it was a good time :)
