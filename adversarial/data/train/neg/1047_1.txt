This is the most intimate venue that hosts nationally recognized artists that I've found in Charlotte so far. \"Theater\" might make you think there are graduated floors or seats inside, but it' all one level aside from a slightly dipped in area in front of the stage. The bar is large and well-stocked. They could probably stand to add a third bartender for bigger shows. There is surprisingly plenty of parking. You'll find a lot across the street and also behind the venue. The bouncers out front can be grumpy even before the shows start, but ignore them because the bartenders are awesome.\n\nI fully believe that whatever you might find less than optimal about the people or the place, the intimacy of the stage to the crowd will make it worth the trip!
