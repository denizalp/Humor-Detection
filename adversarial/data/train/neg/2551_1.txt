Fantastic studio! Gorgeous-- every detail is perfect. The instructor Mary was also great. I practice Bikram and she was very welcoming and took the time to explain the difference in their series and how the heat m\/humidity may differ from my home studio. The series is a nice combo of vinyasa and Bikram. When I visit Scottsdale again I will definitely be back.
