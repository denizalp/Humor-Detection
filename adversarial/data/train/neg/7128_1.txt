This pizza is tasty high quailty ingredients cheese is amazing! Absolutely FRESH veggies! Little Caesars form employee  sorry dont agree with your review. I'm a mushroom liver and there are fresh in fact they are mini portobellos! Anyhow family owned nice people with good pizza ,wings and decent pasta wasn't crazy about marinara but thats my personsl opion since sauce I make is little sweeter less acidic and less thick. Supoort local family pizzeria's $ this is a good one. Closed on Sundays
