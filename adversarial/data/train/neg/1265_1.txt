The finer things in greater variety.\n\nWolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is a bit misleading in it's complexity.  One quick look would expect a great place to grab a quick drink and some pub food, and you wouldn't be wrong in that regard, but you'd miss the other amazing entrees covering seafood, pasta, and more.\n\nI started my meal with the tuna tartar.  The fish was packed with flavor, topped with fresh avocado and a spicy sriracha a√Øoli sauce that blended savory and spicy with just a hint of tart.  For my main course, I split their mushroom pizza and seafood pasta.  The pizza, more catered to the bar lover's food, consisted of a variety of wild mushrooms, layered evenly so that each bit had a different flavor, then topped with a black truffle sauce for added punch.  The seafood pasta was loaded with shrimp, scallops, and fish, covered in a creamy tomato sauce that felt rich and satisfying.  \n\nAnd while you can get free drinks at any of the slot machines, I recommend enjoying one of Wolfgang's cocktails.  Their moscow mule was packed with smooth vodka that went down easy and refreshed me for a night of partying.  \n\nWolfgang is a fantastic way to start an evening of debauchery or relaxation while you're in Vegas.
