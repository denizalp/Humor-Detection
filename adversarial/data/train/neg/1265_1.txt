Was definitely an experience! From being lead into a dark room by your waiter, to managing to eat food without being able to see. The food we ordered was all very tasty. And we had a great deal with a three course dinner for two found on groupon. The price is appropriate to what you receive and the service was great. Would recommend for people to try it for themselves!
