We went in for a mid-week dinner after purchasing groupon deal. We were impressed by the chic modern decor. We got seated near the open kitchen, the chefs were quite animated. The waiters were attentive and pleasant. \nWe got smoked pork croquettes to start. What a delicious appetizer, deep fried goodness. Felt fairly full after three of these on a bed of greens. For mains, I shared steelhead trout on a bed on pur√©e with apricots and pork charcuterie. Overall, the portions were generous, the latter dish was meat overload. My husband and I had a taste of all the prepared meats, with half the dish remaining. \nFor dessert, i had the sticky toffee pudding over a flavourful dates cake. The milk chocolate pudding was a nice compliment to a small cappuccino.\n\nOverall, a very nice meal with excellent service. Definitely would go back again.
