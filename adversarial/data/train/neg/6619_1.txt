I have recently had an on going issue with a damage product from March I have called weekly about this issue and have got no resolve, ending up going to another shop to get the same product again. This pathetic display of customer service has been seriously disappointing. Refusal to get\/ give a refund lack of returned calls. Refusal to give store credit.  Buyer beware!!!!! It's bad enough you have to wait weeks for a special order but then you don't take care of the customer afterwards?????\n\nNo thanks!!!!
