This shop is a sham! I paid $150 + for a medium and a small wedding bouquet. I asked to pay for a floral arrangement that I found on their website. The lady (owner) I spoke with said yes I would get the entire arrangement turned into a bouquet and I paid an extra $30 for the small one. When I received my bouquets on my wedding day they looked as if a 6 year old picked some flowers out of a field and put some flower tap around it. I received about 15 flowers between the two bouquets. When I called the store to complain the owner proceed to yell at me on the phone saying I knew what I was ordering and that she is \"the master florist.\" she then hung up on me and refused to answer any other calls I tried to make that day to the shop. I never write bad reviews but when I am treated the way she treated me everyone needs to know how bad they are. NEVER BUY FROM HERE!
