I work across the street and absolutely love this place! The lines get long sometimes around lunch but if you call ahead they are extremely friendly and quick to have orders ready when I can pick it up. Unfortunately there are no other locations and is owned by a small business owner.  BONUS! The Sonoran Turkey sandwich and lemon bars are worth the short wait!
