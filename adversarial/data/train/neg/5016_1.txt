It's hard to find an authentic place to eat these days. The ambiance, decor, and food were just that. Everything we had was delicious (and unique, to us at least) from the Larb, to the spicy pickled cucumbers. The Pad Thai was wonderful as well. Our favorite by far, however, and large enough to feed 2-4 people alone was the Seafood Soup. The flavors were powerful and delectable. We were full for like two days, haha. Great service too. We went at 5pm on a Sat. night and we basically had the place to ourselves. It was very busy by 7pm. When we're back in that area, there is no doubt we will go there again!  Not expensive, very reasonably priced, ESPECIALLY considering how much food we had (and had left over). Reservations recommended.
