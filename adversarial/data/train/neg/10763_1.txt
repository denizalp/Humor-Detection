I took my Prius in to get the codes read to see what problems my battery was having. It took them almost a full day of having my vehicle to tell me that my hybrid battery was bad. Then proceeded to tell me the only option was to buy a brand new battery for 3400 after tax. Then charged me $138 to tell me my battery was bad.\n\nI then went to someone else who gladly replaced my battery just shy of 1k and said that my experience with Wilhelm was completely unwarranted. Paid $138 to tell me what we already knew. Would not reccomend them.
