I would give it 0 stars if I could. I've been dealing with these folks for just under a year now and they're grossly incompetent. My list of issues\/incidents is too much to list here, but I can summarize by saying that only one encounter out of the dozens I've had with them has gone smoothly. They can barely handle making appointments. The docs are \"so-so\" as well, but the office staff is unbelievable.
