I love this place for all things concerning my two Yorkie dogs!  I've bought great harnesses here for both winter and summer, food, and now GROOMING!  Sherry is the very best dog groomer for my Yorkies...she did a great job today and they look so CUTE! \n\nShe was very aware of the special care of my female Yorkie who is a breeder rescue...she was very gentle with her and she trimmed her hair so CUTE! and the bow in her hair is also adorable! (has a jewel center!).  \n\nMy boy Yorkie looks so great...she took special care to leave the hair around the mole on his back a bit longer so it doesn't show...he looks like a little bear cub! so adorable!\n\nI would highly recommend this very friendly and great store\/groomer!
