3-3.5* for food, but rounded up for the concept, atmosphere, & price point\n\nDecided on this spot for a late night dinner as it was near my hotel and the reviews looked half decent.  Gosh, anything seemed better than the actual eateries in the Westin!\n\nSienna Mercato is divided into 2 sections:  The main level is a meatball joint and the line-up outside, for most evenings, is for the rooftop restaurant which features a more traditional, upscale Italian fare.  \n\nAlthough I wouldn't order the Veg Meatballs again, they were well seasoned, but the texture was mushy (from the white beans), I liked the Mac 'n Cheese that came with them, Marinara was ok, and I loved the concept!\n\nNot only were prices decent, but you could mix and match the kind of meatballs - or even meatless - in various different plates, sauces, & even add sides if you want.\n\nThey also had a cheap dessert menu which consisted of a few items for $5.  I would NEVER see a $5 dessert in Toronto, so that was a treat.\n\nWould definitely go back to try the other meatballs, sauces, sides, & of course, the numerous beers that they offer!
