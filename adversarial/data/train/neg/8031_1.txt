If you're looking for burgers in the PATH,  you're not really going to get many good choices. Your options won't drift far from the Wendy's and the McDonald's...at least that's what I thought before coming to Manhattan's. There is pretty much always a long line up here whenever I come,  and for good reason. Breakfast platters? Check. Gourmet burgers the size of my head? Check. Salads and Poutine? Check. Pretty much a one stop shop for all your gourmet diner eats. Luckily, ordering is as quick as any other foodcourt establishment, and their prices arent outrageous for what you get.\n\nI had the Green Monster Burger: thick beef patty cooked on a grill, avocado, bacon, and other fresh veggies, all on a fresh baked burger bun. The portions were so gigantic I could barely finish it! Needless to say I had no regrets... other than having a food coma after, that is!
