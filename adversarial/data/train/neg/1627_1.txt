This place reminds me of the meat shop I grew up going to.  True butcher shop. Filet is $21.99 a pound which is pretty much the going rate.  Phenomenal quality filet...as in restaurant quality.  Other stuff sold there?  Spices, seasonings, deli meat, cheese, pasta.  I have been searching for a replacement steak rub, and dare I say I found a GREAT one here (Szged brand).  Yowza it is awesome.  The parking lot (I don't know if you can even call it a lot...it is more of a parking 'strip') is completely messed so I suggest you enter their parking strip with one hand on the wheel and one hand on the horn if you know what I mean...
