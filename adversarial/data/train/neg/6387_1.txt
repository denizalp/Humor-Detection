I had the BEST dress shopping experience here! Even though I did not find my dress here, I would still recommend to every bride stopping at Something White! Rebecca (one of the owners) is truly the nicest lady, and she gave me the full bridal dress shopping experience. She was so patient with me while I was deciding between gown styles, and then she was just as happy as I was when I decided on a style! She even took the time to put my hair up in an up-do, added some jewelry, and put a veil on me so that I could get a feel for the whole bridal look :) My mom, sisters, and I truly recommend Something White! It's the cutest shop with a great selection of gowns!
