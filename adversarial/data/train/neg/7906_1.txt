This comparatively new building houses a pleasant open-space library. Not one of TPL's biggest, but it seems to service its constituency well. It is brightly lit with plenty of natural sunlight. It has an excellent bookable meeting room at the front of the building. Relatively quiet compared to other branches like Parkdale, this also one of the few branches open on Sundays. As to be expected with a suburban locale, it has lots car parking, and a decent low-profile bike rack.\n\nI enjoyed doing some research here and will definitely visit again.
