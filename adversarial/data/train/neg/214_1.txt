Very affordable and yummy donuts. With my yelp check in I got 3 donuts for about $4.70. I got the green tea pistachio, churro, and red velvet glazed. The red velvet was a cake donut, the other two were your normal glazed kind. All were super good, but I wanted to try their other red velvet donut Ive seen on yelp with the cream cheese frosting. They didnt have any cronuts which  I think they could really benefit from as well as more cake donuts! Service is great, cashier was very friendly. Better than overpriced Ace Donuts IMO down on tropicana.
