I loved the truck, and i was so glad there was a physical location near me. I have tried all the burgers here and can say honestly that while I still love Shake Shack, Bochi Burger, and BurGR... this place is the best bang for your buck, consistent food that you can get here. Vegas Legend status. Mark My words. Will be back again and again. Pay the extra for the jazz fries. You're welcome.
