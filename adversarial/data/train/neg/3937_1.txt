We just came in and had the corn dog appetizer and a few drinks. They were all good. What we didn't like was the noise level was EXTREMELY loud! Also, it would be nice if the servers wore shirts that said the restaurant name. They all had on different things and there were so many people in there that you had NO clue who to try to get their attention! It was a little confusing. I think we just like more quiet places. It was only ~ 5 p.m., but the noise was just too much for us!
