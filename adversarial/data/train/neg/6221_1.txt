My Wife and I were fully satisfied with the teamwork provided to us by Mike & Tammi Panos. From beginning to end our buying experience was flawless. Mike\/Tammi answered all are questions and responded quickly to all text\/phone calls immediately. We would highly recommend this truly wonderful couple.
