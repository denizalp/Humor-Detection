Best gluten free Italian bar none!  Love their gluten free pizza and all of the options for pasta (I usually get a pasta or entree and a pizza--eat a couple slices with dinner and take the rest of the pizza for the next day). They are one of the only places that I know of that does GF Marsala and parmigiana (and it is fantastic). Didn't get it tonight since it was late and the entrees\/pasta are a bit heavier. This is one of my favorite places to eat in the entire valley. Great family Italian. Not a ton of tables but I've never had to wait long for a table but I imagine it depends on day and time.  Cheers
