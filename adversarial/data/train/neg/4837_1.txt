Dr. Robert Eng was the friendliest and funniest oral surgeon I have met. He put me at ease with his jokes before I had my tooth pulled out. He explained everything and made sure I understood what was going to happen.  I appreciated this a lot as I was very anxious and very scared. Thank you Dr. Eng for a painless and fast tooth extraction.
