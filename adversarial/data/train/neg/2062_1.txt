Unfortunately we had a late start and didn't have much choice for dining.  For some dumb reason, most restaurants close at 10-10:30pm in Vegas.  Can someone please tell me why?  Makes no sense.  \n\nThis was the primarily reason why we decided to eat here.  Besides, it was next door to Blush, where he planned to hit up later.  We ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, and some noodle I can't even remember.  Neither was spectacular.  The seabass was breaded and had the taste and texture of cod.  It tasted so cod-like that I even had to wave the waiter down and ask if the Gordon Fisherman baked this shit.  I have never had a piece of seabass that flaked like cod.  It typically is more fibrous like soft scallops than overcooked cod.  Skip this place if you can.  They charge $7 for tea here.
