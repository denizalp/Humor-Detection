What a great find for us. We had heard about this place and decided to give it a try while in Vegas for a 3 day weekend. We were not disappointed. Everything looked so good that we over ordered and had to take home doggy bags, The decor is very comfortable and the service is great. We order yummy Bloody Marys and started by sharing a delicious wedge salad. Then we caught a glimpse of some devilled eggs going by so we we had to order them as a side for our meals. I ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT with a side of Mac and Cheese. My husband had the Chicken Fried Steak and eggs. Everything was amazing, we can highly recommend this place.
