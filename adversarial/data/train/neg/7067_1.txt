I went here for my birthday dinner last month, and the experience made for a really nice birthday.\n\nI haven't eaten out too many places since the celiac diagnosis, because I'm too sensitive to risk the gluten exposure, but i was meeting up with my folks in Vegas for the weekend and I was determined to have a birthday dinner. I emailed ahead of time and they were so enthusiastic about making me a safe (glutenfree) and vegan meal, I was immediately excited. \n\nSince there isn't much on the menu that's GF and vegan (there's some great GF *or* vegan items though), the chef made my partner and I something special... little tiny veggie tacos on little soft corn tortillas that were positively orgasmic. When I have tacos at home now, I'm always sad they're not those delicious perfect little soft corn tortillas from Border Grill. The guacamole was delicious, and the chips were warm and fresh. \n\nThey accidentally put cheese on our black beans, but fixing the plates were no big deal and was done graciously. Also? Those black beans were DELICIOUS. I wish I knew their secrets. Or that they'd open up a location in San Francisco. \n\nI can't even find the words to do this place justice. If you're in Vegas, this is worth every penny. (And it wasn't as many pennies as I expected, either.)\n\nNote to the gimps like me: It's quite a trek from the entrance to the restaurant, but it's an easily accessible straight shot on wheels. Sometimes you have to really go out of you way to get to the ramps and elevators. Not here.
