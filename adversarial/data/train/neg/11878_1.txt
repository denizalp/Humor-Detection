I was really unhappy with my experience here. I asked for natural looking, ashy blonde light, face framing lifts. The hair dresser left foil in for almost an hour and I got really chunky, streaky highlights that are way too bright all down my part. Looks like something from the 90's. It cost almost double what I was quoted before the treatment. I'll be going to another salon to get this corrected.
