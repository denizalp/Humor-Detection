Centurion is really cute on the inside (which seats about 8 people).  Great patio if you can stand the heat now that it is warmer.  I've passed it a gazillion times during First Fridays.   I just went there for lunch with the Pita Jungle was again packed and informed me that my wait would be 20 minutes (after I had already waited 15).  \nI thought the seating was really cozy with chandeliers and empty wine bottles.\nWe had prosciutto wrapped stuffed mushrooms which were served with a tarrogon (?) cream sauce.  I had a three bean salad, my dining companions had the truffled mushroom panini and the special of the day which was a meatball dish.\nWe were seated inside, and you could watch the kitchen.  My salad looked really pretty, but lacked really any flavor.  I mean, any flavor.  I'm not a huge salt fan, but at the same time, there was literally no flavor.  My salad leaves were dressed in a little oil and that was it.  The white beans were cold (which was fine) but again tasted of nothing.  The middle preparation was a white bean puree with some truffle oil that was cold a bit congealed.\nThe panini was much better.  Served on good ciabatta bread, that seemed to be a hit.\nThe meatballs were interesting.  There was no real description by the hostess, we were expecting a more traditional meatball served in red sauce.  This turned out to be a more swedish meatball concoction served with carrots and potatos.  \nOverall, the food was fine but average.  I came back to the office smelling really greasy though since we sat next to the kitchen.  I would suggest the patio if you want to try the place.
