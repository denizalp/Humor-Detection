There was a line up  for this buy one get one free bubble tea event.  It is coco's 20th-anniversary celebration.  Even though there was a queue, it went by fairly fast.\nAs far as selections go, there's quite a bit to choose from.  The most interesting one, in my opinion, is called 3 Brothers (3 Gems on the website).  It has grass jelly, tapioca, and pudding in the milk tea.  I ordered grass jelly milk tea with reduced sweetener.  I thought it still tasted sweet.  Half way through, i was full.  Lol\nThe best part of my evening at Coco is the associate who yelled out the order number of the drinks.  I am not sure if he was having one of those days so he took out his frustration by yelling the order with such emotion.  I don't know.  All i know is that my friend and i were fascinated by his VERY animated yelling.  It really made us smile.
