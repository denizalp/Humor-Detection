Awesome little spot on the strip! 5 of my friends held up here to watch the Super Bowl they had the game on and weren't mad that we sat there for 4 hours with a pretty low tab we had been hung over from a heavy night of drinking. Bar tenders were awesome and super friendly the staff was awesome as well! The male bar tender took care of us and he knew we were hurting, took his time and didn't push food or drinks. \n\nOnce we warmed up and got some water in our systems we had an awesome time chicken strips were amazing and the fries were light and crispy!
