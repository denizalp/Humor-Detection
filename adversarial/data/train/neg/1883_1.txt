They're always on time and have plenty of masseuses available, even on weekends. Their subscription service is super reasonable, saves you a bundle, and you can split and transfer credits at your leisure. The facility is well maintained and clean, which is a must. I've been getting 90 minute massages here for a year, every month, and have no reason to try anywhere else.
