I needed a much bigger car than my 2009 Subaru Forester. Wheelchairs walkers and elderly parents. I wanted a 2015 Explorer. Went to see Troy. He gave me a good blue book on the Subie, found the 4x Explorer, did the loan and done in 3 hours. Thank you Troy. This is our 4th car from Trend and we will return.
