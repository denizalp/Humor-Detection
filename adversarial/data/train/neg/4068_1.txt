Great location right by UNLV. Was here for a class and was looking for a change from the usual pho place and stopped in here. We stopped in and the place was not too busy, just a small line at the cashier. I noticed everyone was getting everything made to order and the ingredients were really fresh. The ambiance was cool, colorful and very welcoming. Staff was also friendly and this is an easy place to spend an hour and hangout. \n\nI got a chicken quesadilla and it was delicious. It was large, filling, and made with fresh tortillas and cheeses.  Chicken was tender and shredded and they were generous with it. You do need to wait a little more time here since they make all the meals to order, but I think its worth it.\n\nAlso the lime mint drink and homemade strawberry lemonade mixed together were awesome! I would come back just for that! I will be back for more chicken quesadillas.
