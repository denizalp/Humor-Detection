Decent outlet mall.  The vendors in the middle aggressively trying to sell their items are a bit annoying.  If I want your crappy cell phone case I'll ask for it, otherwise get out of my face! lol  The north location is no different, just hotter since it's outside.  If I had to choose I would probably choose this one due to the air conditioning, but the north location is a little bit nicer with a few higher end stores.
