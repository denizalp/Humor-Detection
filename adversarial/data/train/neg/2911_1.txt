We went for a late lunch, so the restaurant was empty. I had a Wiki Wiki, which is wild boar with duck bacon, gouda, pineapple relish and onions. Burger was on the small side, but it tasted delicious. Maybe it could have used a bit more of the toppings, since the last third of the burger I ate ended up being just bun and patty, but still good. The onion rings were cooked to a perfect crisp, not burnt. I love that they serve Sir Kensington's ketchup, which is a huge step up from the standard.
