After being told that the wait time is 30 minutes, my girl friend and I waited an hour and 15 minutes. I actually timed it. To us Customer Service is everything to us. Our drinks took 20 minutes to come even though we order 2 beers in a bottle (not that hard to bring out as no one is making it) or maybe they were in the back based on how long we had to wait.
