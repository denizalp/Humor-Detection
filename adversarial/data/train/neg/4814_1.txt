After signing up for their Pizza Perks Program, we took advantage of their free large cheese pizza deal. \n\nThe person we talked to on the phone while ordering was polite, upbeat and helpful. They gave us an estimated delivery time of 40 minutes and it arrived 20 minutes faster. The man who delivered the pizza was also very nice. Overall the customer service was superb. \n\nThe pizza itself was hot upon delivery and smelled delicious. The crust tasted homemade with a chewy center and a crispy outside. The sauce and cheese were well done also. As a whole, the pizza was one of the best we've had in suburban Pittsburgh. \n\nA free pizza for just signing up for a program was a nice surprise so we cannot say much about the price- we were charged a standard delivery fee. The remainder of their menu seemed moderately priced. \n\nThe only reason we decided on a 4\/5 instead of the 5\/5 was due to the fact that we only had a cheese pizza. Their menu seems like they have an extensive selection so in the future we are planning on ordering here again.
