I ordered chocolate dipped ice cream cone today it was really good! Allison was the team crew trainer that waited on me, and Adriana from out back came up just to say hello.\n\nAnother day, another visit to my favorite McDonald's :-).\n\nAs usual give my regards to Shannon, Jacob, Donovan and my fav mgr- Amanda.\n\nThis is a good McDonalds to go too often cuz the people will get to know you and call you by your name that's what makes it the most rewarding
