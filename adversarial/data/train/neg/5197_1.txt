Super cool decor and interior. I like the open order stand and variety. However, the chicken tacos were SO salty and the pastor was okay, but I lived in Mexico City for 3 years and this was nothing like the pastor there or in places like Cancun or Acapulco.  The staff was very nice though, very friendly!
