Went on a late saturday around 2am for the first time. I had a very great experience. I've never been into a hookah lounge so I'm not sure what's considered good or bad, the space inside was small, but that didn't matter to me as much because the customer service was amazing, all the workers were so friendly. Like, I thought they were my friends lol. \n\nMy friends grabbed food and said it was good. The drinks are decently priced.\n\nI will definitely become a repeat customer.
