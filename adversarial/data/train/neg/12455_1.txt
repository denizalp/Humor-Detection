I've been a big fan of Jade Palace for many years. The old location was a favorite and I'm happy to say the new location boasts the same great, fresh food, the same dedicated service and the same level of caring hospitality. New York egg roll, chicken fried rice, sizzling beef and scallops are dishes I have enjoyed over the years.. I like the new upscale decor as well as the bar area. Always a convenient and delicious choice in North Scottsdale!
