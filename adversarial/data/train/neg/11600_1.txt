My goodness, I have missed you.  We headed to Madison for our 1st anniversary and since we booked the hotel I was trying to get my hands on a large cooler so I could stock up on my loved and very missed items at Trader Joe's.  Thank you husbands coworker for the mighty fine cooler you provided!  \n\nThis is a particularly nice and well stocked Trader Joe's!  The parking, as everyone claims, truly is a bit of a pain in the ass - oh well, parking at the one I frequented in Chicago was a bigger pain in the ass.   The staff here is just as nice as any other TJ's, maybe a little nicer.  I was surprised by how well stocked everything was considering how busy it was and that it was a Sunday morning.   We walked out of here with $180 worth of deliciousness and we have now decided to purchase a deep freezer - well, we've been wanting to for quite some time, but this little trip and 1st time trip for my husband really helped seal the deal I think - and make a trip from good ol' Wausau every other month or so.  \n\nMy god I've missed this place.
