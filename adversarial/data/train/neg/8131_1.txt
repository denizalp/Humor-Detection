The meal here was very good. The waitress was excellent and explained the various pastas and appetizers. Based on her recommendation we had the various meats and cheeses appetizer. When it was brought to us she explained the different variety of cheeses and meats. They were very good. The meals did not appear very large when they were brought out but they were very filling and we were all full at the end, so much so that we had no room for dessert. The bread with oil and balsamic vinegar as well as the olives were also very good. They are brought out while you are waiting for your meal. Overall, a restaurant worth visiting. Good food, great service!
