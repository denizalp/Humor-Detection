Have been here 3 times and won't go back. Service the first time was so so. The second time, our waiter was great so figured we'd give it another try. Got there around 12:30 pm on a Sunday. Only 2 other cars in the parking lot. The waitress yelled from across the restaurant asking how many people we had. Really? You couldn't walk up and ask? She seats us, doesn't explain any of their specials or anything. She was hardly ever around and never had our drinks refilled. Never even asked. Very very poor service
