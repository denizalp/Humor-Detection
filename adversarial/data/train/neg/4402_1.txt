I always like to use Hertz since I know I will be getting a quality car that I can count on, but this last trip to Vegas I was blown away. When I returned my car to receiving I was kindly greeted by Julio. He offered me a ride back to the airport which capped off my trip perfectly. It's nice to know that even a company as big as hertz still takes time to go above and beyond for the customer.
