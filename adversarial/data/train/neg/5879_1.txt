I LOVE their burritos.  Went by Burrito Boyz on a Friday night around 2:30am and the line was huge and out of the door.  As we were too tired and hungry to wait in line, we decided to go to the pountine place upstairs.  The next day, I decided to return to Burrito Boyz and try out their famous wraps. What can I say? Halibut burrtito, as recommended by most of the Yelp users, is the most amazing burrito I have ever had.  The best of everything.  The fish was big and juicy, the ingredients are fresh, the hot sauce is just the right amount.  This place runs their business really well.  They are always busy and the toppings are always refilled to the top.  Love how they grill the wrap to the perfect temperate.  I really got nothing to complain about this place!  I loved it so much that I had to get another halibut burrito the next day!
