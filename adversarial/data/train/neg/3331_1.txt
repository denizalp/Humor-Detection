To be honest way over priced the fact I wanted veggies over rice and I get charged more for veggies come on guys and then I've had chicken with curry sauce before today ask for the same thing and I got this chicken that had no curry spice at all to it veggies are undercooked...  Very disappointed with Pita jungle I am sticking with Pita da vita in Gilbert.  At least I won't get charged for veggies and it's actual curry sauce..
