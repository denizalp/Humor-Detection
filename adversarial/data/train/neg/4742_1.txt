I'm still very disappointed with the cake I ordered for my sons 1st Birthday. It was not only expensive but the excuse was unacceptable. Why must a customer provide a picture of the cake if the decorator decides to make up their own design? Will not return. In my opinion this bakery is over priced and the decorator needs to pay close attention. I called the store and the excuse was ridiculous. I took it back and they changed the ugly block letters you'll see below and they also broke the trunk. They did take $25 off for the elephant. They should have just refunded half of my money for half of the effort. I wish I received the cake I originally ordered. From the beautiful pics on Instagram to the very ugly cake I received. Highly disappointed.
