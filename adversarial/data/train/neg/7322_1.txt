I have always been avoiding this place due to the prices.. Also the outside didn't look like it would be nice inside. But I was all wrong! The wait @ Hwaro was way too long. So my mom and I decided to go to Lee's instead, because there is rarely a wait at this place.\n\nFirst off, yeah you can go to Hwaro or Tofu Hut or Sura for their \"good prices\" for a late night KBBQ craving. BUT let me teeeeell you. Lee's has such good quality meats and banchan! The beef brisket was just.. Amazing lol. The beef tongue was great as well. Unlike other places I have tried that left a bitter taste. \n\nThe one star taken off is for the service. 3\/4 of them were on a break halfway through our meal. And took a couple times to ask where our sides are or to change our grill.\n\nOther than that, this honestly just topped off any other KBBQ place I've been to. They may not have much choices on the ayce menu, but (again) this place has great quality meat and the banchan they have are delicious! (They aren't greedy with the banchan, very generous; I LOVE IT!) :-)
