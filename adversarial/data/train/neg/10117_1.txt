I hung out with my family and some friends. They have some really nice cocktails and the waitress was amazing. The entire ambience was very loud... exactly what i wanted after the game. \n\nI got a long island ice tea and the moscow mule. Both the cocktails felt mild intially, but they hit in right away.
