This is a great library.  If you want to research something, or just find an enjoyable DVD or book, this is the place to go.  The Music Library is fantastic, there's lots of sheet music, CD's and movies.  There's a small cafe on the first floor, and the food and coffee is excellent.  The Pennsylvania Collection has some materials that you will find no place else, and it's especially good for geneology.  The children's room is wonderful and the Librarians there are great.  A couple of cool features that I love about this library are the bamboo garden and also a place in the stacks that you can use to peek into the Dinosaur Hall.  Lots of PCs with Internet access that you can borrow.  Helpful Librarians.
