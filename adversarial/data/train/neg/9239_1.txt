Came to this place since it had great Yelp reviews, but I wasn't that impressed. First, it's located in a gas station, which I didn't expect. Horchata was super watery, and the prices listed are wrong. They have a tv screen showing that 3 mini tacos are $5, not bad. When I paid it was actually $6. I had the carnitas tacos, and they were actually pretty good, just took a long time to make.
