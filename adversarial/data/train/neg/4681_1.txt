This place gets such good reviews and my friends referred me here. This was my first time. I have to say - not a fan. The hot dog was basic tasting and everything on the menu looked gross. I have had better hot dogs off of the hot dog cart in NYC at the park. \n\nNot worth the boooooginess of it all and the parking is miserable. Will not be coming back.
