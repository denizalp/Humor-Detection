This is THE place. As the owner of one dog and the co-owner of two others we go through a lot of dog items, and this is the place to restock them. I've been to many dog stores that have ranged from very posh to the standard franchise this in looks is very bare bones. I choose to think of it like the lack of looks is what saves me money, it may bother other people. I also saw how many people commented that they did not like the lack of customer service while they were there and honestly could not have had more of a 180 experience. As soon as we walked in we were politely offered a catalog and map ( we did avoid the relinquishing of purses by just bringing our wallets in as we knew ahead of time we would have to turn them over). As we walked in it a very warehouse feeling and creates a whole different experience than we were used to, once in the main area we were looking at the map when a clerk walked up to us and said \" did anyone mention the map was upside down\" WOW is all I could say and thank goodness he said something as I'm sure we would still be there inspecting the map. \n\nThe items here from  (toys, grooming, treats, and beds oh my goodness they have great deals on dog beds) are all a great price and many are items I haven't seen in other stores. I wasn't super impressed with the leash and collar selection but I am very picky on which ones I use so I don't count that as to much of a negative. I do recommend that you make sure you take a look at the catalog as we forgot and didn't look until we left and missed out on a bunch of medical items that my disaster dog would have benefited from (oh well that just means another trip). All and all give it a try the worst thing that could happen is you save some money on fun dog toys.
