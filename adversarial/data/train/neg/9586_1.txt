I went to Biaggio's because of all the positive yelp reviews on here. . . they did not disdapoint.  They serve real pizza here.\n\nWe ordered the white pizza, it was awesome. The mozz was fresh and the ricotta was smooth and creamy. No one ingredient on the pizza was overpowering, a rarity in my opinion. The crust of thr pizza was perfect. PERFECT. It was thin, crispy but not burnt, and completely cooked. The crust was what really made the pizza and what will keep mr coming back.\n\nThe only reason I didnt rate it five stars was because the pizza had too much oil on it for me. Also, I wasnt the biggest fan of the decor, i dont think that the oversized pictures of food fit this place very well.\n\nBiaggios is pizza without equal in west las vegas, give it a shot you wont be dissapointed.
