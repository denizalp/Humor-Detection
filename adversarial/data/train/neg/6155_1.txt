This is a great place! My husband and I have had lunch at this location twice now and we have yet to be disappointed. The sandwiches are wonderful and their secret sauce is an added bonus on the sandwiches. I have also recently started trying out their bakery items and they do not disappoint. If you are looking for a quick meal that's not fast food this is the place to go.
