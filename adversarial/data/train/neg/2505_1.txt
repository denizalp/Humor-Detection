Went there recently with the fam. Wifey and I both ordered their burger called \"The Natural\". We both got the combo meal. The burger itself is good sized but that's about it. Comes with cheese and onions. The onions are raw and for me that was a turn off. How hard would it be to grill them? Then their sauce is just thousand island's dressing. With my order I got a 4 piece of fried Zucchini. Im not exaggerating when I say these are freakin' huge. Ordering the 7 piece is a waste. I could only eat 2 anyway. My wife got the onion rings and once again huge! The zucchini and onion rings were just ok. Plus this place isn't cheap. If you compared this place with say in and out or Freddies this place loses hands down. I could make a much tastier burger at home and I have. But I'd your hungry and happen to be near one I guess their ok. But only if you have no other options.
