I am always too \"distracted\" to write a review about Fat Tuesdays, so here it is. Fat Tuesdays is such a necessity when visiting Vegas, no matter which location you go to. All their options for souvenir cups and yard dogs and footballs to buy are very odd, but I suppose that creates a variety of choices. I love all their flavors, especially Peach Bellini and 190 Octane. I'm not a huge fan of the Eye Candy flavor because it turns my mouth blue, but everything else is delicious! Make sure to add an extra shot for $1 because it's totally worth it. I think it's worth buying a nicer hard plastic mug rather than the yard dog if you plan on returning to Vegas occasionally for a refill!
