Big selection of brunch items, including a separate menu for our vegan friends. My most recent visit was on a three-day weekend with a big group of girls for a Sunday brunch and surprisingly we did not have to wait for a table for long. I ordered the huevos rancheros  substituting for the vegan sausage. While the side sauces help the flavor, I was not a big fan of the dish. I tried a friend's French toast and that was amazing for those with a sweet tooth.  My previous experiences were better although I don't remember what I ordered. They also have a big selection of fresh squeezed juices and other fruit smoothies.  \n\nThe service this time was a little slow but I cannot blame them because there was a group of 15 of us. Naturally it is harder to handle. \n\nLove the decor inside,  and love the terrace seating outside.
