This place has some of the most incompetent people to ever walk the earth working here. It reaffirms my belief that both the company and the food is shit. They had to remake my husbands order 3 times, tried to short him on change and then gave us dry old food as a result. I'm not asking for a lot here. Just for a simple job to be done correctly. Especially when we are paying for it. I understand BK underplays their workers so you get what you pay for, but I'm not paying for old stale food and bad attitudes.  I'm pretty sure chicken fries aren't supposed to be overlooked, bone hard and an inch long.... every single one.
