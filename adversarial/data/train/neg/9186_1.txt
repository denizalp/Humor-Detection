Came in on recommendation from the beer bar across the street even though I've been to PNC Park about 10 times never tried your place... Had a small pie with meatballs fresh goat cheese roasted red peppers and mozzarella and I will tell you it was killer !!\nI am from the land of Pizza Southern New Jersey and I know my Pizza and this was damn good so good I ate the whole pie.
