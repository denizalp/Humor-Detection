My little shih tsu Oakley is a very lucky puppy indeed whenever Jeannee and Ellen watch over him.  On his first visit they had a full consultation and asked me about all his preferences and habits. I got pics during his stay, and when I returned, I got a full recap of how he had been.  They even took extra care to let me know he could use a little tooth brushing.   I really appreciate that they come to me so he can stay home and I can call on a moments notice.   I also like that they drop by while I'm on vacation to just check on the house as added benefit.
