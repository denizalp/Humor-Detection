What I really like about this restaurant is the quietness and the ambiance; the food is just okay. Do not expect it to be super 'authentic' as it is a restaurant within a hotel chain. Price of course will be on the higher end too, so if you're looking for an authentic Japanese dining experience, there are actually many others outside of a hotel. \n\nOne of the cute things they do is the dessert, which is essentially a scoop of ice cream in a waffle cup kind of thing, but the plate is decorated with mango sauce and whatnot, and pictures are drawn (ig moment there).\n\nThe sushis are not the best, and appears have gone down in quality over the years (Sagano has been around for a while), but their sashimi is still okay, and service is still excellent. This restaurant is probably better for a quiet meet up\/drink nowadays.\n\nThe food is okay, but the capturing point might be the ambiance, view, service, and the roof-top (indoor) dining experience.
