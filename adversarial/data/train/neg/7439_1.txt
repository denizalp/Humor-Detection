Waiting: I came in around 6:30pm on a Thursday night. There were a few tables full and we were seating right away.\n\nFood (Vegan): I ordered the spring roll appetizers, the pad thai without eggs, and the yellow curry with tofu. Loved the crunchy spring rolls and the sauce is delicious. Probably my favorite curry out of all the thai places I've tried. Spicy scale here is 1-4 and I ordered a 1. Enough to taste the spice, but not too spicy to overwhelm the hint of sweetness. The pad thai was also good, but I still have yet to find one that I love.\n\nService: Waiters were very friendly and always available when we needed them. Very fast to get us what we need.\n\nYummy, convenient, recommend trying, would come again.
