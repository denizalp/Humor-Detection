I'm so very disappointed.  I made an appointment very specific to tmj and the two jaw surgeries ( fully wired shut) that I've had the  need to see only a doc. Or a hygienist.    The DAY before my appointment my appointment was canceled upon a review of my paperwork claiming I needed a medical release. I had filled out the medical paperwork WEEKS in advance and they reviewed my paperwork and canceled me the DAY before.  \n\nI got the waiver spot #2 day #2 off work I arrive w said waiver and I was told the doc could not see me and I had to see a hygienist despite my prior arrangement. How can someone tell me after 2 jaw surgeries and directions to have cleaning from only a doc that they won't honor that arrangement.  I'm beyond disappointed \n2 chances to wow me.  Two total flops    I'm done
