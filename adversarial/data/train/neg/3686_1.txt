I want to love this place so bad, but they KEEP SCREWING UP our order!!! You tell them you want green salsa. How many? 3. You get home and you have 3 red. Just now my husband ordered me nachos with NO sour cream (I can't eat dairy) and extra guacamole. She repeated \"no guacamole extra sour cream?\" No. No sour cream extra guacamole. He pulls up to window. She says \"nachos with no guacamole and extra sour cream right?\". NO. Nachos with NO sour cream extra guacamole. He gets home and guess what. That's right. Covered in sour cream. I can't eat my food. So he has to go back. \nLanguage barrier?  They don't care? Dumb? I'm not sure. But it's frustrating to not get what you paid for the first time. Food is pretty dang good for price. If you can get in habit of investigating your food, salsas etc before you drive off then your golden.
