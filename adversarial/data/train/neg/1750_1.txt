Rude Owner! \nExpired items! Now that he's expended his store, he's out of stock on many things and trying to sell his expired items. I've asked for 1 item from past 3weeks and it still hasn't be restocked! Beware to check well before buying canned stuffs like pickles and frozen goods especially rotis and batter from this place! \nVisited with my son (4yr old) yesterday, he was excited on seeing one of his favorite food item on the shelves(mixture) and promptly went to taste it like any small kid would do! The owner Mr Bala reluctantly shouted at him for touching it! What would a small kid know how he needs to pick it up! He went on to say, what do you think your doing, this is not your house! \nMy son was so taken aback he couldn't get over this trauma for a few hours, he was hesitant to eat the mixture at home also saying that rude uncle will scold me if I have it! He wouldn't stop crying. \nLater before I left the store his employee apologized for her boss's behavior! Atleast I wasn't the only one thinking he was rude! \nDefinitely not going there again and making sure none of my friends go either. \nCan't wait for Patel brothers to open in north charlotte, things would be so much easier then!
