5 stars because for the AYCE price and quality of food, it cant be beat! service was friendly, not much conversation but i go there for the food. went initially because of the Yelp reviews, and i was SO PLEASED with the food!!! \n\nthe kalbi was delightful.. definitely my favorite on the menu. man du was not too greasy\/oily, i ordered two of that :) i like the fact that they allow only two to three orders per round (per person) (IOW: 2 people can order 6 dishes). the volcano pork was supposed to be spicy.. and it looked really spicy, w the red sauce.. but it was not spicy in the least bit. that's okay, because it was still okay to eat (i'd give the volcano pork a 6 out of 10). garlic shrimp was a pain to deshell, so i just ate it whole (and it was pretty good with the shells!!) chap chae was good too. kalbi and chap chae was my top 2. bulgogi was mediocre.. tasted like pure beef.. not much to it. spicy tuna roll was okay, but the love sushi roll was really good too!! \n\noverall, love this place. also you should know a few things before heading over there in terms of pricing: \n-if one person gets an All You Can Eat, everyone else at the table MUST get AYCE (no exceptions!)\n-if you get AYCE, and you would to order some items that is not on the AYCE menu (such as bibimbap), it would cost $4 for the other items instead of the regular price. however, you would not be allowed to take those items (that are not AYCE) home if you can't finish it. if you decide to do some takeout along with your dining in, it would be regular price and not $4.00\n\ncan't wait to come back here when i get back to vegas!!
