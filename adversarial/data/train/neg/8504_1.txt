Went here bc my boyfriend likes Chinese buffets. Could barely concentrate on the food bc, as another reviewer put it, this place smelled like a basement. There is a small room off to the side of the main dining area where I could noticeably see a mop and bucket in full view. Not very fun to look at cleaning supplies while I'm eating. Also, the place was unbelievably humid, no fresh air whatsoever. Who knows, maybe the food wasn't half bad, but the environment kept me from enjoying anything. Would not recommend.
