We take all our family pets here, and it is the best. They never try to upsell unnecessary nonsense or procedures and even my high stress animals come out happy and calm, which is insane. I wish the cat condos were a bit bigger but my kitties are a bit...rotund. I love how the cat rooms look out into the desert though! \n\nEveryone I have ever interacted with here has been amazing. My cat screams like a scary movie and my Mom's dog gets nervous and tries to hide but they never bat an eye or act like our animals are strange. \n\nHighly recommended!
