I went with great expectations based upon the glowing reviews here at YELP.  What a letdown. \n\nA polite way to describe the interior would be to call it shabby.  It is long overdue for a substantial makeover, including new tables and chairs.  The waitress was not what I would call friendly.  I must admit that the food did come quickly but.... it was the chef who delivered it to my table.  \n\nI was not impressed with the flavour of either of the two dishes I ordered.   I asked if they had soda water.  NO....instead I was directed to the back of the restaurant and told to pour myself tap water from the sink.  When asked if I wanted chopsticks or fork, I opted for a fork and to my surprise the waitress brought the cheapest white plastic fork I have ever seen. The whole experience was underwhelming and I could not wait to leave.  The fishballs were bland, the beef was bland and the shrimp balls were nothing to rave about. \n\nWould I ever go back or recommend this place?  Not a hope in hell.
