A coworker of mine had told me about saltcellar as a suggestion for us to go to dinner for my birthday she had mentioned that the food was great that it was romantic and they were nice and gave her a complementary birthday dessert and it was fabulous,however it didn't happen that way for us.    My husband made reservations for us online for dinner,for my birthday. Online they ask my husband if we where celebrating any special occasion, my husband told them that we where celebrating my birthday. During our entire dining experience they made NO mention of my birthday to us. (Why even ask the question when we made the reservation)!!!   Our table was so small &  cramped,  to the point that we could hear everything the table next to us was talking about!  There was a candle on our table but I couldn't hear any music which really took a lot from the experience!! not romantic at all. I had a $40 entry (blackened halibut), which is my favorite fish. I was so disappointed  it was very dry &  certainly not a at  $40 entry. My husband had the salmon which had little flavor.   However our crab cakes (appetizer) was great. OuR server walked by our table 2 times, finally on the 3rd trip by,  he finally  offered to pick up our plates!!!  This was our first visit and last. Our dining experience was certainly not a good value ($160 which included  gratuity) wow!!
