I did an extensive search for a green corn tamale with green sauce in the Gilbert\/Mesa area that would be an equal to Ajo Al's in Scottsdale.  I was thrilled and delighted when I discovered Nando's.   Their green corn tamale is perfection on a plate.  My only complaint is they charge extra for a little additional green sauce.
