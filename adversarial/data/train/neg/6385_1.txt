Being a first time patient, asking for your drivers license and insurance card and then tell you to have a seat and theyll return it to you ASAP! A few minutes later get called back into one of the rooms come out 45 minutes later not realizing that they had never returned it and getting home and go to get your license and realize they still have it! Then advertise your open till 7 o'clock and at 20 after six are closed. So that really was in a very good first impression and actually may be my last considering the fact that I had to drive around without a license and met up with outta town friends with no license!
