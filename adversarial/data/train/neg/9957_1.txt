I think this restaurant has two names.  The sign outside says Le 17eme, yet inside I saw the name Restaurant Minerva.  The receipt said Le 17eme, so I'm putting this review under the name on the window and receipt.\n\nI had the Le carr√© d'agneau or rack of lamb.  It was a good cut of meat, with a nice sauce some nice vegetables and I believe a potato puff.
