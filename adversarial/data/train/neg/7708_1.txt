I have to rave about this place....\n\nNot only are the portions HUGE, but the food is absolutely delicious.\nThe boyfriend and I split the Hawkeye omelette, which has chicken, avocado, bacon, and melty cheese all in  fluffy omelette pillow.\nNot only did this save us money, but we were still stuffed. \n\nI can't wait to go back!
