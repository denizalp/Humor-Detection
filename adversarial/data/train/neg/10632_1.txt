The location is spot on with being near other businesses that may encompass your to do\/errands list and being near the freeway is another bonus. Parking lot is big enough to get gas, stop in for a snack, go through the car wash, and be on your way without too much congestion. Prices are usually a few cents lower than other gas stations and I say every penny counts. Except they do charge 35 cents fee for non cash transactions and I rarely carry 60$ cash so I end up paying the fee. \nInside has all the unhealthy snacks and drinks that anyone could ever want.
