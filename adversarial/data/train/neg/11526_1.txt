A group of 6 stopped in for a late dinner one evening.  We were happy this was open and full menu still.  \n\nWe just ordered a lot of dishes for the group and let the server bring a variety. Overall it worked out very well. We got a good variety and the food was excellent.\n\nThe sushi was fresh and well made, the rock shrimp tempura was outstanding, the steak was cooked perfectly with a char\/med rare middle.\n\nSome things seemed overpriced for what you actually get, but everything was excellent so easier to overlook.\n\nThe group enjoyed the food, we dont have any major complaints.  Can see this as a good stop for a single diner also as it has a nice bar with food service at it for a option to eat at.
