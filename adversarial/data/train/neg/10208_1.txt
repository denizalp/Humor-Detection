My experience was NOT as positive as that of the other reviewers. I'd been referred to Dr. Shalev by my dentist for some sudden extreme and painful sensitivity in the entire lower left quadrant of my mouth. I was kept waiting in a freezing office (the hygienist DID give me a blanket) for 45 minutes, until Dr. Shalev deigned to put in an appearance. He seemed rushed and disinterested. I told him what my symptoms were, and explained that I was puzzled because the pain was not consistent; \"it comes and goes, seemingly without reason...\" he started tapping on my teeth, and when I winced, he sneered, \"that tooth didn't hurt a minute ago, but it hurts NOW?\" I almost shouted at him, \"ISN'T THAT WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU?\" He said \"I can't diagnose you... you need a periodontist... it's not the tooth... it's nerve pain...it might be a tumor...! I'll give you a referral.\" and then he was gone. He practically left skid marks. He was a real jerk with NO bedside manner at all. \n\nI felt sorry for the women working in his office; they seemed nice. He was a real asshat.
