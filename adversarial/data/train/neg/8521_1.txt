I feel compelled to update my review. My cousins and I had some more time to kill before I had to head over to the Wynn to meet with friends, so we decided to smoke some hookah. I was a little apprehensive after my experience here last time. Fortunately, the place was pretty dead, so we actually had very good service.\n\nSo now this place gets an A-OK out of me. If you're just coming to chill and smoke some flavored stuff, it looks like your best bet is when it's a ghost town. I exaggerate of course. Maybe we were just unlucky last time.
