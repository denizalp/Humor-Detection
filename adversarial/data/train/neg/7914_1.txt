The food is absolutely phenomenal. I love everything they have from the gnocchi to pizza to risotto. All so delicious. If you're looking at apps, the burrata as well as the steamed mussels are fantastic.\n\nService has never impressed me, nor is it the worst. So I guess passable.\n\nThey have nice patios in front and to the side of their restaurant. Great for grabbing a bite and people watching. It's in Yorkville, so maybe celebrity watching...\n\nThe prices are a bit on the higher side, but it is a very nice establishment, so I think it's acceptable. Just know that you may spend $25-$40 here for lunch.\n\nI definitely do recommend this place.
