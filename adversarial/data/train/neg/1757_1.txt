We had dinner there to celebrate my sisters birthday and I can't say enough great things about this place.  The ambiance for starters really made the place feel cozy, and was full of eclectic vintage d√©cor.  The service was outstanding suggesting several wonderful plates all of which were equally fantastic.\n\nThe food tasted fresh, all the portions were perfect, and I found the prices to be very fair.  We had a wonderful time and even got to meet Chris Bianco.  I would highly recommend this wonderful place to anyone looking for a wonderful meal with the family to a romantic quaint date with your significant other.\n\nThanks Pizzeria Bianco for a great experience!
