Great drink selectiom here with so many beers on tap and various specials. We visited Friday night, 5 of us, and our server was quirky but hilarious. He steered us away from certain dishes he didnt think was great without telling us not to get it. Food turned out great. I got the chorizo burger with a side of coleslaw. The burger was great but coleslaw was a bit bland. Everyone else enjoyed their food. The thing though... it was friday night around 730 and it was completely dead in the restaurant, yet somehow our food took about 30 minutes from time or order to being served. Not sure what was going on.
