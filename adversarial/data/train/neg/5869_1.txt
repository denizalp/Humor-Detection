I have been here twice within a week. It is just a short walk away but I am so glad there is a place close by that offers real food instead of just sandwiches. \n\nThe atmosphere was really nice, it is dark inside but the tables are still well lit. When there isn't a sports game playing they usually play nice upbeat music.\n\nThe food was very yummy, and surprisingly good, admittedly I was expecting mostly bar food but they have a really nice spread for very little money. The drinks there were also very good and on the cheap.\n\nThe wait staff was friendly both times we went, the first time the manager came by and gave us $10 in gift chips for mentioning a 21st birthday coming up (poker chip gift cards). The turn around time for your food is a bit of a wait but they definitely seem to make their food to order, the have enough happening so you are not bored waiting.\n\nThis place will definitely be a new hang out joint, can't wait to go back again.
