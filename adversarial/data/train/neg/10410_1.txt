Eh nothing special about this hotel. Wasn't impressed. It's a room and it serves it's purpose- to sleep and store your crap when you're traveling. We got a room that had a glass sliding door to the outside- that looked like a cool thing at first because it was easier access to go outside but the door wouldn't budge from inside so it was kinda useless and all it did was cause more cold air to come into the room. \n\nThe bed was comfortable for the most part and the service was pretty good as far as cleanliness. My complaints were all about the bathroom though. One thing I thought was kinda gross was the shower had a dirty water ring around the drain. I had to look closely and it was actually the tub itself that was discolored from the water always hitting it- it wasn't necessarily \"dirty\" from dirt but more so like it was rusting away the tub portion. Just thought that was weird to not replace the tub and to keep it like that. But anyway- the other thing that I didn't like was the toilet and shower are in one room but the damn sink is in another room! Can't stand that. They should do some remodeling lol \n\nBut again- overall the room served its purpose.
