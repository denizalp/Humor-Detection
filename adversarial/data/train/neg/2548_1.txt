Visited on a Sunday around 11am with a couple visiting from out of town.  \n\nFirst...ambiance is awesome it's very open and has a great patio.  A fireplace separates the dining area\/patio when the cooler temps set in. Parking in this area is usually a hassle but not here.  We pulled up and were immediately greeted by the FREE valet...woooohooo! \n\nWe were ready for a few bloodies and some breakfast.  Had the breakfast burritos and they were amazing...bloodies had the right spice and a large piece of bacon for stirring.  Nice touch!\n\nOh....and the beer menu.  Very impressed by the microbrews with a few of my favorites, Sculpin and Guava Islander.\n\nWe happened to run into the owner John and you just sense he cares about getting the details right and delivering for his customers.
