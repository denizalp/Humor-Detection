This review is for Auto Zone at 6304 Mayfield Rd., Mayfield Hts., Ohio 44124 (next to Golden Gate). The Yelp Add a Business site would not accept the category designation of \"automotive\" or \"auto parts\" so I could not add this Auto Zone to Yelp site.\n      Auto Zone at 6304 Mayfield Rd., Mayfield Hts., Ohio, 44124, (next to Golden Gate), sold me 2 bulbs for my tail light at $4.95 plus tax, and gave me free installation. (Yes, I gave the man a tip.) My left turn signal had stopped working and needed the bulb replacement. The mechanic I've been going to for many years, once charged me $35.00 for 1 bulb and installation. Thank you, Auto Zone.
