I liked the place, the concept, the decor. \nHowever there are some tables that are a bit marginalized... that the waiter might end up forgetting. That's where we were sitting,on one of the three tables close to the window.\n\nThe Menu list is not extensive.\nWe had the Salmon tartare (that was so-so definitely not my favourite), the croquette (that I really liked I thought it was delish'), and the Chicken Karaage (which was delish). \n\nI love the cart concept. The waitress in charge of the cart passed by while we were having our drinks (Champagne cocktail) and had not yet ordered food. We had the mushroom maki, which was very good but not impressive.\n\nWe felt forgotten by the waiter who was disappearing most of the times, so during the dinner there were times where we would wait for the waiter to take our order. \nWhen we finished our drinks, the waiters just cleared the glasses without asking whether we wanted another one. We also ordered tea that we didn't get? not sure what happened, but it wasn't a big deal.\n\nI loved the idea of the cart for the dessert. The finishing touches of your dessert are done in front of you which is very entertaining. There were two choices a brownie with white chocolate and lemon zest and a matcha creme brulee. \nWe tried both. The brownie was yummy but the creme brulee was too soft and as a creme brulee fan I was very disappointed. The waiter was very observant and noticed we didn't finish our 2nd dessert and asked whether we liked it or not, and we mentioned our disappointment. \nSo he removed the creme brulee from our bill which I thought was very thoughtful even though not necessary, but definitely very much appreciated.
