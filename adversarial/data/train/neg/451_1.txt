I've always wondered about this place and finally tried it out with a friend who has been before.\n\nTo begin, you should be coming here with a truckstop diner mentality. Don't expect a hipstery brunch joint serving chorizo bennies with a side of duck fat avocado fries (oh man, i don't know if that's even a thing but i want it to be now!) This is a truckstop diner in all its glory. Large portions, probably oversalted food, very efficient service (truckstop servers are my favourite for this reason), retro diner ambience (but not forced retro), and neverending coffee.\n\nI got the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes, gravy, and steamed veg. Very salty, even for a sodiumphile like myself. Also tried the pierogies and sausage which were alright, as well as the hamburger steak.\n\nProbably a great option for those lazy weekend mornings when you feel like going out for a huge, greasy, breakfast but don't want to line up with everyone else for the newest, cool, brunch place. +1 for credit card pay phones at some tables and the wall of stuffed husky toy animals at the front.
