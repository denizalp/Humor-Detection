Maybe it's just me....Our last visit here was about 5 years ago. Even before  they took our order, we noticed the floors were full of old food and napkins. We decided to leave.  Tonight I thought we would give them another try. We walk and in and Judy says \"How clean\". We sat down at a dark table. The light bulb was missing. We changed tables. Judy orders the Lamb and I ordered the Chicken Biryani.  Judy's dish comes out but  my food nowhere in sight. Meanwhile, other tables who ordered after us were getting their food. When I asked where my food was, they said it takes longer and I should share Judy's lamb (I don't eat meat).  10 minutes later, out it comes. The waiter says \"Hot plate\". fine.. Part of the chicken and rice was ice cold.  I call the manager over. As he tries to explain why, he points to a nice size roach crawling on the table.  I told him \"we are out of here\". He wanted to prepare another order to go, but we just left. My original instincts were correct. They're other fine Indian restaurants in Charlotte.
