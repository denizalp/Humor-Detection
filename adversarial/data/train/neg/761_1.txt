Very cute and fun atmosphere. Definitely good for a relaxing change of pace. Although the ambiance is great and there's so much to do and see, the food and service is another story. We went on a Sunday morning for breakfast as a group of 6. I had the best breakfast sandwhich meal, mimosa, and coffee. The coffee was average and the mimosa very dry and tart. As for the food, the potatoes where a bit greasy and didn't have a good fluff and crisp to them. My sandwhich was good, but there was nothing exceptional to it. For the expectation and price I was expecting something a little more worth my while.\nI will say some of the other dishes were a little bit worth it like the French toast and black ham omelet.\nService was also fair. Our waitress was super nice but took forever to get to our table to rage our order,  check on us,  give the check,  and check us out.
