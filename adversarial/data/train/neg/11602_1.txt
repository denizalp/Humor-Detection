This place has lost a star.  Ok, I love my club host, who totally sets me up with getting into places, and he didn't disappoint here either... \n\nbut maybe it was the night I was there (fri) or the crowd or something, but it was just off.  Like not good off the hook, off.\n\nThe club wasn't nearly as busy as it usually is, there were tables empty, the bartenders were actually smiling and waiting to help serve you, rather than being 5 deep in customers, and there was no wait for the women's bathroom.  (that right there should tell you 'something is wrong')\n\ndrinks were good, i can't say I didn't have fun, but by 1am i was ready to go, and headed back to the strip to do some other clubs.
