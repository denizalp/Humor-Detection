This was my first time in this location & I was NOT impressed with the customer service what so ever. I know it's not a high end store like a Sears or Dillard's but the woman behind the counter was very snippy & sarcastic in a very rude way. I may go back because of their good prices on kitchen stuff but everything else is veeeery high priced. Such as the vacuums & little single chairs were going for $75 & up! That's insane!
