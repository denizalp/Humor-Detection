I give it a 3star because the place was clean ,staff friendly and food was good. However the PRICES were very expensive and not dine like at all. The portions were small 9.oo for a Ruben sandwich with no sides and two flimsy pickles. Fries were a extra charge at 3.oo and there weren't that many. So buyer beware food was ok but prices very high
