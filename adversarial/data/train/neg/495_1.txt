Came here for breakfast as it was close to our hotel (walking distance) and my cousin wanted to eat here. I've never been but it's comparable to.. Eggsmart in Toronto though I find this place just a little better. They had a lot of things on their menu so you may get a little overwhelmed. I decided to get an omelette because there was a picture of it on the menu with avocados (love them btw). Food came out quickly and our server was very attentive to us and filled up our coffee whenever we needed. \n\nThe portion of my dish was HUGE. I honestly couldn't finish it but I tried really hard to stuff myself before the long ride back home to Toronto. Food was good, nothing too special here but I enjoyed our service. We asked for our bills and he was able to split it up for us (which makes it soo much easier) and explored the shops downstairs. It was like a mini mall and had a few decent shops down there.
