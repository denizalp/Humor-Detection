Support your local family owned restaurants and you will be blessed.  Breakfast\/Lunch & Dinner plus a variety of baked goods are made onsite the old fashioned way.\n\nSuper clean. Wide open floor plan. Very peaceful vibe and the best way to describe the food I have tried so far is that it feels like homemade.  Like you are at your friends parents house and they invite you to share a meal - it has middle eastern style mixed with japanese influence kind of simplified for a dining experience that leaves you full but not \"too full\".  Fresh cucumber and tomato seems to come with almost everything (eat your veggies) and the HOMEMADE SOUP OF THE DAY is something to look forward to if the Mushroom we had last night is an example of their skills.
