Border Grill's chips were excellent, two of the four salsas were good; we requested hot and we like the tomatillo. Our $49 meal deal from travelzoo came with house margaritas that weren't very good. We had an appetizer platter (chosen for us) to start. It had taquitos, empanadas, and sweet corn tamale. The taquitos were the best, we only wished we had known they were coming because my husband ordered the entree so he was stuck with more of the same. I had beer battered fish tacos which were tasty. I liked that they lacked the creamy slaw that so many places like to add. For dessert, we shared Tres Leche cake. It was drier than those I've had before, but still good. Service was attentive, but the overall meal was just ok. I'm glad we got it at a discount, but I see no reason to return.
