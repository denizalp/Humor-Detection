Carolyn is an AMAZING hair stylist.  She has been doing my hair for years.  She is conscientious and meticulous when it comes to getting your hair style just right.  No leaving with a wet head when you see Carolyn!  I even try to schedule my visits to her before vacations, professional conferences and other important events to I can have \"Carolyn hair\" while I'm there.  Yes.  She's that good.
