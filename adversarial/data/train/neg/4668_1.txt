Took us a while to try this, but once we did, we never looked back!\n\nChicken: The chicken is incredible! Flavourful and spiced nicely. \n\nFries: Basic shoestring cut fries, but good. They have sort of a cajun spice they will add to your fries as well and I highly recommend it!\n\nColeslaw: got it once, wasn't great, but if you really need coleslaw, go for it.\n\nOnion rings: pretty good rings, but the chicken is the star of this show.\n\nPhilly steak: I've seen really good reviews for it, but my boyfriend got it and said it was just ok. So I'm holding my opinion of it until I actually try it myself.
