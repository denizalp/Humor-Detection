One of the only Cantonese main stream chinese deli restaurants in town. It has the name brand of a large chinese restuarant but being Chinese American myself, this place sucks horse balls in the service dept which will distract from any food they serve up.  I have a saying of places do one thing good, be consistently bad.  I can depend on this place to be poor service but home-cook food, even if it's poor, it's better than bad American burgers, hotdogs, bacon this or maple this.
