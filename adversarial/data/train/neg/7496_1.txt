We went on a Valentine's Day, and thus was offered a special menu.  It was a four course meal, and we appreciated the pace of the serving.  Our appetizers were not as warm as we had hoped (crab cakes), but the remainder of the meal was delicious.  \n\nWe did order a beer, but that was forgotten throughout the meal.  We did not inquire about it, nor was it charged on our bill - not a big issue for us.\n\nThe atmosphere is very private, and we enjoyed the noise level around us.  Overall, we had a good dinner.  We would like to return to try items from the regular menu in the near future.
