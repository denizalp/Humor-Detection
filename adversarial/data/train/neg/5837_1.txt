I am moving out of the area and will be sad to leave this gym. The staff is absolutely the best! By far, out of all the gyms I've been a member of, this gym provides an awesome atmosphere and true sense of community. I always looked forward to coming to the gym as I was received with a warm welcome. The encouragement during small group personal training sessions kept me motivated to not give up. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and did an excellent job of catering the workouts for personal training to my fitness level. Thank you again, Anytime Fitness in Middleton, for being top notch!
