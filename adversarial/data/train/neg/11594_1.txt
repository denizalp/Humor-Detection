I recently worked with Stellar Home Services to provide plumbing repair work from my home warranty. This was my first experience with One Guard home warranty, and first with Stellar Home Services. I had an issue with a phantom flushing toilet, and leaking water shutoff valve to my washing machine. Both issues were taken care of completely within 48 hours of contacting One Guard. I received a two hour service window, they arrived on time with a call ahead, were polite and skilled. Everything was fixed for only one service call charge, I'm very satisfied and surprised as I've experienced issues with other home warranty companies in the past. I intend to contact Stellar Home Services in the future for non warranty issues.
