Liked:\nThe greens and condiments are self-serve.  Finally get enough basil and cilantro for my pho, which I love.\n\nAtmosphere is nice with full bar, daily specials and different twists on the traditional menu.\n\nWaiter was helpful and checked on me several times.\n\nDidn't like:\nThe beef was brisket, not thin-sliced flank slices.  Plus the pieces were chunky thick, with some pieces so big I couldn't fit them on my spoon. Had to chop through them in the soup to make them smaller which was awkward.  The pieces were dry and chewy, not the melt in your mouth flank steak slices I'm used to.\n\nThere was hardly any rice noodles in the soup.\n\nThe spring rolls had no shrimp, pork or rice noodles.  Instead lots of chunky cucumber and cabbage.  Not the same flavor profile or mouth feel.  Peanut sauce was not very peanutty.\n\n$11 for a pho bowl is a bit pricey but you ARE in Scottsdale.
