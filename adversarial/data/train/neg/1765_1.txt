The food is pretty standard Hong Kong Style cafe food. The portion is generous for $7.99 \"set meal\"; you can choose many choices of dish and come with rice and drink. Taste is on the good side.\n\nSizzling hot pan dish is okay; portion is big but the meat quality is okay.\n\nService is pretty quick.
