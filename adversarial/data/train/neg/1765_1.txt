First visit and last visit. \n\nI ordered a bowl that was labelled as a best-seller on the menu board. \n\nSince the order card listed premium toppings with additional prices and then unlimited toppings with no prices listed, I thought I'd add a couple things.  Sadly the order card is misleading.  The \"unlimited toppings\" are in fact not unlimited and cost extra for each.   I did choose to pay an extra $1 for avocado, but there were only a few small chunks which left me feeling disappointed and ripped off. \n\nThe bowl did taste ok, and the ingredients were fresh and almost healthy but the price left a bitter taste in my mouth. It was essentially a big bowl full of brown rice with a few token veg thrown in with too much salt. \n\nI doubt I will ever return since there are so many other options in this city that offer more yum for less cash.  Honestly... $11 for a lackluster and tiny lunch is quite ridiculous.
