I cant blv this store only has a 2.5 star rating on Yelp. Here's my experience... some good and some bad but overall great customer service.  I ordered a SS Whirlpool refrigerator from this store. It was delivered but when plugged in made funny noises.  OK, it shouldn't have come to us broken, but these things happen. Key is, they took it back no questions asked and several days later sent another one, and also a Best Buy cash card for $50.  The next one had a bad seal.  Again, one phone call, quick customer service and it was back on the truck to go back to them. But this time their manager got on the phone with us and sent us a brand new top of the line Samsung SS model, several hundred more than the one we originally ordered.  You can't make this stuff up !\n\nWhy did he do that?  I'm sure he lost money on the deal.  One reason - this guy has honor and wanted to make things right and win back a customer who was disappointed.  This simply doesn't happen in this day and age, particularly at big box stores who are supposed to be so bottom line focused.  With that simple act, he won a customer for life. I can't say everyone at the Summerlin branch is like this, but the major appliance manager (I think his name is Jason?) is someone I would do business with any day.  Wish everyone was like him.
