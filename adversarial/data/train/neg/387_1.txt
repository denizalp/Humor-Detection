charged me for a \"bounce back fee\" because i made a typo online for online automatic payments... they should really pay a little more to update their website so this doesn't happen like other websites automatically can detect... this is the first time i've been charged for typing in the wrong account information and seeming like payment went through until only randomly checking in on my online account to see that i had a $26 something charge still due... crappy customer service
