I lived near the Monroe St. location and frequented this place regularly.  Everything is super fresh and authentic. I was always a big fan of the crawfish etoufee with a big slab of cornbread.  The spice could be a little inconsistent though, which is probably a result of having super fresh spices one time and then not the next time.  No big deal though as it was always delicious either way. I regret that I have never had a po' boy from this place, but that is something I will have to remedy ASAP. I also wish that it was easier to eat at the place. I know it is takeout, but it always sucked having to walk home smelling the beautiful aromas roll out of the box. Or, alternatively when it was 40 below\/snowing\/raining\/etc.
