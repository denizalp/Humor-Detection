Food here is great. Not a fantastic selection but what they do serve is outstanding. The service can be hit or miss. The real downside to this place is the space- waaaaay too small. Avoid at all costs on weekends- lineup is usually out the door. And if you do end up getting a table, there will be people standing around you while they wait for tables- very uncomfortable.
