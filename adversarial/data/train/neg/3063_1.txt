Just got to this location and brought my family from out of town. First impressions, restroom is a mess! Will give more details after meal is done...\n\nupdate* \nService is a little bit better. Waitresses looked super tired, probably from working long hours... She is polite tho. Wait time for our table was ok... Not too long.
