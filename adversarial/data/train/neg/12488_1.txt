Absolutely loved our experience at Jakes!!! Greeted when we came in with pleasant conversation from the owner, the food was phenomenal and the atmosphere was sweet and comfy!!! Our waitress was on her game!! Everything was on point and we have made this one of our main restaurants for great food and atmosphere!!!!
