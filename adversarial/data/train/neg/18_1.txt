I really wish there was a worse rating, I have not been going to discount tire for close to a year and a half because of the service. But I thought I'd give it a shot again today and my vehicle had 3 others in front of it... I went about my business and 3 hours later my truck had not even moved, then I said I'll take my keys then I was informed my vehicle was next in line then they brought two more in while mine sat.
