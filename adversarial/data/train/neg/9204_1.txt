Just got back from Vegas - Dick's Last Resort was a hoot!  If your up for some crude and rude waiters and a good laugh this is the place. If you can't take a joke or roll with the punches I suggest you not go to Dick's.  Believe it or not the food was actually good.  The waiters are hilarious and pick on you or anyone in your party, maybe you all get picked on.  They make these hats made of rolled paper and there is always a message for others to read and laugh. I would definitely go back there on my next visit to Vegas.
