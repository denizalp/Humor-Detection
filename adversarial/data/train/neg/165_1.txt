Place is clean an conveniently located, however the pants were still showing marks of salt at the bottom. They were pressed very well over, but that was the reason I took them for dry cleaning in the first place. There is another organic cleaner on the street....will give them a try...if the results are the same, will stick with the regular dry cleaning ( assuming this was the problem).
