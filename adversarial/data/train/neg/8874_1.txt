Since I didn't have a full meal at Metro, I'll keep this review short and sweet (and reserve full judgment for a future visit\/review). \n\nI went to Metro for the Adopt a Family UYE. Thanks again to Gabi for planning and Metro for hosting--it was great to see Yelpers come together for a great cause. \n\nOur first server was a little brusque (the French influence, I'll presume) and our second server was very friendly but a little too earnest. If I return, I'd like to see a balance between the two hospitality styles. \n\nI didn't have a drink because I was feeling the onset of a cold (shocker, I know!), but everyone else commented that their mixed drinks and wine were enjoyable. I did take a sip of someone's gin fizz and thought the flavor was fantastic. \n\nThe complimentary appetizers Metro provided were also quite enjoyable. The pate and onion tart were solidly executed, but the real standout was the fried oysters. The oysters themselves were clearly the freshest available and the crispy, salty coating was to die for. In that moment, I was wishing I had ordered an icy cold beer to go along with them!\n\nThis area of Scottsdale is very far from where I live, but I could see myself returning here for dinner at some point in the future. I'd be even more persuaded to return if I were promised some more free appetizers!
