This is the worst Tim Horton's in all of Toronto! They are always extremely rude. Tonight was the worst! I said I was going to have two things, a soup and a garden salad with chicken. She rang me up, forgot the salad. I said, \"oh and the garden salad\" as she just handed me soup. She looked at me and rolled her eyes and said, \"you did not order that\". So then I had to go back, re-order, and she still got it wrong. No chicken. I didn't even bother asking for chicken even though I paid for it. The whole time she was mumbling under her breath and rolling her eyes. Not ever going back!!!
