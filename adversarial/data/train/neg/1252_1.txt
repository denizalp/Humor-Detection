Small Plateau bakery with extremely limited seating so don't count on hanging out for long inside this place. The lineup was well out the door when we came on a Sunday morning but it was definitely moving. Inside they have a small menu which isn't a bad thing - they do a few things VERY well. Yes, it's French but it's not hard to figure out if you're not fluent with the language. The staff were accommodating with language as they heard me order in what I thought was passable French - it was clearly broken because they immediately switched the rest of the conversation to English. Unfortunately they ran out of almond croissants that day so I had to order just plain croissants.\n\nThese plain croissants were fresh, warm, crispy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside. They were not swimming with butter but also had enough of a delicate lift to put it well ahead of any other croissant I've ever had. Mind you I've never been to France to have croissants, but how many of you people have? I'd definitely come back here for the croissants and I look forward to trying other items like the kouign amann and the almond croissant.
