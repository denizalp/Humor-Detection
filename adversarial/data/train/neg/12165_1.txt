I'm visiting from San Francisco and the Chipotle quality here is extremely distasteful. The workers also look hella miserable to say the least. I will not be eating Chipotle in Vegas ever again. #Yuck the cashier also had acrylic nails and one of the workers on the line had nail polish. They obviously don't care about health code here either.
