The old Tony Roma's is now the Sky bar, and the remodelling done to the place seems stylish and classy. I've noticed the place, but never stopped in until now, because it seems more bar than restaurant from the outside. The food was really great, which is a nice surprise to me, being a fairly tough one to please when it comes to Oriental cuisine. I've been back several times and been well satisfied with both the sweet\/sour chicken and the scallops. I'm NOT a sushi fan, so no rating there, but what troubles me now is that its such a bad location, the traffic is so reduced that I'm sure they must be rethinking the choice, and needing some business. I've scanned these reviews and it seems the opinions are either great or bad. I hope they can continue to build a following, and draw a crowd big enough to sustain themselves. This place is right on a level with P. F. Chang's if you ask me, and thats pretty upscale for Pineville;  it would be a shame to have location be the negative that they can't overcome. I live in Pineville and its nice to have a classy place like this so close by. Try it - you'll like it !
