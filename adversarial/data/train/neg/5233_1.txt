The best experience with a dentist I have ever had!! I had such anxiety over getting my teeth done that I put it off until I had a cracked tooth. This office made me feel so comfortable with headphones and Nitrous Oxide while making sure my experience was positive. I will recommend this place to everyone I know. I can honestly say I have no more fear to go to the dentist.
