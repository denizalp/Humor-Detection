It's very nice inside this location, big, comfy and warm lighting. They did have a few taps for beer and the food was pretty good though nothing to rave about. I had the pastor (my favorite) and the carne asada. My boyfriend did the same except he also had a chicken taco. It's a lot like tacos el Gordo where you order and then get your salsas and take a seat. Everything was yummy and it wasn't overly priced but if I have to be honest it was too far and not anything that caught my attention to make me go all the way back. I've heard people rave about this place but maybe it's just because it's too far from home for me.
