I went to this comedy bar on Saturday night with a couple of friends and had a blast ! The drinks were delish, the comedy was great fun and the atmosphere was seedy. The perfect mix for a comedy club ! My friends ordered the nachos, and they were \"ok\" - but everything else was thumbs up for me - great service !
