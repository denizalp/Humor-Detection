Bought a door here a couple years ago, and that went well.  So I recently called to get a quote on some window parts.  The salesperson I had dealt with previously no longer works there, so I left a voicemail with another salesperson.  No response.  Left another voicemail.  No response.  So I called back, explained the situation to whoever it was who answered the phone, and he said I should email him (that is, a different salesperson) the details.  I did so, and guess what? No response.  I suspect that there was one salesperson who used to work there who actually was for real, but that no such person works there any more.
