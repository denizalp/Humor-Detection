Candy side was amazing. However the ice cream soda shoppe had the absolute worst customer service. After speaking to a person behind the counter about being seated and telling us there was a hostess \"somewhere\" and being completely ignored by the other 3 people behind the counter I asked one of them if he was the manager. He said he was and I asked why it was taking over 10 minutes to be seated or even acknowledged. He said well we are trying to set up for a party of 25...[you only have a party of 5]. We left. FYI I bet we would have tipped better than that party of 25 kids...
