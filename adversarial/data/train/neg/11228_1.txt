The food here is pretty good (as in it's on par with all other panda expresses), but it's just so expensive! A three-entree plate costs $12-13. For Las Vegas, this is pretty cheap, but it just seems ridiculous to pay this much for Panda Express when a three-entree plate at a Panda Express anywhere else would probably be $7-8. \n\nIf you can afford to do it, I definitely recommend eating elsewhere, but if you're in Vegas and trying to save money, this isn't a bad option since prices are inflated for most chains in Vegas.
