Visited here for Thanksgiving and did brunch here. \n\nHonestly was quite impressed with the place. It has a great location with great views by the windows. It had a rustic feel to it. Great family atmosphere as well as sports location with a lot of TVs. \n\nThe service was excellent. Our server was very attentive to our needs. Waters were constantly filled and she was very friendly. She even helped with suggestions about which meals to pick. \n\nThe food was great! It is good sized portions and a lot of things to choose from. I got the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was delicious.  They also have bloody Mary's with all the fixings attached to them by skewers that serves as a full meal. \n\nGreat place and I will most likely come back to visit!
