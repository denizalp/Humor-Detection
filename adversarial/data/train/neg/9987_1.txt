This place was definitely the accidental find of the month for me. My wife and I walked in after dinner nearby and I wanted a tea. Was I surprised at how friendly the staff was and greeted us immediately. The Sun Devil sweat tea that i had was phenomenal, had strawberry chunks in it was awesome and can't wait to go back and try others. My wife got a coconut diamond bar (gelato), it was dipped in chocolate and had almonds she was crazy about it  definitely check this place out.
