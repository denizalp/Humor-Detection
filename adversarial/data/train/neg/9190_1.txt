The whole escape room idea is great and this location has 3 different, and well designed rooms. \nToday we tried the \"Wrongfully Accused\" (From Groupon). While in there they gave us the option of how we wanted to be handcuffed which adds or lessens the difficulty. Seeing that under 50% of people successfully escaped really motivated the group so we were all over the place.  I would definitely recommend this for a group of at least 4. I think only 2 people would definitely have a harder time, but if you're up for the challenge go for it!
