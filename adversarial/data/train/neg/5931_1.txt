Neither great, nor bad I think that is how all chains get 3 stars. Their menu is craftily made by a test kitchen making sure not to offend any pallet. In the process they don't  seduce anyone mouth either.\n\nI frequently had lunches delivered from here to meetings, and I also dined in the restaurant too. \n\nFor delivery I quickly learned to stay away from anything with a dough component, from egg rolls to pizza it was always Luke warm and soggy by time I sunk my teeth in to it.\n\nOne of my preferred dishes for both delivery and in store dining is the Thai Linginni. It is a basic Italian linguine covered in a garlicky, peanut sauce, there are is some bean sprouts and carrots in the mix. However I do have to add a large amount of red pepper to this dish to have adequate flavor for me.  This is also one of the cheaper items on the menu.\n\nI have also tried the salmon when I was trying to be healthy, however it was clear that their blacking process involved a good amount of butter.\n\nAs for the pizzas there is a eclectic mix of pizzas topped with items not traditionally seen on pizza, at least until the California pizza scene had effected out world.  I opt for the mushroom pizza. It is a sourceless style pizza with a \"mushroom pesto\" that is quite earthy and greasy. \n\nIncluded with a meal is bread and butter, the Italian bread here is fairly good with firm crust and airy body.
