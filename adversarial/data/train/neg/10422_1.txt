I used to come here quite often, before i moved away.  I have fond memories of many god breakfasts here.  I was back in the area this morning and was really looking forward to breakfast. I ordered the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs. The plate was full of onions and peppers, but that was about it. There appeared to be one egg, scrambled with just a few sliced potatoes and some sliced corned beef. It didn't taste bad, I was just surprised that past the generous helping of peppers and onions there was not much food. Oh well, I guess good things can't last forever.
