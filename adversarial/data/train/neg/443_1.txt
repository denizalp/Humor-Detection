Good place to go if you're down to grab some wings or ribs. Their ribs are a decent size! We got the greek ribs, honey garlic ribs, salt and pepper ribs, and then the nachos. I'm telling you, the half nacho order is huge. I mean, serves about 5 people. I don't even want to know what the full order is! They had a couple of pool tables so we indulged in that and if you're a sports fanatic, they broadcast the games. It was a pretty decent place! No complaints really except that they aided in my weight gain.
