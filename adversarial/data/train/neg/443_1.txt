My go to Sushi joint, in between visiting clients in downtown Phoenix. They have the freshest fish, generous portions and creatively delicious rolls. They also use \"forbidden rice\" which is also known as black rice, which adds a unique spin to most of the other sushi places in the greater Phoenix area!
