OMG! THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!! Daughter and I were having some mad cravings for some ramen. I check out Yelp and hope there is a spot near by. Lo and behold.... Nishikawa Ramen!!!! Good assortment of reviews, enticing photos.... decision made at 8pm on a Sunday night. We made the quick drive to Nishikawa Ramen, easy to spot from the street. The place is quaint from the outside, in a strip mall next to a Hungry Howie's on the corner anchored by a self storage facility. Inside however,  was fun and refreshing. Full of Japanese pop culture my little one loves. We were seated promptly and brought water by our friendly server. The menu is simple and concise. We were excited to see they offered Japanese soda! Had to try out the strawberry and mango cream.... mmmmmm tasty. I had the Yokohama Ramen, and my daughter had the Miso Ramen. The broth was full of flavor. The pork tender and noodles cooked perfectly. We both had a great experience and enjoyed our dinner! I am so glad we found this place! We will be back soon....
