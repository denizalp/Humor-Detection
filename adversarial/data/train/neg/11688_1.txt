What can be better than drinking coffee while reading comics?\n\nIn my opinion, nothing, especially if you and free wi-fi service! The staff is very friendly and very knowledgeable about comics. Miguel is awesome, if you can't find a certain comic he will say \"I probably have it in the back, come back and I can pull it for you\", don't forget to ask for a recommendation on a series.\n\nOh yeah! You have to try the Dark Knight, so good.
