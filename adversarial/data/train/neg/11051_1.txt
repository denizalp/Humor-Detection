my most favorite taco truck ever!! I could cry lol and not to mention i am a picky eater when it comes to meat but i have never had a complaint here and I've been coming since 2014. I get a queso taco de carne asada, I add beans, salsas & lime. I also get a hot dog with everything on it. I will never eat tacos anywhere else ! :)
