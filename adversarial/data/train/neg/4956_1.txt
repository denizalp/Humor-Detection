The Library, upstairs at the Imperial, is a gem.\n\nYes, it looks like 60s recroom, and it is a bit divey. That all adds to the ambiance.\n\nLee, the server\/bartender at lunch is amazing - should be voted Toronto's best.\n\nAnd, last, but far from least, their new hamburgers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nMade on the premises, grilled the way you want them, quality meat. YOU CAN'T ASK FOR MORE!!!!
