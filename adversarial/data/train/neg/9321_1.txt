First time last night to eat here. We decided to do take out so I put the order in on line for pick up at 6. I was there early and waited with everyone else. The waitress was on the ball and very pleasant! My order was ready at 6 and was correct. The food was ok. It wasn't anything spectacular but wasn't bad. It was warm but figured that was due to taking it home. I ordered a cheese cake for dessert and it was frozen in the middle, which wasn't bad but not fun. Guess next time I will eat there but will do an early dinner since the place was packed and the parking lot was full!! All in all, the food was good enough to try this place again
