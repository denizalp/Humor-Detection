Want to look and feel your best. Snip Salon and gallery  is the place to get it all. The Salon has a unique vibe along with beautful art work and jewelry. The best part  is Kenny! He is not only a fabulous , friendly, delightful young man  but also an  artistic and talented  hair stylist. There may be snow on my roof but with Kenny's magic I leave looking and feeling like a new and younger woman, a smile on my face and spring in my step.
