Just moved to Phoenix from Vegas grew up in NYC I have been looking for a place to get my cut. I have tried Twins n Mens lounge. By far this is the best one I have been too. I had a lady name Vee cut my hair she is a little Asian lady. I had her do a bald fade w\/razor line up great job. I also got a beard trim. A haircut beard trim plus massage come to $16. I love how it has modern stuff but a classic look. I will be going there plus I will be bringing my son.
