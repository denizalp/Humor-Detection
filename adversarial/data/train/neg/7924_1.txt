Yelp did not disappoint me with this one! I've had their California burrito and asada fries, both were amazing. My boyfriend and I have been hooked since the first time we tried it. The meat tastes better than other similar restaurants, the quality seems better as well, I don't have to pick out pieces of meat like I do with Roberto's (haven't been back to Roberto's since trying Jefe's). Staff is always friendly and professional. I'll be eating here quite often, definitely one of my faves.
