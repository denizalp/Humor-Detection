I was in Vegas with about 7 friends and we really wanted to eat here so we made reservations in advance, but arrived to a grumpy hostess and manager claiming that we never made one. The manager was so rude and did not even try to accommodate us. He swore he checked every possible day that weekend looking for the reservation in case it was placed wrong, but they didn't have it. He was not apologetic or accommodating at all and was basically accusing me of lying. Of course, I got a phone call the very next day around dinner time asking if we were still coming for our reservation that evening. Obviously someone had written the wrong day down and the manager lied about checking all possible reservations for that weekend. I made sure the woman on the phone knew of the situation and explained nicely to her that we would not be in ever again due to the way we were treated.
