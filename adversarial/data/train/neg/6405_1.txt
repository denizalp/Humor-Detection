This place was ok but must mention a couple of strange ways they do business. The food and the service were good, but.... we called them to see if we could reserve a table for two, were told earliest was 7.30pm so we decided to just show up. Got there at 6.30 and it was practically empty, got a table right away!\nHead Office asked for the chicken and when she started digging into it we saw there was clearly an undercooked piece, we could tell even in the low light. Waitress called out the manager\/owner who said he would replace it. He did not say he agreed with our opinion on the chicken. Got the bill and they showed the chicken was not charged but there was an added text to the bill that said against the chicken line \"Didn't like\". Clear misrepresentation. Don't think we will be going back, two dishonest statements in one restaurant In one visit!
