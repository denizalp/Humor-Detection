This is my go-to for Mexican-American food in Oakland. It's a chain restaurant, so you can expect a similar experience to any other Chipotles that you have visited.\n\nThe main reason I would recommend Chipotle over the other Mexican restaurants in the area is that this seems to be most students' favorite spot as well. This means that new customers are continuously being served throughout the day which means all the meats were prepared recently. Food is constantly on rotation, so you don't have to worry about ingredients being left out for too long.
