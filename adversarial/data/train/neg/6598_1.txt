Short review- I've been going here since I could drive when this was one of the few games in town that served only Italian. Unfortunately nothing has changed since the good old days and I feel there are some definitely in need. We were greeted with the typical tepid response from mama Manzella once she realized we were there and taken to our table with little more than a word offered. My wife an I ordered our meals, veal parm for me and fettuccini alfredo for her. The salad that came with our entree's were swimming in water (I can assume it wasn't the dressing that was that watery) that they apparently forgot to wring out of the lettuce. There were a few raw onion rings and a roma tomato slice or two scattered on top of of a haphazardly put together bed of iceberg lettuce. The entree's came with little fanfare, my wife reported that her alfredo was on the low end of quality from what she has had in other establishments and my veal was tough and smothered in cheese which pretty much masked any other flavor lying beneath it. The spaghettini that I got as a side seemed to be covered in some sort of jarred sauce (Prego, Ragu?). There was tons of pasta on the side, more than I could ever consider finishing and the veal was borderline too much. I would think with the prices they charge, they could up the quality and cut on the portions and make it a trade off monetarily.  All in all I don't know what we will ever go back. I really want to like this place and I would REALLY like to support a local town staple but I'm not going to pay good money for that. Sometimes it's good to reinvent oneself and their quality and menu could use a big makeover. I am in hopes the owners eventually make me want to return.
