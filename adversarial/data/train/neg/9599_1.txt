I thought whole foods was an environmentally friendly, globally conscious business, but the Unionville store apparently doesn't care about that at all. I know most Whole Foods in the US offer electric vehicle charging stations, and have for many years now. I contacted Unionville's manager years ago asking if they were considering installing some--as evidenced by the continuing lack of charging stations, apparently Whole Foods Unionville's management does not believe in climate change, and does not want people to shop at their store if they do acknowledge that climate change exists. Done and done--happy to shop at more socially progressive grocery stores.
