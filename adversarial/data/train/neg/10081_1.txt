This is the best breakfast spot in the Carolinas! I drive 30 min and wait 30 min sometimes just to eat here.  Food is always fresh, hot and tasty and the staff is always pleasant,  polite and prompt.  TN Fries are awesome and so is the French Toast! Although, I'm sure whatever you order, you are sure to be pleased.
