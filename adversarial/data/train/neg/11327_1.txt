This is a must try when in Vegas. There's a lot of eateries out there but this joint stands above others. But let me tell you bring your appetite! Food items are huge! We had the nachos, which is served in a can and the server delivering it, removes the tin can and the nachos squirt out, . The bloody Mary's are also a must, and you can have them accompanied with a selection of of foof items as garnishes. There is a long wait time for a table, unless you get lucky and find a seat at the bar, and you avoid the wait time. Also the waffle fries are bomb!!! The kitchen is an open concept, and you can see the creative genius working as they prepare and cook your food. This is a fun place, from food to their service to all other offerings.
