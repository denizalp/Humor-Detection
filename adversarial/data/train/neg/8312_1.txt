Wow really bad service.  Food was good though.  Their turkey grinder with greens is excellent.\nOur waiter brought our drinks (finally) when our lunch was half eaten.  Most people like to have their wine before the meal.  Really crappy service all the way around.  And it was embarrassing as I was taking someone for lunch. Booooooo!
