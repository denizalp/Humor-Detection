I have been searching for a very specific pre-owned Mazda CX-5 for months and this dealership happened to have the car I wanted. To start off, it was almost impossible to get a quick and accurate response from the internet and sales team. After being told we had a specific deal over email it was then revoked acting like I made a mistake when I had very clearly asked if I understood the offer correct and it was confirmed. The experience got even worse after dealing with the manager, Jesse. He made it very clear that they are a high volume car dealership and he had no time to provide friendly customer service, nor did he care if I purchased this car. After traveling 2 hrs to Charlotte to purchase the car he was even ruder in person. I am giving this dealership one star for Tony in service. He was wonderful and attentive, making sure that I was taken care of with one minor service need. If you can find your car elsewhere, make the drive to another dealership. Every dealership I went to in Asheville provided stellar customer service.
