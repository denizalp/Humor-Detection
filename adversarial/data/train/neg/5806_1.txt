I'd been wanting to try out Moe's for some time now so when I saw they were offering a groupon I knew it was my chance to give them a try. My husband and I went in on Friday night for dinner and like some of the other reviews we were confused by the menu. Almost immediately I was concerned about my decision of choosing Moe's. There was only 1 person working; she had 3 customers ahead of us and not only was she making the food but also working the register. I looked down the line of food and the place was a mess. When it finally came our turn to order we were advised that they were out of rice. We were disappointed but not completely turned off and decided to come back at a later date. The following Monday my husband and I returned to redeem our groupon. Up front I told the employee that I was there to use my groupon.  I was a bit nervous as my bowl was being assembled; clumpy rice, strange film on the beans, barely enough chicken, white not green lettuce and to top it off a scoop of sour cream which was scrapped from the bottom of the container.  When I got to the register and presented my groupon I was then told by the second employee that I can't use my groupon on Monday because of their $5.99 Monday burrito special. I then said I would pay full price just so I could use the groupon. After some back and forth discussion, where I filled him in on the rice issue from Friday night it was clear to me that they weren't going to accept the groupon. I told the employee that I would not be purchasing the food, that I would be canceling my groupon order and that I would never step foot in that restaurant again. He looked at me and said OK. How's that for customer service?
