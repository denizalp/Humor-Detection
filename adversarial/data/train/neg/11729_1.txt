I got a Brazilian wax there after 4 weeks of growth.  They only use soft wax, so if your sensitive areas do not agree with soft wax do NOT go here.  It has been exactly 1 week today since I got waxed, and I have at least 10-15 hairs that are at least 1\/4\" long on my labia (the small section between your legs), and my skin is VERY irritated too. She was very nice, but she did not get all of my hair (the hair in the MOST important spot), and soft wax is not for me.  All of the reading I have looked up for Brazilian wax says not to use soft wax on the labia, so I am not sure why they do.  I cannot be the only one that does not agree with it if everyone else uses hard wax there!
