This is our go-to Mexican restaurant.  The menu is a great blend of traditional and unique flavors, and is consistently good.  The made-at-your table guacamole is not to be missed, and the servers are friendly and knowledgeable about helping you make the best choice to your liking.  We have tried lunch, brunch, dinner, and catering, and have always been well pleased. This is a family-friendly establishment with both indoor and outdoor seating. There is a full bar, and margaritas to please just about any taste. Try the barbacoa and just about anything that includes avocado! Cantina 1511...yes, please!
