Way overhyped within the Mississauga crowd but decent. Food is authentic Taiwanese and their combos are quite good (especially their fried chicken).\n\nPricey, as is most bubble tea in the GTA, although it tastes pretty good and I love that they have small tapioca available. The red bean and pudding flavors are my favorites. Their honey green tea is also decent for those seeking authentic flavor. \n\nI'd say this location is slightly better than the Huontario one in terms of ambiance and food quality.
