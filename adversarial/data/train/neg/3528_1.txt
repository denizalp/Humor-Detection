Ordered the motley Q sandwich, it came out looking really delicious until you pick it up, and it's laying in grease which the bread was already soggy when I bit into it.. I told the waiter. Which he sent it back and brought me another, It was a little better but you have to make sure you pick up the second one and sit it on napkins or you will have another soggy sandwich.. the meat tasted like yesterday's food with a hint of smoke! Fries were good thou!!
