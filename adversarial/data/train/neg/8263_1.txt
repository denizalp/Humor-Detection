Worst customer service ever yesterday! I went into the South Tryon, Charlotte location after 5pm. The one employee was taking care of a gentleman, but spoke to him rudely when the customer asked a question about packaging. The other person in the office, a female, was walking around not really doing anything, so I thought she was a driver just coming in to pick up packages. She did finally come to the desk and I told her that I had to catch a bus, so I was in a hurry. This made her move even slower, if that's possible. At one point, she went behind a wall at the front and didn't come back to the front desk for several minutes. There were now four people in line. I left very disappointed with the service that day, but I did make my bus on time.
