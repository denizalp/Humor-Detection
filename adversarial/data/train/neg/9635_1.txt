This is my third visit to Dragon Place and I have to say from the first visit to the last one i am really underwhelmed with the food. The first time it was really good and flavorful. The second time I was not overly impressed as I was on my first try but this last time I was disappointed in the overall flavor. I ordered the general tso's chicken and egg rolls. The general tso's chicken was mushy and a little over cooked. The egg rolls honestly didn't seem like they had been freshly cooked. I really wanted to like this place because it comes highly recommended and this is just my own experience but I'm pretty sure it won't be my go to place for Chinese food.
