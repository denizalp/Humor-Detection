Darlene is just the BEST. She was so friendly and sweet when we first met I knew she was the one to do the wedding cake for my niece. Once we tasted her cakes everyone was sold on her. Her cakes are DIVINE. We even had her do the bridal shower cake and it was as big a hit as the wedding cake. \nI cannot thank Darlene enough for patience, wisdom and wonderful personality.  I was never had to worry about the cake from the first minute we met. We were assured it would be exactly what the bride wanted. She is gem.\nThank You.
