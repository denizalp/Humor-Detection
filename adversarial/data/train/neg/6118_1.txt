I wondered into this Wendy's on a cold September night. I had my trench coat buttoned up to my neck because there was a slight breeze about. I felt famished, so I thought I would dabble in the culinary tastes of this inviting Wendy's. Little did I know that my life would change that very day. I walked in expecting a burger, little did I expect to discover the true meaning of love and life, pleasure and pain, and the answer to all of life's toughest questions. I went up to the counter where a very handsome, devilish, man was working the register. He had a smile that would warm up even the coldest of hearts. As I ordered my usual 3 double cheeseburgers off the dollar menu, which I believe the new name is the \"value menu\", but we will get back to that. Anyway, as I placed my order the cashier smiled at me and asked \"would you like some fries with that?\" It was at this moment that I felt my first Wendy's orgasm, or as I now like to call it, \"Wendgasm.\" As I sat down and took my first bite of the forbidden fruit known as a \"Wendy's burger\", or as I like to call it, \"Vibrator on a bun.\" This pleasure filled sandwich will make your taste buds yearn for some juicy sauce if you know what I mean. I can safely say that I have gone back every day since then, and I now carry a condom on my penis upon entry, did I mention I'm a man?
