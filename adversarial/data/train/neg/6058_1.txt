Given its touristy location, this bar was a pleasant surprise! We got in during their happy hour and had $2 knocked off each glass of beer. Their housemade Kilogramme IPA was fantastic--just the right amount of citrus to the nose. The bartenders were also very knowledgeable and friendly. Definitely a hidden gem in Old Montreal, and certainly a young microbrewery with exciting brews to look forward to in the future!
