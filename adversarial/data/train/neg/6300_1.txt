I came to McAdams after a strange experience with a more \"franchised\" dentist.  They had given me a diagnosis that included a very intensive (and expensive) dental cleaning.  I have never had a problem with my teeth and felt like this was out of the blue.  Fortunately I went to Dr. McAdams for a 2nd opinion.  His staff are amazing and they went over my teeth very carefully and diligently.  They found that my dental health was in fact much as it has been my whole life.  The prognosis was much more what i would expect and saved me hundreds of dollars, not to mention the damage that aggressive cleaning can do to healthy gum tissue.  I have been thoroughly pleased with all touch points with McAdams, from the very friendly front desk staff, to the excellent hygienist (Mrs McAdams :), to their flexibility in scheduling and the Dr's excellent methods for administering numbing medication (zero pain, seriously!).   My whole family will be patients when they are next due for a cleaning!
