Mr. Puffs West Island \n \nI still remember the first time going to Mr. Puffs in Laval. Now I don't need to travel far from my mom's house to this location.\n \nLocation: Blvd St Jean - Not a lot of parking here. West end of the city. And the traffic is terrible since they are working on St Jean. 4\/5 stars\n \nAtmosphere: It has a fast food style ordering. You go to the counter, order what you want and wait do pick up your food. It's a small hole in the wall with a few tables inside the building. A nice size patio as taken a few parking spots, but I guess that's a sacrifice they took in behalf of their customers 3\/5 stars\n \nService: Well no real service here since you order over the counter and pickup your own food. The girl over the counter did have attitude. Hey if you don't enjoy the work you do, time to find something else. 2\/5 stars\n \nFood: This is mainly a dessert place with deep fried goodness, milkshakes, ice coffees, ice cream and cold drinks. They did have snack style dishes like spanakopita. So don't come here expecting a good meal. The puffs were good, but you need to eat them while they are hot. Once they get cold, the tastes changes. Please don't mistaken this place as a cream puff place, because if you do, you'll be greatly disappointed. 3.5\/5 stars\n \nPrice: Not bad, $18 for a box 50, which comes to 0.36 pee puff. That's the only thing we ordered, so I can't really comment on the other stuff they have on the menu. But it was well priced. 4\/5 stars\n \nOverall: I will be back to buy some more. It's a on the way home to Toronto. But I think they need to ensure the front staff enjoys their job. Is there a way to keep the puffs warm? Either by microwave or oven? And if so, they should put instructions on their box. 3\/5 stars\n\nFollow me for more pictures on:\n\nInstagram: 905japes\nTwitter: 905Japes
