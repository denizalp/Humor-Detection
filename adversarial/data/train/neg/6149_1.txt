I just had dinner here with a friend for dinner. It was a wonderful experience!\n\nThe Dim Sum menu is exciting. There are so many good things to choose from. We ordered about 8 dishes. Some were very good and some were excellent. The best Dim Sum dishes included Stir Fried Long Beans with black bean sauce; Skewered Buttered Scallops with Soy Sauce, Duck Breast and King Mushroom; Pan Cake with Green Onion, Fried Garlic Shrimp Dumplings, Seaweed Salad (Wakame) and delicious Black Sesame Balls for dessert. We also ordered Calamari Tentacles, but they arrived a bit large and less tender than expected.  We took them home to finish tomorrow. \n\nThe service was excellent!!! From the moment we walked in we were greeted by our waitress, who was professional and helpful in every way. The seating was comfortable. The music was pleasant. No complaints.\n\nI can't wait to go to Pearl King again!
