Thanks to Yelp, we were able to go NUTS at this restaurant without worry.  Reading about the crazy bottled-water charges, we simply avoided bottled water (duh... :) and went on to have one of the best meals of our lives!!   And thanks to the truly delicious food, I'm not even taking off a point for a few of the staffers who were a little on the bitchy side (many men wait on and service your table throughout the meal, it's those cocky, little pretty-boy ones who are a little much -- or, shall i say, a little lacking in their servicing skills).  Our actual waiter, however -- Fabio [ciao bello!!] -- was a consummate pro (making up for those bitchy weasels, luckily)....and was certain to look in on us throughout the evening -- a true charmer!\n\nDO watch out though -- this food is soooooo delicious you may find that you overdo, so don't be afraid to split dishes.  WIth all the extras they bring for you, splitting will help not only with the bill (which will be high, but well worth it),  but with the ability to walk [vs. roll] out of the restaurant.\n\nWe'll definitely do a split-fest for next time (so that we can actually go OUT after dinner -- i mean, this IS vegas [baby]:).........we'll DEFINITELY be back !!!
