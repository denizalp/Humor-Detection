We are always hesitant to try steak chains, but Fleming's did a good job. The bread and cheese spreads were delicious; it could be a meal in itself. We started off with shrimp cocktail. Very good. I had the classic Caesar which was a very large salad. I shared over half of it with my husband. He had the prime bone in ribeye and was cooked to perfection! He said it was done perfect and had wonderful flavor. I had the Lobster tail which was very good. We shared a side of the mashed potatoes with blue cheese melted instead of butter, I would go back just for those! We had a very nice bottle of wine. I must say that they have an incredible wine selection. The waiter was very friendly and the decor was nice.
