I love this salon. They are so friendly and skilled. My manicurist, Loann, is so sweet and  is willing to attempt any design I come up with. They always have a lot of customers, so I know I'm not the only one who likes them. I can't recommend them highly enough. It's a pleasure to spend an hour with them every 3 weeks.
