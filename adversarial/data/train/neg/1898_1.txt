Ordered a mocha espresso and was satisfied.  A pretty standard commercialized \"coffee spot\" with an average menu of over sweetened selections.  Not saying its bad in any way, just not the authentic selection of bean quality and brewing styles I always hope to see.  Good for a quick coffee fix if you prefer drinks that taste like candy bars.,,which most people do.  I'm sure the business does well but overall, I say \"meh.\"
