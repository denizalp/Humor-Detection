Hands down the best boba place in town!\n\nFirst let's start with the drinks. I find their boba extra soft, and a little sweet compared to some other places in town, which is the way I like it. They also have a large selection of drinks to choose from. If you ask nicely enough they'll even mix together custom combinations for you!\n\nThe food is also good for the price. Their sushi rolls are really cheap, so if you have a craving and want a cheap, quick fix this is definitely a good deal. Their bowls and boxes also have generous portions, a good bang for your buck.\n\nStaff has also always been very polite and friendly. If you've been to a decent number of boba places in Vegas you'll know that service is not always consistent everywhere you go, not that I'm naming names or anything... haha.\n\nOverall a good place to meet up and hang with friends. Free wi-fi, open seating, and catchy K-pop soundtracks in the background. They also have a stamp card for those who frequent their store like me. There is a $5 minimum card order, so carry cash or be prepared to buy for your friends. I always forget so I usually end up buying someone a drink haha.\n\nOnly \"complaint\" I guess I really have is that its not open as late as some of the other places in town, so you'll have to go elsewhere if you're looking for some late-night chilling. But that just speaks to how good this place is!
