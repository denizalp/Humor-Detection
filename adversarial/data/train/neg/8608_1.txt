The atmosphere and food is great once you get it. We waited 15 minutes for our drinks only to be told that I needed to choose another cocktail because the bar didn't have an ingredient. That was fine but we waited 45 mins for our food as we watched three tables who came in well after us get their entrees. We specifically put our order in quickly with our drink order as we were short on time before a concert at the Carnegie. Our waitress wasn't around to ask for anything so we had to flag down the young girl who appeared to be serving the entire second floor by herself.  This could be a great place if the waitresses did a better job.
