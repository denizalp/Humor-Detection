As I knew I would, I returned to Maizie's to enjoy a more full experience and I was, to say the least, not at all disappointed. I had the \"fish and chips\" lunch special, served with a delicious (but incongruous, I felt) salsa made with tomatoes, pineapples and cilantro. It was wonderful... and not typical. It was flounder, deliciously prepared but less bar food-y and more bistro food-y. The fries were competent, but kicked up with the chipotle mayo sauce - they were out of this world! My wife had the \"Maizie's Club\" sandwich, which she described as the best club sandwich she had ever had (she seems to say this sort of thing a lot, but she's pickier than you might imagine, so I'm always impressed when I hear it). We started with the artichoke dip and I was as impressed this time around as last. I had a beer but the wife had the huckleberry... I don't remember but it was like an alcoholic liquid sweet tart. Wonderful! I'm certain we will be back.
