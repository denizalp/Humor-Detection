Went w my two boys for breakfast Friday.  Nice decor.   Rather confusing ordering process.  A manager was handing out menus at the door and then another person was taking order at the door.  Then got a wireless square to go pay.  \n\nAfter paying and sat down, no one provided any help for the next 20mins.   We sat near the open kitchen and can see all the food come out.  Got tired of waiting.  Went up to the register and finally got 2 cups for water.  Turns out 2 dishes were completed and sat on pass through for at least 10mins.  Another 5 mins later the waiter finally decided to bring the food out.  \n\nAll food were lukewarm at best.  A cappuccino still did not show up until another 5mins later.  So everything arrived after 30mins.\n\nFiled a complaint w manger and took a few bites of cold disgusting dishes and then we left.\n\nSave your money.  Don't come here
