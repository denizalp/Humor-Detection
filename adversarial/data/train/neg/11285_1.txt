My expectations of chinese delivery places in Gilbert or Mesa are pretty low, but this place is SOO much better than anything we've ordered in the area before.\n\nI'm actually eating my kung pao chicken now and was moved by its yumminess to hop on Yelp and write a quick review.\n\nThe portions are very generous.  The food is actually pretty darn good and they deliver.
