There is absolutely nothing Vietnamese about this place!\nI had the fook kien noodle and it taste nothing like what is suppose to be...soup base was terrible a few PCs of BBQ pork over the soup.\nMy son had the lemon grass chicken on rice and they use regular white rice not broken rice\nThe wife had spring roll vermicelli and she said it was the worst spring-roll ever, and no mint leaves or basil \nWho da hell serve this dish without mint leave or basil! \nNever come back again that's for sure!
