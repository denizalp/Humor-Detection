Where to begin...I've never been a paying customer where the vendor could not provide me accurate and consistent information.  The last three times I've used this store, my glasses have been overpriced, delivered late, and no one seems to care.  They offer empty apologies, without any change to their program.\n\nThis last visit, over the course of a week, I've been given three different dates for delivery.  What happened to \"glasses in about an hour?\"  Each person I've spoken with from the salesperson whom I bought them from, the salesperson on the phone, and then the store manager on the phone, all have different stories about the situation, different excuses, and nothing more than \"I wish there was something more I could do.\"\n\nI tried \"chatting\" with corporate online, and the website is not functioning, and then I called the customer service line, and they are closed early.\n\nOfficially convinced, LensCrafters is sham.
