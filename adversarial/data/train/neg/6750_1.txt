Good food, good people, good prices.  Seemed like a popular neighborhood restaurant, lots of regulars greeted with a smile or by name.\n\nFood was a little salty for my taste, but it was still decent quality and large portions. Plenty of options and no trouble with customizing.\n\nThe staff were terrific.  They clearly knew what they were doing, and always went a step above - bringing dough for the kids the roll out, refilling your glass before it's empty, chatting up customers.\n\nThe decor features old family photos of the owner's Italian heritage.Great touch.
