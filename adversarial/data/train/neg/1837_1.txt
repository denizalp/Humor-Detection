If I had to choose an Ulta location in town, and I only know of this and the one in Best of the West, this would have to be... My last resort to shop at for being a convenient location. \nI'm not one to shop for make-up or other beauty supplies 'cause I rarely wear it, which means I can get a bit confused\/frazzled. \nDid any sales rep notice? Nope. That or they chose to ignore and just chit chat with each other. Didn't even get a yelled greeting when I walked in with the fiance. \nDid I hear them offer help to people that already had a knowledgeable background in beauty practices? Yes. \nI used to work retail. The first people I looked to help were the ones that looked confused or overwhelmed. Basic knowledge. Time to learn how to read body language and general mannerisms. \nThe most personalized (which wasn't much and seemed rushed) customer service I got was from the cashier at checkout. \nTime to search for another possible location or just frequent Sephora when necessary. Or you know... Wait to shop at the Best of the West with my sister.
