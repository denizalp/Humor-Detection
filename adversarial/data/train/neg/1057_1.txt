Staff have LED marquee name tags and it's comfortable inside. The red vertical lights on the outside have a pleasant strip club vibe. Counter-intuitively, you have to drive to the back of the restaurant to enter because you can't enter where all the lights and restaurant sign are. \n\nIf you're sitting near the front of the restaurant in that awkward row of tables, it's going to be rough; you might never get service. The last time I went and sat further in though, they had buttons at our table, so maybe they have these at the front too, which would solve that problem. \n\nMy favourite thing here is the box toast, fried rice, meat, and sauce dish. It's best with ketchup\/tomato sauce; the white cream sauce is not flavourful enough and doesn't seem to go with everything else. The first time I had this dish, it was so good. The toast was so crispy and tasty.\n\nMost recently, it was too oily and I felt like such a slob after eating maybe half of it. The meat also had a bit of an old taste to it. \n\nSo maybe it's hit or miss. It's probably one of the more refined Chinese diners but the service and food can sometimes be spotty.
