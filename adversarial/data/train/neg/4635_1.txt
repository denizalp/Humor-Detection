Smart qualified staff.  This is what I want to spend my money on.  Not too many bells and whistles.  A fitness facility shouldn't be too pretty.  That just means it looks good in photographs.  At Think Fitness they have a boutique studio space with all the equipment needed to give you the workouts you want but more importantly they know how to personalize programs to suit each client's needs and goals.  I have been training here for over 3 years and have never done the same workout twice.  It's always fun and challenging.
