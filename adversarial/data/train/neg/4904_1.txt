My son wanted to try this place.  I said, \"The Yelp reviews aren't very good.\"  I should have listened to what I read!\n\nThe place is nice looking and clean; however, we wanted to eat.  The food was very disappointing.  When you think of a buffet you think, \"I'm going to stuff myself!\" and \"I'm going to eat more than I paid!\"  Not this time.  I ate very little as nothing looked very good and it tasted worse.\n\nWe will not be going back.
