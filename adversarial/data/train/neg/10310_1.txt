I came in on a business trip to Phoenix late at night.  They offered me only two options for cars but neglected to tell me they were both upgrades.   They also charged me insurance which I didn't ask for.  The billing receipt is so opaque it's hard to tell what the extra charges were.  Later I tried to call the customer service to have charges removed.  They refused.
