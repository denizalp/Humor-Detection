So I guess the saying is true, \"you get what you pay for\" The pic on the left is the cut i had gotten from Great Clips, I asked the girl to cut it in layers to remove the dead ends, it still looked like a straw mop!!!! The pic on the right was today I went to the True Aveda Hair Salon in Southern Highlands asked her if she could fix the haircut mess and not only did she fix it and cut it beautifully she also gave me the best head \/scalp message and hair treatment!!! I mean can it even be compared!! It wasn't cheap but now my hair is the perfect length, cut and healthy!!!! Thank you Kira!!
