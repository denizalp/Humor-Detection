Its good, and it gets the job done.  I miss Chinese and Taiwanese food so this definitely hit the spot.  But I would normally not be willing to pay what I did for this kind of food.  Granted you can see the chefs making your food and noodles, but still. The food was good, and the service was too, but like I said, that price is not worth it to me.
