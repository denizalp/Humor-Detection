If you want shitty, mediocre, flavourless tacos, this is the place for you. The tacos were the smallest things ever with a sad little pile of wet meat (we got chicken and pork ones) and overall had no flavour. No cilantro, a sad little dab of cheese, and two little pieces of green onion to top. These were just so unremarkable and left me hungry and wanting real tacos. \nWe also got nachos and those too were simply mediocre nachos I could have just had at home. \nWould never come here ever again. I can make tacos at home that are a thousand times better than these shitty, overpriced, tiny excuses for tacos. \nSo disappointed, after reading their high yelp reviews I was really looking forward to trying these, but I was extremely disapointed, would never go back.
