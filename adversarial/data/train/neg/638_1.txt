Slices is good late night pre or post bar pizza.  Pizzas a pre-cooked and on display for your choosing.  Pick a slice or two and they toss them in the oven for a few minutes and serve them up fairly warm.  If you want it hot hot tell them and they'll do it.  While this isn't the best pizza in the world, it certainly is appreciated after a night of boozin.  If you're looking for a gourmet pie try another spot.
