My husband and I love trying out new Chinese restaurants out in the southwest in hopes of being able to avoid Chinatown. And we may have just found that place!  They have all our favorites!  Fried potstickers, green onion pancakes, wonton noodle soup and beef noodle soup!  The food was flavorful and light.  The potstickers and green onion pancakes especially!  The soups were just he right amount and they were very generous with the meat.\n\nThe place is new, fresh and clean.\n\nThe staff was friendly and quick.  They didn't hover over us while we were eating.\n\nThey have an extensive menu that we definitely be back for to try more food!
