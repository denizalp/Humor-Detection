All I can say is that I have had some good pizza and I am extremely picky about my pizza let me tell you. They have to have sauce lots of sauce and it has to be good!! They have you covered on both counts good sauce and plenty of it. They have a specialty pizza the Italian and it is basically a Chicago pizza and it is by far my favorite. \n\nPizza is always good here and I have no complaints on anything else I have ordered like wings, salads etc. Good value and great taste can't miss here.
