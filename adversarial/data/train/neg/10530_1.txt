I live nearby this gem of a restaurant. I fell in love with it on my first visit. They serve the typical Mexican fare. The servers are always smiling and pleasant. I usually order the vegetarian burrito, which is not even on the menu.  I'm making myself hungry just writing this review. Try this restaurant and you will see for yourself.  ;)
