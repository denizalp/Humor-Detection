It was 3pm on a Monday, about 1 month after they had opened.\n\nHostess was nice and offered us a table, but we just went and sat at the bar. (Great spot to see all the cider tap selections).\n\nThere were two of us. My friend got a cider flight. 1 cherry 2 honey 3 raspberry 4 ginger peach - cherry was good, as usual. honey tasted like well water from a farm. raspberry was very sour, but good in the end. ginger peach was just OK. I've had many of their standard ones before Queen Street, Batch 1904 and Peach and those are all great, so maybe get two classics and two new ones to try if you get a flight, so you aren't disappointed. The mint-basil wasn't available that day, but I hear it's quite good.\n\nThe bartender didn't bring us waters until after the second time we asked for them...after our food had arrived. He wasn't particularly friendly, but he did the standard check in when we got our food...which was bad.\n\nWe shared the pulled pork poutine and the ciderhouse salad. They both sounded great on the menu, but they both were quite mediocre. For starters, the poutine was not hot, it was hardly even warm. The cheese curds weren't melted because the fries weren't hot at all. The pulled pork was lukewarm and not particularly flavourful. The salad was boring and looked like a pre-made salad you could get at a grocery store salad bar, definitely not worth the $14. These were both a disappointment. The kitchen could've made more of an effort, it's not like they were busy (we were 2 of the 10 people in the restaurant, so it was pure laziness). I would not order those menu items again. \n\nI think because it's only been about a month for this establishment, that they still have some kinks to work out. The atmosphere and the layout of the place are quite nice, so let's hope they can bring the staff and the quality of their food to that level. \n\nI will give this place another try in the future, but not anytime soon.
