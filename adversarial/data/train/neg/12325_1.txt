We LOVE the Nook Kitchen, Nick, Ryan, Drew, Victoria and the whole crew! \n\nThe Nook is the perfect combo of neighborhood watering hole and a sweet, romantic, upscale joint. It is perfect for special occasions, entertaining guests or simply enjoying happy hour with friends. \n\nFor dinner, the chicken masala gets three thumbs-up. Wow! It's really out of this world delicious. Ask for the wine pairing to go with this dish. It is large Enough to share, if you go in for that sort of thing, making it perfect for a full evening of cocktails (I love the deconstructed mule, very refreshing), appetizers (the olives are delightful! Served warm, drenched in hot olive oil...stop!), dinner with a bottle of wine (ask for the perfect pairing), dessert and coffee. Yeah, all that. \n\nTo top it off, everyone will make you feel warmly welcomed and a part of the neighborhood. \n\nMuch thanks to Nick for pulling together the perfect blend of ambiance, personality and good vibrations. \n\nNow, if they could update the speaker system, it would be heaven. Until then, I'll settle for a slice of paradise.
