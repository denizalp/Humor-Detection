This is my usual dine spot for Vietnamese food whenever I'm in town. Their food is very delicious and authentic. I don't know if it's because one of the owners reminds me of my mom or not, but the place is a good mom and pop shop unlike the ones on Spring Mountain Road with their fancy ambiance.\nI come here for items other than pho. Their bun rieu oc and bun bo hue is very good! Sadly, I haven't tried their sandwiches yet, but i will soon.\nPrices are also reasonable. Their usual diners are students from UNLV since it is located in University Village. \nService is great and your food comes out in a flash like most Vietnamese places. One of my favorite things about dining at Vietnamese restaurants is their \"pay at the counter\" policy. No need to wait around for the server to pick up your tab or split the bill 10 ways.
