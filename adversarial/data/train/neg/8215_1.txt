Fresh and flavorful ingredients! They have awesome bruschetta and appetizer boards. I appreciate the fact that they have vegan options on pretty much every section of the menu, other than dessert. Their vegetarian panini (minus the goat cheese) on ciabatta is a great vegan option! Every Postino location has a laid back atmosphere where you can just chill out with friends and enjoy some good vino and tasty food!
