The food here is great, amazing breakfast. Only thing wrong is picking up an order. When you call in and place an order for pick up, and they tell you 15 mins Over the phone. I am realistic, normally expect 15-30 when slightly busy, and I am a very patient person but when it takes almost and hour for 3 breakfast items, it becomes and issue. This is unsat, I would expect better service than what happened today.
