This a really great lunch spot. It isn't that loud and the food is really good. Most plates run you about $15. I've been twice now for lunch both times and found the service to be high quality. The food was good for the money. The  pretzel bites are the best I've had in Phoenix and the cheese they use is really good. Would recommend for smaller groups like 4-6 people.   Not sure how good they are at accommodating larger groups but seems like their sitting area is arranged for smaller groups.
