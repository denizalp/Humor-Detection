Just plain sooooo good sooooo nice sooooo delicious sooooooo cute and quaint. The folks in here are very kind to my husband and I. We were there for breakfast after church 3 weeks ago, our server (loved her) came to table to take our order-I don't have a huge appetite and told her so, didn't know how to answer as wasn't going home after meal so couldn't put leftovers in frig. She asked what I wanted, I loved that they had corned beef hash special that day, but again I can't eat tons, she said \"ok, what else do you want?\" Then she said \"how about an egg and maybe a piece of toast?\" PERFECT RESPONSE, she was right on. I ate it all with no room for any more. The price was according to small amount sooooo appreciated. But guess what else when we left they all said \"love you\" and we said it back. Many thumbs up.
