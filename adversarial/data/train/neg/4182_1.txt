I had my wedding gown cleaned here in February\/March. Nadine was extremely responsive, professional and thorough during the whole process.  They ended up cleaning my dress a month earlier than expected as well.  Great family run business and reasonable prices.  They are a bit far from the downtown core but well worth the drive!
