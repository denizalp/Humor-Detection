We live close to iFly and have been driving by it for months since it opened. We finally decided to go despite the expense. It was worth the money!  The sensation of flying in the tunnel was very cool. All of the staff were professional and courteous. They all knew what they were doing and we felt that our safety was their priority. We will be back for a return flight soon!
