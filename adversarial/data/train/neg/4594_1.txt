Great curry laksa noodle made with broth, not creamy coconut curry soup like how the other places do it.   So glad this place does it right.  Even my Singaporean\/Malay friend says it tastes right!\n\nThey have daily  lunch specials, but on weekends, you have to pay regular price for a drink, whereas on weekdays, it's discounted with the lunch special.\n\nThey have an extensive dinner menu too, but we prefer coming here for lunch.  \n\nThings they do that make the eating experience pleasant!,...Their lemongrass chicken is so tasty and it comes deboned and chopped for easier eating.   The Chinese broccoli in beef fried rice is chopped too, not long and stalky.  They make a simple dish good and I get my protein, veggie, dairy (egg), and carb all in one dish!  \n\nQuaint restaurant, friendly owner, and staff.
