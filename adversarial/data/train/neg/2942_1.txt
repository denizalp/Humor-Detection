It's time for an update...\nWhile, this wasn't a bad stay recently, I feel the price isn't worth what you get.  The room is nice, but no bigger than a standard Hilton.  The rooms are comfortable, with a small bathtub.  The beds are nicely comfortable and the service is generally good.  My shower didn't work properly the first morning (either ice cold, or scalding hot - nothing in between), but it was fixed later than day by the staff.\n\nUnfortunately, the rooms are quite noisy - I was able to hear the elevator go up and down through the ventilation system.  The walls are OK, but I have a colleague who had to phone 3 times due to neighbours partying too loudly.  3 times?  After the 2nd time, is it not time to kick them to the curb??\n\nI found the food to be mediocre, and the upcharges for internet access ($14\/day) were insane. I know upscale hotels charge for Internet, but those are 1990s prices!\n\nOverall, these (combined with the high room rate) left a bad taste in my mouth.  Nevertheless the stay wasn't bad...
