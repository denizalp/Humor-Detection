Ever since buying groupon there last week we have been there 3 times since. We live near by and to find great italian place up by us is awesome. The food is amazing from chicken parm to handmade Gnocchi and other pasta dishes and pizzas. TherePanzanella salad is off the hook too. We were there last night with friends again and the live music that was playing was awesome. Not sure who the girl was but she was awesome. She should try out for The Voice shes that good. We topped off night with dessert. Omg. The table shared zeppoles and panna cotta as both were house made along with sauces...omg amazing..\n\nLooking forward to going back again for another solid meal.\n\nFYI..This place is not cheap but as long as they keep serving meals like they have been we will keep coming back..
