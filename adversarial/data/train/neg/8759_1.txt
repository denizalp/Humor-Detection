I just wanted to say I went for the first time to this cleaners and had a great experience. The owner Joanne was amazing. They had fair prices and I took my 5 pants, one dress, and 4 men's shirts in on Saturday and got them back Monday. They look great and I will continue to go here!  Thanks again and please think of this place next time you need  great service.
