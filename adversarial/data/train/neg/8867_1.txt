I have now been to galaxy nails twice. The first time I received a pedicure and was pleased with their service so decided to go back for the new SNS manicure I had heard about. My friend came with me. We both were getting the SNS (it's like gel but with power like acrylic but supposed to be better for your nails). As they started I noticed the lady next to me started doing a base coat on my friends nails, my lady did not do that, so I asked and she said oh no I did then began putting the base on others. Then the other lady was using a light and mine did not. I had noticed that the powder was making the look bumpy so asked about it she said it gets filed out. At the end of the process the thumb nail was still bumpy, they were not drying fast like gel and had to air dry and they did not have a polished finish like the pictures. I voiced my concerns and they said they could take them off for me. After that process they proceeded to charge me for a manicure which states it included cuticle massage etc. which I did not receive. My friend was also not happy with hers so they put a top gel over it which made it look a little shiner but texture was still off. I wish the customer service would have been better if I leave your salon with nothing on my nails and still have to pay after not liking the services it's rather disappointing.
