There are a few Hakka Chinese places in this area and this is one of the best overall.  The shrimp and fish pakoras are decent and the chilli chicken is pretty good.  You can request any dish to be dry as it may usually come drenched in sauce.  I alternate with my chilli chicken depending on my mood between dry and regular.  You can also customize the spice level from mild to extra spicy.  Their lunch specials are a real value starting at $5.95 for items such as chilli chicken with rice and soup\/spring roll and $6.95 for items like Thai green curry with chicken on rice with soup\/ spring roll.  Or my favourite dish at this restaurant is the CRISPY GINGER BEEF!  I really like the crispy texture, subtle spice and they add the right amount of sauce without making it too sweet.  Most other places who make this dish drown it in the sauce making it hard to enjoy after a few bites.  There is plenty of seating inside and the staff is very attentive and regularly fills your water glass.
