After receiving my order I ask for ranch and the guy acted like he put some in the bag but he didn't. I park my car to check if my order is right and of course they didn't so I go in to ask for ranch and to get my correct order. Mean while the guy taking the orders was talking about pitos which means dicks in Spanish. I don't know his name but he works night time. I felt so uncomfortable because my daughters heard them. Never again
