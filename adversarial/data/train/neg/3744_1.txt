i was looking for a quick option for breakfast while walking on the casino floor in the mirage.  i ate breakfast here on 10-26-14 around 8 am.  there was no wait and i was seated immediately.\n\ni guess this particular buffet offers FREE wine, beer, and mimosa.  kinda early to have a drink.  depending on what you put on your plate could range in quality from 2-3 star quality of food.  it wasn't gross per se but was just below okay quality.  because i paid for my food i felt personally obligated to consume the food.  lol.  my french toast was soggy.  my bacon was cardboard like.  my breakfast burrito wasn't bad.  the chicken fried steak was about 2 days old.  the non alcoholic drinks are self-served.\n\nthe service was 3-star and my breakfast buffet was approximately $34.  i don't plan on going back, ever.
