Went today for brunch- lots of people, but the wait was not too bad at all. \n\nOnce inside, I had the Alaksa - a savory crêpe with smoked salmon, herb cream cheese and spinach and a cappuccino and was so pleased with my meal. My friend also got a savory crêpe (can't remember which!) and a latte and she loved it too. One of my favorite parts of my meal was the dressing on the salad that accompanies the savory items. So good! Our service was awesome too -will definitely return.
