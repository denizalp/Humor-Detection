3.5 stars ~ I was there around 1pm on a weekday last week and all tables were occupied. I offered to \"split\" my table to accommodate two customers who were waiting. Good that they provide free WiFi, password (phone number) was on the menu cover.\n\nI ordered the Spicy Ramen on the menu. When I asked for Level 3, the friendly waitress double-checked to make sure I knew that was the highest spice level. I assured her I could take it and yes, it provided the right amount of heat I was seeking that day.\n\nMy one bowl took a while to emerge from the kitchen though, even though the other tables already received their food. But it was good! The BBQ pork was delectable and its flavour stood out even though it was steeped in my red hot bowl of fire. I will be thinking of an excuse to come here again...
