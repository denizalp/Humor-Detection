We came here on a Sunday at 11 for brunch. Unfortunately, a bad time for people watching.  Besides our table of 3, there was only one other table (father\/daughter) occupied.  I was a little disappointed but not too surprised considering DC Ranch's 'remote' location.\n\nHowever, the staff was friendly and the tapa's were great (especially the almond french toast), but if you're hungry, order big or go home.  The bartender gave us mimosa's on the house and after ordering 5 dishes, the bill only came to $45.00, split between the 3 of us.  \n\nI can see this place being a lot of fun at the right time, and very romantic as well.  I'd like to go again, but likely not for brunch.
