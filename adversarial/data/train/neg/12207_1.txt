I had purchased the groupon and made an appointment. They were all so nice and I had absolutely no problems with redeeming the groupon. \n\nMy nail tech was Nina and she was so nice and very attentive.  I accidentally bumped my pedicure nail polish and she re-did the toe for me. \n\nMy feet are so soft and my nails look amazing! Definitely would go back again.
