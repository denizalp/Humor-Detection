The hotel is pretty new, and the room was fine. The only issue with our room was the paper-thin wall separating it from the next room. At 11:30 p.m., we could hear our neighbor's TV way too well.\n\nWe were planning on using the free airport shuttle. And then we stood outside waiting for 25 minutes before giving up and renting a car from Hertz. We had taken a red-eye in and were really hoping to check in early and shower\/nap, but there were no rooms available even at noon, which is not their fault but it was disappointing. \n\nYelp's \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" perfectly describes our experience here.
