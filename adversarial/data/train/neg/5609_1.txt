I always thought I could trust pep boys, but my visit there proved me wrong. Last week I set up an appointment for 6pm to bring my car in to have it looked at because I heard a thumping sound by my feet while driving. When I got there at 6pm they had no mechanics available and one had just clocked out. I gave my keys to the the manager(I assume, he seemed to have some authority) and he drove my car, came back and had it jacked up. He and another mechanic then told me that my year old tires were bad, the tread was separating and then \"showed\" me that my tires were \"wobbling\". I saw nothing but decided to have them looked at, as I had a warranty. I took my car to another mechanic who found that my driver side rotor was loose and my driver side wheel bearings were practically non existent. This was fixed and I no longer have the thumping noise, there was no issue with my tires.
