My wife and I have always had a good experience at this location. We visits Las Vegas several times a year and always stop in when we are in town. On our most recent visits I had an issue with the massage therapist that preformed my service, after speaking with the manager he worked hard to make the issue right. Based on our previous experience and the customer service from the manager this place still is a five star spot.
