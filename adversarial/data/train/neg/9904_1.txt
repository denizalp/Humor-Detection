OK.... not worth a second trip. Fries are not crispy, very greasy. Burger has no taste and it is pretty small. Service is okay, nothing stellar. The bacon bites are good but unfortunately that's the only thing we liked it. The onion rings were not crispy, were more like raw onions with just a few breaded crust around it. It was completely uneatable. The crafty beer we ordered was also on the bad side. It was a waste of money to be quite frank... for what we spent here we would have got a MUCH better burger somewhere else. It was $40+ for a family of 4 (2 kids meals). The server asked me my opinion as I walked out and I told him I wasn't happy and he was like -- oh come'on ! -- Well, while I do understand his disappointment, perhaps it was better to listen to my comments...
