So having been back to Vegas several times, I have had a chance to try this place again. It must have been the dishes I ordered because since then the food I've had has been really great.  Instead of my usual gau gee mein and stuffed duck, I've ordered the minute chicken cake noodle and pork hash.  The cake noodle is just like home, and the pork hash is the BEST pork hash I have ever had at a Chinese restaurant. Super juicy and fatty - perfect on top a huge bowl of rice. I loved it so much, that I ate it twice over a three day trip on two different trips.
