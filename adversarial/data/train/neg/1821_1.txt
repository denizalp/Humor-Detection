At first the bar seating only turned me off but once we sat I realized it was facing the kitchen, it was pretty cool seeing everything happen. If you're in a group setting though you won't be able to talk to other members of your group without standing up and walking to them. Other than that the place was great. I got the chef recommended shio ramen with an extra tamago. The tamago is a poached egg. The broth was so savory, perfect. Omg the chashu it's so delicious crispy but thick clean tasting pork. Great service love the chili paste, nice and spicy. To top it off homemade noodle made all the difference.
