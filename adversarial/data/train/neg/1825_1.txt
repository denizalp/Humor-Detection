Great Indian food!  We drive all the way from Gilbert and it's worth it. Not only is their food delicious, Gill the owner is personable and engages with his customers. You feel as if you are eating with family. \nRecommendations:  chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, and their briani rice (apologize if spelling is off).
