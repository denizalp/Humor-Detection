I've been coming to Bong for a Nice, Quality and  Smooth Haircut for a while . He is one of a Kind! I have a difficult Hair to Cut ( Very Unruly ) he said? But he can manage to fix it all the time. In addition Barber Bong is very Serious about Appointments so be Serious as well if you really needs a nice and clean Haircut. He said he doesn't want to take anymore Appointments because people bailed out or Disregard their Appointments. It is not good for his Business. If you real need a Beautiful Haircut? Please be Serious About it? Because this Man has lots of talent to create an Artwork not just a Haircut. Thanks Bong I am Happy to know you.
