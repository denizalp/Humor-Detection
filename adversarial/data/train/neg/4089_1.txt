Good quality of sausages.\nOne of the best liver pates around.\nThey offer an assortment of toppings for the pate which is unique. We always get coarse ground black pepper which is wonderful. Makes a great addition to a cheese tray. \nBacon ends are sold by the pound and what a great way to freeze some tasty bacon to fry up for some added flavor to any recipe needing just a little bacon flavor.\n\nThe brats are great. We've had several varieties and have always been very happy.\n\nOn a sad note the owners are retiring. Nice couple. \nLast day is end of March 2018 so hurry in.
