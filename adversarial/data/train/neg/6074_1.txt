My favorite new cleaners! I came in with a fashion emergency I needed fixes same day. The lady who helped me went out of her way to get the items needed AND guaranteed a 5p pickup. Not only was she my life saver that day, she was extremely friendly. I will never take my clothes anywhere else to be tailored. :)
