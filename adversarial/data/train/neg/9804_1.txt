Whether it's my birthday, Mother's Day, Christmas, etc., my answer is always the same - \"get me a gift certificate to Above All.\"  \n \nI highly recommend this place for all things spa. The facials and mani\/pedi services are truly exceptional. I sincerely look forward to these appointments. \n\nFor this visit I made a double appointment with my friend. The front desk was very helpful with coordinating our services. We both had vitamin C facials, manicures and pedicures. The facial was relaxing and restorative and I had the pleasure of booking Tara Lee for the best mani\/pedi in the business. She is absolutely my basis of comparison for manicure excellence. In a sense she has ruined me because no one compares to her technique. \n\nI've been a loyal customer at Above All for over five years now. Their commitment to quality in the spa services department keeps me coming back. \n\nLove this place.
