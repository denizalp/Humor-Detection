So I dropped in around 11:30 PM and was presented with a limited late night menu. On the bright side, the award winning Bacon Mac n Cheese burger and quad fries were among the selected moonlight survivors. Las Vegas has become a Mecca for gourmet burgers and Guy's spot is a strong contributor. The only thing preventing me from giving this place the 5 stars it deserves is the cost. Gordon Ramsay's \"Burgr\" has to be considered a strong rival and my comparable burger there was $6 less, leaving enough left over to add their incredible Oreo creme brûlée milk shake. That being said, you're in Vegas and I'd recommend hitting both Guy and Gordon's spot for a heated burger showdown. If you can only choose one, I would personally give Gordon the slight edge but it could go either way. Gordon's patties are smaller but thicker and Guy's are bigger but thiner. Depending on how you like your burger prepared this could drastically affect your experience. I mean, I personally wouldn't want a one inch thick \"well done\" burger or a quarter inch thick burger done \"medium rare.\" \n\nTry it or Diet Final Word\n\nTry it... and take. your. time. If you do it right the $19 you pay for your burger will save you $50+ in the casino.
