It's a super Shopper's, a pharmacy with the makeup section as you walk in. The nice thing about this particular Shopper's set up is there is a desk where the make up girl is generally working and greets you as you walk in. A nice touch. \n\nThere is also a separate vitamin section behind the makeup section, but is blocked off from the make up section for some reason. Followed by the usual deodorant section, baby section, the pharmacy and meds and in the back and tucked away in the back corner is a post office. \n\nJust in front of the post office is a small grocery section with a few basics, a bit of dairy chips crackers, snacks, cookies, and house cleaning supplies. \n\nSome prices here are very reasonable if not the lowest, other items are on the high end.
