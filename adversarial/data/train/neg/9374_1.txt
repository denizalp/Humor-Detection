This review is for the buffet.  We stayed at a different hotel (but we have stayed here before, and had no problems, it's a clean and comfy hotel).  The food here is WAY more expensive than the other buffets in Vegas, and a real pleasant surprise regarding the food.  Both my children are vegetarians, and there was plenty for them to eat.  Lots of great breakfast options for everyone as well.  The one and only thing I'd like to see change is that some of the food items need to be kept hotter.  But seriously, that's it.  The service is friendly, coffee is diner-coffee good and hot, orange juice is good, food was great for an amazing price.  We tried the Circus-Circus buffet one day and had such a bad and over-priced experience, we asked our friends who lived locally what they recommended & it was Palace Station, which we had known of bc we had stayed there years before.  Thanks goodness for this place!
