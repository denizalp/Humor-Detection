I have always been a big fan of the Hudsons chain and I'm glad to see them in Calgary as well as Edmonton.\n\nThe Shawnessy location lives up to the reputation that Hudsons has established in my eyes. The food was delicious (we had a poutine and some mini-burgers) and the various drink choices are always interesting. It was a nice day so we fortunately had the experience of sitting out on the patio. Although it was a Stampede weekend, it was still quite busy and we still received great service. All of the staff were very nice.\n\nIf you like good traditional Canadian food (steaks, burgers, etc.) then head over to Hudsons and you won't be disappointed.
