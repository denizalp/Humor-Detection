As a previous reviewer said, it's \"a diamond in the rough.\" Ignore the \"gentleman's club\" and adult vido shop next door and walk in for a Thai feast. \n\nWe had fantastic coconut soup (nicely spicy), good pad thai, lovely basil eggplant (lots of basil flavour). The cashew stir fry, on the other hand, was mediocre--boring and too saucy. \n\nThe room was a little dark, but our server, Lynn, was warm and hospitable. \n\nThe prices are reasonable and the servings are generous, so you may have to roll happily home.\n\n(Note that although the food tasted authentically Thai enough to my taste, the entire restaurant staff is actually Chinese)
