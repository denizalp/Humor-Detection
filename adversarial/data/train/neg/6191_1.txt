Ordered for pickup. Was told 30 minutes. Showed up in 20 minutes and paid. I sat for 30 minutes waiting. Customer who came in after me was called an got her pizza. I asked if mine was done and they were sitting in the back. I was asked if I paid and then told it was marked as pick up. No apology given. Pizza wasn't hot by the time I got home. The taco pizza and wings were good. Customer service could use some work.
