Very quick service, manchurian fried rice is amazing, and the general tsao, alsottried rhe crispy fried shrimp again very good and huge portions. Didn't really like the chili chicken as it was kind of bland ir the mango chicken as you couldnt taste any mango. But the biggest winner is their wings the best ive had n markham
