I first found this place because I visited Heartwood Coffee next door (also an awesome place). I was immediately hooked when the kind ladies running this place had gluten free muffins for sale! I have to eat gluten and dairy free and they have lots of delicious, creative, healthy options for me. I got the rice bowl and arugula salad and brought them home to share with my sister (awesome portion sizes also). She also enjoyed these meals and we are looking forward to our next visit. :)
