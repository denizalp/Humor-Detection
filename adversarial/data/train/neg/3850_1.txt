We reserved for a group of 24 people 4 days ahead. \nWe got a private room which was great for conversation and the servers were nice. BUT, food took forever to come out!!! Ordered almost 30 mins later then appetizers came out 30-1hr after that and some people didnt get their food until 1.5 hr after they ordered. \nFood was good. Nothing spectacular, but would come here if food came out at a reasonable time.\nPizza, spinach pasta that were like ravioli but shaped like dumplings, soups. Most people liked their food.
