Had a great date night with my husband. The macadamia nut halibut was wonderful. Server was great and gave us plenty of personal space. We told him we were not in any hurry and he respected that. My only concern was the abrupt \/rude hostess when I called to make the reservation. Not friendly or welcoming at all. But on a good note the bartender and waiter made up for the lack of the hostess. Food was wonderful!
