It was last Saturday night.  Beautiful weather, everybody was outside enjoy warm night, all the restaurants on Duluth and St. Denis were packed with people..  \n\nI read this review and wanted to check it.  There were only 6 people inside and outside total.  My husband was skeptical, he asked me several times \" Do you really want to try this restaurant?  Other restaurants are full with people except this one! \"  But I wanted to try!  Since the review was five stars.\n\nI found out that this restaurant food are excellent but super expensive.  I think the first reviewer is a rich person or because she was visiting Montreal, she has more budget than person like me who live in Montreal..\n\n2 small scallops with little teaspoonful of sauce is $8 - Before tax and tips.  In Quebec, you have to think the price before and after since the tax is 12.5% and tips - I am a 20% tipper so it adds up a lot.  \n\nAll things we ordered - scallops, lamb, salted cod, and phyllo -  all came in 2 pieces.  Very small pieces.  I didn't use my knife.  \nAfter 2 glasses of wine and 4 tapas, it was $62 and my husband pay $10 tips - less than usual.  So oh well I don't think I need to go back but if you have money to burn and need to have fancy plates and new fork and knife after every 2 bites.  You should try this place.
