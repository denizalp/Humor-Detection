Good buffet at a great price! I decided to try the MGM Buffet for lunch.  Definitely glad I did.  Great selection of lunch items spread across several stations! They put out small portions and changed out the trays frequently so that there wasn't a huge pile of food that had been sitting out all day.  Food tastes good and they have an All-You-Can-Drink add-on that is easy to take advantage of... Worth trying while in the MGM!
