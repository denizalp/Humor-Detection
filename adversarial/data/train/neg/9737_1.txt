I went here with high expectations as everyone I know praises the Winking Lizard. And they were right! First of all, I want to steal the iguana. That said, the food was delicious! I got my usual spinach and artichoke dip, and it was some of the best spinach and artichoke dip I've ever had. Prices were fair, and the decor was really cool! My only complaint is that because I was with my sister and her friend, who were minors, my non minor friend and I were not allowed to drink. I have never heard of any other restaurant having that policy. Overall a pleasant experience, and I will be back!
