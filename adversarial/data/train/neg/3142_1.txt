I came here with a friend who recommended this place for shabu shabu. The restaurant itself is quite small, but looks very sleek.\n\nThe servers were Japanese and this is clearly an authentic Japanese restaurant. The menu was not too big, but the service was very polite and attentive (i.e. Japanese).\n\nThe food was tasty and very light\/refreshing. The sauces and quality of the food was excellent, and you can get free refills of vegetables. Price is a bit on the higher end, but most Japanese restaurants are not cheap.\n\nI highly recommend if you are in the mood for authentic shabu shabu!
