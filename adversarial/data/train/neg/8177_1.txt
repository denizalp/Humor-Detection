I first came here three years ago when I needed an emergency root canal on a weekend, granted this place isn't \"pretty\" and you definitely don't feel like you're at the spa. It could use a woman's touch. Although each exam area has a little flat screen tv which is nice. \n\nI came back this week to get six fillings. They agreed to do them all at once since who knows when I'd make an appointment for another visit. \n\nFirst off they showed me exactly what I would have to pay when it was all done, there were no surprises or debating after the fact. They were a little late getting started but when it was all done it was a half hour after close and at no point did they make me feel like they had somewhere else to be. I even asked him if he would file down part of another tooth and he did it with no problem, no hesitation about how late we were there. Even the lady at the front desk was polite when we finished so late. \n\nThe dental assistant was great, she kept patting my shoulder while he was giving me novacaine which was surprisingly calming. They laughed and joked with me through the prodedure. \n\n\nIdeally I won't need any dental work for a while but I'll certainly come back here!
