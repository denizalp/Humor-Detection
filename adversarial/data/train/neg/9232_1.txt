This place never disappoints me. Gave my daughter who's 9 my old i4, but she wanted to change the glass from black to white. They took out all the different glass colors for her to look at in case she wanted a different color. Also had both my i5's screen protectors changed to anti-glare ones.  Customer service is excellent. Definitely recommend.
