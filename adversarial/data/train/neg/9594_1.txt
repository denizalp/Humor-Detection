I really love this place. I almost always get one of the small chocolate babkas although I've had the cheese ones as well and they too are delish and a lot less rich but still just as tasty. I think it is a fun place to visit when you are in the Mile End and to take visitors to... all my friends\/fam that I've brought here have really enjoyed it!
