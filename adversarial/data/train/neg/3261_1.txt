It's so nice to stroll around this old pecan farm. You really feel like you're in the rural country side. I love the garden, the towering trees, the shade. It's lovely. \nBest chocolate cake I've ever had is from here. And amazing soup and sandwiches. A little more on the pricier side, but worth it. \nI've been a couple times and have never had a bad experience with service. It's too bad they shut down in the summer. I understand during the day, but in the evening this place would be delightful to have dinner.
