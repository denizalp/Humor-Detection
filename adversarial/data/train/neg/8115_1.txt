You have to try the Border Brunch- $35 per person and you get to try every.single.smallplate. Such a fun experience but go hungry... you will need a poolside chair and nap when it's over!!! The waffle w Serrano ham was to die for. Corn tamale, esquite lettuce wraps, biscuit and chorizo gravy and the egg sandwich w tomato jam were by far my favorites!!! Oh and the tequila Bloody Mary was just perfect.
