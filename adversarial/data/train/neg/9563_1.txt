Food was terrible ! Service was worse . No wonder the restaurant was empty . It took 45 minutes to get our food .. Yet there were only 3 other tables being serviced. My steak was rare and well done all at the same time ?!? If that wasn't bad enough my side order of parmesan rice was nothing more than a thinly disguised scoop of rice a roni . We still have $15 left on a gift card that I'm more than happy to give away to anyone who wants it .
