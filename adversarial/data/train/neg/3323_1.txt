Casa Reynoso's food is by far the best Mexican food here and I've lived in AZ for the past 35 years. HOWEVER, the service at this particular location is not so great and the restaurant doesn't seem too clean, which is why I gave it a 3. Now, if you visit the main location on Mill\/Southern, service is consistently fantastic! GREAT chile relleno (so my husband says - best he's ever had and he's Mexican) and I LOVE their Tamales.
