I stopped for breakfast because it was next to my hotel when I was in Scottsdale for work.  I got a good vibe as soon as I walked in.  It was homey, but modern, clean and fresh looking.  I ordered from the healthy section of the menu - a brie and green apple omelet!  I also ordered an almond coffee - unfortunately they were out of the almond, so I got a caramel macchiato.  The omelet came with a fruit shish kabob on the side.  The omelet was fluffy and big and yummy - I thought the brie would be worked into , but it was a big slab of it on the top!!  Perfect - better for the tasting!  A couple of mistakes by the staff - I ordered coffee in a to go cup, and it came in a ceramic cup, then they brought a hot to go cup, I finally asked for a cold cup with a straw, and the waiter said sorry - he couldn't find the right cup before!  They weren't even that busy!  But overall a very enjoyable experience. I also had enough food to have breakfast for the next day!
