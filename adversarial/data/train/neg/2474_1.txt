I walked into this cute store recently and I must say there are a lot of interesting antique finds! The owner was very friendly and greeted me promptly. Not something you see often nowadays. I've been browsing for some decor for my home and immediately fell in love with a bench that was in the store. \n\nIf I had anymore money I would've bought more!!! Haha, the owner did mention she recently opened month ago and is always bringing in new products. \n\nI definitely recommend coming and checking this place out! You never know what you'll find there.
