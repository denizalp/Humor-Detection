Love this cozy little spot. There is a nice outdoor area to eat complete with picnic tables -people bring their dogs and play on the grass. Not much shade so plan wisely with the weather. The sandwiches are all good. We have had the pulled pork- one of my favorites-and the pecan chicken sandwich. The salads are delicious as well. Nice assortment of desserts, but the pies are more crusty then they should be, but pies really aren't my thing.  No one rushes you to leave- a perfect picnic environment. It is a little pricier then other sandwich places as lunch for 5 of us was $75, but you are paying for the surroundings.
