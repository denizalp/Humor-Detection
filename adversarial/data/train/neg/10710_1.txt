I struggled writing this review. While, the food was delicious (my husband and I got the tequila burger) the service was abismal. \n\nIt took forever to get our drinks and all we asked for was water. Once our order was placed we again waited for an extraordinary length of time. While we finished our food not once did our waitress come back and check on us or offer to refill our drinks. One of the waitresses was more interested in taking snaps by the bar then serving her customers in the not overly crowded restaurant. \n\nIf you're looking for a place to kill a long layover this place will definitely fulfill your needs as you will be here for over 2 hours. If however you're looking to make a tight connection your better off hitting up another joint.
