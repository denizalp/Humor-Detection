Overpriced so-so burgers, no gourmet in sight...\nWe ordered the double cheeseburgers with rings. The rings were bland and looked like they had been in the fryer for an hour.\nThe patties were obviously pre-cooked and quite bland. Buns here are normal Kaisers, which is a good choice, but with bill of $18 I expect something..... GOURMET! Say a Brioche or at least an Ace Bakery bun?\n\nService and topping choices were plentiful, but toppings are rationed so much I could barely count the toppings I had ordered, a sliver of Jalepeno, a teaspoon of caramelized onions, again for $18 where is the love.\n\nYou can find a better burger at many restaurants in the area for $12 add a beer and you're much more satisfied for you $18. Will not be back, if you're stuck in the area, there are much better choices around under a kilometer away.
