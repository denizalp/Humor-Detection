I was charged 600.oo for serveilance cam installation. Let me state that was a nightmare. They came to install and put holes all thru my walls and would not set up the cams on the top of the home along the roof line. They stated they could only go so far and did not have ladders high enough to go higher. Mind you I had a two story home with black wires going across the middle of the house. Tacky! Where someone could reach and pull down the cams and wires. I would not recommend that you use this so called service to set up cams on your two story homes. Just a warning to prevent you a bunch of needless holes in your house. I called and spoke with the managers who took days to give me a refund of my money and asked they repair the holes in the walls which they declined to do. I guess I will have to take them to court and let a judge decide if this was worth the six hundred they tried to charge. This was a waste of time and I just wanted to warn everyone that if you don't set up cams correctly. Don't attempt it with them. Hire a professional service to do it.
