*BIG* Servings!!! If you are hungry and want a YUMMY breakfast COME here! \n\nThe Banana nut muffin is so delicious! This is technically your \"free\" appetizer. This is not the place for someone who is trying to keep it light - NO WAY! This is definitely for the hungry and the brave!! \n\nI had a half serving of French toast and a half serving of the omelet with toast and hashbrowns! MY GOODNESS! Wayyyyy too much food!\nHubby had the parfait and he said it was too sweet, so, I would not suggest that. All items seem to be over the top.. Super buttery toast, which was nice.. Good meal, definitely will come again and order a half of one thing only! :)
