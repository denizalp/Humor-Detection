Yes it is pricey, but it is really good too.  My favorite now is the Thaid Up Chicken.  I only eat their food when I'm trying to spoil myself with a special treat.  I've been to their Taco and Dilla Parlor and have had their tongue and asada taco, which were both really good.  \n\nTheir flavors are as expected of the menu item.  Always smells yummy and tastes delicious.  Try them out at their food truck or their take out restaurant.
