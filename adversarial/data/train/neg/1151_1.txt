Love this place.  Went to visit my mother-in-law and she said she wanted to eat something so we went to lunch.  This place is right around the corner for her job - so lucky - and so we decided to try it.  The service is great, the food is fabulous, and the atmosphere is even better.  I haven't made it back in a while but I love this place.  The black beans are wonderful - you can eat them all on their own. True Cuban food.  I am Puerto Rican and Cuban and really missed the food - until now.  \n\nFeel lucky we stumbled upon it - can't wait to go back!
