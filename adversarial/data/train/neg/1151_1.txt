I am glad that others have had good experiences at this store. I have only been through the drive trough at this location. Among other issues, an employee dropped my food and napkins in the floor at the drive threw window and then tried to severe it to me while I was watching. disgusting!!!! The next time I went the ladies attitude made me just decide not to spend my money there.
