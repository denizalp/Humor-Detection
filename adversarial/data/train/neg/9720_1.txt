Good food, clean, and nice staff. We ordered orange chicken and chicken fun noodles. They were both very good. We had drinks, 2 lunch specials, order of chicken fun noodles and the  bill was less than 30.00. We walked out with full bellies and tons of leftovers. I would recommend it because of taste and value.
