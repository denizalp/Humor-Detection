After positive experiences in East Coast Swing jump-in classes in November, my partner and I decided to buy a 5-class card. This turned out to be a bad idea and we ended up going home after demanding a refund tonight.\n\nClass schedules are not created and posted on time. I emailed and called the studio a week ago and Melissa advised that we should be fine to jump-in to tonight's class, but since it's the 4th week, we should be aware that the dance will change the following week.\n\nUpon arriving tonight, we were advised that Lauren (instructor) \"prefers\" that we \"do not come to this week's class because they will be taking pictures\" and we wouldn't be up to speed on the steps....\n\nWhat is the point of a \"jump-in\" class that you can't jump into??\n\nThey offered a private lesson at 8pm in lieu of attending the 7pm group class, but we travel to the studio and this did not work with our schedule. Honestly, the disorganization, poor staff communication, and their handling of tonight's situation have turned my impression of this studio sour.
