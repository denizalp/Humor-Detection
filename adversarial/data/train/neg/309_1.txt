The food was good and the service was great.  The only thing that I didn't love was my fish had a lot of bones that were not removed.  It was very obvious that they were there and the cook was careless.\n\nAlso, I think we were seated close to the back area where employees can take their smoke breaks, it smelled very strongly of smoke.  It was only an issue for me because I'm sensitive to cigarette smoke.
