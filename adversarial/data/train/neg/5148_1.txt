I've passed by Sweet Dough many times but never stopped until recently.  They have a large assortment of donuts and other items listed.  I had a glazed donut which would have been great if it was not so cold.  I ate it outside on the patio so that it could warm up.  The taste was good and just what I expected from a yeast donut.  \n\nThe second thing I disliked about the donut is that it was placed in the bag without being wrapped in deli wrapped paper or something similar.  Now that I know what to expect, I may visit Sweet Dough in the future.
