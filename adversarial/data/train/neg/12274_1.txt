Something must have happened with this company recently... it came highly recommended and has many good reviews. \nMy son-in-law had the MOVE FROM HELL! He was quoted a 7 hour move that took almost 17 hours. The movers did not appear to know what they were doing. One example was trying to fit a couch through a door 3 times before they figured out that turning it around would make it go through.\n\nMy daughter and son in law had to leave for work, so I stayed until they finished. \n\nNumerous things were damaged. Moving pads were used only to protect the banisters, but not any of the furniture, therefore the damage. Too much to list in the review. His bed was assembled inaccurately. They took it apart so the bed company has to come to correct it.\n\nDoors and railings were left off. There is miscellaneous hardware laying around. What does it belong to???\n\nI could go on and on!\n\nIt seemed as if one of the movers may have been high after the drive that took them 2 hours to get from point A to point B. Everyone else traveling back and forth made the trip in an hour or less.\n\nOwner of the company was not cooperative or helpful. Things got a little better when litigation was mentioned.\n\nA totally frustrating experience. We hire movers to avoid nightmares like this.
