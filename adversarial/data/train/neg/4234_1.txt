My original review of this place is below, which I wrote while I was sitting in the bakery. I had given it 4 stars and some really nice comments, but felt I should update it after the rest of my experience here. I've truly never had such an upsetting experience at any business in my life.\n\nIn the review I had said the worker was \"seemingly\" condescending, implying that her attitude might not have been intentional and trying to give her the benefit of the doubt while she was rolling her eyes at me while I decided between the desserts. \n\nShe had read my review while I was in the bakery (which is fine although she pointed out how \"obvious\" it was that I was writing it as if I was trying to hide it). She brought my coffee to me and said \"Here you go, Jasmine\" making a point that she had seen my review, as I hadn't told her my name and didn't use a card to pay. She went back to the counter and got on her phone.\n\nAbout ten minutes later, two of her friends came in, went to the counter and began quoting my review out loud while saying things like \"how dumb is this person, it's actually hilarious\"\n\nThe girl working said \"like I actually want to show them this review we literally do not care what people say on Yelp like I should frame that and hang it up here.\" Which is interesting because I'm pretty sure reviews are for other possible guests, not to hurt some 20 year old worker's feelings...\n\nThey continued to talk about about me loud and clear enough so I could hear them from the other side of the room saying: \n\n\"We came down here as fast as we could when we saw this. I read it on the way down it actually made me laugh.\"\n\n\"Is that her right there?? Ohh my...\"\n\n\"I could tell she was writing it like its so obvious when people are doing it.\"\n\nAfter 15 minutes of this, I went up to the girl and said \"Okay, as you clearly want since you've been standing up here intentionally talking about me, I'm leaving. Just so you understand, that review was not written as a personal jab at you, it was written to help other customers and the business which is why I gave it 4 stars. I intentionally didn't use a description of you or gender because I didn't want to pinpoint a certain person.\" \n\nAs I said this, the three of them were mimicking my body language and chuckling to themselves...it was like watching 7th graders interact on a playground. As I walked out the door the girl yelled \"it's okay guys, some people are just miserable.\" \n\nSo I guess by giving a business 4 stars and an honest review, I'm a miserable person (which by this point yeah I probably was). I also thought it was interesting that she was \"figuring out\" I was the one that wrote the review...if I was trying to hide who I was, I probably wouldn't have gone around taking pictures and wrote the review while I was sitting there.. \n\nI work in a restaurant myself, I do my best to be an understanding and friendly customer, I know how it feels when a customer upsets you. I just can't believe anyone would think its okay to treat any person like this, let alone when they're representing a business. I had sent texts out to my friends and family telling them to try this place at first, but naturally I've taken that back. Enjoy reading this review you don't care about, darling! \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\n \"Nice atmosphere, decent espresso drinks, DELICIOUS desserts! \n\nCozy, relaxed, Victorian style atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. Seems to usually be about 6 deserts at a time, with vegan options as well! I had a slice of salted caramel chocolate cake that was so big and rich I had to take some home! Limited espresso menu--no flavors or milk options, but my cappuccino was made well. \n\nMy only complaint was the person working at the time wasn't the most friendly person in the world--not sure if they were the owner or just a worker, but they definitely didn't seem happy to have a new customer as they were short and seemingly condescending. Kind of a turnoff, but the place is so nice in itself I will most likely return!\"
