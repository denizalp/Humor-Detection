The place looks as though it does well.  Tons of diversity in the crowd.  The food was mediocre, the place was loud and cramped.  I will definitely be returning to try their pizza and roof-top.  Nothing special about the meatballs though.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night.  \nDeep fried pickles were runny a little too greasy.
