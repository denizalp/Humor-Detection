This seemed like an appealing concept - who doesn't like a fancy hot dog with cool things on it? I've had some delicious ones in Minneapolis and a few winners elsewhere, too. Not so much these, though. \n\nPart of the problem was the roll - huge, mushy, and sweet when it should have been lower in profile and more neutral flavored. The topping options seemed odd, and none of them made much kind of use that I could see of the great texture\/flavor contrasts a good hot dog provides. They were also remarkably expensive for how not-great they were - any street cart in Toronto would sell you the same dog on the same bun for half the price, and you could doctor it yourself (not with short ribs, true, but still). It was hard to have paid $9 for a mediocre hot dog with cheese and think about how many hot dogs I could have bought at Costco, without cheese, for the same money. Poutine, same problem - overpriced and undistinguished. \n\nThe surprise winner of the visit was the mini doughnuts. $6.50 gets you a dozen mini Nutella doughnuts with biscotti crumbs, and those are the most expensive - the cinnamon sugar ones are $4.50 and also look very nice. The doughnuts tipped this from two stars to three, but if we'd just got doughnuts and nothing else I would have been happier.
