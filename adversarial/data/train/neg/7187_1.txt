Came here based on Yelp rating but was sorely disappointed. \n\nOrdered Turkey sandwich and received it promptly. In fact it had been pre made, but seemed fresh.  It had a couple of thin toppings of their specialty condiments (avocado and something else) but it was very dry.  I asked for some mustard and was offered a mustard dressing for 80 cents.  I asked if they just had some plain mustard and, after checking with the kitchen, was told no. \n\nA sandwich shop without mustard?\n\nThe sandwich would have been perfect for $5 or even $8 on the high end, but I paid nearly $10 for a basic sandwich and a glass of ice water with no table service. \n\nWanting to give them one more chance and still hungry, I decided to try their Peanut Butter cookie sandwich (2 cookies filled with a cream frosting).  Once again, the taste was okay (although slightly burned and overlooked), but the cost was nearly $3. \n\nI probably won't be going back soon.
