Good food, large portions, swift friendly service and reasonable prices. The real stand out was the soup, it's excellent, we all complemented on it and the perfect temp didn't go unnoticed.   \nThe place was quite full, understandably, so we opted to be seated in the bar rather than wait. Our mistake, good meal in a noisy chaotic environment, bit of a shame, took some of the enjoyment out of it. Fortunately the food is as good as it is and made it worth while. \nWould definitely return given the chance.
