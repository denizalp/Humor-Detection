Let me start with this year has been frustrating for me in the prescription drug world.  I changed insurance providers and didn't realize my one monthly RX was only partially covered by my provider. I went from paying 10 a month to $75 a month. I called in today to get my RX refilled and talked to Pharmacist Ryan. Ryan asked if my insurance changed because my RX was no longer covered and would be $176 for 1 month. I have never cried over an RX before, that changed today. I told him to fill it anyway. He called me back 10 mins later and let me know how upset he was that it was going to cost so much, so he did a little digging and found that my insurance now covers the name brand RX FOR FREE. He just saved me $176 dollars a month for the next 6 months. He went above and beyond and I feel very confident using CVS for all my pharmacy needs because I know their employees put their customers first.
