Really enjoyed the authenticity of the tapas here.  While the menu is on the small side, it leaves nothing to be desired.  The cheese platter, figs, and potatos were amazing.  The lamb meatballs were weird.  My huabsnd loved the chorizo.  The sangria was great.  My biggest complaint is that they were out of three things we wanted to order that night.  Our server also disappeared for about 30 minutes once we were finished with our meal.  Beware too that they have a DJ there during dinner and it gets pretty loud.
