I was extremely surprised by this store! I had just moved from out of state and was looking to replace some of my wardrobe that I had to leave behind. When I walked up, they had this truly awful window display of really old styles in sickening pastels and gaudy beaded purses. But, I hate paying full price for things so I went in anyway. It is a small store, but they have a lot of really nice things in there. And the prices are fantastic! The only expensive things are kept on the designer racks or displayed separately because they have tags on them showing their worth. Everything else is priced at $8-12 for most of the tops and $10-$15 for the dresses. In general, that is. And they have a nice mix of current styles and some slightly more vintage-y looks. Plus, they have a front room that is a always a sale room. I found a couple great tops in there for $2. \n\nI haven't tried selling anything to them because I sold off most of my excess stuff before I moved, so I can't speak for that side of the business.
