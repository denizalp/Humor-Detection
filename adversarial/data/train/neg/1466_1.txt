Canteen is like ever other Food Fight Restaurant-it's never terrible but it is also not a place to have an amazing meal.  Definitely some hit or misses.  For the hits, the #1 are the Duritos-puffed wheat wagon wheels with chili and lime seasoning.  The first bag is free and subsequent ones are $1.  They are completely addicting and pair well with a beer.  The street corn is also a favorite of mine.  What is there not to like when you pair corn, chili lime aioil, butter, and cotija cheese?  Although the other tacos are less memorable, the Fried Cauliflower taco is one I would eat again.  The cauliflower was battered and perfectly fried with a guajillo cream suace and topped with a radish and red onion slaw.  For the misses, I would throw the rest of the tacos into the mix.  They are not terrible but just meh.  The carnitas were rather mushy while the farmers cheese taco was a congealed block of regret topped with some toppings.  Wait staff are fast and friendly.  On it's own, I would consider stopping back but with Bel Air a block away, I know where I will be going for my taco fix!
