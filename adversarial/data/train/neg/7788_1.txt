The food is always hot, fresh and delicious - no doubt about it! The staff are also friendly and very efficient. Sometimes it can get pretty busy around the lunch hour (12:00-12:30) and they still manage to make the food so efficiently. All in all the food is delicious, it can be a little pricey BUT still worth it for the quality of the food you get.
