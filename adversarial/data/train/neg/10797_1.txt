The cool thing about this strip club is locals plus a guest don't have to pay a cover to get in. Beyond that I am not the right person to review strip clubs as its not my thing. I never go to Walmart and pay them to look at groceries so I really don't understand how people find this a fun activity at a strip club. \n\nClean decent girls if you like strip clubs this one seems ok.
