Two walls of windows allow sunlight to pour in this coffee shop.  Lots of tables with mismatched chairs add to the casual, funky charm.  We never had a problem getting a seat on any of the weekend afternoons we visited, which was nice.  The tables are glass-topped, protecting found \"treasures\" that make for interesting things to look at (peoples' doodles, ticket stubs, postcards, etc.).  The service was just fine, one time the barista was super friendly, another time not overly so... but all in all it was satisfactory.  And they had a nice tea selection, loose leaf, so you know I appreciated that!  They have a small, private, free, parking lot adjacent to the building, otherwise there is street parking that is non-metered and non-permitted on nearby side streets.   Not a bad spot at all to spend an afternoon.
