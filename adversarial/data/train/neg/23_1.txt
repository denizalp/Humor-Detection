Pre-ordered lunch for 10 people and went to pick up the food. The order was very messed up. I had to go over each dish with them to make sure all the dishes were there. One whole platter was missing but they made it quickly. Note to anyone who orders by phone - get them to repeat and double check any big orders. But the food was wonderful! Authentic and flavourful and great portions. I ordered the chicken enchiladas in mole sauce and was very happy. Everyone else enjoyed what they ordered. Would definitely eat here again. One other thing to note: the place is tiny so I would only suggest dining in if you're one or two people.
