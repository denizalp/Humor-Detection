Ironically, I'm sitting in Hot Taco right now. My boyfriend and I came to get $6 margaritas (a Thursday special) on a whim. Truthfully, the experience was awful. We waited 15 minutes before the hostess even returned to the stand to talk to us, then another 45 minutes for a table. We then waited 10 more minutes for our waitress, who didn't return to check on us for another 20 minutes. We ended up getting 2 drinks and ordering a check. The $6 margaritas were not worth the wait (overly sweet and generic), especially given it wasn't packed. I won't be returning.
