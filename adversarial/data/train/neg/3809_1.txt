I came in to the shop today to downsize my recent tongue piercing that I had performed by Frank. I got a super pretty 5mm prong set pink opal. He first switched the length of the barbell to something shorter (sorry! I forgot the length) but it still felt a little too long. He said, \"No worries, we'll switch it out if you still feel it's too long\". So then he switched it out with a 1\/2 inch barbell. Which was THE perfect fit. \nI feel like he is always so patient and nice. He wants to make sure that i'm happy with what i have before i walk out of the door. \nI will gladly continue to tell all my friends how amazing the people are here and how great the quality of their jewelry is.\nThank you AGAIN for another stellar experience Frank!
