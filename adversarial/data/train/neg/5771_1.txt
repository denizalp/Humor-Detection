This was our first time trying The Yolk Cafe and it was amazing! We normally like to eat at Toast in tega cay, but this is ranking at the top of my list now! I had egg Benedict and my husband had the veggie omelet, both were delicious! The TN fries are a must as well! Our kids had the chip and dale kids meal. Let's just say their plates were empty at the end! Definitely going back!
