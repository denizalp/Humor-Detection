The food is delicious!  I can never even finish my entree, it's a good portion and very yummy.\n\nA tad expensive for what you're getting, but compared to Hernando's Hideaway up the street, this is a much better option by far.  \n\nCould use a bit more drink selection but the margarita was quite good!
