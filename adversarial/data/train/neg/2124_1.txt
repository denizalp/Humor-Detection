We visit Iruka almost on a weekly basis. Between the two of us, we get the love boat a lot and it never dissapoints. The corn tea is a must have and the Miso soup is the honestly one of if not the best in the city. This place is super intimate with friendly staff and extremely fresh food all the time. \n\nThe candies at the end of the meal are incredible and end the meal on a sweet note. \n\nHappy eating folks!
