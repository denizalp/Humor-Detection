Ordered pizza for a 5:15 pick up. My husband gets there to pick it up and the delivery driver took the wrong order, so they remake it. He gets it 15 mins later, no harm, no foul. We got home and the pizza is so greasy and disgusting that it is pretty much just falling apart and my kids won't even eat it. Trust me, that's saying a lot of how gross it was when my kids won't eat a cheese pizza. Called and talked to the manager Kenny and asked if we could have it delivered since they messed up twice. He said there's no way they could do that, it's for carry out only. I asked then if we could get another pizza for free since they messed up our order twice and my husband now has to drive all the way over there AGAIN due to their mistake. He said no, and offered us cheese sticks. I said we already ordered cheese sticks and we don't need anymore but an extra pizza would be nice. He offered me Wings and we don't eat wings, so I said a plain cheese pizza is about the same price so why cant we get something like that that we can actually eat because it's an hour of waiting now to eat some food due to their mess ups. All he would offer is to remake it. So my husband's going to pick it up now, but I'm hesitant to eat it because who knows what they've done to it now that I pissed them off, and the quality was so poor to begin with. I have ordered here many times, but I won't be back. Ridiculous that they can't offer a better customer service. Especially when I order there frequently. I can see from past reviews that this is a common occurrence.
