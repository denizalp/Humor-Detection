They do a good job. My problem was mostly that they are not very open minded. Yesterday was my first visit. They offer a free first service for new comers, and give the choice between underarms ($18), Bikini line ($32), and eyebrow ($18). Since I wanted to to UA and BK anyway, and given the higher normal price of the bikini line, I chose the bikini line as my first-client free service. Then I asked my caregiver if I could do the full bikini (priced at $47) instead but still keep the bikini line as my free service, hence just paying the difference between the two ($15). She insisted that this was not possible because the \"rule\" was that only the bikini line is free. I explained to her that I would pay for the difference, so the result would be the same. She kept saying no, and seemed annoyed. When she did the bikini line, she was very careful to NOT do too much, to make sure I would find myself asking for the full bikini (a little bit further than the bikini line) instead. In the end, the bikini \"line\" was still showing everything (compared to my experience at other salons) so I just asked her to do the full bikini, and I paid the full price of $47! When I left they directly told me that my next appointment would be one month from today. I just said yes, to make sure they would not try to sell me more.
