Best Buffet I had in my 5 years in the US. They make traditional south-Indian food, very tasty, spicy and flavorful. Must try if you like spicy food and if you are in Charlotte. Recently they opened up in Columbus, Ohio so seems like they are spreading. Only con is, while we visited Godavari on a Saturday afternoon for buffet and it was crowded, and the manager\/owner couldn't keep up with the billing and it was a wait for 15 mins just to play the bill. Other than that the food is awesome !!
