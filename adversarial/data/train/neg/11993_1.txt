A friend booked this restaurant as a surprise birthday party for her bf, but even though reservations were set the tables were not ready until the very last minute, and we were all worried that the birthday guy would show up and everybody would still be scattered in the bar area.  Luckily we all finally got seated by the time he came.\n\nThe food at this restaurant was really good though and their portions were huge.  I had the ribs and they were nice and smokey and their fries were fried in animal fat, but was nowhere near the level of awesomeness that the Beer Bistro fries were at.  One of the guests had an overdone steak too, but it was replaced after the waiter inspected it.\n\nAlthough I said I liked the food I would say that it is comparable to The Keg, nothing more, and pricier than The Keg.  I just expect more when the restaurant is a bit pricier.  I also found it weird that their menu had a mismatch of items from curries to steaks.  I'm not sure what to think of that.\n\nI like that this place does not charge a cake cutting fee and was more than happy to serve the cupcakes that I brought for the party.  A 20% gratuity was added to our bills, but the waiter was happy to split the bills individually amongst all of us.  Overall, I'd say it was a good choice of restaurant for the birthday party but only because they serviced the group quite well and there are some decent bars in the area.
