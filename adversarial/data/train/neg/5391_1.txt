This place has one of THE BEST escape room experiences around! If you are up for a challenge - do Bloodthirst. It is incredible. The puzzles are difficult, the challenges intense, but the whole concept and set up are so good. We also did their Fortune Teller Room and Rogue Agent, these were great as well. Staff is helpful, rooms are brilliant. Not much more you can ask for!
