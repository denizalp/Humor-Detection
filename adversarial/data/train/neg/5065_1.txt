Mozell has been my hairdresser for several years now & I love her like a sister.\n\nUnlike a lot of hair stylists, she's very gentle on your hair. I am infamously \"tender headed\" but with Mozell, it's never been an issue. I almost forget she's even touching my hair when I'm there.\n\nAdditionally, she uses high quality products, and is a master colorist. \n\nHer pricing is reasonable & fair as well which cannot be overlooked here in the land of \"exorbitantly high priced Black hairstylists\". \n\nI also have to remark that she is extremely personable, charming, and fun to talk to- which definitely helps pass the time. \n\nAll these things combined make Mozell a local treasure! I can't imagine trusting my hair with anyone else.
