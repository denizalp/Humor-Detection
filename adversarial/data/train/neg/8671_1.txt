I wondered about this place since there are couple locations in Los Angeles. This place is casual by ordering your pizza at counter and pay for it and pick up pizza at counter. It's nice ambiance with nice staff and self serve soda (high tech). My meal was around $15 with salad, classic pizza, soda. They accept MLife card for points.
