Don't let the name fool you. Express doesn't indicate cheap fast food but it certainly means quick attentive service!  This unique Moroccan restaurant had amazing food and incredible service. The chef is the prime example of hospitality. They are very attentive! We had the lamb tajine and chicken kabobs. The best kabobs I've ever had at a restaurant. They even let Mako in to enjoy the meal with us!  This place certainly deserves its 5 star ratings.
