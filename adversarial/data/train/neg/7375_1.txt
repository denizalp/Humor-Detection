The first day I paid $50 before tip for a full set, and the thumb broke off THE SAME DAY I got them done. I called to ask if I can come back in to get it fixed since I have work all week and he told me they couldn't get me in for another 3 days. Straight ridiculous. Will never be back, didn't even go back to get them fixed by them. 2 more fell off in the next 3 days and I couldn't be more disappointed with my money spent.
