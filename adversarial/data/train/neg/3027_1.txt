Karma Juice and all of their juices are amazing! I tend to be an over-researcher and so I had looked into a lot of juicing companies in Phoenix\/Scottsdale and even some that delivered juices online. I wanted to try out a 5-day cleanse and finally was deciding between Karma Juice, Nekter and JubyTrue. In the end, I chose to go with Karma Juice. I was a little hesitant because I hadn't ever had any of their products before and Nekter and JubyTrue seem to be everywhere, but I am completely 100% glad that I did. \n\nInstead of just ordering your \"standard package\" they asked me what my goals of the cleanse were and if I had any preferences. They educated me about some of the different juices and the benefits of some of the ingredients, VERY knowledgeable. Everyone I spoke to knew their stuff and they weren't just people simply working a job, they are very passionate about their product and the benefits it provides!\n\nI expected to be hungry on the cleanse after reading lots of blogs online about juice cleanses, but my energy levels were perfectly balanced. The few times I started to get hungry it was just in perfect time to have my next juice. Every juice was amazing and the wide variety helped keep me focused and allowed me enough options to be excited to stick with the cleanse. It seems most cleanses give you the exact same juices every day, which for 5 days could get a little tedious. Even my girls (ages 2 and 4) loved the juices and were excited to try some whenever they saw me drinking them. It's been about 2 months since I did my cleanse and it helped reset my cravings for healthy food and helped me a lot with mental clarity and eliminating brain fog. I talked to the owner for a long time and it's also great to note that they are doing beautiful things giving back to our local community, truly karma is not just the name of their brand! I can't wait to do another cleanse again!
