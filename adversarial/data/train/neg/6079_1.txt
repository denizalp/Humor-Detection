Came in 01\/25\/2013 - for birthday dinner.  Service was on point, let us be loud and silly and were very accommodating of our group.\nFood - WAY overpriced for the quality of beef.  I don't mind paying $50 for a steak, but it better melt in your mouth.  I literally had to saw through the meat and chewing was a project too.\nAgain..the service was great, it was just the food that wasn't so hot.\nThe happy hour oysters were a great deal, were fresh and if we ever come back, that is all it would be for.  Go for happy hour oysters, skip the steak.
