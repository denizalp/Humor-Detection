Really cool concept and different from the norm. It wasn't anything we'd ever seen or tasted before so we decided to give it a try. Family and I thought it was tasty, and the staff very friendly. The location is out of our way and we just happened to be in that area but I'd make it a point to stop in again if I were to happen to be in that part of town again.
