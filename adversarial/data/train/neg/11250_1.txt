Came here for the breakfast sandwiches and we were not disappointed. I had the fried egg sandwich on the pretzel bun and the hubster had the fried egg sandwich with bacon on ciabatta roll.  OMG!  For a breakfast sandwich they are HUGE! We ended up splitting the pretzel bun sandwich and saved the ciabatta roll for the flight back to Sacramento (low cost airlines = little bags of peanuts and pretzels).  Bread on both sandwiches was excellent.  Nicely layered with fresh produce and choice of swiss or cheddar cheese - yum!!!  We also got a cashew scone and chocolate chip muffin for later which were also delightful.
