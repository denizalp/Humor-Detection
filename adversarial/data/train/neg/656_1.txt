Delicious fresh food. I always appreciate freshly made items that are healthy and this place has a lot. Nice patio, staff is friendly. I'm giving it 4\/5 stars due to the atmosphere at night. I have been here during the day and it is pleasant. At night the place turns into what I like to call \"The Scottsdale wannabe rich dude hang out,\" full of over plastic surgery individuals.. Not my cup of tea.
