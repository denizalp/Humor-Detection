New location - still the same yummy goodness. I really love their egg salad sandwich and my husband favors the Fairfax. This location still has the really long line like the downtown LA original. I thought 8 am on a Saturday would be dead in Vegas but I was way wrong.... usually 20-30min wait at least.
