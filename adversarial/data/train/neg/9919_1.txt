Best Italian outside of my mother's kitchen. Great waitstaff, courteous and kind. Colleen, one of the owners is not afraid to help the waitstaff and do the dirty work. She also talks to all the tables and makes sure you are happy. Great restaurant.\n\nThe only issue is that I noticed recently that they are getting skimpy on things. My twice baked penne had only one slice of cheese baked on top, usually it's covered. We had to ASK for bread to be given to our table and our salad came with NO CROUTONS! They have really good fresh croutons too... :(
