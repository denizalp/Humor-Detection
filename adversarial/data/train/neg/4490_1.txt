I got my tattoo by Joseph and holy hell Im so in love with it! He was booked months in advance but it was so worth the wait! He was quick and so professional, and the tattoo was very easy to sit through. \n\nTo set up the appointment I went through his wife, Michelle who was so sweet and very attentive to my requests. She constantly kept me up to date.\n\nThe whole process was easy and I can't wait to come back and get more ink by him.
