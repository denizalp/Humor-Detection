Found this place online after eating at SMOKE. So happy we decided to stop in. It was busy but not crazy. Easy to order and sit to wait for our espresso and cake. Ordered the Tumeric cake and some butterscotch pudding. Both excellent. Chill vibe. Great place to come for dessert or just a coffee. Staff friendly.
