Front office and the ladies that walked us in and greeted us in and out where GREAT. Took us outside to the patio and at a corner it was nice. They are usually great but tonight my server was very lacking, no soup delivered to me and my two guests, asked for water twice, Margarita and drinks came out way too late we were ignored as she practically served other tables but just ignored us, at one point one of my guests had to call another guy over to get us plates to get through the appetizer. We skipped ordering Entrees as the Waitress showed up 30 mins later. I gave her a 40% tip like I usually do but it is was for mainly the front of house and the greeters that took us in. Our waitress dropped the ball her big time.
