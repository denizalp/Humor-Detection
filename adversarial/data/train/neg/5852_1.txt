Having a late bite due to some meetings, refraining from eating anything heavy Keungs seemed to be the safe choice to eat at.\nI believe this may be the 'original' Keung's location at Peach Tree Plaza (Kennedy and Hwy 7).\n\nCraving some Chinese comfort food we ordered their seafood congee (big-bowl) served with shrimps, squid, scallops and salmon, 3.5\/5\nRather than ordering their fried dough, we opted for their Chili turnip cake, which I've had at other locations.  Slight crunch on the outside, soft inside, nonetheless  it was tasty about a 4\/5.\nOverall the service was 'OKAY' and their prices are really reasonable.  In terms of cleanliness, its about a 3.5\/5.
