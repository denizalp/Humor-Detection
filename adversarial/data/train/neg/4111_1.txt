Tremendous!  Go for the plain bagel, add lox, cream cheese, tomato, red onion, and capers.  It's perfection.\n\nThe atmosphere is the perfect compliment to the menu - its a casual, relaxed vibe.\n\nAs soon as I finish this mammoth bagel, I'll be heading back up to the deli case.  I haven't seen a selection like this outside of NYC or Philly.\n\nThe price?  Perhaps a tad high (my bagel described above and a fountain drink rang up at $13.48), but go anyway.  The lox jacked my cost up, simply because it's high quality and frankly, worth it.  Who else is doing anything this authentic outside of the \"three C's\"?\n\nGo.
