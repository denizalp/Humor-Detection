Mars Uptown is good for that late night bite\n\nAfter a night of clubbing, this is the place to go to\n\nBreakfast is always a hit \n\nFrench toast\nPancakes\nPeameal\n\nDefinitely the way to go\n\nIf not, a big juicy banquet burger is always a nice alternative\n\nAgain I would recommend this place for an after club\/after bar eat treat\n\nClassic diner food
