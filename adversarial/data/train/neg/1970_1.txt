I'm certainly no vegetarian but I've been twice in a couple of weeks and really like this place. It's good to eat a little differently. \n\nI've had the same thing both times essentially. My favorite is the Buffalo Cauliflower. It is breaded and fried and the first time I had it wasn't as heavy as the second time but both were very good and you'd swear you were eating boneless chicken wings! I mean it! \n\nBoth times I went I had the Thai Peanut Brussels Sprouts too and I really loved the Thai peanut sauce on these beautifully roasted Brussels. \n\nMy guests had the salad and added a black bean burger and the next time the pesto sandwich and both were very happy. Enjoyed sitting on the patio when it wasn't super sunny.
