I really cannot recommend this restaurant. For starters we went with a groupon that included entrees up to $24 each. We asked about the $29 filet and they said they could not include that. Fine, not a big deal. I wanted a $25 dish and they said they would oblige but it would be a $5 charge instead of $1. Whatever . . .\n\nSo we order drinks and my girlfriend's mojito arrives without sugar in it. It was disgusting. We ask the waiter to get a beer instead. When he takes it back to the bar the bartender says \"some people like them sweeter than others\".\n\nOur appetizer comes out, some deep fried risotto balls. Less than stellar but not horrible just very dry. Salads come out with a remarkable amount of cheese on them. Our dishes come out and I will say the duck was pretty good. The sirloin, ordered medium, came out charred and nearly well done. We didn't see our waiter for 10 minutes before we could say something. We ended up skipping on dessert and took another order of duck home to replace the sirloin.\n\nOur waiter was quite nice but not very attentive. This place just seems to not care about the details and expects to be viewed as a high class restaurant just because of the prices. I was not impressed and will not be returning!
