Overall the hotel is in great location and one block away from Aquarium, one block from Gretzky's, few walking blocks from Hockey hall of fame. The price for a two bedroom hotel is a little pricey at over $800. Great setup in the room but not clean at all. My kids feet were black after a shower and running around the room for a bit. There was blood in the shower, drinks still in the fridge from people before us, butter packet on the floor that was not from us. They should get their rugs shampooed every once in a while and work on cleaning. Breakfast buffet was ridiculously crowed which is easier taking it up to your room. Food I will say was a good choices and good. If they worked on cleaning, I would rate this higher than a 2-star.
