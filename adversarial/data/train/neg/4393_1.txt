One of the best seafood restaurants I've ever been to! We ordered oysters, which were great, scallops the best and the monk fish was good too. Creme brule was a little too sweet but still tasted good.  \nOur waiter, George, was amazing, and he was also great with our kids (2.5 & 4.5 yrs old)! \nI would highly recommend this place to friends and family! Great place!!
