I got to sample several gelatos. I love that they have variety, and that they are creative in coming up with some new flavors. There are so many choices, so it's easy to get lost in what to purchase. I settled on an awesome flavor that I really liked. My only mistake was purchasing it in BAMBINO size. It was like half a scoop and for kiddies. Hahahaha, I should have gotten the small scoop for adults. I will be back to try more! \n\nService was great: They are quite patient about sampling.
