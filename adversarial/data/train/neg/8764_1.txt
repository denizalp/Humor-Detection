I love Olive and Ivy. It is a tried and true staple, always the first place I bring an out of town visitor.  \n\nThe ambience inside is warm and charming, open and friendly, and classy.  I loove thier lighting it is just so inviting.  Tables are spaced nicely, the bar has great seating and not too packed in that area either.  You can order a meal at the bar without feeling like you're knocking elbows with the person next to you.\n\nThe outside of Olive and Ivy is my favorite though.  The social hour seating fills up QUICK - get there early.  There are comfy big chairs and couches right outside the waterfront.  It is my favorite sitting spot in all of scottsdale to eat drink and dine.\n\nFor food -- I've come here plenty, and here's my two cents. Skip the apps, share a salad with a friend, and enjoy an entree. I keep coming back to the veal ravioli, it is just heavenly and perfect.  There is arugula on top with a light cream sauce which isn't too heavy at all. I have to force myself to explore the menu because this dish is just so good.  Last time I was here I was trying to stick to my diet, I ordered the salmon and subbed spinach instead of thier regular side.  The dish was perfect, salmon was grilled to perfection, a real fresh piece of fish. It was generous too (more generous portion than the ravioli) - and I actually ended up taking some home. My mom ordered the Cioippino, which was flavorful, a generous portion, and very good also.  I also love their scallop entree.  I don't eat a ton of red meat, but I went with a friend one time who ordered the steak and pretty much devoured it.  \n\nAs for drinks -- thier sangria is amaze! Stick with the red one.\n\nHonestly I'm writing this right now, a warm February day in Arizona, and want to leave work to sit outside and eat my lunch in pure bliss at Olive and Ivy. I have a day off later this week and will make sure I stop by.  I simply cannot get enough of this place.
