Had a Groupon for this place that I used for lunch on the 2nd day of my 5 day stay at Harrah's. \n\nI'll just say that Purina must be their food supplier because it was dog food at best. \n\n- flavorless skirt steak at the carving station\n- mussels that looked like they were cooked 3 days ago\n- sloppy, uninspired, visually nauseating \"Asian\" and \"Mexican\" dishes\n- polish sausage looked good, but I was unable to chew more than once before spitting it back on my plate\n- oyster shooters (which I typically love) looked terrifying\n- I'm almost sure the Bloody Mary's in my \"all you care to drink\" add-on were virgin, and to give them any flavor at all you had to spice them up at the laziest Bloody Mary bar ever put together by human beings\n\nThe only bright spots were the salad which was a solid average salad bar (at least the lettuce was fresh) and the very above average dessert station. \n\nI had a desire to eat at the adjacent oyster bar and burger restaurant during my stay, but was put-off to all food at Harrah's as a result of this lunch. \n\nCaesars Entertainment should be ashamed of themselves for this display
