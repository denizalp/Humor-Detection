Great spot for burritos. The filling don't get weird, so it's safe to just ask for everything.\n\nNormal burritos are slow because they need to heat them thoroughly. \n\nInstead go for the 'naked burrito'. A meat \/ rice \/ vegetable plate. They're super quick and delicious.\n\nIf you're going as a group make sure that you don't get a mix of naked \/ normal burritos. The naked burrito eaters will be finished before the regular burrito eaters get their food.
