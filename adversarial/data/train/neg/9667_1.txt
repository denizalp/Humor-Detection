Fresh ingredients!  Very reasonably priced.  We had Kung Pao Beef, Chicken with Cashew and Cantonese Pan Fried Noodle.  Everything was very tasty.  As with any Chinese restaurant;  if you want more spicy with your dish, ask for hot chili sauce.  Staff was attentive and friendly.\nwww.taokitchen.wordpress.com
