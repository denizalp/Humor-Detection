Went on a Saturday around 7pm and the place was empty. Service was good and food wasn't bad but the prices are ridiculous!! A cup of vegetable soup for $7.95 is a little much. 2 drinks, 2 sandwiches and 1 cup of soup $48....like I said food was good but for soup and sandwiches at those prices, I think I'll go elsewhere.
