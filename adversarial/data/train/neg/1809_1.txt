Horrible.  Don't waste your money if you did not grow up in the era.  My husband and I like a couple of Beatles songs so we wanted to try something different.  We love the Mirage and thought it would be a good show to watch.  It was horrible.  We saw Mystere 4 times and it was awesome each time.  So my expectations were set high when I watched the show.  Not only did I not like the show they stopped the show due to a medical situation in the audience (that's understandable) but they would not comp us for the hour they stopped the show.  These tickets are not cheap.  I would not recommend this show to anyone \"just to watch a show\" if you had free tickets and especially to pay the $$$ they charge.
