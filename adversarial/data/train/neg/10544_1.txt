My fiancee and I stopped in this place on our trip to Madison from Chicago. My finacee has a gluten allergy, so this place wasnt the best for her because they fry everything in the same oil. Service was good overall as the place was not busy. I was impressed with the decor and menu and the food was really good. I especially loved the duritos which were so flavorful. We ordered the sweet potato durados. The presentation of this dish is on point and it was flavorful but not spicy at all. I also enjoyed a hibiscus Jamaica and a shot from their extensive list of mezcals.
