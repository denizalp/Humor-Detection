I went home to Cleveland to visit family and friends and was pleasantly surprised to see all the new restaurants thriving in my home town.  My Aunt organized brunch for the family at this nice little restaurant.  They are open from 7 am til about 2 or 3 pm.  My mom was not as impressed as I was, but the food was very fresh and the portions were generous.  The prices were not too much and they happily accommodated a large party such as ours including kids.  I am happy to say that there were plenty of options for everyone including diabetic family members.
