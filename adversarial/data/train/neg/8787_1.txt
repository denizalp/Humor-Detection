Had to get my cat's stomatitis treated ASAP so my vet put me in contact with Roadrunner. Great customer service over the phone and I even got to pick a flavor for her prescription. I had the meds expedited because of the situation and it arrived next day. The package came with cat toys as well, so cute!
