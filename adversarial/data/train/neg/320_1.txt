Nice dinner here last week as a group of 4! Sat at the corner of the bar (I don't think there are any tables that fit 4). Tried the cauliflower, fried chicken, a few handrolls, and the steak! Food was good (steak was really good quality) but the portions a little small for the price. The hand rolls were good (my fave was the shrimp) but not amazing - I was hoping to be blown away and I wasn't. Glad to try out this spot, recommended if you have some extra money to spend :)
