Came for breakfast and must say it was impressive.  The selections were incredible and lots to choose from.  I have only ever done the Luxor Breakfast Buffet which has a lot of same items (sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs) at many of the stations.  At Bellagio, there were no two same selections.  Even for scrambled eggs:  each station that had them were a bit different from each other.  The quality is incredibly fresh and very tasty.  Implementing the freestyle Coca-Cola machines and self-serve coffee\/juices is a huge perk as you can customize however you want.\n\nUnfortunately, we did not have a single quality interaction with any of the staff.  From the cashier to seater, waitress to bus-person, none of them had any personality, seemed incredibly irate, showed no empathy, and either sounded as if they were in a rush or we were bothersome.  I am starting to think this is the general expectation at Bellagio's Buffet as when I visited a few years ago for a Dinner Buffet, the mood was generally the same.  One key moment that stuck out was when I was seated as I normally do, the bus-person had come to the table and collected our plates.  When he turned to the table, he had fully stepped on my foot under my table (my foot was not sticking out of the table's perimeter).  It did not hurt but did catch me off guard. I pulled my foot away, and I'm sure he had noticed because there was a sudden jolt in his stance.  I just do not think he cared because he said nothing and was not phased nor fidgeted, just continued to do his job and move on to another table.
