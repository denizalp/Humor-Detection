Definitely more high-end appearing than other taco joints in town, but still serving pretty authentic Mexican street tacos. Prices are not too high overall for food, but probably a little pricey for tacos.\n\nNonetheless, the flavors are excellent and there is quite an extensive offering. Get into the various different lines to order various different foods. Everything is assembled to order.\n\nThere is also a complimentary sauce\/condiment bar in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant itself is quite large and has additional seating upstairs.\n\nOrder at the counter, so no table service, though workers will come by to clear things off your table.\n\nI'll definitely return when I'm craving tacos, especially since this place is so close to my house!
