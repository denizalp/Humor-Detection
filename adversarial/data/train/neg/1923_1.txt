I visited this pizzeria with a friend whom was allergic to gluten. The staff was well prepared for this and even went as far as to change gloves prior to preparing her food. They were quick, kind and understanding. As for the food; delicious. The pizza was awesome, though pricey... But it's the strip, so you can expect that anywhere. Great place to eat.
