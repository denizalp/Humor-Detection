i went here for lunch on the weekend with no reservations and was seated quickly. The drinks were good, especially the raspberry tea. The bread served with olive oil was very good. The pasta and chicken was okay. The only disappointment was the cheesecake dessert which took a while to be served and came caramelized, which was terrible.
