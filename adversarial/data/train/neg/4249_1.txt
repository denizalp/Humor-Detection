BEST VIP service in town.   I have lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years and work in the casino industry.  I am extremely impressed with the professional, prompt, and efficient service provided.  I have never been treated so well and had such a great time walking past ALL the other \"VIP's\" standing in line!  RED CARPET VIP is the ONLY way to go out.  Andreena is beautiful, professional and prompt!  She will make sure you are taken care of.  THANK YOU Red Carpet VIP for an amazing experience at XS inside the Encore, Las Vegas........  \n\nP.S. it was a Halloween party of @ 6000 people and we walked RIGHT IN!!!  Awesome!\n\nI would 100% recommend them over and over and over!!!!!
