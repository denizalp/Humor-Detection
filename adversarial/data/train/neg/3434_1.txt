Fantastic synergy of Chinese & Latin American cuisine (merging the owners' worlds).  Build your own combinations, then choose to have it served in bowls\/burritos or with quesadillas. The ordering process can take a few minutes to figure out but they're patient and offer free samples of the dishes and sauces to help you decide. \n\nThe Emerald Chicken is a great example of their fusion menu. It's tender, skinless grilled chicken served with a light ginger green onion sauce. I chose to have it over Jerk Chicken Rice (Chinese-style fried rice w\/ Jamaican Jerk Chicken & green onions... Yum!). You can also opt for plain white rice, yet trust me, the Jerk Chicken is bomb-lish-ish.\n\nSince I made my own 2-dish combo, got the famous Jade Chicken with it.  This is a lightly deep-fried chicken served with an Asian sweet sauce. I'm a fan of both these dishes. You also have your choice of beans. As per most people I know who eat here, the black beans win. \n\nFantastic fusion food!  5 star food experience, yet I'm giving 4 starts since ambience is a part of the overall food experience when ordering out.
