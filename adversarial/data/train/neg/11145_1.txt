I've been here a bunch of times, but my most recent visit was an absolute pleasure. I was on my way back from a concert, feeling a bit peckish, but feeling even more thirsty. As usual, the food was great, the beer was great, and the laid back atmosphere was just very... casual. \n\nBUT- the waitress I had that evening was spectacular! Not only was she helpful, and super attentive- she was absolutely hilarious! Hilarious to the point where my girlfriend and I had tears in our eyes from laughing so hard!\n\nSo, thank you Stacey (I hope I spelled that right)... from your two customers in their own little \"oasis\"! You made our awesome night that much better!
