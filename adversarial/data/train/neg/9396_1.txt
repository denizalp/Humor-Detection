The good: The interior is gorgeous. Custom cocktails we sampled were very tasty.\n \nNot so good: Coursing of the meal was extremely fast. We were a party of four with a 7:45 reservation, so I wouldn't think the staff would have been in such a hurry. To be fair, some people would have been fine with the pace, but it was a little quick for me.\n \nThe real disappointment were the steaks. When I order a $39 filet, I expect the person cooking it to know what he or she is doing and for there to be some char on it - some, at minimum. There was no char on any of the four we ordered. What a waste of high-quality beef! We ordered four sides: Brussels, lobster mac and cheese, pork belly mac and cheese and the jalapeno corn bread. All were fine, but not impressive.\n \nLastly - dinner bread. This seemed like sad grocery store bread - not the kinda good stuff Harris Teeter might bake in-store. Sad bread that apparently wasn't worth bothering to heat all the way through.\n \nTo be fair, we didn't alert anyone that we didn't enjoy the food. Complaining is so tiresome and I didn't want freebies - I wanted a great meal, but that opportunity had come and gone for March 6. I'd recommend Capitol Grill, Beef N Bottle or any number of other steakhouses ahead of this one. There's a Ruths Chris right around the corner too.
