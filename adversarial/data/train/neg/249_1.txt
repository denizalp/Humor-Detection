Unfortunately I was not impressed. Looking forward to some good barbecue brisket on a Sunday night. The wait for food was supposed to be about 30 to 35 minutes I waited hour and then went to the counter and asked if someone will check on my order. They did and actually got it out in about five more minutes but it took way longer I would normally wait for food casual take out atmosphere. The manager was nice and apologized and actually gave me a gift card for another visit, but the brisket was not very good. Mostly fat, not very tender and not Very smoked. I will not be back. My wife just the gift card in their gift shop. Maybe I was expecting too much.
