Went to this restaurant after seeing a show for a late night dinner. Our waitress was very friendly and sat us outside in the patio which is a great place to sit and watch the strip. I wasn't very hungry so just ordered the appetizer of Brussel sprouts and surprised me with how tasty they were! my husband got the 'big ass egg roll' which was basically a fried burrito. We were pretty disappointed with it. We did have to wait a long time for these two items to be served, which wasn't really a big deal to us as we were just enjoying each others company but the waitress brought out two pork belly tacos, compliments if the chef, to apologize for the wait. We were pleasantly surprised! My husband said they were better than the meal he had ordered. overall, not a bad dining experience, but not a particularly memorable or outstanding one either.
