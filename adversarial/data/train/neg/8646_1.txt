Six for dinner Saturday night at 7:30 or so. Place was full. So waited 10 minutes at the bar and had great $4 Brandy Old Fashioneds. Two of us had the Lobster Bisque. Ok we are in Wisconsin, I wasn't expecting much. It was great! Smooth creamy and actually had Lobster in it! The other four salads. No complaints on the salads, simple side type salad. For our entrees we had a bit of a mix. I had ribs and coconut shrimp. I've read a lot of the reviews here about the ribs. Seems unfair to criticize when rib preparation preference is very wide. Personally I thought they were great! Did they fall off the bone? No but they shouldn't either. Some people like them like mush and that is fine but I'll take a little firmness. These ribs that night came off the bone clean with a slight tug. Great texture and dark smoky bark. Coconut shrimp were a tasty compliment. Others had catfish they really enjoyed. Not like in Texas with small curled pieces but actually corn meal battered filets. The pulled pork was awesome! Here too, not what you usually get with pulled pork. This was nice long strings with some texture, sauce free, with your choice of 4 on the table. Not that mashed up pile of meat buried in sauce that you can't tell what you are eating. Brisket beans were very good and meaty. Hush Puppies were straight out of the South, very good. The prices I thought were very reasonable. We were shocked how low our bill was for 6. We were out of there with two drinks each and 20% tip for under $190 and we were stuffed! We can't wait to go back!
