This property management company was the worst company I have ever rented from. I have lived in Boston, Denver, and Phoenix renting homes and apartments in all 3 states. My husband and I had a major water leak that took them 6 weeks to fix. Our water and gas bill were multiplied by 10 over that time and the management company refused to reimburse us. We went 6 weeks without hot water and were down an entire bathroom. They refused to compensate us on our rent. My husband had to take multiple days out of work to wait for contractors that never came. We then had a water leak from the water line to our fridge this morning and when we called emergency maintenance we were told no one would be out until tomorrow. My husband spent the day fixing the leak and I spent the days washing 4 loads of laundry for wet towels and ruined personal belongings. I work in the medical field and my husband works in the service industry. We wouldn't recommend this company on our worst enemy. We are easy going hard working people but feel very strongly about how poorly this company is run.
