this restaurant on the outside is not very noticeable so its pretty easy to overlook but  i think it should get more exposure. i always used to bike past it and didn't think much, but after coming here i can say that the chicken adobo and rice i got was one of the best meals i've ever had. this was my first time having filipino food, and it did not disapoint. the only thing i didnt like was the halo halo, and everything took a while to get made so maybe order ahead if youre getting takeout. otherwise, everything was amazing and i can't wait to come and eat here more.
