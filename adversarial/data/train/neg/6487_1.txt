Finally got back to the Avenue Club for dinner. It has become a new and classy place. The four busy bartenders are encouraging  the high end drinks by presenting you with a place setting with all the speciality drinks pictured right there for you to choose from.They are good drinks I might add. Of course they take longer to make so the wait is longer that it should be, even with the four bartenders. I like the idea though. The fish fry was pretty good. There were two big pieces of fish and a large baked potato and a piece of bread on a plate that was too small! They should have had the potato on a separate plate or just served it all on a lager one. It was tricky to eat without knocking stuff off on the table. Oh, and there was just one lonely butter patty for the bread and potato. I would have asked for more but the waitstaff was only around when I didn't need her and not when I did. Lots of rubber necking for our late glass of wine as well. They apparently only serve the waitstaff  drinks at the far end of the bar, so it was a long walk to the front of the place by the windows where we were. They are trying hard to be the best here but it still needs a little tweaking. I moved them up a star and liked the restaurant better than last time. I would go back.
