My fiancé and I are new to the Phoenix area and have been in search of a yummy Chinese food restaurant. Well, our search is finally over. This place has very tasty and fresh Chinese food. My fiancé loves the BBQ pork appetizer and orange chicken and I'm very fond of the beef and broccoli. We usually order delivery and the food is always delivered fast and hot. I can't wait to try more items from the menu.
