First visit to Cracker Barrel... The BEST gift store, ever!! Hospitality was great, like we all know, half of the pleasure of dining out is hospitality! Shout out to our server, Vicky! Food was good, I would definitely go back! Ambiance was very comfortable! Prices are family friendly. #SatisfiedCustomer
