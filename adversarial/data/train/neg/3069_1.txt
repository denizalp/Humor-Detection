I walked in here due to some sale signs and the sale lived up to the signs. The store was highly organized and the sales were great. I will continue to shop here for baby gifts and clothes. Carter's has a reputation for being too expensive, but I actually didn't feel that regular prices were outrageously high. But needless to say, I'll continue to shop the sales! Go here especially if you're in a rush to find the perfect gift.
