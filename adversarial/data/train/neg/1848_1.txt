I've actually never been to the St. Clair or Sheppard locations so this review will be solely based on my experiences at the Mississauga location. \n\nThis is one of my fav restaurant\/bar chains. I come here every now and then, and I always enjoy it because the food and drinks are amazing and affordable, the vibe is comforting and clean, and the staff is always friendly. Never had a bad experience here. \n\nI recommend the firecrackers (it's basically deep fried spring rolls with beef, mushroom, and cream cheese in them) - my friend and I are obsessed with them!!! Other things on the menu are great as well - I've never had food that is less than great here. \n\nLove the drinks here as well! They have drink special on each day of the week which makes it easier to try the variety of their drink options. Also they occasionally have special drink menus (i.e. mojito with fresh raspberries) so that adds some fun. \n\nThis place is great if you want to relax in a casual environment.
