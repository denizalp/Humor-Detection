First went to In N Out in California and went for business out to Vegas twice a year for Conventions and we always go to this location, just off the strip. In N Out is the best burger, I just love the Double, like it with the extra sauce, animaly style also good. Shakes and fries are also a must. Really wish they were on the east coast. This is simply fresh good food and is my favorite burger, hands down. This place gets very crowded no matter what time you go but the line is worth the wait. I am having withdrawals,
