Please take a patients allergies seriously when the CLEARLY SPELL THEM OUT FOR YOU.  MEDshape is a misleading name as it would lead clients to believe that you have some medical experience. You pushed a weight loss powder on me that contained an allergen that sent me to the ER with a severe allergic reaction requiring hospitalization. No, I didn't look closely at the ingredients because you are a medical facility which I assumed after paying you a significant amount of money would NEVER give me something I was allergic to. Not only should you pay for my hospital stay but at the very least should refund the money I paid you for nothing.  Oh and have you ever heard of HIPPA?  \nSeriously, calling another patients phone number because \"you didn't believe we weren't the same patient\" \" because our names and DOB were so similar?\" Absolutely unbelievable incompetence! \nYelp doesn't let you give zero stars, more important that others are made aware.
