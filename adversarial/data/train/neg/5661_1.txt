They have the most authentic Taiwanese (and some Chinese) food in Pittsburgh metro area. Their beef noodle soup is comparable to the one you can get from Chinatown, NYC! Other than various deliciously drooling entrees, their appetizers and soup selections are also go-die-for, highly recommending the marinated duck!
