We just moved to the area recently and tried out numerous other car lots before we found Cfae. We went to them because of their great reviews online. Turns out Cfae Auto truly strives to get you what you're looking for without pretending or playing the typical salesman games. They have reports on all their inventory and you'll know what you're getting into. We ended up going back to them for a second vehicle. I highly recommend this customer centered company for your next vehicle purchase if you're in the Phoenix area! No hassle, smooth process, no brainer 5 star Yelp action...
