The food was average but the service was nonexistent. We started out with a waiter who took our initial drink order but never returned. Thus we flagged down another waitress who seemed flummoxed when we asked her to take our order. Begrudgingly, she did.\n\nService was unreliable throughout dinner. It was nearly impossible to get a drink refill or even extra napkins. The silverware was plastic, which is cheap, classless, and ridiculous (i.e., this wasn't an outdoor picnic affair). And they catered much more to larger parties of ten plus people than they did the two tops. That was disappointing because we would have tipped well if they paid us some attention.\n\nFinally, they tolerated classless customers. They did nothing when some kid continuously spiked a basketball up and down the aisles. This is bad parenting and a case of bad parents who spent most of their time texting. But I won't make that the point of my review.\n\nBottom line: My money is as green as the next guy's. It spends anywhere. I won't waste it here. And I certainly won't waste my time trying to flag someone down or twist their arm to get a drink.
