Checked this place out twice, looking for a rental suit. First time we went to gather information. The staff was nice and friendly. They took the measurements for free, explained the pricing and the process for rentals. We went home to discuss it. A week later we came back to finalize the order. I suggest making an appointment if you go on Saturday. We didn't and ended up waiting a bit. Then someone not from rentals tried to help us. He did a good job with the fitting. However his information, prices\/dates, was different from what we gathered last visit. Once at the register, Jared did a great job of clearing up any issues and making us feel good. I just wished someone had told me there was a no refundable damage deposit. I wouldn't have minded paying it, if I was told. Suit should be ready in a few days. Hoping for the same level of service once we pick up and drop back off.
