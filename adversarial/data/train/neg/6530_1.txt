Coffee Shop\n\nThe new Delta is a great location for the business traveller as it's minutes from everything and it's spanky shiny new\n\nI have arranged several business breakfasts at this spot and they do a wonderful job and pricing is a bit high but the return on your investment is cool modern decor, free newspaper and fast and a tasty menu\n\nMade to order omelettes, eggs Benny 3 ways and corned beef hash is right on\n\nThe buffet is expansive for those that eat one meal a day so come hungry and bring Tupperware too\n\nHotel guests have a big high five for the great customer experience during a stay
