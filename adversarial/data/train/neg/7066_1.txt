I have been only volunteering at Toys 4 Smiles for a few weeks now but I can definitely say this is a great group of individuals that are donating a lot of time and energy to do something simple yet profound, make children happy. In a society full of high-speed entertainment (internet, cell phones and video games) fueled by a \"I want it yesterday\" mentality, it is refreshing to see something like Toys 4 Smiles. These toys are very simple, yet very high quality. It is rare in this day and age that a child will receive a toy that not only was HANDMADE for them but also requires them to use their imaginations. The way I think of it is that maybe some of these kids getting theses toys don't have a lot of people in their lives that make them seem \"worth it.\" Well, I am hoping that some of these kids will get these toys and understand that a stranger took the time to make them by hand and that a stranger CARES. They are worthy of it and deserve it. It's a simple thing but if that message reaches some children that message could possibly affect a life. \n\nI encourage anyone looking to donate some time (doesn't matter how much) to give them a call and head on in and help make some toys!
