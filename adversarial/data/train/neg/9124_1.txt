Found Framin Works on Yelp. and was not disappointed. I had a very large picture that needed framing. In the past, I had gone the easy route, and gone to Michaels for all my framing needs. The picture I had was so large that I decided to call them with the dimensions of the picture and tell them what I was looking to have done. The lowest prices they quoted me was almost $400, and that was with a 60%+20% off coupon!!! i decided to try Framin works, and saved over $100 off the lowest price that Michael's had quoted me. Granted, this price included a 25% off coupon, but I still thought the price was very fair. When I brought the picture in, the owner was very fair and didn't try to oversell me. He actually, told me that all I really needed for the picture was a new frame. He said the glass was fine, and that matting was in pretty good shape. I ended up replacing the matting and the frame. The finished product was great. I will definitely be back!
