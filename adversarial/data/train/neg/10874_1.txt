Had a great stay while here for Dodgers Spring Training. Room service was pretty affordable considering it is room service. Westgate Entertainment district is walking distance (it's like a ghost town though when there aren't events at Cardinals stadium or Jobing Arena) There's a trolley at Westgate that goes to Camelback Ranch every 30 minutes on game day. Cardinals stadium & Jobing Arena are also walking distance. The rooms are very spacious & love that they have Aveda products. Extra bonus is the mini toothpaste. \n\nPool area was nice, although understaffed. People are slobs & it would be nice if either guest put their dirty towels in the designated area or staff was there to clear unused cabanas & lounge chairs. I know, you're on vacation. But that doesn't mean common courtesy should go out the window. The bar & pool side service is kinda hit or miss, hence the understaffed.  \n\nOur one negative experience was at the restaurant. We were seated immediately and then it all went downhill. There were very few diners & it took FOREVER to get our order taken, get our food, and get our bill. Got the wrong food but I was starving & just ate what they brought. Had I not been staying at the hotel, I probably would have gotten up and left. \n\nWill definitely stay again but will either eat offsite or order room service instead.
