Sweet Moses is one of my favorite Cleveland gems. This shop will take you on a journey into a magical past. The atmosphere is spot on for a vintage soda fountain, down to every last detail. \n\nThey are also spot on with their treats. Everything is delicious and made with care the old fashioned way. No matter what you choose, you will not be disappointed! Some friends have had a little sticker shock, but once they see and taste their order, they agree that their treats are worth every penny. \n\nI have two Sweet Moses traditions that I stick to each year. In January I visit for a chocolate cola in honor of my grandmother's birthday - she used to make them for me as a child because she was a fountain girl back in the day. At Christmas time I am there for the Sterling Linder Sundae. This magical treat is big enough that share and is made of homemade peppermint stick ice cream and hot fudge, and topped with a custom Christmas tree made from a sprinkle-coated sugar cone surrounded by a blanket of whipped cream snow.
