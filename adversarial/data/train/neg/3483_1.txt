We really enjoy coming here. It's the perfect place to go before or after catching a movie at Stonecrest. The tableside guacamole is really good, we always have to get that! They have a nice variety of tacos and have the choice of a corn soft shell! The chimichanga's are super good too and HUGE...prepare to get a to do box!
