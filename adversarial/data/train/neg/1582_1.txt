I had a wonderful dinner here last night! It's a small and intimate dining room, which was a nice change to getaway from the large crowds on Friday nights. When we sat down the head chef came over to our table to greet us and shared some of his favorite dishes. It was a nice personal touch! He also came back after our meal to ask us how it was. The waiter was very friendly too. They had live music in the front corner of the restaurant. It was fun to sing along while we waited for our food. And the food was fantastic! The pasta and seafood tasted fresh. The food and wine was a little pricey, but they gave us nice sized portions. We had enough to take home and eat for lunch the next day. The wine selection was great too! Will be back soon, it's a nice place to take friends and family when they come to visit!
