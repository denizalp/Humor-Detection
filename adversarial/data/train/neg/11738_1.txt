Amazing. Ethan, our server was adorable and very accommodating. 2 of us in our party of four ordered the vegetarian eggs Benedict but subbed out the tomatoes for avocado. Sometimes modifiers like that can get lost in translation, but both dishes were served perfectly.\n\nI had never been here before, but heard there was a significant remodel. It looks great. You can bet that we will be trying the cocktails next time! Great Madison establishment!
