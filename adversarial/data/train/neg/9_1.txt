We enjoyed our lunch and will come back. However, my husband's ribs were suspiciously uniform for an authentic rib joint and only \"just ok\". My pulled pork sandwich was very good and all of the sides were excellent (between us we had mac and cheese, hush puppies, vinegar coleslaw, and baked beans). I think it was pricey, but no more so than other midrange restaurants.
