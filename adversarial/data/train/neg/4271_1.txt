It was a Sunday afternoon and we made a reservation about an hour and a half prior just to make sure we got seated without wait. The service was excellent, our server was helpful and made many great recommendations for drinks and main courses. The service was great, orders were out quick! And the quantity and quality of food is superb! Can't go to Yardbird without ordering fried chicken! It's the whole point! Can't go wrong with chicken watermelon and waffles!
