First time being at this hole in the wall restaurant. Let me tell you the ambience is cool and the dive atmosphere is exciting. However, when it came to the wings let me tell you they were not that bad, nor that good. These wings are EXPENSIVE to the contrary it is a dive bar and you would expect a little bit less expensive. For 16 wings you are looking at a 17 dollar check and in my opinion that is completely ludicrous. And don't bother with the \"extra hot,\" it cost more money and you can't even tell the difference from hot to extra hot. All in all not a bad experience but because or the prices, I will most likely not be back.
