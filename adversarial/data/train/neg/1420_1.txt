Smoky Jon's is some of the best BBQ I've had in Madison.  However, I haven't tried many places, so that's not saying much.  I really enjoy the ribs and the pork shoulder sandwich.  The brisket is good as well.  I have found all the barbecued menu items to be flavorful and tender.  The burgers aren't that good, however; they're overdone and greasy.\n\nThe sides also leave something to be desired.  I've never had a bad side dish, but I've only really been impressed by the fried biscuits.  The mashed potatoes are runner-up.  The pasta salad and potato salad are both well below average.\n\nService at Smoky Jon's is both quick and friendly.  Employees will remember you, which is always nice.  The prices are good.  The location is a little iffy, though; the parking lot is too small and the building itself can feel cramped.\n\nAll problems aside, I will keep coming here for the delicious BBQ.
