This review is only for the service, which prevented us from trying the food. We're here for 4 more days and likely won't be coming back as a result of this experience. \n\nWe got there 10 minutes before they opened for breakfast only to be frowned at by the woman opening up who didn't seem happy to see us. Oh well. We looked at the menu and it looked good, but because we had time, we decided to check out our other options and come back when they opened. We just now literally turned and walked out because the hostess was so unpleasant, condescending and rude. First she didn't acknowledge us when we came back. She muttered \"I'll seat you in a minute\" as she rolled some metal stanchion in front of us and continued to look down and scowl like we were in her way. Ummm. Okay I guess. Then she looks at the computer screen for about a minute, still not acknowledging us, then she says, with an entirely empty restaurant behind her, \"do you have a reservation?\" We burst out laughing. What? We were just here 10 minutes ago looking at the menu and wondering what time they opened! For the first time in either encounter with her, she looks up and actually glared at me and said. \"it's not about how full the restaurant is, I have to check you off in the computer if you have a reservation.\" Ummm. Ok. Then she sarcastically called me \"honey\" and that was that. We said,\" we'll go somewhere else\" and left. \n\nThere are plenty of other places for breakfast where they smile and say good morning to you when you show up. Good luck getting all your 8 am reservations seated \"honey\"!
