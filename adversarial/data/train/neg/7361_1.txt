The atmosphere was trendy, but very loud. We had difficulty hearing each other. Our server was fabulous, very attentive and helpful. We made reservations and the table was ready on time. \n\nThe food was excellent! I had the scallops with bacon wrapped sweet potatoes. It was beautiful and delicious. However, I was a bit disappointed on the portion size. The dish had 5 scallops and five small pieces of sweet potato.  The entree did not come with any bread, sides, or salad so 5 scallops was not much of a meal. But what was there was delicious!
