Located in basement public walkway - not really part of hotel. Bummer to have to go to 3rd floor hotel for sauna, shower, change and go to spa for services. I like to walk in robe\/ bathing suit. However. Staff was so friendly. Services were fresh and clean. Lilian did great job working on me. It's a very busy place, so be sure to book in advance. All are RMT.
