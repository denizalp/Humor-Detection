This is a solid Tex\/Mex restaurant. The ratings are going to average closer to 4 stars overall. \n\nI love their Enchiladas. I have tried them all and they are delicious. I stay away from the chips and salsa because they are so good that I never make it to the entree. I literally end up eating the chips and salsa as my main course. \n\nThe service is always excellent. Very friendly staff.\n\nVital Statistic: Overall a really good price\/value relationship. Very large entrees you can split with someone.
