Ok, yes I am a guy and this is most definitely a ladies store, but I wanted to buy my Mom a nice Birthday Present. I knew she liked Vera Bradley and so I went to have a look. The sales clerk Cecile, was amazingly helpful. Since my Mom loves the Beach and we had a trip planned right around her birthday, Cecile steered me toward a nice beachy color scheme. We started with a nice Beach Bag and then added a towel, hat, some flip flops and a few miscellaneous items. Everyone made me feel welcome and my Mom loved the present. So guys are welcome at Vera Bradley, just ask for Cecile and she will set you up.
