Very good quality Southern food with a few good twists (like chicken with cheddar waffles).\nHowever, my fried chicken was good but wasn't that crispy, and it ain't cheap food.\nIf you are in Vegas with a hankering for Southern food, this will be a good choice.\nBut I've eaten in many, many BBQ or Southern restaurants that are a notch better.  No way this deserves five stars:  its good but not great
