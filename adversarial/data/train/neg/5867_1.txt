After two dining experiences here I can say that I really like this new addition to the Henderson breakfast scene. Metro does more than just breakfast, but so far I've only dined in for breakfast. The food is good, service is friendly, and it's a quick dine-in option.\n\nMetro is on their game with efficiently serving up good food. We've never had to wait long for a table and the food is quick to arrive at the table. The front of the restaurant has a comfortable waiting area for busy times. The servers have been friendly and accommodating. The inside of the restaurant has an old school diner feel, but cleaner and more open.\n\nI've enjoyed a Crab Cake Benedict and Sausage Gravy & Biscuits. Both were delicious and came out as generous portions. The hash browns on the side were tasty too. My orders have been correct and well prepared both times. Next time I'll have to try the signature Chicken & Waffles!
