Been hear a handful of times since it's been opened. Absolutely love cork and cleaver. Confit chicken wings and Ruben ribs are amazing. I've ordered entrees of the regular menu being the gnocchi and fried chicken Mac and cheese. They are both great. I usually do always get their daily special which has always been outstanding. It's nice having a gourmet, artsy type of restaurant right in the suburbs, instead of heading down to ohio city, tremont or downtown. Oh and can't go wrong with their hand made cocktails.
