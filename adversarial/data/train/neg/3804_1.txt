This is a new place to Chandler and I was curious so I came by. It is Greek\/Mediterranean\/Arabic food and also other things.  I had Banana and Peanut butter smoothie, Meat roll and Panini bbq chicken. Staff and Owner were friendly and cooked up food right away. Meat roll was delicious with ground beef and saffron, bbq chicken panini was good but a little bold. Smoothie was delicious.    Very good spot I recmmend!
