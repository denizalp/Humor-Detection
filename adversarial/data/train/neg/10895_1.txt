so sad! this place is close! i used to come here but recently i realize that it's been replace by a korean restaurant.\n\nthe wontons are so filled with shrimp, the fish balls had bones in them i always get scared the bones might choke me but the food tasted awesome! hot water dispenser is at each table so you make your own tea. the soups tasted too much of msg... delicious but... msg is bad for you. \n\nbye bye wonton place, i kinda miss you.
