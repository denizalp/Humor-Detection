I really love this coffee shop. When we moved here and we had an empty kitchen we went here every day. Their coffee is great. The food is really yummy. You can tell things are sourced locally. They have a lot of seating to sip and savor. They even have a cute play area for kiddos. As an ex-Seattleite I appreciate this local latte shop!!
