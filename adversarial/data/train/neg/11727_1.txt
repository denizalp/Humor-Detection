I came here on a Friday night just to hang out and kick off the weekend. We were seated at the bar because the restaurant was already closed (@ 9?!) and the bartenders were umm well not very attentive. Granted, we had drunk @$$holes sitting next to us, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to ignore me. When we FINALLY got to order (just chips and salsa, cuz the kitchen was closed!) we weren't sure if the order ever got put in by the bartender. When a confused guy came out of the kitchen with a plate of chips and salsa, I pounced on him, not sure if it was my order. It was, thank god. The salsa was decent but the beans which they provide with the chips were AMAZING!! Highly recommend!! We got kicked out like half an hour later, which I was not capable to drive yet. I was disappointed by the hours of this place, considering it's IN A CASINO!
