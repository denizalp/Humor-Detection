Winner winner chicken dinner! This place has a really solid chicken shawarma and what put it over the top was the service given to me! The owner of the place, Matt, greeted me as soon as I entered and was genuinely interested in how I was doing. He made sure he made the shawarma just right to my liking. \n\nGreat Food and greater hospitality.
