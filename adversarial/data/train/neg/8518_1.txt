Wow I wish there was a way to put negative stars. I just had the worst customer service experience I've had in a long time if ever. They just lost a good customer permanently. I don't think anyone there will care but go somewhere else if you can. This is what happened. Lady walks away from Customer Service Counter carrying a small dog. I see people in there with dogs all of the time not wearing any type of service vest and I'm curious if the store determines whether or not they are service animals. The FDA provides that only service animals are allowed in food establishments.\n\nI politely asked the Safeway Customer Service Person: \"Do you monitor whether or not those are service dogs? Safeway Customer Service: \"No we are not a monitoring store. If you want, you can say something to the customer yourself.\"\n\nMe (getting annoyed they expect me to do something about it and not wishing to confront another customer): \"Well I don't think I should have to do that. I'm afraid it would piss her off.\"\n\nSafeway Customer Service: \"Well we are not going to do it.\"\n\nMe (Kind of surprised at how rude she is, she knows me, I've been shopping there for years and I was simply asking questions. I wasn't confrontational until I heard her responses.) : \"So then what if I called the Board of Health?\"\n\nSafeway Customer Service: \"Well now you are pissing me off.\"\n\nI walked away, I will never set foot in the Safeway Store on Frank Lloyd Wright and Thompson Peak in Scottsdale again.\n\nUpdate: 2\/17\/17 To be fair - I should say I did receive a call from the store manager who seemed sincerely apologetic about the treatment I received.
