I try to support local, small businesses whenever possible as we are small business owners in Verona also.  I have been in the store 3 times and 2 out of 3 times I've encountered a woman (owner?) that is so rude. She acts like you're bothering her by entering her store.  Today I had a postage paid envelope to drop and wanted a receipt but wasn't sure if it was rude of me to ask when they weren't making a sale. She offered me a receipt but was inconvenienced and no comment to me when I left saying \"thanks have a great day\".  I asked her if she'd rather I drop postage paid items at the post office (which would seem reasonable if she's not making any money from the transaction) to which she replied \"no\".  Happens once - we all have an off day.  Happens twice - I tried to support your business but this was the last time.  Note: the 1 out of 3 positive experience I had was not a encounter with the female employee but a male.
