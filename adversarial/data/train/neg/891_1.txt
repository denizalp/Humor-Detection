Boyfriend and I came here for date night and had a great time. Delicious food, excellent service.\n\nWe had the Calamari Fritti as an appetizer and were very pleased with it. It was seasoned well and very crispy. \n\nI ordered the Vitellina alla Parmigiana and it's probably one of the best things I've ever eaten. \n\nBoyfriend ordered the duck breast and thought it was okay. He wasn't crazy about the sauce (red wine demi-glace) and he thought the duck was just slightly overcooked. He started eating off of my plate though and LOVED the veal.\n\nOverall, I'd give this place 4.5 stars. I will definitely be back!
