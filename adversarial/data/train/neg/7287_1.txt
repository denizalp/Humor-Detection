I don't normally write reviews but I felt like I had to say something. I had the daily special sacha with beef. It comes with steamed rice and vegetables (onions, carrots, zucchini, celery). Not sure if it was the sacha but the taste was bland and disappointing. Not to mention the portion was not worth the $6.95 price. Maybe I'll try one of their noodle dishes in the future since \"noodles\" is in their name--maybe they're actually better than the rice dishes. But I wouldn't do a daily special again.
