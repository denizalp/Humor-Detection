This is a place I have drove past a dozen times, and today I finally stopped in. It was as good as the hype.  I kind of resent that it get compared to chipotle, its a similar set up but the taste is far supiror. I had two tacos one Chicken one beef, meat had so much flavor, and I could probably eat a whole plate full of those pickles onions. The soup was amazing as well.
