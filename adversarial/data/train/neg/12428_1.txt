Honestly this place is always so I go to for a late night eats and quick bites. The service has always been top notch and the atmosphere is beautiful. The tables have one side against the wall and the other with just normal chairs. The seats against the wall ordained with pillows and beautiful fabric. There are hanging lanterns around the restaurant and fun music always playing. When you walk in the host will direct you to sit down and hand you menus. The menus aren't large or overwhelming but they have a lot to offer. The prices are also really good and you won't be paying a ton out of pocket if you eat here. I believe that they have lunch specials for the cheap but I'm not usually around for lunch so I cannot be sure. I do know they have a Groupon and the Living Social coupon so you can even buy one of those to save even more money. I usually like to get the chicken kabob and my partner likes to get the Iraqi kabob. Both come with three skewers of meat, a salad, saffron rice, pita, and some taziki sauce. It is more than enough food to have some for extra the next day. But sometimes it's so good that you end up eating all of it and being sad that you don't have anything for lunch. The service is always really nice. They know how to make you feel comfortable and welcome. In the food is out of this world. Really you should try it, and they're even open late. If you are in the Lawrenceville area I would really suggest coming here to enjoy some delicious food. You will not be disappointed.
