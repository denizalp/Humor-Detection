I have using this UPS store the last four years. I was told from day one that each item shipped was automatically covered for $100. no additional insurance needed unless I valued package higher. \nI recently shipped items and again when I brought up insurance I received same story. The package in question this time was marked 'Fragile' and of course this one and only time since shipping from this particular store, several items were broken. I called store to ask how to start a claim. I have tracking number and was told an investigation would be started. I called today and no claim was filed. Then today I'm told the $100. Is only guaranteed if the store does the packing. I've never been told that by anyone in that store until now. Now I don't blame the store that items were broken but I do blame them for not being honest and upfront on insurance and shipping policies.  I would of bought additional insurance since I was sending that was breakable and wanted extra assurance. If I'd known about policy the insurance was only good if they packed, I certainly would of paid the extra money for them to pack. I feel I have been deceived. When I expressed my feelings I was told the person that waited on me would of made sure I knew the policy. Then I was made to feel I was lying and trying to defraud them. Yes I got angry very angry. Used a few choice words and hung up. Theses places are easy and convenient to use but when you need to file a claim there is always so loop hole for them to get out of it. In future I will go to USPS!!!!!
