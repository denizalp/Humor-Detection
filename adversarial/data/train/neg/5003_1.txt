I have been here twice for dinner and I like the place a lot.  Maybe it's not the best sushi, but the value you get on the price is amazing.  Don't fall for their Titanic roll.  Supposedly you can find a treasure which turns into a gift certificate, but it's not a tasty roll.\nI recommend the Midnight Club roll and the Volcano roll.  Both are excellent.  Also, try the teriyaki ball.  Get some yakitori\/tempura\/maki rolls for $1-3 each.  End up with a full stomach after spending around $20.\nThe best way to order is family style where everyone shares.  That way you don't end up eating a whole roll you don't like and have more variety.  Honestly, both times I ordered so much food, and never spent more than $30-35 after tip.\nAlso, it's a nice looking restaurant with a pretty fancy decor, but it's a casual atmosphere, although I hear on the weekends it's pretty bumpin.
