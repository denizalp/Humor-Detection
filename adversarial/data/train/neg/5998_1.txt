This was my first time using this site and I was very impressed and delighted on how easy and accommodating it is. LuAnn was wonderful very pleasant and very knowledgeable about the different entertainment within Las Vegas. I had no problems picking up my tickets, they were waiting for me as discussed at the box office. The seating was awesome and the show was great! I've dealt with other companies providing the same service but, Showtime Marketing is in a class of its own!  LuAnn thank you for your excellent level of service and I promise I will sing your praises to all of my friends!\n\nThank you \n\nBarbara Washington
