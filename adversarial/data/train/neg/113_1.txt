My husband loves the $6.00 mug of Guiness and I love the fish sandwich. Their homemade chips  & dips are wonderful too. Great reubens, the Mulligan's Egg Rolls are a great appetizer too. Lots of \"Irish\" feel to the place. Patio is awesome in the summer\/fall with bike nights and parking for the bikes it is a nice night out.
