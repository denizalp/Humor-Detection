First, I want to note that this restaurant in MGM is not called Wolfgang Puck Express. \n\nThe real name is Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill!\nSomeone made a mistake when starting this review thread...\n\nSo on to the food. I had a braised short rib dish served with some sort of pasta filled with cheese. There were also cooked mushrooms and spinach that came with the dish. It was very tasty. One of my friends had the skirt steak with fries, which also had great flavor.\n\nThe service was top notch and very attentive. Our water glasses were constantly being filled up. This is especially important in Vegas where the weather is very dry.\n\nThe dinner prices were very reasonable for a \"name brand\" restaurant. Most dishes were in the $18 - $30 range.\n\nI had to take away one star because our table bread arrived cold. They gotta serve it warm to get five stars.
