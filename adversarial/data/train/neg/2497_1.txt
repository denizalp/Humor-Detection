Huge space with indoor and outdoor seating. Service was a bit confused - for example after we finished our meal and the table was cleared a new waiter came by and put bread on our table thinking we had just got there. There were only two beers on tap which is odd for a place called the keg. The calamari, steak skewers and garlic shrimp appetizers were good - especially garlic shrimp. I had the baseball steak for dinner which was also good.
