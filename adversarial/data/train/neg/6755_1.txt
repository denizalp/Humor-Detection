The \"Q\" is this rotisserie chicken spot that is near identical to Swiss Chalet, but pricier and smaller portions....\n\nThe Q offers up rotisserie chicken with some other comfort food items. They have an eclectic menu as they also do steaks and seafood and such, but chicken is their primary area of focus. \n\nI got the quarter chicken lunch special that comes with fries, slaw, and bread (as well as soup for lunch) for $12.95. The chicken leg was rather small, which was pretty disappointing, but the meat was tasty and the skin was pretty crispy. Fries were the best kind as they are the crisp ones and not the flaccid greasy ones that Swiss Chalet has. Bread was a pretty weak half of a hamburger bun??\n\nOverall, I found the Q pretty disappointing. The prices are higher than Swiss Chalet, and although the chicken might be slightly better, they're smaller and not as filling. Gravy that comes with the chicken is the same too. Can't tell much of a difference.
