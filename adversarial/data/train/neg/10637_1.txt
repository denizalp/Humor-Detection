Really solid cookies, especially the chocolate chip and ginger. I've had them both from the storefront on Carlaw and from a local cafe that keeps them in stock. Strangely enough, the ones from the cafe were better than from the storefront, but that may have been a batch issue. They run a little on the dry side (not gooey). I've also had the chocolate cupcake which was average, but I'm not really a cupcake person.\n\nNot the best cookies in Toronto but pretty close. Definitely give them a try.
