I usually only go to the MBB airport location but the Biltmore location did not disappoint. After being told Snooze would not have a wait based on its help and then being told it was actually a 50 minutes wait we discovered that MBB was near. We were sat immediately or server apologized and let us know that they were waiting in clean glasses to serve us drinks. Our food was amazing as always. I'm glad we went here instead.
