Unexpectedly impressive and delicious! This was where I went when I snuck out of the Toronto Western Hospital across the street after 2 weeks of hospital food. My illness had made eating a huge challenge. \nTheir barbecued pork vermicelli with spring roll was so delicious - make that SO delicious!! - and I ate more during that visit than I had been able to consume in days. So tender.  So flavourful.  So delicately prepared. Shockingly good. \nI returned many times as I recovered and since, and it's been perfect every single time. Literally it's Vietnamese food nirvana to me. \nThe young waitress was all alone during my first visit and she was working maybe  six tables plus the bar plus she had to package and serve take out orders. I have never seen a waiter or waitress move faster and more efficiently. She was like totally a blur in her running shoes. It was crazy.  And she did not miss a beat. So impressive. And she was still sweet and sunny and lovely. Wow.\n(They weren't understaffed in subsequent visits btw). \nSeriously delicious and so unexpected. Highly recommended! Go go go!
