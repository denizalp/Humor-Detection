What a GEM! Sushi can be very hit or miss in Phoenix and Harumi Sushi wins for food, ambiance and amazing service with a smile! Not super trendy or fancy, but a great spot for a casual date. Upon entering, you're greeted with a big KONICHIWA from the owner and staff who bend over backwards to make sure every guest feels welcomed and has a positive experience. The signature forbidden rice is a fun twist on old classic. The sushi is absolutely delicious and the portions are huge! We always end up with more than we need because it's just too good to stop order. The H3 roll and Sushi Combo appetizers are favorites of ours. Give this downtown Phoenix spot a chance, you won't be disappointed.
