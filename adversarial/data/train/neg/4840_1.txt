I like this Casino. Looks new and clean. Out of the 4 casinos in the valley. I prefer this one. Wish they had $5 tables more often in the evenings. \n\nWe'll be sitting at the Black Jack tables. No auto-Shufflers here. :) I like the colors of the theme too. \n\nNot sure about dining. Haven't tried anything yet. Smoke is ventilated enough (I'm a smoker)
