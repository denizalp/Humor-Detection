Super cool bar, loved the ceiling and ambiance there! Great staff! I went in around 3am. The bar was still a bit busy giving how late it was. My bartender Kel was fast, friendly and efficient!! I ordered one of my faves, an Espresso Martini which was absolutely amazing! I asked him if he could come up with something different and told him the flavors I like. He was able to create a perfect drink that tasted exactly how I was hoping, I had to ask him to make another just like it! Great customer service and great bar!
