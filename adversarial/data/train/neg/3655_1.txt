5 Stars for Calvin. He was more helpful than the initial guy who I spoke to regarding my Asus purchase. Calvin grabbed it for me and processed my transaction. Although I didn't purchase the warranty, he tried his best to sell it. Great sales tactics and very informative. I'm just a determined person who doesn't want to spend more than I should. He also left me with the option to come back within 15 days if I change my mind.
