My favorite Montreal restaurant...The food is all great (I think I've tried just about everything). Most of the simulated 'meat' analogues are excellent...the mock shrimp is kind of 'off'...more like fishy gummybears...not terrible, just not 'convincing'. This alone is not enough to drop a star. GO!
