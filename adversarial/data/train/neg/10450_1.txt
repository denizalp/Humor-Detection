I was referred to Dr. Merhdad Tafreshi after a accident, 3 years ago.  After my first visit, I knew that I had found my primary doctor.  I have never found another person besides my spouse or parents that cares more about my health and well being than Dr. Tafreshi.  \n\nI am so fortunate to have found a doctor who listens to me and gives me great advice to treat my medical issues.  Dr. Tafreshi is very efficient and thorough and I know he really cares about my health.  I highly recommend visiting Meadows Medical Group and see Dr. Tafreshi he is a wonderful Doctor and I'm fortunate to have found him.
