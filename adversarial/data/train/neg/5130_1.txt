This is my new favorite place. I love the atmosphere and the creative decor with the schoolhouse theme. The outside patio will be fantastic in the spring. It's very roomy and has a gorgeous view. They have fun drinks and good prices and their buffalo cauliflower appetizer was fantastic. I had the tortilla soup and one of their salads, both of which were very very good. We had a great server and a super fun time enjoying the bottomless drink brunch. I'm really excited to go back and eat and drink again very soon.
