I've had better.  Yup, that pretty much sums up my experience here.  If I was to use one word - disorganized.  Here's why.  \n\nFirst, reservations were made for a Saturday night.  My date and I arrived on time.  The hostess was polite, but showed little concern for our seating arrangement.  I would have chose a different table and almost did.  \n\nSecond, we waited at least 10 minutes before a waiter even came to our table.  Really?!  Apparently, he didn't know he was our waiter.  We placed a drink order and it took another 10 minutes before that arrived.  The waiter appeared to be very busy with little time for us.  The night continued in that fashion.  The amount of time we had to endure for our sushi to arrive was unacceptable.  When the food finally was placed in front of us the waiter took zero time to explain the dish and quickly exited the area.  We are not sushi experts by any means.  \n\nThird, allegedly their checkout machines had \"gone down\".  Our bill was wrong.  I had to point this out to our waiter and had it corrected.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is great and I enjoyed the food.  Unfortunately, we spent 2 hours at this place for 4 rolls and a couple beers.  The wait staff seems to be lacking in training and there is no sense of urgency.
