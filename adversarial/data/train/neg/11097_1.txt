Max is a charming man to start with. So humble and welcoming. I had a fantastic time with my sister. \n\nOn to the food!!!\n\nMy goodness is it AMAZING!\n\nWe had the lightsoup with fufu aka aponchi kakraa and it was so delicious and filling!! It was an ample serving of protein and carbs alike. I made sure to finish every ounce of it. Beware guys food coma alert. This is no joke- chale! it takes me back to chop bar days and you'd be hard pressed to find Ghanaian cuisine as authentic as this. \n\nOur fufu was served in a traditional bowl the apotoyiwa (hurray!!)- a blackened fired clay bowl with a grooved pattern in it. Max even followed up with a bowl of water to wash our hands which was extremely humbling to us.\n\nIt's a must visit every time we're in town!!
