I was in Vegas for a short biz trip, after standing all day at the booth, super exhausted, found this place on yelp, went in, pretty lay back environment, what great about this place is they explain everything in details, no hidden fees like places in LA, got an hour and half foot care, head back to hotel, what a day.  Thumbs up! \n\nAppreciate too for the new customer discount Nicole gave to me.  Definitely a place to stop when next in Vegas! Absolutely worth my 5 star rating!
