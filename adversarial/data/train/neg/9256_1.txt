When I moved to Vegas i was hunting for a Good Korean BBQ\nTried several of them till I found Lee's Korean BBQ\nThe best thing is that it's always clean, service is fine, the Must is that they open 24\/7 and offer all you can eat options! Depending on meat selection option you choose price goes from $20 to $33 (all you can eat) - of course you still have A la Carte menu\n\nIt's roomy and clean!\nsorry i didn't take as much pictures as usual. i was starving yesterday lol and forgot to take pics\nService is fast. The waitress are not so friendly but \nstill pleasant.\nThey usually start grilling the meat for you and then you are on your own unless your burn the grill then they come and say \"no no no\" lol\nthe little dishes that come with the meat like kimchi, sprouts, papaya salad (spicy hot guys), radish, green salad (dressing is not tasty at all)\nthen they bring you the salt&pepper with the sesame oil et some soy sauce\nI wish they would bring you some spicy chili oil instead of the soy sauce (better with sushi in my opinion)\n\nThe only reason why i didn't put 5 stars is that often you have to ask twice for refill or accompanied dish (like the papaya salad or kimchi or sprouts)...
