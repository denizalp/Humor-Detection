I decided that chain pizza was not my thing on Thursday evening so I was looking through Yelp and came across this place. When a Pizza Joint has been in business as long as these guys, they have to be doing something right. I ordered the Marconi Large Super for delivery. When I called the lady who took my order was super polite and my order was at my door within 40 mins or less. It arrived hot, fresh and very tasty. \n\nThis Pizza is hands down one of the best Pizzas I have had in years. I like lots of fresh ingredients. These folks do not skimp on any of that. Nothing stingy about this place at all. The crust is just right, not too thick and not too thin, with just the right amount of crispy crunch around the edges and a slight bit of charing to enhance the flavour. These folks definitely know thier stuff when it comes to good quality pizza. \n\nThis place will absolutely get a return call for more business from me no doubt. Happy customer here. I should also add that if you like leftover pizza for the next day, this stuff is legit. Cold or Hot it goes down nicely.
