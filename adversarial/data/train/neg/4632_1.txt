This place used to be customer friendly and the food pretty tasty.  Well, I don't know about the food anymore because the last few times I came in, I waited, and waited, and waited for someone, anyone to take an order.   The people who work here should all be drawing unemployment; GENERALIZING????  Yes, I am because it happens every damn time I walk in the place, they are either mopping, talking, or no one is around except for the cashier.  I don't have 10 minutes to waste standing around watching a menu and not getting any service.  The food is overpriced anyway, if it wasn't for UNLV and the poor starving students who have got to eat, this place would be closed.  And finally, it is filthy....no more wasting my time with Einstein's here.
