Roly Poly is a hidden gem tucked in the middle of a strip of stores in Golden Gate Plaza. There are three things that are great about RP: (1) the service; (2) the food; and (3) the smoothies - mango is ridiculous! Everything is so fresh, and healthy but satisfying. \n\nThere's not a whole lot of seating, but the place doesn't seem to get packed so you can definitely eat in. If you haven't already, check this place out while you're out there shopping.
