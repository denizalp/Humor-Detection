Ellen and I ate a superb lunch for the first time at Nonna Urban Eatery, but certainly not the last. It is one of the very best new additions to Old Town Scottsdale!\n\nShe had the veggie omelette with mozzarella, available only on weekends, and I had the chicken Milanese. Upon arrival at our table, the dishes looked like delicious works of art!\n\nOur superb server was Valentina, co-owner and a smart, enthusiastic dynamo who told us about appealing upcoming additions to their offerings. She is a great spokesperson for Nonna Urban Eatery. The chef and co-owner, Gian Franco Brugaletta, graciously came around to check on our experience. His passion for food was infectious and we were lucky to be among his diners. \n\nIn addition to tantalizing food choices, Nonna's also has a wide selection of beverage choices. Ellen enjoyed their wine, and I enjoyed one of their Arizona-brewed craft beers. \n\nNonna Urban Eatery is warm and inviting. Their food is excellent. Service is terrific. We're looking forward to returning to this gem!
