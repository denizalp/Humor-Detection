Nice place. We were seated after a short wait on the patio. If I remember correctly, they had a water dispenser for those waiting. Place was packed. Seats were OK. Small menu. There wasn't really a combo that did it for me. A lot of good looking food on the daily special list, problem is, you'd have to come that specific day. Today's daily specials were steak and eggs and jalapeño hash thingy. They just ran out of steaks I was told. Made the decision easier. I got jalapeño hash thingy. The food was OK. It was well executed, but nothing jumped out to me as being special, or deserving of the hype.\n\nWould possibly go back if in the neighborhood, more likely if a daily special was one that seemed exciting. I'm not near Matt's and there was nothing here that made it worth the drive.
