AVOID AT ALL COSTS. \n\nI only needed 60 seconds of interaction with two of the employees at this location before I left. \n\nBefore I even entered the building a then unknown to me person, we will call him Employee One, drives up next to me in a MiniVan and asks me what I want. It took me a few seconds to realize he worked there because he was so casual. He told me it I would have to Drop off my car for a flat repair. As I am walking through the doors into the lobby, Employee One feigns running into another older employee in Bay 1 and honks right behind him to scare him. Real Mature. \n\nAs I approach the desk the first thing this genius says to my Girlfriend is \" before I say hello I have to make fun of what you are wearing , Its not cold enough for sweaters and beanies\".... FULL STOP\n\nHe then told us he was from the Northeast and that he went to the gym at 5:30 this morning in a T-shirt and shorts and he was just fine in cold weather. My girlfriend replied that was not a very good way to introduce your self to a customer and he reached over and ripped the keys out of her hand, saying something to the effect \"Now you can't leave\". He then started making fun of the BMW Dolphin that she has a a keyring finder. Its at this point Employee 1 comes in from the garage and sticks his nose back in the picture. He forgot in the 30 seconds since I last talked  to him that I needed a flat repaired. After I told him again why I was there he said , \"Its a BMW, its got run flats and its going to be a nightmare\".\n\nThis is where I had enough. Grabbed my keys back from Employee 2 and left. \n\nI have never seen this level of Juvenile behavior from any auto shop, and that's saying something, cause there are some real poor performers out there. \n \nThis happened around 12:30 PM PST  Sunday, December 11th. Big O Regional Manger- I highly suggest you go back and look at the tapes, if you have audio, review the audio and please FIRE those two \"employees\", I use that term loosely. \n\nBTW I went to another shop and they fixed it free , in 8 minutes. I hope being an idiot was worth it Thing1 and Thing 2. \n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS.
