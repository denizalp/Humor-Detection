Here is the thing.  I really wanted to like this place and I love the location in Scottsdale, but this just really was not to great the night I went.  We came during happy hour on a Thursday and ended up staying quit a while.  The stay was friendly and attentive, no issues there.  It is just little things I could not get past.  For instance the patio, had a lot of bugs including bees and just was not clean.  I don't mean not clean by fine dining standards.  I am strictly talking your basic party\/sports bar cleanliness.  Just very dusty with random junk sitting around.  The other thing was the lack of draft selection.  Nowadays everyone has a good tap selection.  The only beer I recall outside of your basic American lagers was Blue moon served in a plastic \"glass\".  I can't get too mad about that though because the place does seem like a party bar and I could see the reasoning.  The misters were dripping pretty bad as well, so you had to watch out for those.  The last thing I did not understand was why have a jukebox and not let patrons use it.  I was with a decent sized party the night I was there and while the classic rock soundtrack they played did not bother me, I am sure the group would have had a bit more fun if we could have played music.  Had a little bit of food and it was solid no complaints there.  The place has potential and I would love to see it on a packed night because many of the flaws I saw you could probably overlook, but for my visit I'll have to stick to 3 stars and that is being kind because I am a smoker.
