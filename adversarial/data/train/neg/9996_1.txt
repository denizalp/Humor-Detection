The place is an ideal location to grab a snack to munch on the metro on your way to home from work . The fresh sweet cinnamon smell emancipating from the food makes me to buy the pies or the buns every time I take the Atwater metro . The service was very limited, as there were only two cashiers . It was a self service that involves pick your stuff and pay at the counter .
