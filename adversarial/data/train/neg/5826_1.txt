I was disappointed in my Tuxedo Rental from Creative Formalwear.  On the Friday before the Wedding, the delivery of the Tuxedo was late by a couple of hours causing some unnecessary changes in my busy schedule that day.  Also, the Tux was the wrong size and I didn't get a correct size back to me until late the night before my wedding.  To their credit, they did pull it off at the last minute, but all the hassle to get it right made this a bad situation.
