I've been hearing all good things about this spot and I finally had the chance to try it out as I was in the area. \n\nYou do receive an entire pie but it's like a baby pie, so cute! I did not underestimate the size and I was right because after eating the entire thing, I was perfectly stuffed. Not overly full and definitely not hungry at all.\n\nI ordered one of the special pies (Braised Beef and Pulled Pork) but I am definitely returning to try one of the curry ones! They have seats if you want to enjoy your pie while it's fresh.
