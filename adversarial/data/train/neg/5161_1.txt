Terrible experience. Such a disappointment. Horrible customer service. Would give -5 stars if possible. Show was cancelled last minute, and no one bothered to email or notify us. Waited over an hour, only to be met with a sloppy and aggressive performer by the entrance being incredibly inappropriate, unprofessional, rude, unapologetic and offensive towards everyone who was waiting. I'd highly recommend Chippendales instead, your money is much better spent on actual gentlemen who are professional, sweet, and know how to  create a good fun time without being disgusting and misogynistic like the Thunder Down Under guys.
