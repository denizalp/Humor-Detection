Third time's a charm. Well, other two visits were great as well...fondue dippers, $20 pitchers, lettuce wraps...what's not to love??? But seriously...this visit was the best. Great service and the most personable and professional server yet. Food amazing as always! Thank you, Sheriff of Flavortown. You, my friend, rock. See y'all again soon.
