45 minutes to closing time, I'm the only one in here on a Tuesday night and 15 minutes later my salad still hasn't arrived. WTH?\nA simple smokehouse salad. Chicken was dry and the brisket was pretty fatty. Some of the employees seemed more interested in their phones then providing good customer service.
