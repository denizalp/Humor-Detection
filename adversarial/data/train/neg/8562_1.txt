Unlike most of the reviews on here I really enjoy going to this starbucks! Artell is so nice and friendly and always makes conversation. There is a sweet girl here who knows what I want to drink before I get to the counter! They're always really quick when they make their drinks and the drinks always taste delicious. Thanks so much for being an awesome starbucks to visit! I'll keep coming back.
