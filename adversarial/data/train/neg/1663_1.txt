I have had glasses\/contacts for over 30 years and have had my share of optometrists. I cannot say enough positive things about Dr. Waldman. He is so thorough and takes his time explaining things throughout your exam. I had a change in insurance about 10 years ago and he wasn't on my plan - but I still chose to pay out of pocket for his services. Every year I walk out of his office feeling grateful for his expertise. I know that sounds silly and most people don't write reviews about their eye doctor - but he really is one of the best around the Lake County area. Highly recommended!
