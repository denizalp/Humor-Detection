I cannot tell you how much I love staying at the Four Point Sheraton Airport because the staff at Ric's Lounge \"ALWAYS\" are outstanding with their service. A shout out to Amanda, each time we have stayed you not only looked after us but the service was ABOVE AND BEYOND exceptional! My visits to deal with my brothers estate was not the happiest times for me but you always took extra care and even tried to put a smile on my face. Again, GREAT work to the whole team......Well done!
