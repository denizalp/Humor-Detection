I have stayed at the Sheraton twice for business and I'm sad to say I will not be returning. The hotel and its services are pretty good. As an Epic guest I got access to the 7th floor which had free food and drinks and a nice place to hang out or do work. The hotel rooms were decent. The food was pretty good as well. I will not be returning because of the shuttle driver. Not only did he ask for tips which was very unprofessional but he also got angry when the $2 was not enough. Me and a colleague were followed into the lobby and confronted about our $2 tip (which was all the cash we had). He told us that he wanted at least $5 and that we could have taken a cab. Once the incident was over we reported his behavior to the front desk supervisor who apologized an offered us a drink at the bar which we declined. Later that night I called the front desk to make sure the issue was addressed and I wouldn't have trouble taking the shuttle to epic the next morning. I was told by the front desk manager that he spoke to the driver. After a brief awkward pause he said \"I don't know what else you want me to do. I'm not going to fire him.\" \nNeedless to say I will not go back to the Sheraton Madison. Next trip I will stay at a hotel with in walking distance of restaurants so I don't have to deal with depending on a shuttle.
