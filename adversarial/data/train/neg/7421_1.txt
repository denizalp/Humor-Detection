I don't mind Longo's.  It's always a quick trip because the selection isn't as robust as Loblaws, but they have everything you need and they're not crazy busy like most LCL stores.\n\nMy only burr about this particular location is that in the summer they have about 1\/3 of their parking lot fenced off for their garden centre area. And it's not in the back corner either, it's right in the middle of the lot.
