Patrick was awesome. Arrive 10-mins EARLY and did a great job on all the carpets. He was thorough, honest and a genuinely nice guy. Very easy to work with! When I called and left a message to schedule an appointment, my call was returned promptly and even on the weekend. I'm really glad I called on Hydrocare! Great operations and customer service.
