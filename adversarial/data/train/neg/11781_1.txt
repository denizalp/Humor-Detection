Definitely my favorite place for sushi in Charlotte. We've been there a couple of times and are always pleased with our choices & recommendations from the servers. Everything is fresh and delicious. The range of pricing & portions are reasonable. \n\nTiger Shrimp appetizer is a MUST to try if you like spicy food. I have not tried much else that has been cooked but look forward to our next visit.
