This is a must every time we are here.  We love the food!  Anything you order is awesome.  The wait staff is great.  Great diner.  You can order what you want when you want, no matter what time it is.  Huge portions, everyone leaves very full and happy!  If you can go during the middle of the day, your wait isn't as long.
