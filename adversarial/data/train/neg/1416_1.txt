We were in Rio to watch Eddie Griffin in the King's Room, and we thought of having dinner here before the show. Pho in Vegas? I was a bit skeptical since I got used to different pho places in the Bay Area. It was, of course, pricey. What else would you expect to have in Vegas? Their execution looked okay, but there's something missing from the whole bowl. I had to put a lot of stuff in it to get comfy eating it. It was a bit weird of how they took our order, got our money, gave us a number, found our own table, waited for our number to be called, and picked up our own food to bring it to our table. It felt stressful. The whole place was a big confusion to me, but we got our food, ate, and left. I started with three stars since the food was okay, although it was not on the level of my Bay Area experience. So, I finally decided that two stars feels right on the spot.
