An early lunch during Stampede week led my gfs and me here, and even though it was pretty busy but the service and food were not lacking at all! \n\nOne gf started with the tortilla soup and I got to take a few bites - super tasty! The spices weren't too overwhelming and complemented each other really well.\n\nI decided on the crispy chicken sandwich with fries for my main. Granted the coleslaw and the BBQ mustard sauce made my sandwich pretty messy, it was so good! The chicken was crunchy and juicy, and the shoestring fries reminded me of the old Joey Tomatoes ones (which we later learned that LOCAL is actually part of the Joey Restaurant group!)\n\nConsidering this place is literally across the street from my office, I will definitely suggest this place for future after work events or even lunch!
