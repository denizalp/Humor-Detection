The reviews about this place are on point. The food is out of this world good. Worth every minute in line. Everything you're reading here is true. \nMiddle of nowhere, parking is hit or miss, get there early or wait for over an hour like we did. \nFatty brisket is heavenly. The ribs are fall off the bone tender, sausage is full of flavor. And the grits & beans are the perfect compliment to the tender, flavorful meat.  This place is legit. It will ruin you for any other bbq. Be prepared to crave the brisket for days after.
