Went here last night with 3 others, for Summerlicious. Two of us didn't end up ordering off the Summerlicious menu, and just ordered off the regular one. \n\nOur server maybe came to our table twice for the entire 2 hours we spent there, and forgot our bread, but seemed to be interested in every other table around us. The service was far below standard, and was straight up annoying me. I don't know if it was because two of us ordered Summerlicious, but he seemed to be attending to every other table except ours, and it was noticeable amongst all 4 of us.\n\nThe Summerlicious apps were tiny compared to the regular ones, and although at some places this is to be expected, Ciao isn't that fancy shmancy of a place to begin with. The bottle of wine that was suggested to us was a shitty bottle of Chardonnay for $32, after that we stuck to ordering by the glass.\n\nNeedless to say, the food was actually pretty good. Pizza was great, pasta dishes were alright too. Typical Italian, and there is definitely better in the city, but if it weren't for the bad service, I might return. Now I most definitely will not. It's unfortunate when this happens, isn't it?\n\nThe highlight of our meal was the tour bus parked directly outside the restaurant which was rumoured to be Lady Gaga's, so the place was swarming with paparazzi outside which made for good dinner conversation. HAH.
