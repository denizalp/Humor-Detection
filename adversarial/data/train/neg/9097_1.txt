This was my first time getting eyelash extensions. I was a bit apprehensive due to the fact that I am a bit intimidated with \"upscale places\". I always feel \"unworthy\". Just not pretty enough to be at their salon or store, however, upon my arrival at this facility, I was made feel welcome. Theresa did an awsome job on my lashes. I am now looking forward to either permanant eyeliner or eyebrows, can't decide which to do first.... probably eyeliner since I do not know how to do my makeup, this will help me immensley!!! I am very pleased with not just the work, but the customer service that I recieved. I know that I am not pretty, however, the staff made me feel as if I were. Thank you ladies! I will be coming back for certain.
