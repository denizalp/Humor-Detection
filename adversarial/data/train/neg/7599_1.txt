Great location. The staff are really really friendly\nThere is a hot tub and a pool (I LOVE ME some hot-tubbing)\nThe food is aiiiight. \n\nThey upgraded me to a fancy pantsy room (which was totes unnecessary but whatevs I'll take it) \n\nGrabbing a cab is super easy out front and if you want to get a coffee outside the hotel there are a couple of really cute coffee shops right out front.
