Feast buffet Palace Station casino is a great place to eat for the price. The food was good and nothing was unpleasant. The waiter was friendly. The line before entering was long, high, maybe 45 minute wait for lunch.\n\nAs many others have mentioned, you need a Boarding Pass to get the buffet discount. Getting the pass is free, and simple to do. I just handed the agent my ID and she took care of the rest. \n\nEach Boarding Pass will allow you to purchase 2 adult buffets. So if you have a party of 8 adults, four people will need to sign up for the card. Children eat at the discounted rate without needing the cards but I don't know what the cut-ff age is. \n\nSoda is included in the price of the meal. You can upgrade and add beer or wine, I think for an extra $2 (not certain on this - I saw a sign that said '$2' but I didn't read the fine print)\n\nThe pasta station had good food, but I didn't like having to shout my order through a plexiglass window. The ingredients offered aren't even listed anywhere so how are you supposed to know what's available? I ordered pasta with mushrooms, spinach and clams in Alfredo sauce. \n\nAnother good entree item was the Hawaiian BBQ chicken. \n\nDining here will cost you less than dining at McDonald's or Taco Bell. I recommend it for larger groups and families. I even have a picky eater in my family and she ate until she was full.
