The store is nice & clean, the workers are very friendly but doesn't go out of there way to help you. They have a lot of expired dog food & treats. This is my second time here and I thought there will be no more expired stuff. But I was wrong. They seems to be more. Watch out now. Look at the back of the dog food or on the bottom for expiration date.
