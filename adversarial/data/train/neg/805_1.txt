I was very impressed with the service I received last night at this Outback. I have many food allergies and am always hesitant to go out to eat. I explained to my server that I had food allergies and asked if they could accomodate, she understood completely saying that she herself has many food allergies too. She brought me a Gluten-Free menu and I made my adjustments from that.\n\nAfter placing my order the manager came out to ask more specifically how I wanted my food cooked wether it should be cooked on its own, what spices were acceptable and she also offered different options for sauces to which I was able to choose from.\n\nMy food was perfect, I can't complain about anything, they went above and beyond my request and I am so grateful. I never felt like my many requests and substitutions were a burden. I highly recommend the Outback at Southern and McClintock if you have food allergies.
