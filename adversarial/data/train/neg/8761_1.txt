The service in this location is great, everyone is friendly and helpful. I always get a bowl with a tortilla on the side (just in case I decide to make baby burritos on my own). Their barbacoa is my favourite, along with their (surprisingly flavourful!) tofu. Love it so much! And if you're watching your calories, you can always drop your 1000 calorie burrito into half by switching to a salad bowl and skipping some ingredients.
