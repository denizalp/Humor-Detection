I ordered the fiesta burger... Took awhile to make, longer than I thought it should, but hey, if it's a good burger, worth the wait right?  Well, the burger, while decently flavorful, was a little too \"done\" for my taste, and wasn't all that hot when I got it...  Also, the cheese wasn't melted, so who knows if I just got a patty that had been sitting for awhile...  \nOverall a decent burger and good fries, although for a small basket of fries it was almost $2.  Burger was also not quite worth the price in my opinion.  Won't be someplace I intentionally go to unless I happen to be closeby and in need of food.
