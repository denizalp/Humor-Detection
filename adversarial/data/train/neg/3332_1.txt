Can't decide between Chinese and Mexican food? This is your spot! Black beans, jerk fried rice, jade red chicken, pollo Diablo, egg fu yung and chile relleno are all amazing! I love to order the egg fu yung or the chile relleno in a quesadilla, yum! Everything I've tried is great, and I've been going for 20 years or so. Great hangover food!
