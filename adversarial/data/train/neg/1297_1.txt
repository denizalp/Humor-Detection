Coming from Dallas we have lots of great Vietnams restaurants so finding a good one close by was an absolute must, and we most def lucked out with this one. Pho Nam has great food and you can feel the love that goes into the food. The protions are also right for the price. My favorite part the owner is a Feeder, meaning he lives to feed people.
