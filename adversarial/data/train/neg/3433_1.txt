Comfort food at its finest. Reasonable prices. Great portions. My dad is picky and he found a breakfast entree made the way he usually orders. It was called Curtis' Stack. It was biscuits, hash browns, eggs, and meat smothered with gravy. He was a happy boy. Brian and his wife are very friendly and down to earth. This reminds me of home. My stomach belongs to Lou's!
