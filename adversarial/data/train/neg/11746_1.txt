I am very impressed with this place - moreso than I expected to be. \n\nFirst off - for an outlet store it is pretty well organized. Most items are organized by style and then size (as opposed to my biggest pet peeve, by colour).\n\nKeep in mind this is Orfus road so come expecting to check your bags at the door, well-aware that there are no returns and that you will get minimal help on the \"sales floor\". I am happy to say this differs from many Orfus road stores because they actually allow you to try the clothing on before purchasing it. Which might I add, is just ridiculous of the other stores. \n\nCheck out the shoe section - great selection for an outlet store!
