Amazing experience here at Maya! I found them through Yelp because of the awesome reviews and it's nothing short of what they say it is. A hidden gem. Seriously it's hidden lol. I didn't have cash but they let me pay afterwards, and it was 30 bucks for a cut. I get blunt cuts so it's just a matter of follow my line but they were followed along with my meticulous antics and made sure it was perfect. \n\nLove it here and I will be back again. For all my cuts!
