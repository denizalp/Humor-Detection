This bakery has a lot of space to sit down and eat. It's nicely decorated inside as well. They have a lot of buns and baked goods at the back and some hot foods\/drinks at the counter. There is a fridge that has some drinks and cakes as well. \n\nThe selection is reduced drastically when you go later in the day so I recommend going early. They tend to always be out of the white chocolate matcha croissant which is what I've wanted to try for a long time. I finally was able to get my hands on it, having only 1 left. It was flakey and crispy, just how a croissant should be. It has a little hint of matcha and a few spots where you would get a bite of white chocolate. Overall, I had high expectations but it wasn't quite as good as I would have hoped. I also tried the donut. It was good as well. I would probably get it again if I was looking for a quick snack. \n\nOverall this bakery is okay. The service here isn't that great. They don't take credit cards. And the buns are on the pricey side. It is quite convenient to the movie theatre and cheaper than most of the other places to grab a quick bite to eat.
