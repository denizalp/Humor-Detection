My first impression was not a good one. The line to order was about 15 people long, snaking through the dining area. The line to place my order moved incredibly slowly. One lady in front of me took 10 minutes to place her order! As I creeped towards the young lady taking orders, I found out why. She was pleasant, but unnecessarily talkative and  socialized with everyone in the line.\n\nAs I sat and waited for my food, I noted that all of the employees were pleasant and attentive. My fresh squeezed OJ was great, but very pricey. All of the food they brought out looked very good. We ordered 3 crepes, one with chorizo and egg, one with ham, mushrooms, egg and cheese, and a dessert crepe with bananas. All were very good, but not superior to other crepe places I've been to (Flip Happy in Austin, TX is better and they serve theirs faster out of an old Airstream trailer).\n\nWould I go back? Maybe, if I just had to have crepes in Phoenix.
