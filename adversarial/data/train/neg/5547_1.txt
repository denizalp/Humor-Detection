I had an odd experience here...  Nothing was bad.  But it really hurts when you expect to have an extraordinary meal and it falls way short.\n\nThe best thing were the oysters which were so fresh and delicious.  Particularly the West Coast ones.  They are exorbitantly priced by the piece but if you order the \"one-of-each\" you get an assortment at a pretty reasonable price considering Vegas is land-locked.\n\nThe Rhode Island style calamari was great at first: lightly battered, lightly fried, cooked perfectly.  But there was no punch to it.  There were some hot, some sweet peppers, but not enough to really add anything and it really didn't come close to measuring up to expectations--almost like it was tempered to appeal to timid palates.  Also after a minute or 2 it went soggy, I think because it was sitting on a bunch of sauce which sucked it in and bogged it down.  It was a very strange almost instant transformation from a good dish to an average one. \nThe appetizer portion was big enough for 3 or 4 people to share.\n\nNext I ordered the sturgeon.  When it arrived, the runner said \"here's your halibut.\"  The waiter quickly rushed over and said that used to be the prep for the halibut and they switched to sturgeon.  Pardon the pun, but very fishy.  (And it did taste more like halibut than sturgeon.)  The sauce with the fish was FANTASTIC...the best part of the meal next to the oysters.\n\nI should also say the reservationist was unbelievably helpful and accommodating which isn't always the case in Vegas (although I noticed a change for the better overall on this trip: maybe the economic downturn has meant an upturn in customer service.)
