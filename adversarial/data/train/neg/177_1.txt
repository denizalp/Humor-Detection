Red Carpet VIP was extremely professional, prompt, and an awesome service all around.  We worked with Terry and Kelvie, who were on top of our reservations.  They helped me map out a great night at a club that suits my group...XS and it was awesome!  We walked passed all the suckers in line and also got a follow up call if everything turned out okay.  I will always use Red Carpet when I visit Vegas.  \n\nRecommend if...\nA) You'd rather holler at hoodrats WHILE you're drinking instead of in line.  \nB) You're a group of guys that's more than 3...because it's tough to get in a real club with a pack of dudes.  \nC) You're from out of town, in which they'll recommend the best spot for you.
