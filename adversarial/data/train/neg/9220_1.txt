Convenient little pizza joint for those who live around the Horizon Ridge area. It isn't the absolute BEST pizza, but the quality is still pretty good here.\n\nI usually opt for the classic pepperoni pizza and some wings. Pizza usually comes out quickly and the staff is friendly.\n\nSometimes when I don't feel like driving, I call in for delivery and usually the pizza comes in hot!\n\nQuick delivery, hot pizza, friendly staff!
