We went for dinner with 2 other people and my husband can't wait to go back.  Service was awesome and food was delicious.  My son said the sushi was way better than the sushi at that popular spot at Chandler Mall.  My husband had oysters and salmon.  He loved both dishes.  I had the pulled pork sandwich which was yummy and flavorful, but so soggy I had to eat it with a fork.  The crispy fries were wonderful.  As for the service, I think our server was Omar and he could not have been better.  Friendly, helpful and everything a server should be.  My husband spilled his Manhatton about two sips in and Omar was there immediately to clean up the mess and replace the drink.   Open since March, and not yet that busy.  We will be going back!
