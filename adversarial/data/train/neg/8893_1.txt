My dog has anxiety every time she goes to the groomer and it breaks my heart when I see her sad puppy eyes. Having just moved to Cleveland it was difficult for me to choose a new groomer for her. Paws and Effects was recommended to me by a relative and the employee who took my appointment immediately put me at ease! They listened carefully to what I wanted for Annabelle (my dog) and even recommended a new vet for me! She will continue to go here because I feel comfortable leaving her in their care. They are more affordable than your chain pet store. Only negative for me is it took longer than I expected.
