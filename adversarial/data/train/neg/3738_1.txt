I came with friends and family under the recommendation of my (Persian) friend. This is not a fancy restaurant. It's a storefront restaurant in a strip mall and the decor is plain and functional. So, don't come here for ambiance. But DO come for the food, the friendly staff, and the price too. These people know what they are doing. The food is good, well portioned and decently priced.\n\nThe eggplant dish was AMAZING. Pomegranate beef was succulent, but perhaps a bit too sour for me. The bean soup superb and the standards of Koobideh and Soultani Kebabs were juicy. I couldn't finish my dish, but likely that's because I was tasting from other peoples plates.
