This place is awesome!!! Sweet dough has donuts, muffins, breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches. Staff is super friendly. This is just the kind of place Fort Mill needs, local and family owned. Shop is very bright and open. My son loved being able to see the donuts be made. I can't wait to try more of what they offer
