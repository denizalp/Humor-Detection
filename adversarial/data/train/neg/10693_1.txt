This whole office has been great, my son is 2 but they are patient and kind. And I can tell there are some mothers in that office just how they work with them. Kendall was especially kind to get my son in so quickly, understanding that I was worried but it wasn't really an emergency. But she got me in right away. The dentist, Dr. Whelan did some beautiful work on my sons teeth today! The front desk staff is also wonderful and you can tell the morale is amazing amongst the staff members, which always makes a difference to me! They are 50 mins away from me but the piece of mind is just worth it for me! Happy I found them for my kids!
