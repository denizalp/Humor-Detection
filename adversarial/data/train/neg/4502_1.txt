Nice place for sandwiches and beer with patio seating. Inside is very noisy. I guess because it's an old house it's not designed for loud bass music. So you really have to talk loud to hear each other if you seat inside.\n\nThe patio is really nice and they have good service. They share the parking with the other business next to them, but never had a problem for parking.
