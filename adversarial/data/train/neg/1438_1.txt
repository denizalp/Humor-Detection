I sooo wanted to love this place and have visited them frequently and each time I am somewhat disappointed in the taste of their products. I have had some outstanding desserts and this place just does not cut it for me. Maybe it's the cold cake. I do not like cold cake.  Maybe it's the whipped cream icing.  Whipped creamed icing on a homemade bakery cake to me says lazy. I think it just ruins the cake. They do have a lot of good reviews but I guess it just depends on where people have eaten..I am in no way a food connoisseur, but I know good food when I taste it.
