Stopped in after a day of golf. Waitress was prompt and got our beer order to us quickly. Football was on the tv which was why we came in. Food was good and selection of beers was above normal. Atmosphere was excellent. The Venetian sandwich ordered by a friend said it was excellent. I had the fish tacos which were average. All in all good place to go.
