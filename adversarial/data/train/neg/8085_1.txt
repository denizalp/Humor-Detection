Moe's is very average food. There isn't anything that stands out and falls behind similar places-Qdoba, Chipotle etc. \n\nThe food was fresh and tasted alright, but was nothing special. The burritos are on the smaller end and has smaller portions inside the burrito.\n\nMy biggest problem was the value. There is NO way a burrito of that size with that little rice, beans, meat should cost over $7.50 for an original size. I've had bigger and better burritos that cost around $5. A small soda for $2.50 is also a bit much (free refills).\n\nWith each order you do get chips and salsa. I really liked the chips. Salsa was okay.\n\nOne other thing that baffled me. My wife ordered a Triple Lindy burrito in a bowl. You get this in a white box. When you try to throw it away, you can't fit the box in the trash can as the top is configured in a weird way. Good thinking.....\n\nI was amused by the name of the Burritos-Homewrecker, Art Vandelay etc. Good stuff!\n\nMoe's won't be high on list to go back to around Jobing.com for me. There are other places that are better.\n\n2.5
