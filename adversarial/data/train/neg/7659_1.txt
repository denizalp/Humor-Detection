HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! I was visiting and i came to get 1 nail fixed it took almost 2 hrs and i had to change nail techs first of all the first person who did my nails shouldn't be doing nails at all her drill was jumping she didn't let let the acrylic harden before filing it it was all flimsy and soft she didn't know how to even paint my nails it was a mess there was gel polish and crylic all under my nail and all on the side of my one nail the tech that fixed my nail did better but it still wasn't right it was a horrible mess and absolute bad first impression i left super upset I wanted to cry like i was really really mad and i still had to pay like what??!!? No way! Never again!\n\n\n\n\nBtw since she wants to write back and lie I have Receipts as well and Uber trips with the time as well and I had not to mention a reservation I was late for I was ther 2 1\/2 hrs !!!! For one freaking nail they hire anybody she wasn't licensed at all she never did a nail ever trust me I wish I had my friend record it it was so embarrassing and horrible because she was just a mess lmao it's okay though I went somewhere else and paid them top dollar for a fix and it took 2 mins to do LITERALLY! Only 2 mins. Get it together your shop is pathetic and you guys don't know what your doing at all!
