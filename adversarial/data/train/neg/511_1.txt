I have had the pleasure of working with Nathan on numerous transactions and I have to say, he is one of the most professional Realtors in Arizona. Not only does he know his craft but he treats his clients as if they were his own family. He takes the time to explain every step during the home buying process and keeps his clients' best interests in mind. If you want a true professional from first consultation to close (and beyond for that matter) give Nathan a call.
