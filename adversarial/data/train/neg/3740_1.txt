This restaurant is, by far, the slowest place in the area.  From the time I walked in to the time I left with my food was 40 minutes.  Drive thru NEVER get's any order right.  Neither do the counters.  The people taking orders seem more interested in their phones than in the people trying to order.  Avoid at ALL COSTS!
