This was the first time I'd tried rolled ice cream.  I was impressed by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff.  I loved that it's made to order of natural ingredients.  They have a great selection of toppings and add in items, pretty much anything you'd want.  There is also a list of suggested combinations if you aren't feeling too creative.  Parking isn't easy, it's metered on the street.  But, the ice cream is worth finding a spot!
