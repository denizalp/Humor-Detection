I've had a hard time finding the right hair stylist since moving here from Europe via California and walked in with a golden\/orange tint and let Candy work her magic on my Scandinavian hair. I couldn't believe the transformation, she turned it into different shades of Champagne blonde that I had always wanted but apparently not been able to describe, that suited my skin tone perfect! I booked my next appointment before leaving, fantastic salon!
