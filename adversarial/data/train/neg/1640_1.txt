Let me first say that I very rarely write reviews. After researching gun safes on the internet for a couple months, I was finally ready to make a purchase. As this was my first gun safe, I wanted to make sure I got what I needed. I checked what the local big-box stores had to offer, and was left very unimpressed by the quality of the safes offered. I found an ad for The Safe Keeper on craigslist but kept putting it off as I figured they would be overpriced. I finally went in about a week ago after exhausting all other options, and I must say that I was very wrong in assuming things. I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of pressure from anyone in the store to purchase a safe. And their prices were very reasonable. Eugene took the time to answer all my questions and show me my options. He should definitely be given a raise. I found a safe that I liked, and told Eugene I would make a decision and be back. After another week of internet research and talking with people, and checking out what a couple other places had to offer, I ended up back at The Safe Keeper. This time I spoke with an older gentleman, (the owner, I think), and he was just as pleasant as Eugene. I told him I'd found another brand safe elsewhere and asked for his opinion. Surprisingly, he gave me an honest opinion and told me that it was also a good quality safe. In the end, I purchased my new safe from The Safe Keeper and couldn't be happier. Kudos to the entire crew there. I will definitely refer any friends to them. Thank you.
