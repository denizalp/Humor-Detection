My husband and I were so excited to try this place. We don't have super hip restaurants in this area so we eagerly awaited their opening and gave them about a month to really settle in before we went. The decor is beautiful and hip. The food, unfortunately,  just didn't live up to the rest. We started with the Ahi Poke appetizer and shared one of the chopped salads. The Ahi was good...just a little lack luster for the price and the chopped salad was pretty bland. My husband had the Fire Braised Short Rib and I opted for the Braised Beef Ravioli. His dinner was pretty tasty. I think I ate more of his than my own. The ravioli was so disappointing. I've never had ravioli that I needed to cut with a knife before. It was just dried out and chewy. I ate two of them and then just gave up. I was hoping the manager would be walking around. I'm happy to give my feedback, especially for a new restaurant. That never happened and the waitress didn't seem to care that I barely touched my food. Overall it was just OK. There are many really good restaurants, especially at this price point, that just get it right. SHOOT...there are many below this price point that I would prefer to go to. At the end of the day we will try them again, in maybe 6 months or so. Hopefully they will take the feedback offered to them and make some adjustments.
