I've been here for dinner, happy hours, and the Wednesday special and enjoyed it every single time. \n\nThis is one of my top go to's for happy hour.  They have regular happy hour from 4-7pm and reverse happy hour from 10pm-2am on weekends.  The happy hour menu is extensive (albeit the dishes are small, kind of like tapas).  My favorites are the chicken wings, fried calamari, crispy chick peas, and barbecue ribs.  The burger is good if you want something more filling. But I've tried pretty much everything on the happy hour menu and liked it.  The cocktails here are delicious, not too sweet.  Off their regular menu I like the steak and frites and their tacos.  Their $22 3-course meal on Wednesdays is an awesome deal and I highly recommend it! Their molten chocolate cake is to die for (apple cobbler also delicious).\n\nBesides the food, I love the ambiance here.  The outside patio is a must on warm summer nights. Open air, plenty of seats, and a covered area if its raining.  They also opened a new bar\/lounge area upstairs that's a nice place to hangout during happy hour or to grab drinks.  The owner is super friendly and frequently makes rounds checking on how everyone's doing.  The service here is great and everyone is friendly and helpful. Check it out!
