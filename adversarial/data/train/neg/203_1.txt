For my first breakfast in Montreal I searched Yelp for a location not too far from my hotel. Based on the stellar reviews I headed over to this cafe. The wait to order was about 15 minutes but being on vacation and not in a rush the wait didn't bother me. So when I was finally able to order I ordered 2 cafe au laits, a bagel with cream cheese and a bagel with egg, cheese and bacon. The bagel with cream cheese came out just fine, however the bagel for the bagel, egg, cheese and bacon was burnt. Literally, black. So I asked for another and that one was also burnt but more dark brown with a few areas of black. As I don't like to complain, I ate it, picking off the black burnt parts of the bagel. The egg, cheese and bacon were all excellent but I'm confused as to why my bagel was burnt, twice. My bill was $16 for 2 coffees and bagel sandwiches. Yelp let me down with this place. The cafes were just ok.
