The food was ok, not great. I mistakenly assumed that for $36 The goblet was included, and that was my fault. Although we were able to purchase it for an additonal $14, we politely declined.  We came here expecting to pay Vegas prices. The $2 water charge was one thing, but when I ordered two chocolate milks for my six and three year old daughters and saw the bill for $6.49 EACH!  That's not even Vegas prices, that's just CRAZY!  I will never go back to this place again.
