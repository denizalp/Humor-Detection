I brought my car in for the monsoon special advertised (oil change, new wipers, tire rotation). When I arrived later to pick up my vehicle I was informed that they had broken one of my lug nuts during the rotation. The lug nut was in good condition prior ( the gentleman working there, Chris Carrillo, even said it was and was surprised it broke), so I'm thinking it broke due to ineptitude or maybe it just happens. Either way, the customer service and the way in which the staff conducted themselves is inexcusable. I wasn't contacted when the lug nut broke and had they actually had one in stock, would they even have told me it happened? Upon returning the next day I was greeted with attitude when I explained I was here for a replacement lug nut that had been broken yesterday when having my car serviced. Here I am, inconvenienced and wasting another hour to hour and half getting this sorted out because I was told that's how long it takes to replace one lug nut. I don't even know if they actually changed the oil in my vehicle because there was no sticker indicating they did and when the vehicle is due for another. After all of this, I will be taking my car to the dealership and having them inspect the tire and make sure everything was properly installed and there was no stripping when the nut broke. Unprofessional staff and low quality service. I know that it's nice to save a little money, just remember you get what you pay for.
