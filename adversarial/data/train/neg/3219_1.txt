I've been taking my car here for several years now and have never been anything less than satisfied. My landlady recommended them, and Mark has even come to the house when her car hasn't started. The guys don't treat me differently because I'm a woman, and the prices are always fair. I have never felt like I've been ripped off and definitely feel they are extremely trustworthy. I stopped here recently with a bolt in my tire. Gene took it out free of charge within a minute of my pulling in and gave my tire the all-clear. I highly recommend them.
