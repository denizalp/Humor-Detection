I love how this is walking distance from where I live. The workers are so nice, especially the first time I was there. The guy offered me so much flavors that I could try, even asked around to see what their favorite flavor is. He told me what was popular, that you can have up to 3 flavors, and just really informed me about the place. Now, it's one of my go-to places for desserts. Even if it's 30 degrees outside, I'm still craving a Bahama Rama Mama! Plus, you get more stamps on your card the colder it is outside, haha. :) \nI think the price is very reasonable considering you get what you paid for.\nOverall, just love this place. Take my money!
