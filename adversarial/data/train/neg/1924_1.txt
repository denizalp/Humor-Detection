I have been shopping at the Danforth location for a number of years now. Prices are often cheaper than your local grocery store (and way cheaper than other \"boutique\" health food stores), and can be made even more of a bargain by buying by the case (e.g. rice pasta, almond milk). It is not a one-stop shop, but it carries a wide range of items, some of which are hard to find elsewhere, and often at better prices. Staff are a little more laid back than I'd like, but they are generally helpful if you approach them.
