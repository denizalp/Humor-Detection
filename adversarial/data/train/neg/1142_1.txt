If I were to base this solely on the massage experience, it would be a 5! Sarah was AH freakin' MAZING! We will never go anywhere else in Vegas to get a massage and will personally request her. My husband and I were celebrating our 1 yr wedding anniversary and wanted to start our day off with a massage. We did the \"Couples Paint Party\" and wow is all we can say to describe the experience! We did the body scrub and mud painting on each other in the very private steam room with the attached shower area while enjoying complimentary champagne for an hour. We then moved into the massage area of the room and waited for our therapists. We left there feeling more connected, relaxed and rejuvenated, which was the perfect start to the rest of our romantic evening. The only reason for the 4 stars is the robe I changed into didn't smell super fresh and there were 2 maintenance men who walked through a couple of times in the relaxation area which wasn't super private and made me feel a little uncomfortable. Almost like I was on display in my bathrobe. I would have preferred if they either did their work in off hours or had a different way to walk that would bypass the relaxation area. If you can get past that, I would (and already have) recommended Well Spa!
