I've walked by numerous times and never went in as it was busy and I didn't have time to wait. \nI'm really happy I did go in this time!! Super friendly and really clean.  The barber I got was very attentive to detail and really listened to my requests. A tiny bit on the pricey side but life has gotten expensive. I'd totally go there again. Thoroughly impressed. Thanks for the great cut!!
