Inside the Paris Hotel (7am-11pm)\nSelection of savory or sweet crepes\nGood value for light meal ($9-$12) given location\nMade to order, relatively quick service but backs up easily if long line\n\nStayed at the Paris Hotel for about a week and my final recommendations are \n-Roasted chicken for savory: very good, chicken was prepped well and not dry\n-Blueberry Lemon for dessert: blueberries were sweet and the lemon accented the flavor, not overwhelmed it
