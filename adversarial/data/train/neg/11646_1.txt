Outstanding Product and speedy Installation.  Clark's guys came on time \nand not only installed our windows with the Solar Screens but added a screen for our rear French Doors that now allows us to better air out the house.  He has a lot of experience in this area and seems very committed\nto a professional type installation.  The demo he did with the hair dryer was amazing--shows how effective the material is at blocking the heat.\nOh another interesting fact--He works along side his crew--Not the vanishing owner type.
