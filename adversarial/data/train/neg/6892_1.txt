Very clean and brightly lit place. Service was somewhat negligent but friendly - I had two girls helping me. One was texting on her phone for 5 minutes before she noticed I had no menu or wafer. I actually had to ask for water as I wasn't given any. Service did get better when her colleague stepped in. The second server was the opposite of the first server - very attentive and filled up my water every time it was half full. The first server came back around again by the time I was ready to pay. It actually took another customer to let her know that I was ready to pay. So...all in all, not terrible service but service as a whole needs to be more attentive. \n\nThe food was pretty good. I got the seafood base rice cakes with ros√© sauce and ramen noodles. It was very filling! I also ended up getting the veggie fritters and they were good as well. Since I was starving when I came in, I ended up finishing everything! \n\nThe restaurant also serves shaved ice, which is interesting, considering how it is usually dessert-type restaurants that serve shaved ice. Then again, Go Topoki specializes in serving customized rice cakes so the shaved ice for dessert shouldn't be something that is super surprising. \n\nOverall, clean, unique place and I really liked the Korean\/Italian fusion concept of serving customized rice cakes with pasta sauces.
