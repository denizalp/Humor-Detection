I come here fairly often since I live within walking distance, 9 times out of 10 the staff is very rude unless they know you. Last time the woman taking my order (or pretending to) was talking to an old friend about getting old and moving to ca. She was so distracted that she didn't realize the other girl had already taken my order and she only needed to ring me up. As she did she continued talking to her friend and didn't say a single word to me. I find this extremely rude and it's the kind of service I get there almost every time. They have great food and coffee but I dnt go there often because I dread the service. It's great that they're friendly with half of there customers but the other half of us find it not so wonderful. If it changed, I would be there everyday.
