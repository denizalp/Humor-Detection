Good Chinese take out and also dine inn. I ordered a full serving of orange chicken which was A huge plate of orange chicken with some broccoli on the side and a separate big plate or rice. This order could feed two adults, and possibly 2 adults and a child depending. Huge portion for only $6.95 and also tasted very good. They also give won ton chips with sweet sour sauce for free if you dine in which was interesting. Service  was great as well.
