Small theater kinda old school. Lots of places close by to grab a bite. If you're looking for a new modern theater with comfortable recliners this isn't it. But if you're looking for hard to find films everyone isn't playing this is the hidden gem where you'll find them. Foreign films, documentaries, smaller hits the other theaters aren't running, classics. This is a cool theater for the variety it offers.
