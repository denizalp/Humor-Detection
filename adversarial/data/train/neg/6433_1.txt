We just went to this escape room with 4 people in our group and it was amazing! We went to other escape rooms as well but this one was our favorite. We tried The Collector. I would definitely recommend going with a bigger group because this was the hardest room! We were the first group to try this room(literally finished the room two minutes before we showed up) and although we did not make it, the two guys running the room were very helpful with guiding us. I would 10\/10 recommend this place. They are very accommodating and the staff was super friendly!
