I've been going to the E&H uptown location for almost 15 years. In that time I've had exception al care from the previous staff (John Metz, Lisa Battat) but the place has recently seen some changes.  At the end of my recent annual standard eye exam I was informed that the Optometrist charged the visit to my medical insurance instead of my Vision insurance. My annual eye exam that is covered under my vision insurance now cost me almost $100 in co-pay fees. The front desk told me the OD indicated this was a visit for a medical condition thus it was submitted to my health insurance. There was no mention of any medical condition, it was just a standard visit to get new RX for glasses. I've called the office several times asking for clarification on the billing only to be told someone would get back to me. I gave up after two weeks. The visit summary I was given included a supposed discussion the OD had with me that never happened. Some shady billing\/insurance issues going on.
