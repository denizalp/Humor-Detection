After work and before class, I faxed an order to Stir Fry for carry-out.  After calling to verify receipt of the order, I was informed that they had not received my fax.  So I placed my order over the phone.\n\nI ordered the BBQ Thai Noodles and my co-worker ordered the Sesame Chicken dish.  The noodles in my dish were very thick, almost too thick to pick up and they definitely took some effort to chew threw.  It was like ultra-thick spaghetti.  The flavor was good and the quality of the ingredients seemed good too.  My co-worker said his chicken was bland and the overall dish was so-so.\n\nI give three stars because I had high expectations for this place.  My expectations were not met.  Would I go again?  Probably.  But if the next dish is just average, like the BBQ Thai Noodles, it would probably be my last trip.  $24 for two dishes and a coke to-go.\n\nOn the fence.
