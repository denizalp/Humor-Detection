The service provided was great. I love that the staff is friendly and attentive.\n\nThe space emulates a coffee shop vibe. There's plenty of space for you and your laptop here. The decor is very minimal, yet contemporary.\n\nThe Blueberry Latte tasted like a blueberry pur√©e with cream. It was topped with whipped cream and blueberries. It's super simple that it was not enough to justify the drive. \n\nThe Bread Box reminds me of their take on honey toast, only in smaller pieces (or boxes). The bread's exterior was too toasty. It was hard to enjoy. (Pun intended)\n\nOverall, it was cool to check it out, but based on value and quality, I wont be going back.
