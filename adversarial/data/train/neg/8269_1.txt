Descriptions led me to think this was going to be on the casual side but turned out very nice, but not stuffy! We brought in a magnum of wine from 1994 to celebrate a 21 year birthday and the corkage fee was only $30. Sommelier was wonderful and decanted the bottle as the cork was a bit soft. Our waiter was right there when we needed him. Food was superb - our group of nine ordered quite a variety and shared. We tasted the wonderful artichoke pasta, macaroni, crispy chicken biscuits, shrimp ceasar salad,and of course, waffles and fried chicken with spiced watermelon! How do we get them to open one in northern California??\nLocation right inside the Venetian
