The decor if this restaurant is very beautiful! You get a view of the strip because there is an open seating area that everyone in the restaurant gets a view of. I was hungover here when I came here so I did not order a drink but I think $32 for a drink is pricey and they all looked like they would give me a bad headache because of all of the sugar. So I ordered a hot chocolate and for a place that is named sugar it was not sweet at all. To eat I orders the ham croissant with potatoes and got an egg on top! The food was out of this world good so I am glad I ordered that. My sister on the other hand got a crepe and it was horrible because they put all the toppings on top and not inside the crepe and it got chewy really fast pretty disgusting so that's why they get three stars it was just ok.
