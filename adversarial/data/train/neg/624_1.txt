I went to L&H, last Saturday to get a tattoo of my daughter's name touched up, unfortunately the person who did it last did a really crappy job. After a brief discussion it was suggested to cover up my tattoo and just get her name somewhere else. They offered me soda and made my time there comfortable. The end results are Great!! you can't even tell the other design was their before. Goeke did my tattoo, free-handed it, asked me if I was okay with the sensitive parts because of the area it was it, and made it within the price range I asked while making it the size I wanted. AW-SOME JOB!! ;) I will definitely be going there for my next one after this ones heals. Word of wisdom if you can not handle pain DO NOT get a tattoo in-between the crack of your hand and wrist.  Thanks Goeke. =D
