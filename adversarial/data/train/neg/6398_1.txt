I have been coming here since the original one opened in Westlake  and the brothers were running it themselves.  I love that the quality has not changed and what passed for a chocolate chip....well it does come close the never eat anything bigger than your head rule.  I find the staff to be friendly no matter what time or day I am in and the ice cream cakes and pies are really a good deal.  They will gladly work with you regarding any changes you may need to make.\n\nLove the parfaits and the pina-colada  smoothie.  \n\nI love Malleys too, but sometimes you just gotta have a good homemade ice cream with good toppings.
