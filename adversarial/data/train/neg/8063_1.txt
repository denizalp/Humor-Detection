Came here for the jazz, not the food.  There was a $10 cover on a Monday night, but since we wanted entertainment on our vacation we were OK with that.  The band was great and we thoroughly enjoyed our night out.  The food wasn't great.  We did not order their 'specialties' and instead had potato skins, a salad, and caramel explosion dessert.  The potato skins were cheesy, but not great and the salad was a simple salad.  Dessert was good though with a fun presentation.  Come here for the jazz, not the food.
