I'm in town for work and needed some cool 70's clothes for a shoot this weekend at home.  I went in and was looking around and the clerk immediately came up to see if I needed help. I told her what I needed and she picked out some great pieces.  \n\nThis is a tiny shop and compared to what we have in Atlanta, but it was a very cool place and I will definitely come back when I'm back in town.
