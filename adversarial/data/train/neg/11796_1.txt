Extremely disappointing.  She has no respect for people's time.  I made an appointment weeks in advance and was told to arrive 15 minutes early.  I did.  I was told to print out and fill out the many pages of paperwork before I arrived in the office.  I did.  I was then forced to wait 45 minutes and was told by 2 different staff members that she was out to lunch.  I was going to be a new patient, so you would think that she would want to put her best foot forward at our first meeting and at least keep the appointment time I had scheduled with her office.  When she finally wandered in, she never even apologized.  Just because she's a doctor does not mean that her time is more important than mine.  I was furious and left.  I will not be her new patient and will not recommend her to anyone else.
