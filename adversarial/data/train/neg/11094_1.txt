Things weren't up to par last night. We had a reservation, but the 4 people checking in folks were flummoxed by the two groups in front of us without reservations and by answering the telephones. We had to wait. And wait and wait. The food was good for the most part. The dim sum pork belly was not. The dough was oddly chewy. Service was forgetful and rushed. They should turn down the background music. The noise level was jarring.
