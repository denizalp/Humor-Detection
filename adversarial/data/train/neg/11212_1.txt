Came in to meet a friend for breakfast and this is a nice, hometown country feeling place. Made me forget I was in Vegas for a second with all of the knick knacks and decor. Lou's has a good menu selection, tasty, generously sized portions and fair prices. Popular, busy local diner with lots of friendly wait staff.
