Not a bad buffet by any means. I always recommend Vegas buffets in general for \"foodie\" types. If you like seafood, sushi, or \"gourmet\" flavors, you can get your money's worth at this buffet. The other choices are slightly above average home cooking and didn't blow my mind. The carving stations didn't have people at them most of the time. The customer service was lacking and it just isn't the grand buffet I've heard stories about. \n\nThe desserts were just okay. Pretty much a repeat of all the other Vegas buffets. To sum it up, there's nothing that makes this buffet stand out above all the others, other than their Coca Cola machine where you can choose from 100 flavors. You serve yourself for both drinks and food, which I prefer. I don't appreciate being interrupted all the time for refills when I can just get my drink myself. The food wasn't changed out regularly enough. We stayed past 4 when they swapped over to dinner, and bread wasn't refilled for at least 30 minutes. I could attribute this to us visiting on a week day, but they seemed fairly busy. Again, not terrible, but it could have been better. \n\nI mostly sampled pasta selections and they were decent. I just wasn't blown away. I would recommend paying the same price and visiting the Wynn or Bacchanal which both have a better atmosphere and better customer service.
