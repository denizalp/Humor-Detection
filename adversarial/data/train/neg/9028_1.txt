Went there on a Monday evening. Not too busy. We were seated quickly. Service was excellent. They brought out a variety of warm rolls, they were delicious. If you have their players card you got a discount on the meal. We ordered the Cesar salad and 16 oz prime rib. It was cooked perfectly medium rare. The prime rib was tender and delicious. With the discount the prime rib by it self only cost 35.00 well worth the cost. Can't wait to come back to Las Vegas. Will definitely eat here again.
