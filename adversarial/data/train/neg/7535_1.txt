Stopped in for breakfast\/brunch, which was nice to find a decent place with great ambience open at 9:45 in the morning! The vibe is 5 star... you can feel Guy's touch and presence about...from the thirsty themed napkins to the way the silverware is laid out. Food has Guy's traditional 'pile it on thick and messy' flair, but that's why I give it 4\/5. My eggs-over-easy, cheesy, guacamole covered tortilla chips got a bit soggy as I ate through them, but I KNEW that was going to happen going in! Right!?! And my husband's mac and cheese burger suffered a similar fate! That being said, I'd go back again in a heartbeat! Give it a go!
