The employees at wild nails are extremely kind and friendly. I have gone to wild nails twice and both times I have loved my nails. They do fantastic gels. They give massages with all mani and pedi, which feels great. The owner is also great, my friends did not like how her nails came out, she went a week later and he redid them for free and they looked great.
