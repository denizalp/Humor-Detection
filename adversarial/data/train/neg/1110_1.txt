After doing some research on car dealerships in the area, with hopes of trading in my car that I was under on, and knew would be hard to get rid of....this place made the transition easy, smooth and as easy as renting a Redbox movie.... Their car salesman Junior was on point with details and getting me the best interest rate on a new loan, and helping figure out which car would be the best option for me. This will be the only place I go for the upkeeping of my car as they have tons of resources for whatever car needs you may have! Ask for Junior!!! He is the homie! \n\nThanks LVAS!
