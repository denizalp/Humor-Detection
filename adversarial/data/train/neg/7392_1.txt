My girlfriend and I were staying at Vdara and wanted to get a get a nice dinner within walking distance.  We didn't have reservations and were walking around the Crystals shopping center, just taking a gander at each restaurant's menus.  Although Mastro's Ocean Club has received some glittering reviews; the menu didn't seem to speak to our palettes (or stomachs) on that particular evening.  We then settled on Beso (and it was the first place we walked past).  \n\nThey had us sit at the bar while our table was being readied, and so sipped on cocktails while we waited.  No more than 10 minutes later, we were brought to our table, which was pretty good given that it was Friday night and we didn't have any reservations.  \n\nWe started off with the chips\/guac and the steamed mussels.  Both were perfectly fine.  I had the petit filet with sides of grilled shrimp and the jalapeno creamed corn.  My girlfriend had the ahi tuna adobo.  My only gripe is when I say \"medium\", I like it to be very pink, but not bloody.  I'd have to say that the filet was closer to \"medium well.\"  I will say however that the jalapeno creamed corn is quite delicious.  \n\nThe final bill (including a couple of cocktails) ended up around $170 (tax\/tip included).  Normally, with such a steep price, and what we got, we're looking at 3'ish stars.  HOWEVER......\n\nKEN JEONG SHOWED UP!!! Dr. Ken, aka \"Leslie Chow\" of the Hangover fame, was there celebrating a private party with some friends.  He could not have been more generous and gracious when essentially the entire restaurant got in line to take pictures with him.  \n\nTHAT was a freaking awesome Vegas memory!  Hence, FOUR STARS!
