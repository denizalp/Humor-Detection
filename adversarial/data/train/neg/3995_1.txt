Green catered my anniversary party recently. I was happy that we were able to offer a vegetarian meal that my whole family could enjoy. I love to eat at the Tempe location whenever I'm in town visiting. \n\nA couple downsides for the event catering was that they provided the plates, and we quickly ran out during appetizers. Luckily my Dad was wiling to run out and grab some, but of course he brought back styrofoam instead of the compostable plates I would have preferred. But really he had no options on such short notice. \n\nThe other downside was that the sauces for the chicken wing and the salad were not labeled, so there was some confusion on our guests part as to what sauce went with what. \n\nBut overall, Green delivered a tasty meal.
