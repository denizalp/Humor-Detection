This place is pretty good. A nice interior design, really helpful and nice staff plus delicious food.\n\nReally, my only gripe, is that it's no different than the other 10 places that sell sushi burritos within a half mile of here. Because the location of this place isn't very prominent, I would highly recommend to this place that they come up with a niche to set themselves apart. Maybe offer a roll no one else is doing. Everyone is doing bowls and burritos. How about a burrito that's \"enchilada style\" smothered in a spicy mayo with roe or something unique like that?
