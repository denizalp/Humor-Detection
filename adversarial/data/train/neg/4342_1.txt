Definitely the worst gel manicure I've had. The technician didn't even bother to scrape all of the old gel off, didn't soak my cuticles or push them back, and when i pointed out several times that there was something wrong with one of them, she ignored me. I've never broken a nail within 2 weeks of a gel manicure, and I've broken 3 within a week of this botched job, and most of the other nails have gel pulling up at the edges.\n\nWon't be wasting my money here anymore.
