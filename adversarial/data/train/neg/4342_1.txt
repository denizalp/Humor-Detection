Of all the build your own\/quick cook pizza places I've been to Fired Pie is my favorite. I've been to multiple locations and the food is always consistently good.\n\nI usually order a pizza but their salads are fantastic as well. The ingredients are quality and tasty. Can't beat a yummy pizza for less than $9 and I always have leftovers.\n\nThis location is right by ASU and a lot of offices so it can have a pretty big lunch rush. They keep things moving along pretty quickly. The dining area is open and spacious.
