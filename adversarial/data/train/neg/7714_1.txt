I loved my experience at 800 Degrees! I went there Tuesday for lunch and I was recommended the Carni. My pizza was made by Yoselin and you can tell she takes great pride in her work! The pizza was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing! Overall, great establishment, everything looked nice and fresh. 800 Degrees will absolutely be my go to spot every time I am in Vegas!
