The Strip in Pittsburgh is awesome. Lots of vendors out on the street selling everything from clothes to souvenirs to Steelers merchandise. And it was all inexpensive!\n\nThe farmer's market was awesome and had unbeatable prices. If only I didn't have a 5-hour drive home, I would have bought a lot! \n\nFor fans of anything Pittsburgh...go to the Strip to get loaded up with gear!!\n\nVisited October 2014
