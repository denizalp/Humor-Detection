Fantastic shawarma with all the fixin's! Garlic sauce is super delicious and the garnishes are very fresh! My wife and daughter love the donairs with the sweet sauce! Jimmy is awesome and funny! They really look after their customers and seriously they want you to have fun in the line up which can be long during lunch or dinner, but trust me it's worth the wait! I read a review from someone who said they thought the food was flavourless all I have to know is does that person use dog poop as toothpaste? It is delicious, do yourself a favour and go try it!!
