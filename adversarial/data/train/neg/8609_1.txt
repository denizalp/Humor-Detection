We waited 20 minutes without ever seeing our server and during that time it took more than ten minutes for a busser to get our waters to the table. All of this and the restaurant wasn't even crowded, it was actually almost empty. There is no reason for service this poor. This is the only time I have ever walked out of a restaurant.
