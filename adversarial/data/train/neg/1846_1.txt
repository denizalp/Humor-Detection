This is hands down the worst dealership. I bought a Nissan from them and it was a used car. They had told me everything was certified and working correctly on the car. Come summer time I started to try and use the AC it wouldn't work at all. It was just blowing hot air on me. I tried recharging it with Freon and it did nothing. They sold the car to me with a leak in the system. They refuse to make good on it in any way shape or form. I take car of my vehicles and am up to date on everything that needs to be done. I've tried talking to my stupid ass sales person Drew Ragonese about this matter and he was honestly the rudest human being I've ever encountered. He was nice when buying the car but now that I'm having a problem with it, he's being extremely rude. He Was making comments about how if it wasn't working when I got it I should have brought it in. I got the car in late December when the ac Wouldnt be used. Come summer time it never worked at all. I recommend not doing business with these incompetent idiots. They've lost all of my business and my family's business. I always thought Toyota was a great place to get a car and this completely turned me off. I will never be buying anything from Toyota ever again. Very displeased and now having heatstroke in a car they sold me. Go somewhere else, don't give any of these people commission. They don't deserve a punny.
