This review is only for the front end - To Go. \n\nWe stopped here before and got the salted duck. It wasn't as great as other place but I guess it's still tasty. \n\nToday, we came in and got the 1lb crunchy pork meat. I was not pleased with the way he chopped the meat. There's small pieces and big pieces. Not even at all or even make it look appetizing. We also ordered combination fried rice. It tasted plain but decent enough. The rice is cooked. That is what I look for. Hehe \n\nOverall... the meat skin was over cooked. Too hard and not crunchy. Rice is plained.
