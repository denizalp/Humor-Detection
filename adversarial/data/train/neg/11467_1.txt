Here's an update. Hannah lives by her word. When I first met her, she told me that her gel manicures last 4 weeks.. I never wanted to believe it, let alone for me personally my nails have never lasted me 4 weeks.. EVER\nThis is what the growout looks like on my natural nails. This is 5 weeks.  BEST nail salon to go to, the customer service is STILL SO amazing from the moment I step in til I walk out. 10000% satisfied as always, and I would recommend in a heart beat! Love them! Recommended all my gal pals to come here and they were not disappointed !! \njelly pedi is a must try !!
