Two great experiences having our cars repaired At New Look.  Most recently, they not only did a fine and timely repair on our Mercedes, but really went above and beyond when we brought it back a month later, for what we thought was warranty work on an underbody panel.  \nUpon further inspection, what may have happened is we may have scraped the panel on a parking block, but Paul the GM at New Look said he would do us a solid in the name of excellent customer service and fix it for us.\nIt is not very often these days that you will find people who stand behind their work like New Look did.\nWe will undoubtedly bruise more cars and when we do we will definitely be back at New Look \nThank You! Paul, Lou & Horacio.
