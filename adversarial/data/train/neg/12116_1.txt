Absolute best Thai food in Las Vegas. The soups, curries and stir frys are to die for. I love their fried rice. Lotus of siam has got nothing on this place. Everything is fresh. The  curry duck is the best but its carried fresh only so you might need to call in advance to reserve your duck, but its worth it. David Wongs Pan Asia puts all the other \"supposed Thai restaurants\" in Vegas to shame. The flavor and use of real spice is  phenomenal.
