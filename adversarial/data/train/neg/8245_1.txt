I was impressed by this salon before I ever went in. The receptionist was incredibly accommodating and nice when making my appointment. I had an ombr√© color done and loved it and was very happy with the service. However before I left i had a \"product consultation.\" I really don't like feeling like I'm beig sold something after I spent $100 on my color, especially when I already have expensive products from other salons and I am already pretty low maintenance with my hair and don't use a lot of products. The stylist even said something along the lines of \"if you don't buy it you can't be mad if your color fades.\" Red flag. Sure enough it did after two weeks and I understood her shpeel and why it faded but I went back and asked about it and the girl at the front desk gave me the exact same speech. She was again very nice about it, but I just felt like they were pushing the product on me more than customer service. I could be more specific, but the bottom line is if I already have $30 shampoo at home I'm not going to buy more from you and you shouldn't make me feel guilty for that.
