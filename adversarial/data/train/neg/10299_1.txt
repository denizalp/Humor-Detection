Typical Italian eatery.  Nothing to brag about.  Happy hour bites are average and drinks are standard.\n\nI wouldn't really say it's the best place to go but for food but the atmosphere is great.  Any seat you take is fun and inviting.  Open seating outside by the water is relaxing and so is the seating inside the giant space that they have.  The service can be a bit slow when it gets busy.\n\nOverall might be a spot to stop after shopping or a glass of wine between walking around the area.
