This could be a great Y.  Good diverse membership, location (for me), renovation changes (mostly except for the now - only one large weight lifting area  - throwing all levels of weight lifters together is not working well).  Unfortunately, this Y is the worst for cell phone use. I have been to other Y locations in Charlotte, and many across the country while traveling. By far, this Y has the most disrespectful, self-absorbed, rude people (while working out on machines or on workout floors: speaking loudly on their cell holding phone to their ear and via open mic - seriously how unbelievable selfish and rude?).  The management says \"No cell phone use on workout floors\", and that it will be 100% enforced when the renovation is done. Well, the new area is open and renovation is nearly done: cell phone use is worse than ever. Management does nothing and does not support the floor staff to get rude people off their phones.  I'm looking for truly no cell phone fitness place to work out, like other more professional Y locations (& where the no cell calls policy is enforced).
