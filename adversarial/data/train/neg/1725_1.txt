I don't like hot dogs that much, so when my friend suggested this place, I was skeptical.  Why would I want to spend $8 on a hot dog and fries?  I decided to give this place a shot anyway.  Not that I had much of choice, because that's where the majority of my coworkers wanted to go for lunch that week.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I was pleasantly surprised!  I got the Quarter Hounder -- really flavorful, just a little messy to eat.  Their fries were delicious, and were even better with a scoop of chili on top.  They've got desserts from King of Pops -- a renowned local Charlotte popsicle place.  Niche meets niche.  And it's a good combo.\n\nI'd come here again, it's pretty darn good.
