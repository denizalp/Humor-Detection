My husband has been trying to get me to go to this location for long time as he really likes the doctor there.  I've been having some shoulder pain and started going to this location as well and have been impressed with the service.  You check in and usually get called back pretty fast to see the doctor and the adjustment is completed in a timely manner.  The doctor talks with you and makes you feel comfortable during the adjustment.  I've been to other chiropractors before who pressure you to pay for lots of different services and question you if you don't go every week to see them.  I like that at The Joint the chiropractor will recommend for you to come back at a certain time but there's not pressure or guilt if you can't make it then.  I signed up for the monthly membership because I'll definitely continue going to this location.
