Me and my boyfriend came here for the first time for 4th of July lunch. I have to say...Out of this world food and service. We have been to many top rated places while visiting here in Vegas but this place was by far our favorite. The prices are affordable and the portion sizes are huge. The food was so flavorful we just wanted to keep eating. Our server, Nick (sheriff of flavor town) was awesome! He gave us some great recommendations and made our experience here even better. We are already planning on coming back for dinner.
