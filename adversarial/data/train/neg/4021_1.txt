you can find specials on their website (drinks and food)\n\ntable of four, we sat ourselves upstairs. it was candlelit with dim lights (the servers turned up the lights about 1\/2 hour later)\n\nowner came to take our drink orders and then food orders - he clearly knew the menu (didn't have to write anything down) and was friendly.\n\nitems that were consumed: \nWeissbeer (Bavarian beer)\npulled pork sandwich, substituting fries with mac and cheese\nMac and Cheese + caesar salad\nfish and chips (two pieces of fish)\n\nTo be honest, out of all the food we had ordered, the mac and cheese was the best.  Pulled pork sandwich was dripping with sauce but it was bland. \nThe fish with the fish and chips were dry. \nIf you do order a sandwich, I highly suggest you substitute fries with mac and cheese (it's only $3-4 more and you get a portion that is just enough for you to enjoy mac and cheese (and not be stuffed \/ overwhelmed)).  The entree sized mac and cheese is pretty big, so you could probably share it with someone else .\n\nWe didn't order the nachos, but it looked really good (many other tables ordered that, so we saw servers walking by with nachos throughout the meal).  I think anything cheese related on the menu is a safer bet, so keep that in mind if you go. I do recommend going to try out the place anyways - doesn't have to be for food, they stock beer that is different from what you'd find in restaurants and it's a nice environment to just hang out and chat.
