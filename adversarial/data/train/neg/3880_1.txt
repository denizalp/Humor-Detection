Very good sushi at a much better price than you'll find in the casinos. Don't be fooled by the slightly off the beaten path location, this is a go-to place for sushi in Vegas. Very friendly staff, some interesting and well crafted specialty rolls, beautiful presentation. They just extended their hours, so don't be afraid to head over at midnight on a Friday. Skip the overpriced sushi at the casinos and take a little excursion.
