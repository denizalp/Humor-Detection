Pretty decent, actually more than decent for Arizona I guess.  Didn't even know that had decent Greek food, boy was I told wrong.   But if I was in So Cal, or LA\/OC... this place would be a 1 or 2stars, however its Arizona.  I'm surprised they even had a greek family in the kitchen. \n\nThis joint is small & its more like a quick bite place.  Great for lunch to go, lunch break eats, or chill joint to eat at with a friend.  Joint has only tables for two I think and not much seating, so maybe enough for 8 ppl total?\n\n\n*Food: \nFries: so my friend has to order fries everywhere she goes.  Funny thing, I wasn't expecting this place to even have decent fries.... they're fries are awesome!!! Definitely get that over the hummus\n\nHummus: don't get it or get if you aren't expecting much.  Its pretty grainy still and is a little plain .\n\nGyro: dude its huge!!! I'm serious, split it with two people & see if thats enough for you.  Unless you a very big guy, then go for it... you'll be full for sure.  Its a lot of meat even when its split into two... i mean alot of meat, like meat overload.  Be sure to get more sauce or put your hummus on it haha\n\nDrink: Soda Fountain.  We got Raspberry Iced Tea.\n\n\n*Service: None, but as for the cashier...which probably is the owner's daughter - she could be a little more pleasant?\n\n\n*Parking: Its a plaza parking lot.  Theres enough parking, but you might not get a parking right in front of it.  Doesn't matter, its not much of a walk anyways, better than the grocery stores type of parking walk.\n\n\n*Price: Decent.  Dude the Gyros are totally worth it though!!!
