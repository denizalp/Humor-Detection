I've been a Camelback CrossFit member for eight months and have loved every second of it. Being new to CrossFit I was naturally nervous to join.  However, with Coach Matt and Coach Robert's help, I felt completely comfortable every work out. Not only are you getting best in class coaching but you really feel like all of the coaches care about you. The monthly fees are the best in town.
