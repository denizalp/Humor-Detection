I can't express enough how grateful I am that I found NVP Autowerks. After taking my car to 3 national chain autoshops where I was told \"this & that\" was wrong and it will be a bajillion dollars to fix it, I found NVP Autowerks and they discovered what I was told originally needed repaired didn't need repaired at all! (other things did need repaired, but not the items I had been told by the other shops) And NVP didn't charge me a bajillion dollars for the repairs! They charged a very fair & reasonable price and provided me a level of trust I have not had in years, if ever, with a mechanic.\n\nThey have gone above and beyond to help me with the issues my '02 BMW X5 has been experiencing but most importantly, they stand firmly behind their work .
