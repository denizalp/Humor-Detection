The restaurant is pretty small. I went on a Sunday around 12:30 and the place was packed. It took a little bit of time for them to take our order. The restaurant was pretty hot as well. We ordered the chicken nachos and 6 tacos (2 chicken, 2 asada & 2  barbacoa). We had to wait a long time to get the food as well because of the lunch rush but everything was DELICIOUS! It was way too much food for two people. The chicken nachos are huge and can probably be a meal for two on their own! The tacos were awesome. All the meat seasoning was really good and the salsas were great. All the workers were really nice. We asked for a to-go box for the nachos and the lady working there added some more sauce to the nachos before we left. I really enjoyed this place. Only thing stopping it from being 5 stars is the wait for food and their air conditioning.
