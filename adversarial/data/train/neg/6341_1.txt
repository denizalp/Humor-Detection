Love all of the new Mediterranean offerings. These meals are so tasty, with 600 or less calories each. The Herb-Grilled Salmon topped with garlic butter and served with broccoli was particularly yummy. Yes, I'm advising you to order salmon at Olive Garden! \n\nHere you can get any pasta dish with gluten-free rotini (yay!). The only sauces that are 100% gluten-free, though, are their marinara or meat sauce. If you can tolerate a bit of gluten (like I can), go for the Shrimp Scampi - so good.\n\nFinish your meal with a cup of hot chocolate topped with whipped cream and an Andes mint. Mmmm!\n\nStaff here from the hostess, to servers to manager were super friendly and accommodating. \n\nIf you're looking for an affordable and tasty meal away from the strip, go here.
