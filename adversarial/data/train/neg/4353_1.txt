***Review is for Post Office only***\n\nI hafta give this Shoppers location props for having extended hours for their Post Office.  I asked the clerk what time they closed and she responded 9PM.  9pm on a Sunday evening, unbelievable! \n\nI ended up driving out here after I found out that Clayhill closed at 4pm on a Sunday??!!  4pm.  That's right, people.  Something shuts down before the sun does in the Wintertime.\n\nThis is the second closest Post Office to me and I've had to come here throughout the years.  And even though I've dealt with several people at this counter, NONE of them have been rude or curt.  \n\nToday, I had to wait extra long because there was an elderly immigrant woman shipping a package and the postal clerk needed extra time to explain to her the process which is totally fine with me.  What I have no tolerance for are people who purposely drag out serving one person because they're pulling some sort of passive-aggression.  Not cool.\n\nAnyway, keep up the good work!  Perhaps I'll go to this location more often than Clayhill.
