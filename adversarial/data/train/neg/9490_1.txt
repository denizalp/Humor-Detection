Tremont neighborhoody hangout. It's low-key, not busy, and they have a fun bowling arcade game. It's kind of a funky little place, not really fancy or anything special. It's kind of run-down from the looks of the outside. They play hip tunes while you sip on your booze and hang out. \n\nDefinitely a dive bar if that's what you're in the mood for. :)
