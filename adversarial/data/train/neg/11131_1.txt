First time I've ventured into City Barbecue while in CLT for work. I ordered the City Sampler and opted for the pulled chicken instead of turkey. The beef brisket was by far the best meat on my plate. Tender, smokey, and a handsome smoke ring surrounding a well earned bark made this the highlight of my meal. To further the beef affair, I had a small Brisket Chili Bowl and that too was a beautifully composed bite that I'd happily eat as a meal in itself. Their sausage was a home run and my second choice for meat on the plate. The hush puppies were excellent as well as both varieties of coleslaw. I didn't spend as much time enjoying the pork (a bit chewier than I liked with my recent dental work) and the chicken was tasty but not enough to distract my attention from the beef. \n\nTheir Kansas City style sauces were decent but in my opinion the real star was their Piedmont Carolina sauce. Wow! That stuff had kick and flavor and was excellent on everything from the meat, corn bread, and hush puppies. \n\nThe staff was extremely friendly in multiple interactions and made an out-of-towner feel very welcome. My new favorite Q place in Charlotte. Will definitely be back and recommend to coworkers.
