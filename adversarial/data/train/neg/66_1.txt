I feel compelled to update everyone on the new dealership. I know things change and that's part of life but not always for the better. I paid a lot for an extended warranty but I cant get a call back from the service department to check to see if what I want fixed is covered, I was assured by sales that it would be only to be transferred to service and find out \"Well, we need to look at it first\" That would be understandable but I explained exactly what needed to be done and in detail. I do know and did repair my own vehicles for years. Still, its a long way there and I have to devote an entire day to get it done. I wish they could just look up my warranty info and say yes that's covered or no its not based on the information I give them.
