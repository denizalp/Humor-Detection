Thank you Tuft & Needle for making our mattress buying experience so great! We had a bad taste in our mouths from our last expensive mattress purchase of a bed that broke down in like a month and the business closed, so we were slightly hesitant to purchase again but were in desperate need for a comfortable mattress.  From the second we went to the store we were impressed.  We were in and out in about 15 minutes and were sleeping on it the same night for a fraction of the cost we paid the last time.  I waited to write this review until we slept on the mattress for a few months and I am happy to say it is extremely comfortable.  We couldn't be happier.
