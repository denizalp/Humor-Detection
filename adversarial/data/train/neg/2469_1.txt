Beerbistro was fine in every way, but I can't really justify more than 3 stars.\n\nWe had the duck-fat fries, which I read many glowing reviews of.  I found them under-seasoned, just a bit soggy (not much), and not really tasting of much duck fat.  And I normally like duck-fat fries a lot.  They weren't bad, just not particularly good.\n\nOur other dishes were the pulled pork and the chicken curry.  Again, both were good, but that's about it.  I had much, much better pulled pork the next day around the corner at one of the Front Street Foods stalls (at Union Station).  And the chicken curry was well-cooked (moist, tender chicken) with decent sauce and rice.  \n\nAgain, it was a perfectly fine lunch.  Service was very good, and it had nice outdoor seating.  Food was just good enough, though.
