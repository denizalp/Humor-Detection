Really cool concept for the whole restaurant. The decor, the white boards, and the menu made you feel like your were back in elementary school. I just wished the service and the food was better!\n\nFOOD\nNothing really special here. We tried a number of the appetizers (the bacon cheddar tots, the buffalo cauliflower, and the calamari) along with a couple of drinks, but they were all pretty basic. The appetizers and the drinks were around $10 each. Nothing that I would rave about or come back for. The drinks were good and I did like the fact that they have a variety of beers on tap, but other than that I would not come back solely for the food.\n\nSERVICE\nThis is the main reason why I am only giving them a 2 star rating. Our waiter didn't really seem like he knew what he was doing. He would take our orders and then come back to ask what they were again because he didn't write them down. When he had brought the water bottle to us, he also didn't pour any of it initially and when he saw our glass was empty, we were the ones to ask him to get another bottle of water instead of anticipating our needs. The other waiter delivering food passed us because she too was unsure where the food was to go. I felt like their system was clunky.\n\nLOGISTICS\nThere's never really any issue for parking when we go here. There also wasn't a wait to get in, so that was good. They have USB\/regular outlets where you can plug your phone in so that was cool.\n\nThis place isn't bad. It looks nice and modern, but the service is poor. The managers need to retrain the staff if anything. I wouldn't recommend others to go here. Try another place with better food and better service!
