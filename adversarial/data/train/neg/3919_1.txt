Food is good, drink selection is great, but it is absolutely asinine that these fantastic HD TVs are shown in black and white only.  \n\nAsked a few servers why they don't show in color, and the most thorough answer was \"well we noticed when we show in color, that people at the bar weren't talking to each other.\"  Um...it's probably because they are doing what people do at bars, watch the game.
