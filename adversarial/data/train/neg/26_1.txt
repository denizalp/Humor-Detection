Great service, probably because I was the the only one there lol. I got their signature FNB poke bowl and it had a lot of yummy stuff I've never had before in a traditional poke bowl. I came during my lunch break around 1:30-2pm and food came out quick. Great, cheap lunch specials. Will come back again.
