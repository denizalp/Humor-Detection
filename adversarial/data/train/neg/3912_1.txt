Thanks Groupon for helping me discover this new Italian spot in Old Town a little off the beaten path. \n\nDecor\/ambience - 3.5 stars\n\nService - 3.5 stars\n\nRoasted artichoke appetizer - 5 stars\nOne of be best I've ever had and the oregano aioli sauce was on point! This should be a regular menu item - I would come back just for them alone. \n\nLobster bisque - 5 stars \nSo rich and incredibly flavorful. No lobster chunks but flavor makes up for it. Split a bowl between two people ($10) and it's the perfect amount. \n\nEntrees - 3 stars \nScallop dish came with 3 large scallops that were tasty but I prefer a lemon-butter based sauce. Came served with a plate full of risotto that was flavorful but a little too overpowering for me. Black linguine seafood pasta sauce was a little mild and not too flavorful. \n\nNo dessert this time - I was totally stuffed!\n\nBest part of the meal was the appetizer\/soup. Oh and the $25 for $50 of food Groupon was awesome and made it worth it too!
