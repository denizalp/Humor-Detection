Came here with a friend on a weekend night as I was craving for some dumplings. Reviews here were decent and the restaurant is super close to my house so we decided to come here. Fairly busy when we came on Saturday evening. We ordered different dishes including 2 sets of steamed dumplings, the pan-fried beef dumplings, the green onion pancake and this spicy jelly dish. The steamed dumplings were good but the star here was the pan-fried beef dumplings- it was really good. I was little surprised to see very limited selection for pan-fried dumplings. I think they need to add more selection for this to their menu. I found the service was mediocre because I had to ask for water 3 different times with 3 different waiters before I got my water. Somehow, we ended getting the wrong order of dumplings. We ordered the pork dumplings but we ended up getting the pork dumplings with peas and didn't realize it till we left the restaurant. Overall, the pan fried beef dumplings were really good so definitely get that. I would not get the jelly like dish- tasted pretty bad and not good. The steamed dumplings were good. Wouldn't mind coming back here- they really need to be more attentive in their service to the customers.
