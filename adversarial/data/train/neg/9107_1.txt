Not my favorite Marriott.  Will not go back ever!!\nAsked for a upgrade room since I am platinum  elite ( I was told , sorry nothing available)  My stay was for 4 nights. Yet hotel seemed empty.  Sat by the pool several different times, no umbrellas and no shade.  It's AZ and over 100 degrees. Landscapers were working around the pool, scrapping their shovels across the cement area and talking loudly.  I complained to the front desk, staff said They have a job to do, so sorry.!!  Thank goodness I have a choice of hotels and will go somewhere else.  I also got one stay credit and half points because I was on a special rate.  Make sure you ask about your points BEFORE you book your room.
