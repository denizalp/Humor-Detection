Haven't found a go to spot yet for Chinese here in Las Vegas which is off the LV strip. This place is pretty good. Customer service is good. When I was first seated the table tops of some\nOf the booths had big cracks to point where the table tops were coming apart. I just simply asked them to move us. Food was really good. We had Salted Fish and Chicken Fried rice. I am a fan of the salted fish, but it maybe a little overbearing for some. We also had the honey walnut shrimp which was really good and also the Salted Pepper Pork Chops! Delicious! I would definitely go back again. Prices where about in line, but I would suggest they add lunch specials. I believe it would drive more traffic to the restaurant.
