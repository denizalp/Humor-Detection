I've only gone once and it was for Sunday brunch.  We didn't get there early or at opening time, but a couple hours in and there was no line out the door.  Four of us sat on a couch and chairs and drank coffee while we waited to be seated.  I was only slightly afraid that something would fall on my head while waiting (in an antique store crammed full of various things, and yes, some were hanging from the ceiling).  We were offered to be seated with another party, but due to social anxiety with one in our party we asked if it was possible to have our own table: of course but it will be a few more minutes then (only 5-10 minutes longer).  We sat, ordered, helped ourselves to a delicious buffet.  I'm more of a fan of brunch meaning breakfast foods at lunch time, rather than the breakfast and lunch foods.  Did not care here!  Everything I tried was delicious.  I had french toast as my entree which was good at satisfying my once in awhile french toast craving.  It was a bit of a carb overload with that, all of the yummy cakes, and then the buffet pastas and whatnot.  Did I mind?  Heck no.  It was delicious!  I just wish I could have ate more.  Can't wait to go again.
