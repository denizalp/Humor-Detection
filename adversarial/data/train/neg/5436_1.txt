After several times visiting Mandalay, we finally decided to try this place. I was excited about the 4course dinner package but we decided to splurge and get the 5course chef menu where you let the chef prepare the menu along with the wine pairing. The service was wonderful. The only bad thing was that they weren't loose on the pouring of the wine,
