The tacos here are on point. My coworkers and I come here for lunch sometimes, and they always have fast service.  Almost everything I have had here was delicious, with exception of the chicken bowl; It's just kind of.. lacking flavor.  But everything else is delicious and I would recommend to anyone who likes food.
