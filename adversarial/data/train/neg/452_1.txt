The shop is my spot, and I'm a commuter. I've been getting my hair cut by Brandon since before I permanently lived in Arizona! Followed him from shop to shop because he can cut my difficult hair and turn it into a calling card for himself. Everywhere I go I get, \"yo my man, where do you get cut like that?\" A few shops in the hood had Brandon for some time and the level of atmosphere was not quite on par with his knowledge, abilities, and customer service; until now. The Shop by Lefty has the atmosphere and professionalism I desire, and befitting my barber. Everyone in the shop is \"Major League\" in abilities and customer service. I rarely have to choose another barber, but if it comes to that I have no doubts my cut will be top notch. Even my son got his first haircut here. Best shop in AZ!
