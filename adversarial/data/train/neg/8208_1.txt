Are the gyros good? Yes! Have I had better? Yes! \n\nI had been wanting to try their food for a while now. I haven't had a chance to sample everything on their menu so I'm only going off of what I did order. The price is fair, compared to other Greek restaurants we've been to, it's a steal! Before we placed our order, the nice gentleman let us sample the chicken meat they use for the gyros, it had a good flavor and it wasn't bland.My husband and I decided to go with the beef\/lamb gyro combo in the end.\n\nWe received our order with fries. They were nice and crispy but just plain. I am not sure if they offer Greek fries but next time I will look and substitute them in if they do. On to the gyro, it came topped with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and feta cheese.I felt like the gyro was missing tzaziki sauce, either that or the sauce was weak, I couldn't taste it. We asked for no onions on both gyros but voila! Onions on both, yuck! Now for the tomatoes, I have a weird relationship with tomatoes, if they look fresh I'll eat them, if they look old they make me feel nauseous on cue, I can't eat them. In this case, they looked old so I picked them all out. Overall, the gyro was good but not great. The cashiers were friendly and helpful, they answered questions in regards to the menu, I will be back though, I am curious about their tyropita.
