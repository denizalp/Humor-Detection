We have worked with Scott Harmon and Exclusive Tree Service for 4 years.  We found Scott and company when we needed a large ficus removed from a pool area, 3 very shaggy queen palms trimmed as well as trimming another large ficus and a Chinese Pepper tree.  Our trees are 18 to 20 years old.  Tree trimming is not just lobbing off branches.  Scott is the only trimmer we have found that knows exactly which branches to take off, how to thin a thick ficus and a fussy pepper tree that keep them beautiful and healthy, and all at competitive prices.  He is meticulous and works with our property like he would his own.  He is professional, friendly and generous.  He confirms appointments, is punctual and offers advice and information.  Although he did not mention it, we noticed he trimmed three arboretum bushes that were hanging over our driveway.  Most would do a sheer cut leaving the front flat.  The only way we knew they were trimmed is they were no longer hanging over the driveway.  Beautiful job.  When they swept the debris left over from trimming the palms he also cleaned up the ground around it.  We always look forward to working with Exclusive Tree and highly recommend to anyone who takes pride in their property.
