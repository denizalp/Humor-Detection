If your going to offer a SENIOR rate of a whole saving of .50 don't ask the customer 4 times you want to pay the senior rate, or you payed the senior rate?  Bought senior tickets online as we are seniors, but was questioned by a (I think a Manager, gentleman with a very scruffy looking beard for the 445PM show) 4 times, maybe just asked for ID don't be a jerk about it.  NOT all seniors look old, some folks many look younger than what they are..... This is a good thing no need to make it OFFENSIVE to the customer and ask for $1.  That was just very RUDE of this Manager, he does set a good example for his team.
