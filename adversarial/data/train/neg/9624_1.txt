I finally managed to make my way here and immediately ordered their steak submarine and small classic poutine. I've had a bookmark here for the longest time!\n\nThe ordering process is kind of neat with this establishment employing waitresses in a casse-croûte style of joint. The service was very kind and helpful. We had a few young children with us and they accommodated us nicely. \n\nAfter 10 minutes our meals were served and I literally destroyed my steak sandwich as I was famished. The submarine was very good with high quality fresh ingredients. My only qualm was the bread being too small to hold it all together. I hate needing to cut my subs into smaller segments or have it risk being ruined with needless spillage while it is being transitioned from the plate, to my hands until its final destination... my stomach. The quality of the bread must be better and my favorite subs are those with bread made with potato dough for extra flavor. Either way, it was pretty good. Typical as it gets.\n\nThe poutine itself was between good and very good. A staple of classic casse-croûte style poutine found in many local institutions across the province.\n\nThe price tag is average for this type of cuisine.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it and would find myself come back one day.
