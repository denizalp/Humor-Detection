Tonight we are seeing KA at the MGM. Last night we had a disappointing dinner at Mercato Della Pescheria at the Venetian (see my review). Tonight we visited Wolfgang Pucks Bar & Grill across from the KA theater. What a difference. Excellent food (Best damn chicken wings I've ever had!) and Chinoise salad delicious. Wife had linguini with clams. Pasta cooked perfectly. They even brought her the little clam fork. Service was outstanding from our waitress Natalie (who was training and was always attentive (friendly but not imposing, just right) and always checking with us) to the other team members who made sure water glasses were always full, bread was available, and dishes taken away promptly. Those guys at Mercato have very big shoes to fill in their former Puck space and have not hit the mark.
