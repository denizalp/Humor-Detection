This place has the best sushi that I've found in Phoenix.  The prices are reasonable and the sushi is excellent.  This sushi shop isn't one of those affected locations where you'll feel like you need to dress up.  The owners are on site often and overall, this is our favorite place to go for sushi.  I HIGHLY recommend the Oh My God roll.  It was named well.  It is my favorite roll anywhere.
