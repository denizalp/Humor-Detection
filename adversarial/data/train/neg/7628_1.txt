Love love LOVE Fox Sports Grill.  Its the perfect combination of 2 of my favorite things: beautiful people and (midwest) sports.  \n\nBelly up to the bar in the middle of the restaurant for the best people and sports watching seats in the house--there are a ton of TVs so you wont miss a minute of your favorite games, even if youre cheering for more than one team at a time.  \n\nThere are pool tables for your entertainment at half time, and a private room in the back where I once got way too saucy at a company gathering.  \n\nDJs are mixing the latest during commercials of REALLY big games, and Fox Sports broadcasts right in the bar from time to time.  \n\nPrices are Scottsdale par and the food is upscale bar.  \n\nBe sure you shower and put on your best jersey, there are some seriously good looking sports fans at Fox Sports and hell, you might even be cheering for the same team.
