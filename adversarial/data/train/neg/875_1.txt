South Points has a nice little set up with bowling, bingo and a theater inside. Not so cool if you're going to have a closed snack bar while games are being played. I swear it should be a crime. Games were cheap and so were drinks. Although drinks were completely watered down also. I guess in this instance you really get what you pay for. \n\n-Joseph
