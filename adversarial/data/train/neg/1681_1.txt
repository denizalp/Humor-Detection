The customer service was great!  They were really crowded and the staff apologized for the wait.  \n\nI love that clean juice posts all of their nutrition so that you know what is going into your body. \n\nI ordered the nutty bowl and it was delicious. All of the açaí bowls are all very yummy.  \n\nThere are different types of smoothies, juices, and all sort of healthy options.   You can also do meal plans.  Everything can be a little pricey but you are paying for fresh healthy food.  I recommend giving them a try!
