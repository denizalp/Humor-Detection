This people ruined our wedding day !!! \nA group of cons that seemed to act nice and tell you anything you'd like to hear before the day of the event. Eventually bailed out on us at our wedding day leaving my mother and sister with their hair undone since they had another event although we agreed on 5 girls for the wedding day !\nIf I could give them 0 stars I would..will never do business with them again
