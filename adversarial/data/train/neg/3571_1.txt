Great Outlet stores. Love the open design with seating in the middle. Easy to get between sections. They are adding more food options which is nice. The Starbucks is always very busy.  Parking can be a challenge, and I'm looking forward to more food options. Other than that it is a great Outlet Store and we love shopping there.
