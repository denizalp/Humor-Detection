Just moved in across from this pizza joint and we decided to get a quick bite, so we went here and let me say they have some great food pretty good prices but OMG the girl at the counter was so rude and pressing I hate when I find a good place to eat but never want to go there because the staff is awful. I would get delivery if I was you....
