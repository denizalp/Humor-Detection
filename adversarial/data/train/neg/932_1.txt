In the end, the carpets are clean and look great.  However, there were some issues with the day of the service. 1) The technician called ahead, which I really appreciate, and said he'd be there in 10 - 15 minutes. I went to the house to open up and he didn't show until 30+ minutes after the call. Annoying! 2) There is a driveway at the house and then some additional concrete going towards the front door. It is not wide enough for a car and, I think, clearly not part of the driveway. But, after the technician checked in with me, he got in his van and drove right up to the front door. I asked what he was doing, and he said he was trying to get closer to the hose spigot. \"But you drove on the front lawn? There are sprinklers. What are you doing?\" He moved his van back to the driveway. His equipment reached the house and spigot just fine from there.  But, he left tire marks on the concrete pad. I did ask him to clean it off and he did. Really weird though.  Again, the carpet looks good, but you may need to keep and eye on the technician.
