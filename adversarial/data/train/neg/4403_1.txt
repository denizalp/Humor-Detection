Totally fine place to crash for a night.  Dennis and Pam at check-in were super friendly and even helped me find places to grab a quick dinner in the area.  For that matter, all of the staff members I met were polite and friendly.  The location is excellent since it is literally a minute off of I-90 with plenty of shopping, food, and gas stations within a mile of the area. \n\nWith that said, the hotel is very high mileage and seems to be pretty busy.  The layout is really, really weird with rooms overlooking an indoor pool that is full of noisy kids.  Ask for an outside facing room if you want some semblance of quiet!  The rooms are fine but seem a bit dated and the bathrooms are not brightly lit.  Outside of that, the beds are very comfy, there is plenty of free parking, and wi-fi is free.
