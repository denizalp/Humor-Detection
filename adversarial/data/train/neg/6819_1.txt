I love the Greek Festival and look forward to it every year. I've taken a 4 year hiatus, but it's good to be back! I went here all 3 days this year (probably to make up for not making it the last 4 years) and loved it. I had forgotten how much I was missing out on and how much I enjoy the people, food and entertainment. I came up on Friday to eat and have fun and then worked the pork and chicken grill for the gyro booth all day Saturday and Sunday. I hope they're doing it again in November. Thanks everybody for lettting me help out.
