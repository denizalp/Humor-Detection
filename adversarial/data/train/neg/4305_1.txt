I'll give it a 2 because it is still a WM with great prices. \n\nBeyond that the place is a total disaster. This must be one of their token stores if you get my drift. I doubt they even have managers at this location. Place is a mess. Many out of stocks. Checkout takes easily 10 minutes on a good day.  Won't be visiting this location again, fail.
