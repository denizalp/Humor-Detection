So glad SNOOZE is just up the block. I've been to Eggstasy multiple times and unfortunately it got worse each visit. I will not return again. Service is slow, management is unorganized, and food is average.\n\nCheck out Snooze at Kierland if you want a great breakfast with great service. Might have to wait, but it's well worth the wait!!\n\nIf you want a below average experience then Eggstasy is for you.
