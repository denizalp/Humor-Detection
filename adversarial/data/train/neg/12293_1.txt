My daughter searched for farm to table restaurants and this came up. We ate at the Stable grill and it was good. The decor is rustic but nice. The food was very good and the prices are reasonable. The joy reason n for 4 stars is the entry's don't come with a vegetable. I had the meatloaf and smashed potatoes and they it was very good. Seemed it was missing a veggie though. I would go back Service was good too
