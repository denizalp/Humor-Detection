Great Place!! Love the atmosphere, very upscale and service is the best. The food is great, tried just about everything on the menu, the Chicken BBQ rotisserie is to die for, the meat just melts in your mouth. The waiters and bartenders are very friendly, Ben was my favorite bartender of all times. Very modern, great presentation on the food and quality and taste is on every plate.
