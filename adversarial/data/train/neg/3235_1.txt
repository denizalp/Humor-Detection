One of the best meals my husband and I have ever had!  There are a number of reasons why I absolutely adore Vintner Grill!  Let me count the ways:\n\n1. It's hidden in a office business park in Summerlin.  It's not like its out in the open; you gotta play eye-spy to find it.  And I like that!\n\n2. Their bar area is something that I feel that I could call home five nights a week.  It's very inviting and they have delicious drinks.\n\n3. The seating at the tables are super comfortable.  On the \"booth\" side- it is all white with gorgeous, comfortable pillows.  On the \"chair\" side- its a very comfortable, padded chair.  They make it comfy so you can enjoy your dinner.\n\n4. They don't rush you.  My husband and I were there for almost two hours and never once did the waiter try and get us out.  He gave us plenty of time and it was perfect.  If we needed him, he was always around.\n\n5. Their menu.  The first few pages is about their cheeses and meat selections that they have.  You know if they focus on this, it must be good.\n\n6. They play old black & white movies on this see-through glass that you would never expect to turn into a movie screen.  Very cool!\n\n7. The Bread Man- so after you get comfortable the \"bread man\" comes by with a many different selections of cold or room temperature bread.  You can have as many as you want!  They also bring out a dish with a couple dipping sauces and butter. (Suggestion- set the butter & sauce near the candle on the table, so the butter softens up!)\n\n8. The fresh and comfortable feeling that you get when just sitting in the restaurant.  It's white and crisp and lovely.\n\nOk, so my husband and I started with a glass of wine ($9) and a cocktail ($10) and after looking over the two page meat and cheeses we said \"hell, we gotta try it!\"  We asked our wonderful waiter for help.  Since my husband loves bleu cheese, that was one of the picks along with some salami and pancetta. (You can mix and match any meats and cheeses that you like!)  It came out on a plate with apricot mustard sauce and a homemade blueberry sauce.  OMG!  The bleu cheese with the blueberry sauce = amazeaballs!  So good!  The entire plate was delicious and something perfect to get our palette ready for the main courses.\n\nI had the bouillabaisse with mussels, clams, shrimp, snapper, calamari, scallops and saffron broth.  It's similar to a cioppino but even better!  The saffron broth had just enough flavor and it was plentiful of seafood!\n\nMy husband had the prime beef tenderloin with peppercorn sauce, brie potato puree and grilled asparagus.  He orders his steak cooked \"between medium rare and medium\" some places call it medium rare plus.  Comes out perfect every time!  He said that it was one of the best steaks he has ever had!\n\nEveryone in the restaurant seemed to enjoy their meals and the ambiance was definitely something that I enjoyed.  I'm looking forward to bringing some family here later this month!
