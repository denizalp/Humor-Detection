Optical dept - worst experience. Dr Burns is unfriendly but I figured as long as I get an exam and prescription that's what matters. I had glasses made but then could not see clearly. When I went back to tell him, he said that he didn't make it up out of thin air. What kind of a response is that? He blamed me because he said that it's based on my responses to his questions. He was completely unwilling to help me! All I wanted was a pair of glasses I could see out of. The optical retail dept however were very nice and helpful. I will need to figure out where else to get the Rx.
