Trader Joe's is really a good place to shop - they have great produce, meat\/poultry\/fish, cheese, dairy, flowers, dry goods and their prepared products are usually very good and interesting\/flavorful.  Wine\/beer\/liquor\/cider selection is also very good.\n\nTheir retailing approach also generally keeps prices reasonable, although some things can be a bit pricey (but the quality is commesurate).\n\nService is very friendly as well, and they always have a treat for my child when finding Koko the monkey.  Return policy is very good as well if you get something that isn't quite right.\n\nI particularly like this location, as having Trader Joe's here (and this is similar in other locations) means more walk in traffic to the other businesses in what generally are strip malls that are older and need some redevelopment.
