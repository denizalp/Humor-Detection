If you are looking for Pad Thai go someplace else. What they gave me smelled bad, and was WAY over seasoned with salt. It was inedible. \n\nFor a carry-out Chinese place this falls horribly short of already low expectations. \n\nThe only saving grace of the food was the fried dumplings. \n\nSad. Just embarrassingly sad.
