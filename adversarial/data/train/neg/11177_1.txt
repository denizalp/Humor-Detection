Not much more I could ask for!\n\nFood was amazing with large portions. I had to divvy up my Thai red curry with shrimp into lunch and dinner. It was the perfect amount of spicyness and there was a generous serving of shrimp. A+. \n\nThe cashier was super nice and smiley. I asked for her opinion but I went with something else haha. \n\nI will definitely be coming back to try the Laksa curry noodle with shrimp.
