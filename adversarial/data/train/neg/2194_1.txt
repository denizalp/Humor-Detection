Pei Wei is like a fast-food version of PF Changs (same owner\/recipes). There is something that is a MUST for anybody trying Pei Wei for the first time: Lettuce Wraps.\n\nAbsolutely worth the trip alone. I normally get this for myself as my entree, and my fiance likes the Honey Chicken. Both are excellent. I've also tried the Pad Thai, and it was just 'ok'. The dumplings were above average, but as stated, the thing to get is the Lettuce Wraps.\n\nFor a chain, its pretty good. The food has always been hot and fresh and flavors are great. I LOVE their Ice Tea as well. Service is always fast and courteous.
