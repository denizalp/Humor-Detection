Great veg restaurant. Ate here three different times during my trip to the Southwest. \n\nThe Big Wac is where it's at. The combination of sesame seed bun, the pickles, the sauce, the thinner burgers, and a side of skinny fries is eerily satisfying in that nostalgic McDonald's kind of way.\n\nThe BBQ chicken sandwich was pretty solid. I stole some of my friend's peanut tofu and noodles... they were pretty good too.\n\nI split a Tsoynami - I think it was the smores one. It was good, for being vegan.
