Terrible. I've come here several times, and this experience was one of the worst. The guy with the curly hair gave me three tablespoons of rice (no exaggeration) and the girl who took my card (long dirty blonde hair braided back) didn't mutter a word throughout the entire transaction. I understand that working in the food industry is tough, but don't let your pissy mood out on customers.
