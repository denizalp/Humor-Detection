I love coming to buffets. Buffets are the best places to get something to eat. I came to Vegas hoping for the best buffet ever and we came to Bellagio and just buffets the worst ever. They have no crab legs no Mexican food no steaks. I've been to Indian casino down in San Diego that are 10 times better than this place. Highly don't recommend this place find something better.
