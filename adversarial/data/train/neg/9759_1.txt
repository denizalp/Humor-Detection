This is my favorite place to get Mexican food! I recommend the cheese quesadillas with guacamole (only $4.25) and the carne asada  (which is a little expensive at $9.99). They also have a nicely sized condiment and salsa bar which is free. The location is a little ghetto but my only negative comment is that the woman who takes my order is rude every time I come in (no smile, mumbles, rushes me). I'm giving it four stars based on the absolutely delicious food!
