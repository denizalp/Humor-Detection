I went here on a Tuesday at 3pm. There was no line up at all which was BLESSED. My friend ordered the ice cream red bean fish and loved it. I ordered the sugar brown pancakes but it took 5-10 minutes to make and they warned me. TOTALLY WORTH IT it was fresh as hell. Also the workers were so nice it was this young gentlemen and this elder lady I wanna say it was a son and grandma or mother duo? Comes to think of it I wish i left them a tip in their little tip cup now. Awesome place guys check it !!!
