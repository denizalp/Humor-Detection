We took our two kids here from October 2011 to July 2012.  It was a terrible experience for our girl in the pre-school room.  Anthea and Christine were rude and belligerent to the kids.  Our girl can speak quite well, and would tell us of them putting her and other kids down.  A few examples:  they told our 4 year old that her baby brother ate cleaner and that she \"eats like a baby\".  They would announce who the last one to get their shoes on was and that they didn't get the toys that quicker kids would get outside.  I even heard from another parent that Christine put down the mother to the child.  They are reprehensible.  Other odd things were that they had to have their blankets over their heads for naps...who knows what the reason is for that.  Did they not want them to see what they were up to....?  Beyond this, we heard both of these caregivers yelling at kids when we were in the coat room area multiple times.\nThe other rooms of this daycare are good.  Margaret in the baby room was great and the people from the toddler room seem good as well.  However, Elizabeth is the manager and Anthea is her daughter, the apple doesn't fall far there.  I heard Elizabeth yelling at kids multiple times when she didn't know someone was there.\nI would recommend other daycares if you are planning any long term care.
