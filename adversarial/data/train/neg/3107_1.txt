Considering this location had a facelift a couple years ago this place was in a pretty bad shape. The bathrooms are in a deplorable state. The chairs and tables are sticky and scuffed. Really feels like management has given up on the place. They placed my family and I in a nook where we were forgotten and ignored. So on that note, service was slow and non existant. It took an hour for the food to arrive from the time we ordered. By then my family and I had lost patience. My order came out wrong but was too hungry to bother at this point. The waiter was nice and offered sofa and desert on the house. The food was okay, up to franchise expectations. The rest really made it for an overall bad experience that won't make me go back there.
