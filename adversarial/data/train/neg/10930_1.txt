My husband and I are staying at Plaza Hotel for 2 days and figured we'd try Zaba's for breakfast. 5.99 seemed a pretty reasonable price for a breakfast burrito, however the grumpy girl behind the glass partition assembling our burritos informed us, after she'd started our food, that meat was an additional $1.99. In addition to the extra charge for meat, she insisted we could not have pico AND sauce in our burritos without incurring another extra charge. I didn't even ask about adding corn or onions to my order because I'm not a millionaire, folks!\nPrice aside, the burrito girl should really have worn a hairnet because I found a hair in one of my last bites. I wonder if there was an extra charge for it?\n\nI'd suggest the Subway next door for a cheaper, hassle free, quick breakfast if you're a fan of fixings and accoutrements.
