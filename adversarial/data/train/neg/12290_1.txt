I feel like 3 Stars is pretty generous for the review on this place. First service was horrible. I think we only saw our waitress once after we ordered eventually having to track down a manager just to get our check and then left cash so we didn't have to wait longer. \n\nChicken and waffle was way overpriced for what it was. It was just fried chicken and one waffle. Nothing exciting about the flavoring or anything of the fried chicken. The syrup was a nice touch but not worth the $36 for fried chicken and a waffle. \n\nThe menu is very small for a brunch menu. Not a lot of options. Luckily we were seated next to the kitchen and after not seeing anything my husband liked he saw a burger come out of the kitchen and asked the waitress. She was very reluctant to bring us the dinner menu and when she did told us the only thing we could order off it was the burger ( it was 1 in the afternoon not 9 in the morning) but then we continued to see sandwiches and other dinner items come out of the kitchen while waiting for our food. The poached egg dish had a very odd overpowering lemon flavor to the sauce that ruined the whole dish. The burger was super greasy. \n\nWe ordered the peach cobbler instantly cause we had friends tell us it was fantastic (again nothing overly special) and still ended up waiting for it forever after our meal.  \n\nWouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend it. Maybe it's better for the cocktails!
