The food gets a 100%, but the service knocked this down by 2 stars. It took an hour to get our food, and then even then, our food came out at a slow pace. I got mine, my friend got hers 10 minutes later. \n\nI had the cinnamon French toast, and it was great! My friend had the taco dish, and she really enjoyed it. I just hope the service improves.
