Portions are probably the only thing on the plus side\nI did not find the burgers tasty and it's on the costlier side, especially when you compare it with the Gordon Ramsay burger. Maybe, it's because I don't understand the taste of food. Regardless, I won't be going there anytime soon .\nOh, I liked the banana sundae.
