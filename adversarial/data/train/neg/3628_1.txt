This is probably the largest electronics store I've ever been to.\n\nListen, if you've only ever been to stuff like CompUSA or Tiger Direct in Florida like I have, then you're going to think this place is amazing.\n\nWhich is what happened to us. We had to buy a ton of equipment for a large event in Vegas and they took great care of us. They had basically everything we needed and it was all pretty reasonably priced. Wish they'd open one of these in Miami!
