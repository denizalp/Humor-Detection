Last week,I visited this excellent art museum and enjoyed its splendid collection of French Impressionism,including wonderful paintings by Alfred Sisley,Pierre Renoir,Claude Monet(\"Cliffs Near Dieppe\"-my favorite Impressionist work),Camille Pissarro,Degas,Jean Rafaelli(\"Schenley Park,Pittsburgh\"),and Americans Mary Cassatt and Theodore Butler.I also enjoyed its collection of Modern Art,including splendid paintings by Oscar Kokoshka,Marsden Hartley,and Maurice Prendergast.I also liked its smaller collection of Old Master paintings,especially appreciating paintings by Francesco Traini,Jan Massys,Jacopo Tintoretto,Frans Hals,and Vernet.I enjoyed this art museum .Admission also includes the Carnegie Museum of Natural History's great paleontological collection and Polar exhibit.There is a nice cafeteria in the basement of the Carnegie's Natural History section -reasonable prices.
