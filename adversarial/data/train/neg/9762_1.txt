Come here every time we visit Vegas! The gluten free breakfast options are amazing. Emily was our server this time. She was exceptional. We came yesterday and told her we would be back today. She remembered our drink order and what she had suggested we try the day before. She is so friendly and personable and her suggestions were great! Thank you Emily!
