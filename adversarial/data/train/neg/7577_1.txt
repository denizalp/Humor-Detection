I've been meaning to hit this brick house for quite some time now, but I just couldn't make it work. \n\nCut to sitting in nearby Northwood and feeling starving. My colleague and I were both squirming from hunger pangs, but it was a little too hot out for Korean and we were hoping for a patio. \n\n\"White Brick Kitchen!\" I shouted, and off we scurried. \n\nWe grabbed a seat on their patio, and ordered. The entire menu looked pretty perfect, and I can't wait to return for their macaroni and cheese! I had the club add cheese with their house greens and it was great. Sage butter mayo stuff on the bread really made it pop. My buddy had a burger, and it looked grilled to perfection, thick and juicy... just like a brick house.
