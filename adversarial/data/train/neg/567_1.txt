Absolutely amazing first time. The beer selection is delicious. My husband and I shared the oysters (briney and amazing), beef marrow (out of this world), the salted beets (refreshing & delicious), steak tartare (better than Bobby Flay's) and a cheese and meat board. Fern the hostess, to the bartender, to the server and the food runners everyone was friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back.
