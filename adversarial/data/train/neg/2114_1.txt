First thing I noticed: did not smell good when I walked in. Second, staff was not very welcoming to new guests. Third, staff did not offer to set up bike for newbies. Fourth, instructor did not help the new students which is important when the spin class is NOT typical (I.e. standing the whole time, doing something with arms, and so dark you can barely see the instructor. I've done spin all over the valley, and this class was not typical). Fifth, no one talked to each other...awkward. Sixth, I will not be going back! This review would be biased if I didn't include what was enjoyable; the music.
