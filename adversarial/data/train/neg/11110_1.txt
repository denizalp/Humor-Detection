Dined here with Tom R.\n\nFood was good, had tons of flavor. Things we had:\n\nMalaysian Roti: Not amazingly good, but I was impressed with how it turned out especially since the person that ordered it had no idea what it was. The contrast in texture between the crispy outside and chewy inside was very enjoyable and the sauce was quite nice.\n\nGrilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad: Can't say I was too fond of this one. The shrimp was still raw on the inside, though for a salad maybe that's how it's supposed to be? The main detractor for me was the copious amounts of mango on it. The mango flavor overwhelmed everything else.\n\nSingapore Noodles: Definitely one of the best dishes we had, was well cooked and flavorful.\n\nGarlic Beef: Advertised as \"1000 times better than broccoli beef\" by the owner himself. Granted nothing can be 1000 times better than broccoli beef, it didn't disappoint. It was heavy on the salt and pepper, probably too salty on it's own for most people's liking but not me. Fortunately it comes with a side of rice that I highly advise you use.\n\nPad Thai: Perhaps the most disappointing dish. Not very authentic if you ask me. It wasn't sweet enough, was PINK, and had no peanuts. Nonetheless it was still pretty tasty, though it's pretty hard to make Pad Thai not taste good. The only Pad Thai I've had and didn't like was from Buffet @Asia.\n\nProbably the worse thing about the restaurant is the lack of staff. There's one person that stays in the kitchen and cooks, and then the other triples as a cook, server, and cashier. When my water ran out, I didn't even want to ask for a refill seeing how bad the customer:employee ratio was. Seeing how Tom knew the owners and he's a regular, I hoped we'd get some sort of a discount.
