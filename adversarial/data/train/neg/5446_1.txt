Second time I've booked with Jeff.  This time booked for a bachelor party of 19 guys. Booked the \"don't wait in line service\" for Light Nightclub at Mandalay Bay.  A few hours before, decided to book bottle service through him.  After a back and forth we agreed on an additional $1430 for 4 bottles at a small table in an upstairs location.  Club was having a Grey Goose promotion, buy 1 get 1 free.  Great!\n\nShowed up at club, met the guy Jeff sent. He informed us he was having problems with the club. They wouldn't do the Grey Goose promotion and if we bailed on the bottle service the club wouldn't do the \"don't wait in line entrance\" that we originally booked.  Guy who Jeff sent said this has never happened before and that Jeff was pissed.  They came to an agreement on letting us in with $1200 bar tab that we then used to buy 2 bottles.  So we ended up paying $2,570 for 2 bottles.\n\nI understand things can go wrong, but Jeff was a dick about the whole thing and just didn't deliver on anything he booked and anything that was invoiced to me. But he took our money.  He came through on that.
