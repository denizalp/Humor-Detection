My wife and I took my sons to El Chorro last night for dinner. They are both college football players and full time students so our chances to get together with them is are rare. We were first introduce to El Chorro by my parents 30 years ago and it is our favorite resultant in Arizona and we have been accused by some of traveling from Chicago to Phoenix just to have dinner. \n\nThe night was awesome! The restaurant was packed as usual and we had a 8 pm reservation. We were seated on the patio which we requested at 7;50. Our waiter Leo was awesome! He was super knowledgable about the menu and anticipated our every need. Our food as usual was outstanding. As a starter we had the shrimp pepper pot, outstanding. For our second course we ordered four different items for a good sampling. We had a bowl of New England Clam Chowder, wedge salad, tomato salad and the beet salad. We sent back 4 clean plates. Next the sticky buns, Epic!! As our main course my wife had the short rib with mustard seed infused whipped potatoes, I had the beef stroganoff and my sons each had the New York Strip steak. Everything was perfect from presentation to temperature. Again we sent back for clean plates. The dining experience was capped off with one more round of sticky buns for the men while my wife enjoyed the strawberry shortcake. \n\nEl Chorro is a true 5 star dining experience in a beautiful spotless setting and receives my highest recommendation.
