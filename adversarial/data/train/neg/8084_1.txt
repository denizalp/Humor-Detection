WE traveled from Kauai to this field for our sons baseball tournament on Memorial day weekend. The facilities were clean, the bathrooms were a little far if you didn't want to use the porta potty. The fields were kept nice and they also have a great skatepark. There were lots of parking and it was easy to find. The only downside is that there is very little shade. So if you are going to this park please wear sunscreen, bring a hat and as much shade as you can. And don't forget your water!
