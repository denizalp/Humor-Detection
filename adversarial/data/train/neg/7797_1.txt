Two days ago I ordered wings from here 25 minutes before arriving, I got there and had to wait another 25 minutes. I was patient and let that one go.\n\nToday I ordered wings again and my order was done on time BUT once I got home I noticed I was given half the wings I ordered, I tried talking to the \"kitchen manager\" but he was being a prick to me like the was with me in the prior occasion. \n\nThis \"manager\" needs to learn to value the people that give him a job.
