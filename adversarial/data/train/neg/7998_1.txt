We had the prime rib medium rare with a side of macaroni. We ordered the 10 ounce but got the 16, we ate it all so I didn't make a fuss LOL. We made reservations, but weren't staying at the hotel so people who had the preference card got seated before us anyways. Nice ambience but kinda weird when their waiters cleaned the tables next to us. They would fluff the table cloth toward us. The table next to us order the lobster and it looked really good
