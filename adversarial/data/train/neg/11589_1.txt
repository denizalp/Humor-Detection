I like this thrift store because it is a REAL thrift store. I don't like this thrift store chain action that Savers is marketing, so it's nice to Yelp a thrift store and have a legit one show up.\n\nMy boyfriend and I collect jars for sand we've collected on beaches through our life, and Gracie's did not disappoint! It's a huge shop with a large selection, including furniture.\n\nEverything is very well organized, and there are tons of treasures to discover!
