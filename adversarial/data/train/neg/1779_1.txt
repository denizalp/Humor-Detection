Homemade Italian Heaven - Just had lunch at Vaccaro's, everything was completely homemade and market fresh, caprese salad with fresh mozzarella and farmers market tomatoes, the best wedding soup I have ever had and amazing homemade gnocchi with fabulous bolognese. By all means make your way to Vaccaro's Trattoria at the intersection of I77 and Ghent Rd in Akron, you will be glad you did!
