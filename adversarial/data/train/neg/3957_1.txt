We went.  We tried.  We won't be back.  The great anticipation of a real NY deli was all for naught.  When the best thing on the table is a cheeseburger, there is a problem  Corned beef was dry, sliced way too thick and tasteless.  4 out of 10.  Fish and chips was second best to the burgers, smallish bits of fish in too much batter.  Our waiter was friendly but more suited to stand-up.  He delivered a burger, announced \"burger, no onions\" and didn't even look at it or he would have seen plenty of onions poking out.  Prices are way too high for the quantity and quality of the food.  Nothing horrible, just mediocre and disappointing.  Judging by our experience, the reviews here and management responses, this restaurant needs some work.
