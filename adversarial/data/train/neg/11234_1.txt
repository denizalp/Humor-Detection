This was my first time ordering from here, I had the Curry Chicken with Steamed rice, and the Pineapple fried rice. Both were very good, the curry had just the right amount of spice. The restaurant was clean and the two ladies working  the front were very friendly and extended a warm greeting upon entering.  I will definitely be coming back here and trying other items on the menu, this place could easily go up to five stars after a few visits if everything is as good as what I got today.
