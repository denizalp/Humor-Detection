Cool place but was greeted with someone shouting to turn the video off.  I had my cell\nphone up taking a video of my entering the door.  Would be nice for a 2 dollar sign to be posted ahead of or on the entrance door.  I exited just to see if I missed a sign and apologize for doing so, but I couldn't find any sign.  For a fabrication shop, the signage could be a lot better.  Shitty 1st impression, no matter how nice his work is.  It's dime a dozen out here.
