This place isn't exactly known for brunch but they do have a hearty, if short, brunch menu. I tried the maple bacon French toast. Delicious, perfect French toast served with bacon coated in peppery brown sugar and served with caramelized bananas. Large enough for two people, certainly. Service gets an A+ the server was prompt, checked on me frequently, and was very sweet. Do Not order coffee- even after three sugars and half a pitcher of cream, it tasted like motor oil- absolutely undrinkable. (There is a Starbucks across the path.)
