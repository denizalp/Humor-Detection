I am a Pilates beginner (one year) and more than happy with the training and philosophy at Delta Pilates. Alexis has a natural instinct to support my fitness goals and does it in a way that motivates me to keep going. If you're committed to the practice, she will create an ongoing platform to make it fun yet focused. I often get frustrated with my body's limitations but she finds alternative options and has the gift of patience! In the past year, I've made a lot of progress with abdominal strength, articulation and endurance. She also taught me how to properly breath with a workout to gain the maximum performance. The studio has the latest equipment, a friendly staff and treats customers in a great way! They make it about your goals which is refreshing when compared to other facilities who don't personalize the experience. Thank you!
