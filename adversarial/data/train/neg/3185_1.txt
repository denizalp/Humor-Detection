I'm a sucker for an outside tiki bar. The patio is beautiful and very spacious. There are tables for dining in, an outdoor bar, and lounging areas. \n\nI went there for dinner for a friend's birthday. We got a few appetizers and I got a chicken salad for dinner. Nothing too remarkable, but the prices are rather high for the quality of food. During this visit our server was rarely seen and it was too loud for her to accurately hear our order. We made the mistake of going on Thursday: biker night. \n\nI did go back for the view though! It's not a world-changing spot for food, but it's an excellent environment for meeting up with a friend for a drink. They have plenty of tasty mixed drink options for your sweet tooth.
