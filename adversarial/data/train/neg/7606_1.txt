Back home Midas is who I knew I can always trust, and it seems to be the same here! \nI called in to make an appointment for a tire rotation and an oil change on a Tuesday and they were pretty booked. I wasn't able to get in until Saturday. When I called in I was asked if I had already printed a coupon or did I need them to print me one. I loved that, I'm all about saving money! \nIf you check in here you will get a coupon, unfortunately it has to be the right coupon for your car so I was grateful that they had one waiting for me. \nI dropped my car off and I was called a hour after of 2 suggestions for my car. I decided to also go with a alignment for my vehicle and that took another hour. I do recommend running other errands if you can. They do have a small waiting area if needed. \nI have also stopped here to get a battery check at no charge that took less than 5 min!
