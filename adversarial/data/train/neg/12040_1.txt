Aside from great tasting food with multiple vegan options and really interesting specials, the people who work here are awesome! They're not only nice but also really care about their jobs and you can taste the love in the food. A great way to get a feel for the food is to try their $5 bowls - you get to choose one of their mains (jerk chicken or pork, curry goat or chicken or a vegan option like jackfruit, pumpkin or chana\/chickpeas) over rice and peas. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu though! You get a really great feel for the neighbourhood if you sit outside to eat too.
