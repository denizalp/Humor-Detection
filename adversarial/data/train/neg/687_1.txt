The office etiquette on the phones is terrible & every time I have called in, I get placed on hold by multiple people. Not only is the office personnel rude but the dr. had me wait until 12:30 to see me when i called ahead for a 11:15 appt. Yes she takes time to have a thorough visit with her patients but this is a business and punctuality needs to be taken more seriously. If you choose nursing as a career, you should understand that service should be a top priority at all times!!!!!!!
