My family worked with The District to sell our older home in Phoenix.  It was a second home and we wanted to sell it and use the proceeds to buy our daughter a newer home.  But, we are a very busy family working 6-7 days a week in our business and did not have the time to deal with repairs and updating.  We calculated the lost hours and costs involved in upgrades and then compared them to the hassle free price The District offered and decided it was a win-win situation.  We dealt mainly with Maddison who is a genuinely nice and professional person.  There was no high pressure to take their offer.  They gave us more than ample time to consider their offer and once it was accepted they went immediately and opened escrow.  They gave ample time for move out once the closing was complete which we really appreciated.  It was the smoothest sale of a home that I have ever been involved with and I would highly recommend The District to anyone considering selling their home.  It was a very easy, uncomplicated transaction.
