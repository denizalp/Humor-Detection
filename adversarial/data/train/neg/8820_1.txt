Bad service,  cold burgers.  The bun was good.  Bucket of beer deal was good to bring into the place.   Fries were bland and cold.  The shake was not worth the money and we were given them for free due to the bad service.  The place only had 4 other tables with customers and the people on the other tables seemed to have it worse than us.
