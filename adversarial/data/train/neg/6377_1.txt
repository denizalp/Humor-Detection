My soon to be father-in-law recommended that I come to Towne Jewelers.  I am extremely happy that he did.  The first time I went in was to buy an engagement ring and Fran was a huge help.  I explained what I was looking for my price range and directed me to a case with very beautiful rings.  We found a couple that matched what I was looking for and she even showed me a couple of rings that matched my style that already had the diamond setting.  Within minutes I knew I found the perfect ring!  Fran took the ring to the back to re-sized and cleaned.  While I was waiting it felt as if we had know each other for a long time.  Fran and Joe are both very friendly and are interested in you.\n\n8 months have gone by and my fiancee and I went back to Towne Jewelers to pick out her wedding band and my ring.  This time we worked with Joe and he is also very friendly.  We told him what we were looking for and he pointed us in the right direction.  Jessica tried on a few rings and Joe showed us what it would look like with different combination of bands or what the ring would look like if we had bands on both sides of the ring.  While Jessica was still looking I asked Joe about the Mens rings and he pointed me to a case with a lot of nice rings.  I tried on about 4 and picked two, one as a show ring and another as a daily ring.  We also did the same thing for Jessica she picked out the band and then picked out a very pretty daily ring.\n\nWorking with Joe and Fran was a great experience!  We never felt pushed or rushed to make our purchase.\n\nI will be making all my jewelry purchases from them.  Quality jewelry, friendly service, and they go the extra mile to make sure you are happy.
