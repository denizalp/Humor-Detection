On my latest trip to Las Vegas I stayed in THEhotel and ended up going to Border Grill 3 times.  It is just that good.  If you are staying at Mandalay Bay or THEhotel you HAVE to go to Border Grill.\n\nPrices are decent especially for Vegas and the food is delicious.  I have never had something I didn't like.  My favorite was the brunch tapas menu.  For a set price (I think it was $20 for brunch plus $5 for mimosas) you get unlimited tapas and mimosas.  The tapas menu had about 20 items on it and everyone I had was amazing.  I was so full I had to stop.  The plantain empanada, mini burito, and Machaca Chilaquiles were particularly amazing.  My mouth is watering thinking about them.  \n\nThe service was also amazing.  We had a group of 10 and it was very fast even with the large group.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating.  \n\nOverall the food is inventive and delicious.  If you are in Las Vegas you should definitely try Border Grill especially for the brunch.  AMAZING!
