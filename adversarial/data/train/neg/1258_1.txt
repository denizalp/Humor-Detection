Took my son there so he can play and have some fun. I bought a card which gave him unlimited plays for one hour and that hour could come fast enough. Idk if there is any manager on duty at this branch because the employees who work there clearly don't care. Pretty much all the tables were dirty when we got there and had not been cleaned when we left one hour later.\n\nMany of the game machines were out of tickets. So after playing and racking up points we waited for tickets to come flying out of the slot in vain. \n\nThere were a lot of kids playing (as expected) and quite a few of them were not being supervised by a parent or guardian. Some of the kids were climbing into the games which contained balls to retrieve the balls. There were 3 kids on the carousel with basketballs, trying to shoot the balls into the hoop across from the carousel while it was moving. But there was no staff from chuck e cheese on the floor to ask parents to have them stop this unsafe activity etc.\n\nThis place is pretty much ran like a zoo. Actually a zoo is more organized because they keep safety in mind. I have taken my son to dave and buster and sports connection etc. and the environment was much safer and more fun.
