The hubs and I moved into this neighborhood a few months ago. A couple weeks ago we decided to try out Spuds. \n\nThey have some great beers on tap and good prices to boot! \nWe were way stocked to see they had hush puppies on the menu! \n\nI ordered the patty melt and the hubs ordered some monstrosity of a burger that looked like they put almost a whole package of bacon on top of it! They came out fast and looked picture perfect, BUT the meat was a little dry\/poor quality. Im going to have to go back again and try another burger...if they upped the quality of the meat this place would be in the running with the original wineburger, as everything else was amazing!
