I really enjoy Thai food, and I'm excited to eat it anywhere I go. My friend that lives in Mesa says that people at her school really like it here, so I was thinking I was really going to enjoy their food too. \n\nWe ordered their pad thai and thai spicy fried rice. Their fried rice looked really good, but it wasn't as good as it might have looked. Their pad thai was the most different pad thai I have ever tried, and it wasn't in a good way. The pad thai tasted really acidic and didn't have that savory flavor that has come with all the other pad thais I've had everywhere else. I usually don't like to waste food, but I really couldn't force myself to eat it. Maybe it's just how they make it in their particular part of where they are from, but it doesn't fit my taste buds like other places do. It could be an off day for the chef because I've heard people enjoying it, but it just wasn't a good dish when I came to eat. The service was good which made it nice, but just be forewarned about the food.
