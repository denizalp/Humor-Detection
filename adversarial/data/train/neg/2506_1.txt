I had an appointment, had me sitting there for 20 extra minutes past the time while about 7 employees sat and chatted... \nFinally get to me and they tell me it's gonna be 2+ hours to get my screen fixed? I can go to the little Asian man and get it done for half the price and half the hassle. It doesn't take 3 hours to change out a screen. Get it together.
