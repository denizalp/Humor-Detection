We stopped at Peachtree for a glass of wine and appetizers. The place was comfortable. Unfortunately though not only was the bartender cranky but he made us feel like we were a bother to him. Then we order sweet potato chips which were $9. The chips were burnt and was about one cup total. So overpriced and bad quality.  Couldn't recommend this place to anyone.
