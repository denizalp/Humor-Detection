A year and a half ago I brought my little angel home and was looking for a reputable vet that was also close by. I came across this spot and thought I'd give them a try - it's only a 10 minute walk from my place. At the time, my French Bulldog was only 8 weeks old. Fast-forward almost 2 years and I'm still going to Dr. Debski! His wife and their dog are often there - the whole family is lovely!\n\nDr. Debski is very knowledgable and is always patient and willing to explain things. I find him fair with his prices and has even went out of his way to save me a couple bucks when he can. I find him to be honest, helpful, and very accommodating. The receptionists are always pleasant which is nice since that is your first impression. \n\nYou can see and feel the love that this family has for animals. They always call my dog by name and give her some attention when she struts in! I was in recently to treat my dog's ear infection - the Dr. as usual was great and suggested I change her diet aside from treating the ears. \n\nIf my girl Cola could, she would say thank you, thank you, thank you! She's back to being her happy self and it's thanks to the staff here at Harbourfront!\n\nIf you're not satisfied with your vet or you're looking for - reputable vet to take your puppy like I once was, I would highly recommend this spot!
