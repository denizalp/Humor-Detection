Since my previous favorite hair salon ceased the business, I was looking for replacement and was happy to find Chatters nearby. Yelp reviews were shining, and I can only concur with the rest of the crowd - this is a good Chatters.\n\nGoing there for more than half a year now, feel consistently satisfied and welcome. Girls definitely know their job, and more importantly - besides being solid, fast-working professionals - they are genuinely friendly and interested in their customers. This is a big deal.\n\nI've been to the places where you feel just like yet another \"Bah-Bah-Black-Sheep\" getting shaved and gone, and no one cares. Not like that in this Chatters - every visit was a positive, personal experience.\n\nSo just wanted to thank all the ladies working at this location and invite you to check out their work - in my opinion, that'd be a worthy try.
