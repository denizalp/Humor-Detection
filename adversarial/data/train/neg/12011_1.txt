800 Degrees Pizza is a \"gourmet\" version of places like Blaze Pizza where you are able to choose a basic foundation of your pizza then mix and match toppings all you want!  The ingredients are higher quality than a blaze - I chose the margarita base and added pepperoni.  They also have a Blanca base mad a pesto base.   If you prefer, there is a selection of preset pies and also salads.  The one thing to keep in mind, it gets expensive fast.  Each topping is an extra charge, which is different than blaze and some toppings (buffalo mozzarella) are even more!  \n\nThis isn't a 5 star joint because of the cost and also the location and very limited hours.   Service was OK, but they seem incredibly understaffed and a bit slow.
