I used to eat here all the time when I worked downtown in the building she is in. She has some really good food! Her breakfast sandwiches are always fresh and amazing and her turkey chili is like the best thing on earth!! I've never tasted turkey chili like that I wish I could get down there more often but I'm literally uptown and I am hardly ever downtown anymore she makes some really great food though, really great food! I've never been disappointed
