Such a cute place! Super Instagram worthy :D This place is known for its shaved ice desserts but my friends and I were really full and wanted something small and lighter. We went for this Honey-almond brick toast with 2 icecream scoops (black sesame and matcha). The toast was super good! Two stacks of thick toasts, sliced in cubes for us. The ice cream scoops were really small tho. Black sesame icecream was good! But the matcha didn't taste like matcha at all. It tasted like... One of the flavours of the Magnolia brand icecream that i can't remember haha...  Anyway it was good as a whole ! Decent price. Like about $8 after tax. My friend's and i would definitely visit again to try the shaved ice desserts.
