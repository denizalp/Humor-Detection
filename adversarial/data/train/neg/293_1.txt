We went in just before the lunch rush. We sat down and our drink orders were taken. It took another 15 minutes for our food order to be taken. I will say that in that 15 minutes the lunch rush came in, so we understood. However, there was not apology or acknowledgment of our extended wait. We saw several of the parties that came in after us served before we received our food. About 25 minutes after our order was taken we received our food. Just as we saw two parties who came in after us headed out the door.  We were finally asked how the food was by an employee (not our waitress) and after telling him about our experience. We were told the full kitchen staff was working, but the wait staff was short. He said he did not know why it took so long for us to be served.  Our main problem was the lack  of apology or acknowledgment.  I really wish I had a pen so I could tell them that the two dollar tip that was left was not an indicator of how cheap I was, but how bad the service was. \n\nAs for the food, i was good, but not amazing. It definitely was not good enough for me to forgive the faults and try this place again.
