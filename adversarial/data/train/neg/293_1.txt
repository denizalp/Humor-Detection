The staff was friendly and the food was pretty good. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place too! I'm not usually a seafood or a bbq sauce fan, so me giving this place 4 stars is kinda saying something! I got the Butterball (I think that's what it was called). It was turkey done two ways with a choice of two sides. The smoked (?) sliced turkey was a little dry, but the flavor was amazing. All in all I would definitely go back again!
