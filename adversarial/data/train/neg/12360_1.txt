3\/5  \n\nits in need of a renovation thats for sure....\n\nno frills all you can eat restaurant.\n\ni would say this is the cheapest all you can eat place in markham.  If anyone knows of another place .. please let me know.\n\nits 19.99 on weekdays and 21.99 on weekends... however they have a promo for 10% off if you do not want one of their specials \"lobster sashimi\" \/ sea urchin... etc... many of the other ayce places are offering the same promo.\n\nfood is not TOO bad... not as good as places like matsuda but worth it if you go with more people because you do save a hefty amount.  \n\nThey try to copy the mango yogurt from matsuda\/sushi shizun in shot glasses.. but they put it in big cups and it taste like crap.. its not the same type of mango yogurt you think or expect.. \n\nthey do have an awesome steamed egg milk dessert which is pretty good...
