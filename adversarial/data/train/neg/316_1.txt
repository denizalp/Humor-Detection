Very nice cozy place. I got the ginger black bean sauce stir fry with beef and I really liked the beef. Veggies are just so-so. But there's a lot of other stuff on the menu that I must try and I will update review later on for that. \n\nMy friend also got the cheesecake tempura with his entree and appetizer and he pretty much loved it. I'm not a cheesecake fan overall but it looks pretty good. \n\nI've still got to try the crying tiger salad since it looks good. Oh, if you need more rice just ask :). They also have sticky rice. \n\nWhat I always give bonus for is the service. David is the one that served us and he is extremely hospitable and friendly. Chef Lisa also made sure to ask her guests how the food was so they are both very friendly. Always a plus to see owners actually caring about your experience. They interact very well with their guests. \n\nPhotos are posted for my order as well as the crispy fried tofu and the menu. ^^v
