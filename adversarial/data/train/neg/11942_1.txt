Went to LV for a Quick weekend getaway before school got back in session.\n\nAlways wanted to ride a segway so we call Segway LV and booked a fremont street tour. \n\nWe had a blast with our tourguide Steve.  Very knowledgeable about the strip and saw a LV we had not seen before.\n\nGreat Tour!  Would highly recommend Segway LV to folks wanting to try something different in Las Vegas.\n\nThey are starting up tours to Red Rock Canyon...definitely on my list next time in town.\n\nNice Job Guys!
