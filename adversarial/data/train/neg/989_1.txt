Yes!! This place is everything a restaurant in Scottsdale should be. I loved the indoor\/outdoor space with a great bar and decor. I ordered and devoured the green chili chicken quesadilla with garlic beet Crema drizzled on top. Pair that with a margarita and you're golden! I opted for the prickly pear margarita because...when in Arizona.. I will say it wasn't the best margarita I've ever had but it was tasty.  My husband loved his plantain bowl! It's so great that you can choose between crispy or soft tacos or a bowl as well as all the sauce options brought to your table. Can't go wrong at Diego Pops!
