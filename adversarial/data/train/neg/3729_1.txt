My husband and I decided to go back on our own after we have been there with a large group -and enjoyed it even more! Happy hours margaritas were delicious and the food was fresh full of flavored and yummy! The service was a good as the food! We are highly recommend this place for authentic Mexican food that made practically a front of you! We'll be back soon!
