1 star. Came after wonderland. The bar & server crew was very unprofessional. 2 girls were on break and sat beside us that worked there & were running around and yelling and screaming. So loud I could not hear my friend that sat in front of me. My food was also burnt along with my cousins. Would not go back. They need to hire or retrain staff for professionalism.
