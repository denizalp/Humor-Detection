Were staying at Henderson last year. One of the valet asked us if we need any restaurant recommendations, and he suggested Chada. Didn't expect such an elegant restaurant from the outside. Had a great meal and left with happy tummy. We visited Vegas again last week, and just had to come back. The Panang curry is great,  just as I remembered. They're famous for their duck curry. (I opted for salmon instead since I'm a pesco-veggie) The wine selections are great. Will definitely be coming back if we visit Vegas again.
