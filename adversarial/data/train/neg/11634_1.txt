I can't rate the food because we didn't even get a chance to try it. Saturday afternoon.  130pm. Not busy at all. Staff wandering around not paying any attention to us or the party that came in behind us. After about 5 mins we were seated outside. Another 10 passed. A server came out to clear the several dirty tables and didn't even look in our direction. Service really needs a meeting to review how to serve customers in a timely manner.
