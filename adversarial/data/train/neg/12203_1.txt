I like this gym a lot. The staff is friendly, the place is clean and well-organized, and there is a wide variety of classes at convenient times for women looking to squeeze in a workout on their lunch hour. The vibe is nice - part gym, part spa. I love that there are women of all body types, ages, and skill levels here. The gym is very welcoming and encouraging in that respect.\n\nThe only downside I've run into is that the area set aside for weights is quite small, and there are only a handful of benches and mats so it can get a little crowded if you're trying to do a circuit or stretches.
