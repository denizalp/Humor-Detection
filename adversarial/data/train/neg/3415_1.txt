Don't wast your time!!!\nI went today to have my headphone port replaced and here's what happened. \nI made my way to the head of the check in line and when I got to talk to the \"genius\" \nI asked him do you replaced the headphone ports here at the store or do you send the phone out. His answer was no we do those repairs in house. Great put my name on the list. Ok sir it will be about 2 hours. I wait 2.5 hours to be seen by another \"genius\" this one asks did you try different headphones \nDhaaa about 4 new sets. Ok let me try a pair of mine. Ok yours must be magic headphones but go for it. 1\/2 hour later he comes back with a pair of his and guess what....they don't work. He looks at me and says the port is not working \nYa think!!! Ok change it out. Oh we can't fix it but I'll sell you a new phone.what do you mean you don't replace them? The other genius\" said you do that's why I waited 2.5 hours. Sorry he's wrong.  \nAt that point I thought it was best I just walk out without saying another word\nOn my way home I called Smartphone city in Matthews asked if they do it. He said sure come on in. By the time I walked in and out with a new headphone jack installed in my phone was 15 min the cost $59. \nI took a hand full of there cards and will tell everyone I know how great they are!!!\nDONT WAST YOUR TIME AT THE APPLE STORE FOR REPAIRS.
