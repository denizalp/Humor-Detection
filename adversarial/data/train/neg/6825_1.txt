So Hash is like the Midwest on mega-roids.  The portions are cow-sized, my friend finished like 10% of her chicken and waffles.  My buddy ate most of his grilled mashed potato stuffed double cheeseburger that was almost the size of his head and I don't know how he was able to walk out of the place.  I wanted everything on the menu, happily ended up with the corned beef hash, also way more than I could finish.  I will probably never stay at the Rio, but I will definitely go back there for lunch at Hash, before I want to take a serious nap that is.  I will probably order two entr√©es for a table of six.  And the price per serving size has to be the best deal in town.  This place is ludicrous in all the best Midwest ways, down to the barrels of wheat and portraits of corn decorating the place.
