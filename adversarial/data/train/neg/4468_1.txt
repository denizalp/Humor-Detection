Why am I reviewing a post office? I don't know. Everyone knows that the post office is the WORST PLACE in the world.\n\nI get it. You're angry; I'm angry. Everyone hates the post office. But at this one, not ONLY do you get to wait for a painfully long time (more than 30 minutes) during your cherished lunch break, but you get to be abused by disgruntled public servants while you're at it.\n\nAvoid, obviously. You probably won't find a shorter wait anywhere else, but you may find nicer people that don't want to burn you for filling out your addresses on the front counter. Or, you know. Try to do something like buy stamps. Or send a package. Etc.
