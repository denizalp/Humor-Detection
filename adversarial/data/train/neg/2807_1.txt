The half hour wait in line to be seated was expected, but then it took over an HOUR to get one burger. Everyone next to us, even those seated after us, got their food before us. We were offered no compensation, the food was not very good and over cooked. It's over hyped....don't waste your time going. If there was a negative star rating, I would give them that.
