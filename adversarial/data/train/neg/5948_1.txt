These guys were great. Billy and Jared showed up and assessed my situation. They arrived ahead of schedule and stayed until they made sure everything was working properly. They were extremely nice. They checked all of my vents and made sure everything was in proper working order. It was literally 90 degrees in my home when they got here. Thanks, guys. I have cards and will recommend you to highly. I had to call a manufacturer representative to verify that the machine was broken or faulty. Upon further examination the representative noticed that the hoses connecting the The washer Were reversed. He then switch the hoses and the machine worked perfectly. I still highly recommend this company and appreciate that I was not charged an additional amount of money for a home visit.
