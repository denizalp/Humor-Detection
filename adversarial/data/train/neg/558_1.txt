This is by far the BEST car wash in the Valley (unless you are getting a hand wash detail). I love the new equipment.  I love the different price points and I LOVE that they have people guiding you into the tire guides.   It's also a perk that they give you a dash wipe and air freshener.  Drying time could be a little longer.   \n\nI think it's great that high powered vacuums are offered for free as well as the air to get into the cracks and crevices.   \n\nThis place is so good that I was able to convince my husband to bring his Porsche here.  \n\nKeep up the great work!!
