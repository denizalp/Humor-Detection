Bass Pro is always an experience.  It's great to walk into such a large sportsman's store like this.  Their prices are no doubt high... Their sale items are reasonably good.  They always have special things for the kids during the summer and holidays.\n\nNow for the bad.  I've never had a good experience at the firearm counter.  Their prices are again high.  But the worse part is the staff.  They are all grumps that don't seem to know much about firearms.  Pulled a number and I was next.  As he was showing a gun-noob a shotgun he just really didn't seem to care.  I stepped back to wait and as he was showing the Rem870 he proceeds to take the gun from the customer and he sweeps and holds the gun right facing toward me?  WTF?  Really?  Waiting patiently for my number to be called he starts helping every and anyone.  Why draw numbers then?  After seeing some guns that he obviously knew little about, he wouldn't even show me where some other items were that I was looking for.  Awesome service?  I think not.
