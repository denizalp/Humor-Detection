this place is a must visit and experience. there fully staffed with barbers who all have different skills but from what i saw and experienced today. its truly a craft that there blessed with and it shows from the amount of business flowing through the doors all ages. i went today and brought a friend and some family here and we all left feeling like new people this will be my new offical way to spend my saturday morning\/evening. good people with great vibes and family orientated. football always on tv's around the shop and sometimes they bbq as well in addition to selling some good hair products and hard to find retro air jordans. rich got my taper all around just righti will be back
