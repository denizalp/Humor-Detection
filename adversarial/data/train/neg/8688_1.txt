Man, that is annoying.  Placed a take-out order at the bar.  25 minutes later I asked the bartender where the order was and it had been sitting at the stand at the front of the restaurant getting cold for 10 minutes.  Not that hard.  Also, turkey burger disgustingly undercooked (like unhygenically) and salad gloppy (though  bartender indicated all dressings were on the side).   I've been here 20-30 times and while it's not my favorite burger around there are things on the menu I like (Old School Thick Cut Salami sandwich, among them).  Still, so many chefs are doing this downmarket thing and Bspot definitely seems like its slippin'.  Borocco is opening something in Crocker Park which I'm hoping will be worth skipping this place for.
