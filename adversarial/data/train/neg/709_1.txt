A Nevada Plumbing is a great company to deal with. He was on time, on budget and very professional.  I had a broken hot water heater and  he came out within the time frame he had told me and installed a new water heater and even cleaned up after himself.  He explained what he was doing at each step and gave pointers on the operation and maintenance of the water heater.  He was very pleasant to work with and I would highly recommend him to my friends and family for their plumbing needs.
