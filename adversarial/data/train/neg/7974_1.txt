This was my second time coming - the first time was just after they had opened and I thought the oxtail pho was quite good but expensive for what it was. Today I took an oxtail pho to go and was very disappointed. The quality was drastically different- almost no meat on the scrawny pieces of oxtail- mostly bone. The broth wasn't very flavourful this time either. In my opinion a good pho broth shouldn't even need any hoisin or lime or sriracha. Sadly this one was so bland I needed to use extra sauces to make it have a taste. And the meatballs in the oxtail soup were inedible- they were so hard and rubbery I spat out my one bite. Definitely not worth the $13 + tax when you can get bigger and tastier pho just about anywhere else in the city.
