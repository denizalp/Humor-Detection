My grandson's favorite store. I took him to 3 of the craft nights for kids a couple weeks ago, and he had a blast. Only $10 and they made several fun crafts. The third night, he insisted on saving his favorite part of his dinner to share with Ruben. \nHe can't wait until he turns 7 and is old enough to take the beginning woodworking class.
