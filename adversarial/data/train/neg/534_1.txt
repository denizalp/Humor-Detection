Twice I found very long waiting times to get a lane at the \"other\" range just up the street from Gun Garage, and didn't want to wait that long.  Fortunately, upon leaving, I noticed Gun Garage.  I'm glad I did...  I really like this place.  Everyone was super friendly, and the place just has a fun feel to it.  I spoke mostly to Casey, and some to Melani. Both were polite, and helpful.  I shoot at least twice a month, and I will definitely be going back.
