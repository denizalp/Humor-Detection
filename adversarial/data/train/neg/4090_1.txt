This place is legit and Gus is great. A tad eccentric--but great. I went there because I had a Living Social coupon for a custom suit. I upgraded and spent extra but whoa. Totally worth it because I LOVE the finished product! I had no idea there were so many decisions, but I liked that. \n\nMy only (very minor) complaint is it took a little too long for my liking to actually get the suit after picking everything out and getting the measurements. Plan ahead and get there at least a few weeks early if the suit is for a special occasion.
