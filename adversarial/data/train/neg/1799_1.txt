I was in the store earlier today and Edgar was so helpful. I grabbed the wrong size shirt and after trying it on and realizing my mistake, I asked Edgar for assistance. He was friendly, knew the store and merchandise, and was able to get me in and out of the store quickly. The gentleman at the cash wrap was very nice too, he had blonde hair and was wearing a blue and white striped button down shirt. Love this location, and the staff is always great! Will definitely be back :)
