Reviewing this place before I even walk out of the restaurant after eating THATS how good it was. If I could rate more than 5 stars, I would. First time eating here and everything was amazing! It's basically a build your own stirfry noodle place. You pick a noodle style, veggies, protein and sauces then they stirfry it all together for you.  There's also an option of putting it all in a broth so it's like a ramen noodle soup. You can make it a meal for an extra $3, which includes their republic fries & special dipping sauce (bomb!) or the edamame which you can get plain or spicy garlic (the spicy garlic is killer) and a fountain drink. Everything tasted amazing. The ambience was super hip and trendy. This building sat vacant for a long time so I'm happy someone has taken it over and turned it into something wonderful. The customer service was outstanding. Spent some time speaking with Ann, Jackie (Jax) and a few others who informed me it's a family owned business which is always a major plus in my book. They were all so friendly. They offered a sample of their homemade ginger ale which was very refreshing; if you like ginger give it a try! I really can't say enough good things about this place. We will definitely be back no question.
