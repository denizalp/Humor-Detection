Our plumbers, Kenneth V. and Frank, just left and we were just waiting to write a 5 star review! We called the main company number at 7:30pm for an after hours emergency due to a pipe burst causing us to have to turn our main water line off. Within 30 minutes, Kenneth and Frank showed up to our home and got to work.  They showed us what they were doing each step of the way and even asked how we wanted the new water faucet line positioned so that it was to our liking. \n\nThey stuck around quite a while and answered our many questions. Kenneth was patient through it all and even gave us a pretty much Home Plumbing 101 course because  we were asking so many questions Lol. Keep in mind, the only reason they were here was to fix a broken pipe where our water hose attaches. Kenneth schooled us on main water lines and sewage lines (and showed us where ours were), home filtration systems, and suggested maintenance we can do ourselves. Being first time home owners and this being our first home emergency we  were thankful for all his knowledge shared. \n\nAlthough we would prefer to not have a pipe burst, especially when it's one exempt by our warranty, they definitely made the situation bearable and surprisingly pleasant. We would highly recommend Kenneth and Frank again and will definitely request them for all future service calls (although, we definitely don't  want future plumbing issues).
