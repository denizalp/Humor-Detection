I've spent a lot of time at this Chocolate Cafe.\nFree wifi and chocolate, you can be entertained for hours!\n\nI used to drive out here because I didn't like the location on Saint Denis.\nToo many students and bad service.\nWell, this location had fewer students.\n\nThis place is great to take a date or friends visiting from out of town!\nI used to always get the hot chocolate with ice cream (insert the fancy French name here) and the salted caramel brownie (insert the fancy French name here).\n\nPear and dulce de leche crepes,  fondue is fantastic!\nFlambe crepes... a bit more booze than crepe.. but you are in Montreal after all!\n\nThey even have salad with chocolate dressing!\nThere are a lot of things I'll eat chocolate off of, but lettuce isn't one of them.\n\nGreat dessert place though :)
