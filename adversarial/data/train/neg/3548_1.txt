This review is solely based on the chocolates.\n\nMy coworker, a native of Chesterland, showed up at work one day with a bag of chocolates for me.\n\n\"Here, Rachael\", she said, \"have these chocolates from a placed called Farmer in the Deli out in Chesterland by me.\"\n\nExpecting just a regular ole chocolate, I took a bite into one of them. \"Holy moly, this is realllyyyyyyy good!\" I exclaimed. \n\nApparently, this place has bulk fresh chocolate that you can grab by the handful- my coworker had grabbed me a bunch of milk chocolate peanut clusters and caramel ones as well. The chocolate is so fresh and the peanuts are good peanuts- not cheapo ones, but actually fresh peanuts.\n\nI gobbled up my bag of chocolates like it was no other. Now, I have to go there to have the full experience!\n\nGet the chocolate. :)
