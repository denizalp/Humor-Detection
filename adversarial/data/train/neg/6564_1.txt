This place is definitely one to check out. It may be a little expensive but the healthy food that they provide is worth it. I ordered their apple cinnamon pancakes with bacon and this chocolate shake. It all filled me up pretty quickly and was fantastic. They do use wheat on their pancakes which is something I wasn't expecting but still was pretty good. Staff are very friendly and are quick at the service. The place looks very clean and well established.
