Needed a plumber in an emergency for my rental property. Rich was extremely timely getting back to me and came out later that day! The price to come out was reasonable as other services in the area couldn't come out same day. He replaced the pipes in my kitchen as they had rusted, and we did not realize. \n\nHighly suggest Rich and his services!! He was professonal and knew his stuff!
