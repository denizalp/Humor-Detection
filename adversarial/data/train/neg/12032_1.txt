I was a progressive customer. \n\nI was informed that the online discount would not be applied because I have an iPhone and they won't let me electronically sign the agreement with an iPhone. \n\nI was told to get on a PC to electronically sign it. \n\nI did not know progressive only gives PC users the online discount. I promptly signed up with Geico and canceled my progressive insurance. \n\nIncidentally, I went from minimal coverage with progressive to full coverage with Geico for $20 less a month. \n\nIt took longer than 15 minutes to save with Geico but at least they do not charge me extra for being an iPhone user. \n\nGood by Progressive.
