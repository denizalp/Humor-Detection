Honestly, I feel bad for writing this review since the owner was soo nice. But this shawarma was not the best I ever had, like the owner promised. It was actually terrible. No garlic, carbage instead of rice? No flavour etc. \nI stopped by here since I was hoping to find a good shawarma place in the area, as it seems like Toronto and Scarborough have the best shawarma. End result; I'd rather drive to Toronto for shawarma.
