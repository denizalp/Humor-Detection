Calling an Air Conditioning company gets me all worked up because I never know what kind of business I am about to encounter on the other end of the line. Unfortunately, this kind of company has a really bad reputation by association.  I needed to call someone because (of course) our A\/C stopped working on the day that Arizona had record temps for March! I called AZ Dukes of Air simply because of the Yelp reviews I read. I am so glad that I called this company! The appointment was set for two days later. They did call me the next day stating they could come earlier but unfortunately I was not able to be home. I want to let everyone who reads Yelp to know that every part of my experience has been outstanding; from the first call to the end of the service!  My husband and I felt the company had fair pricing and provided education on what was specifically wrong with our system.  We didn't feel like we were getting ripped off by being sold something we didn't need. You never know how things are going to turn out because there are many companies out there that don't care about the potential repeat business.  AZ Dukes of Air obviously does. It's obvious in the reviews here on Yelp and it's obvious with the service they provided to my family. I now have a VERY cool house thanks to AZ Dukes of Air. If you want great service, fair pricing and caring people to handle your A\/C needs please stop looking, and stop reading and call them now! I want to thank everyone who helps make this business a success. My future business will be given to no one other than AZ DUKES of AIR! That's a promise!
