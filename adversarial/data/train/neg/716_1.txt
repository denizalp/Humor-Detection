My boyfriend and I were given a Wolfgang Puck gift card, and found out there was one in the MGM where we were staying. When making the reservation, the hostess asked us if we were celebrating anything. I informed her that we were celebrating our 3 year anniversary and that we were in a long distance relationship.\n\nWhen we were seated and brought our menus, I was so surprised. At the top of their menu, they had \"Happy 3rd Anniversary\" printed on the top. Yes it was something small, but it meant a lot to me. We both ordered the linguini pasta with shrimp and it was amazing. We ended with creme brulee for dessert and it was delicious.\n\nThe wait staff was great and we never had to really wait for anything to come to our table or for our drinks to be refreshed.\n\nThank you for making our anniversary dinner so great!!!
