Disclaimer: I didn't pay for my lunch here.  The office i'm working in got takeout from Peppermint Thai the other day.  Which was odd, because when it arrived it was pretty clear I was the only Asian food aficionado and I had nothing to do with the restaurant choice.  \n\nAt any rate, I ordered tofu pad thai spicy (3\/5 here) because that's my go-to Thai order anytime I'm trying out a new place.  I really liked some things about it-- I loved that it was topped with a bunch of chopped peanuts, had a good hint of lime, and the tofu was fried perfectly.  On the downside, it wasn't quite as spicy as I'd hoped for and the sauce was quite a bit sweeter than I normally expect.  Not my favorite iteration of the dish, but it passed my test-- if they can make decent pad thai, I'd be willing to branch out and try other dishes in the future.\n\nBased on this experience, I probably won't switch Thai food allegiances from my normal go-to, but I would definitely try it again if offered to me or if i was in the neighborhood.
