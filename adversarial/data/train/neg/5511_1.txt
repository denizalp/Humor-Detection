First time here at this location, the staff was very friendly, energetic, engaging and welcomed us soon as we entered. We soon got seated was offered coffee and they leave the coffee pincher on the table. I ordered the waffles, cream on top, turkey bacon and egg over easy. My husband ordered the egg omelette spinach, green peppers and onions. The banana nuts muffin was super good. We did not leave anything on our plate and I hardly finish my breakfast unless its good! The bathroom has an Outhouse sigh, that's a nice country touch. Also, cleanliness throughout the restaurant and overall awesome experience. I would of given a 5star but I nothing special to separate from other EggWorks. It would of been nice to ask, if it's our first time, offered their best or favorite dishes to try out. Otherwise, if we're ever on this side of town again, we know that this would be one of our breakfast option to go to.
