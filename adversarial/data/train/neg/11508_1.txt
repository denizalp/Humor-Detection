Food was great. \nTurkey pastrami sandwich was fantastic, also tried the salad and fries.\nEverything was superb, highly recommended!\nIf you're going with a group of people, recommend you make reservations.\n\nJust fyi, the only reason I'm not giving this place a 5 is because the service wasn't the best when I was there. Bartenders and even the hostess were rather inattentive. Also, this is not the best place for vegetarians (one of my colleagues who I was having dinner with was a vegetarian.... not many options).
