We had dinner at Pei Wei again last night and While we were waiting for our dinner I overheard a customer asking if they had tofu lettuce wraps...Because all that was listed was chicken lettuce wraps. To my great surprise the waitress said yes,we can make tofu vegan lettuce wraps for you! Guess what we are going to order next time...yup you guessed it...the tofu lettuce wraps.
