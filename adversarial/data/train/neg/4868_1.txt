The most awkward dining experience I had in a long time.  High quality food with diner like service.  Not sure if you should dress in a shirt and tie or in tshirt, jean and baseball cap.  The food is high quality, the presentation is that of a white table cloth restaurant.  But food is served on chipped plates and the waitress is someone you expect from a 24 hours diner.  Nothing really goes together.  Come here for the food.  The decor is warm but don't expect much else for the money.  Plus the menu is limits to 3-4 entries.
