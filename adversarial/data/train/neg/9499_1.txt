From the gray carpeting to the dull green walls, the cheap fixtures, the lack of art or music to the so-so food and slow service this place can best be described as dull, bland and boring mixed with no ambience at all.  Playhouse Square has done a real disservice to itself and it's patrons by leasing this space out to this operator.  Time for Sammy to retire.
