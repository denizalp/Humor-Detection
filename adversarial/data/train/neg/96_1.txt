If you've got the money, stay here. The lobby\/elevators\/rooms are adorned with very beautiful art and architecture. During my last stay here, I kept asking my boyfriend what he thought of the marble floors because I looooooved them. They have a security guard 24\/7 checking room keys, a food court, the grand canal shoppes, a Coffee Bean (not a Stabucks wah), great fitness center, pool area, and solid Wifi in the rooms.\n\nThis hotel is also centrally located, which makes it easy to walk to many other clubs and hotels (XS, Encore, Treasure Island, etc)
