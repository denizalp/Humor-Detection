The person who did my lashes Britney did full classic set. She did decent job and told me lashes can last 3 or 4 weeks. I like them.\n\nThe woman who did my eyebrow wax was the worst. Told her what i wanted and everyone but her is capable. She claimed to know how to wax and do lashes etc. she however told me to come back for refills every two weeks. \n\nI wouldn't trust that woman to do anything for me ever again. \n\nAlso didn't like how they had me so lashes before wax.
