This is one fine Japanese restaurant.  The omakase experience is extraordinary and the ingredients can't be more fresh!\n\nSitting at the bar allows you to interact with the chef and see their delicate and skillful techniques while they prepare each piece.  The attention to detail and subtleties add so much to the flavours of each unique piece of sushi.\n\nThe steady pace of the meal leaves you comfortably full at the end in such a way like it's the healthy pace and portion to eat at.\n\nWhat used to be priced at $80pp was a steal.  At $105 I would call this fair market value.  An optional $25 upgrade for a premium sashimi is fair too and the meal is pleasant whether you opt in or out of that.\n\nProbably not an everyday meal sort of destination but certainly a great way to indulge for a special occasion.\n\nThe only drawback?  You gotta book way ahead to ensure you get a spot!
