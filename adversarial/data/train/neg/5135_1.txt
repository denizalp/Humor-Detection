I moved into Bakery Living about a month ago and so far it has been a really good experience. The staff is fantastic - they bend over backwards to make sure you are taken care of and that everything is going well. It's a great location and it only takes a few minutes to get anywhere in the city. It is within walking distance of the bars and shops in Shadyside which is convenient and the park next door is great for early morning runs. The apartments are modern and although the pool is small, there is a nice area to hang out around it.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the construction going on around the apartment. Most of it happens during the day while I'm working so it isn't too much of an inconvenience and as soon as they pave the road to the parking garage I will hardly notice it at all. That should be done in the next week or two so after that is done I would give these apartments 5 stars.
