I have been a fan of Vintner's for the past 2 years, always recommending this place to my out of town visitors with great results.  But I have to take a star off for the snooty attitudes of a few of the hostesses, as well as inconsistent service at the bar.  The food has always been spot on for me, and we have tried just about everything on the menu.  But on several occasions, the girls were a bit uppity, which doesn't sit well with me...seriously, why do some of these service industry workers think this is acceptable?!?  And a few times at the bar, the bartender had given less than attentive service.  I no longer sit at the bar for this reason...and I like to play video poker.  Oh well, I will still keep coming back for the ambience and food.
