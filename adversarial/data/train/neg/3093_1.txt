I read the other reviews on yelp and knew I had to give this place a try! I wanted my nose pierced really badly, but also wanted a cute stud to go along with it. They have a great selection of jewelry ranging from more affordable to luxury (I splurged on a small diamond). I'm planning on coming back to get my upper lobes done!
