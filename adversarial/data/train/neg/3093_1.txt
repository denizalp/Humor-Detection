Well this place takes me back. Discovered the restaurant in 2012, and has been my go to Hakka restaurant since then. While not without it's flaws, I definitely consider federicks to be one of the best Hakka restaurant within the York Region area.\n\nFood: While they do have a wide variety dishes to choose from, my go to items will always be any of their Pakora dishes, consisting of a number of deep fried meats or vegetables, I would consider them great starters for anyone unfamiliar with Indian cuisine.\n\nWho can forget Chilli Chicken; if you're a big fan of Hakka food, then you should know that if you going to be eating at one of these joints, you have to try their chilli chicken. I repeat this is must try dish! Be warned though, it is not for the faint of heart. This dish can be killer if you're not prepared for spicy food, but it can also be terribly addictive.\n\nService: Attentive and fast service, with my experience at the restaurant, I ever rarely had to flag down a server for something that I needed. Conversation with the wait staff was never really thing, but the restaurant is more about speedy service if anything.\n\nAtmosphere: Simple decor, nothing fancy. Dining area can get very loud and not much intimacy in the restaurant. More suited for Hangouts and family gatherings, you wouldn't be bringing someone here for a first date.\n\nRecommendation: One of the best Hakka joints in the York Region area so I would suggest stopping here before heading to other Hakka restaurant.
