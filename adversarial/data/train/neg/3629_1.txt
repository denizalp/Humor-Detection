I got my 80s and 90s LIFE at the Roxbury on July 7th, 2017. I think my favorite thing was the showing of music videos when you walk in. The dance floor was cool too but at one point it was so packed we could barely cabbage patch but that just shows how popular Roxbury is. I was surprised to see so many youngins  but it was a decent mix of them and us over 30 crowd. It is only $5 to get in which is great, I've been to some places where it is $10 and up. I love how they let you in free if it's your Birthday. I'll remember that for mine in August.  I'll be back but my only complaint is the weak drinks. I had a Purple Rain and a Valley Girl and it was like drinking koolaid, really sweet koolaid. They need to be a tad bit stronger. I saw a few people complain to the bartenders about their drinks not being the best.  Next time I'll get a beer like the majority of people were getting. Staff were all friendly. Can't wait to come back.
