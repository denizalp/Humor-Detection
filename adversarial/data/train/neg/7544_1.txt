A Saturday evening seating for four...old neighbours reconnecting after 10 years.  Although quite small inside the Lemon Bistro made up for their stature in delivering great food.  Low points were the men getting served first and the fries with the beef tenderloin served in a coffee cup. Our waitress was quite attentive right up until we paid our bill.  It was then that the tee-shirt & ballcap \"bartender\" (who didn't know how to make a simple margarita) started clearing our table and interrupting our jovial conversation.  We let it go, until the another tee-shirt staffer again barged in across our table and pulled smaller plates & water glasses, blocking our conversation with no notice as he reached across our table blocking our conversation.  No apologies from either.  Then the hammer dropped on us when we were told (@ 8:45pm) by the ball capped bartender that they needed our table for another sitting and that we needed to hurry up...whilst our wives were finishing up their full glasses of wine.  I was PISSED, but to avoid embarrassment with our guests, I met ball cap bartender at the front door.  I said to him \"that wasn't cool.\"  He simply remarked \"I appreciate this\", but I quickly and harshly replied \"well, I don't appreciate it and nor do my guests!\"  Ball capped bartender just thanked me and I noted that we would NEVER be back.  Thus, my one star for ruining what was a great night with great friends based on the very poor judgement of two individuals that simply don't get it when it comes to simple customer courtesy.  Too bad as the food was great, but the final piece of their customer service was atrocious!  Guess we found a real lemon, so I will find another gem next time in Markham, where staff treat their paying customers with respect and a spot that can handle making any drink desired...so many to choose from.
