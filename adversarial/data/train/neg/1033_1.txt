Teresa, I believe was the manager's name, is simply the best manager I've seen with this company! I ordered some bras online a month or two ago. I kept a few and didn't like the fit of the others. I called to inquire about the return policy and she was very helpful. She ended up taking care of me in store to settle the return. Though I was unable to find anything else I liked in store, Teresa was happy to process my return without question. \n\nI, again, ordered bras online and had them shipped to another location for pick up since it was more convenient to my home. I tried on the bras at the time of pick up. I loved one, but not the other 2. I tried on another bra in store that I loved! That manager was unwilling to price match because she said it needed to be the same bra. I've never had an issue with this in all the years I've shopped with Lane Bryant. It bothered me, so I was walking to put the bra back. At that point the manager at the other location told me she would go ahead and price match the other bra for me. I appreciated it, but at the same time, was still a bit bothered. If you tell me you'll only price match the same bra in a different size, but don't have any of that particular bra in stock, what's the point of having that type of policy? Why not have more flexibility? Again, I'm glad she opted to price match and let me swap out the bras--I LOVE the one I ended up finding!\n\nGoing forward, even though it's a drive for me, I will stick to this location for all my buying needs. The service at this location is far better than the others!!!
