We visited on a Saturday evening, and had no problem getting seated quickly on their patio.  The weather was perfect for outdoor dining, and the service was top notch.  I eat out regularly, and have rarely had a waiter as perfectly attentive (kept our waters filled without always being in the way).  He had a great drink recommendation for my friend who couldn't find what she was craving.  The food was also to die for.  The Figgy Piggy sandwich was deliciously unique (fig jam, brie and other cheeses grilled together), and my friends enjoyed their spicy cornmeal pancake with friend chicken and salads.  We will definitely be back!
