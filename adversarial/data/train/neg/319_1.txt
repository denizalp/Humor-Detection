One of our favorites. We order pizza here a couple times a month. Dining there is always tasty. Nice variety of items on the menu. Gets very busy and a little noisy but worth it!\n\nHighly recommend their catering services for parties. They work with various dietary restrictions, make excellent dishes for large groups. \n\nTry to save room for true New York style cheesecake.
