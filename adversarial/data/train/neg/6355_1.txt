We waited almost 2 hours for a table of 6 and it was not worth the wait. Food is overpriced for the quality. (entrees are at least $22) We saw our busser\/food runner more often than our waiter who only came to take our order, bring our food and bring the check. He didn't even introduce himself or ask us how the food was. \n\nThe bad: You're entire group has to be present and then your wait time starts. It would have been a lot better if the hostess told me that crucial fact when I put my name on the wait list. She quoted us 45 min, that passed, then she said another 20 min, that passed, another 20 min, that passed, 15 min, finally a table. Get a reservation if you really want to try it.\nGot the pomodoro and the sauce was runny and watered down. My friends got the lasagna which is massive and the eggplant parm which was ok. The white wine tasted watered down, and didn't even smell like wine.\n\nThe good: unlimited wine. The red wine was actually ok, it's more sweet than dry. The salad and garlic bread was bomb. The \"cappuccino\" (it's hot chocolate with a shot of caffeine and whip cream) was good. The portions are big. It's a fun atmosphere (the accordian guy can't really play well but bless his heart he's adorable!) Food service is fast. \n\nDon't think I'm coming back, or recommending this place to friends or guests unless they want the unlimited wine.
