This was my first time here and I would have to say I was very pleased with everything. The space in here is huge. It's a great place for a big group of people to come and enjoy one another's company.  They even have karaoke so if you like to sing and drink, I highly recommend this place. The food here is amazing. It's so delicious and the price is very reasonable. The staff here is very welcoming. I can't wait to come back.
