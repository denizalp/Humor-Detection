Had a wonderful lunch here today. We started with a hummus appetizer that came with freshly made (warm!) flat bread. Yum! Then I had a falafel wrap, which came with a delicious small Greek side salad. Everything was so fresh! My husband had the giros plate with rice, which he said was also delicious. And, of course, we ended the meal with baklava, which was perfect! I highly recommend this restaurant. Oh, yes, everything was clean as a whistle, including the bathroom!
