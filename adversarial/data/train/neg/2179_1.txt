I didnt really like this place for the first two times. However, there are not very many chinese breakfast place in sauga and I was craving for it so I decided to give it try again....\n\nIts funny that I actually enjoyed my taiwanese sausage sandwich this time and my husband enjoyed his house special pork sandwich. \n\nI guess we will come back again! And hopefully we will have great experience every single time.
