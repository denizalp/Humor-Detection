Their boba drinks are good.  The Thai iced tea is good too.\n\nThe snacks they serve there are actually better than the drinks. \n\nYour order always comes out in a timely manner, even when it's busy.\n\nMy only complaint is that not everything on the wall menu is available..  They need to update it, because I'm one of those people that are into the items that they no longer serve.
