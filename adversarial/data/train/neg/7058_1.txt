Just checked into 'The Hotel'. Originally had reservations at Mandalay Bay, but then were told we should 'upgrade' to a \"suite\" at 'The Hotel' for $20 plus a night. Long lines at the check-in when we arrived, the bartenders at the bar close to the check-in did not seem interested in serving any customers. And now - the room: OLD SCHOOL TV Really?! They still exist? And, even worse, that big monster of a TV is hidden in a closet and the doors do not open up to the sides, only straight out. Man. So only one person lying on the bed right across from the TV can see anything. Second, this \"suite\" is small. We're three people and there's only one bed, but two rooms. Well, great. Big bathroom - but no space for another bed. Pretty disappointed so far. Encore is still the best place in Vegas for me.
