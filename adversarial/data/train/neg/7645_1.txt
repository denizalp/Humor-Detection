Everyone I know has been talking about Honey Salt, and obviously we HAD to go. Frankly I was disappointed. The menu isn't very extensive and the prices are a little high for what you get. The food was good, but not spectacular. I'm willing to give it another shot, but I'm not keeping my hopes up. Many other great places to eat in Las Vegas.
