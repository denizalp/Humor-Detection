Went in there to look for a specific SUV and the salesman, Sam, was telling me that every SUV I tried was the \"perfect\" fit for me.  He was pushy and overall not very helpful.  Did not like the managers there either.  Decided to go next door to the Jeep dealer, where they treated me a whole lot better, not pushy & listened to what I wanted.  Ended up getting a Jeep for cheaper than a small toyota SUV.  Would not recommend Right Toyota to anyone!
