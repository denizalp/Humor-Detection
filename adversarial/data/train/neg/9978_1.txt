This place was very cool, the house is historic looking, lots of wood on the walls, cool doors etc. the happy hut deals are awesome. We had the perogie which was amaze balls, as well as the fried Brussel sprouts, equally amazing!! The drinks were good as well- the put in bay zombie was good, as well as tavern draft. The beet salad was huge and was a half-I have no idea how big the big one is! I switched feta for goat cheese and highly recommend doing so! The maple vinaigrette was a little too sweet. Everything we ate was perfect. The flavors and seasonings were just right. This is a cool place, if you're ever in the area you should stop in and check it out!
