I needed a suit for a conference and Nelya was so helpful! She assisted me in starting a change room, and continuing to get sizes for me as I continued to try on. She searched other stores just to try and find the specific item I was looking for. She went out of her way to take care of me and followed through with me even though alterations and exchanges due to some good fortune of the size I needed appearing on the rack. Thanks Nelya in suiting!
