I went there with a few friends on a Monday night. I enjoyed the free popcorn and it had a nice vibe. The bottom floor has a nice vibe. Alot of hipsters in the upstairs part. The bartender was a nice older lady who let me know when they were running low on 50. The other bartender was a guy in his 20s who was also very cool. Drinks were reasonably priced and it had a decent crowd for a Monday. I'll check it out again next time I'm in town.
