I made a yelp specifically to review this place so I really hope this gets posted...\n\nFOOD: MEDIOCRE \nSERVICE: UTTERLY HORRIBLE\n\nWhoever is running this establishment knows NOTHING about about customer service.\n\nMy group arrived at 10:30, was seated at 11 (the wait for a table was understandable) and waited for someone to tend to our table for 15 minuets... we did not even get waters... after a waiter finally came to take our order, we noticed groups that arrived after us were getting their food while all we had were empty water cups. \n\nFINALLY at 11:57 (an entire hour after we were seated) after every other group in the restaurant received their food, we asked to cancel two of our orders because two people out of our group could not eat meat on Sunday (aka in 3 minutes) and the staff said they were unable to substitute any meat for tofu. After those two people in our party left because they were unable to eat ANYTHING, the last 4 of us waited ANOTHER 15 minutes for our pho to come out (which was not even hot btw???). We did not even receive the 1 pork banh mi we ordered until we asked where it was, and even then they gave us the wrong order and served us a BEFF banh mi!!!!! \n\nThe staff did not even know how to apologize properly, or even provide better service. They just kept trying to blame everything on the kitchen staff. At least refill the empty water cups!\n\nAt the very least those two kids working the front of the house need to be fired or trained properly because I have NEVER been to an establishment this unprofessional\/confused before. Everything mentioned in this review was LESS THAN HALF of the horrible service we experienced. \n\nNEVER COME TO THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU LIKE TO STARVE AND GET SERVED COLD FOOD AND THE WRONG ORDERS
