Brewsters used to be 5 stars for me - just try the Blueberry Beer; it is amazing! The food was always great, and service fast. The Asian dumplings for example are incredible; light and not too doughy paired perfectly with sweet chili Thai sauce. Great summer patio and the McKenzie Towne location has an even better roof top patio.\n\nThen last fall they took a turn for the worst. They started only hiring the zombie-blond \"Earl's-style\" servers. They also took off the best salad - The Rio Grande - don't know why; it was the most popular off the menu. The year before that they took away the cod boxie (fish on a potato pancake; amazing!) and they killed off dumpling night and steak night.\n\nThey brought out new dishes that are mediocre at best (Cantonese chow mien stirfry for example), and they cut all portion sizes by 20-30% while increasing the costs 10-15%. \n\nI emailed the manager and he forwarded it to the head office where they sent me a template email and proceeded to not care.\n\nWhy Brewster's why? I used to eat there 2-4 times a week; now I have not been there in 6 months with no plans to return.\n\nI still eat the dumplings once a week; no one does them better except for me - I found out that they are a Sysco product and ordered me a case of 200 for $35.\n\n\nok... I have said my piece; all that being said the food is still better than most pub's and the beer is still great. They brew their own and it is fresh and cold.
