Stopped by for a beer as well for some food before my flight. Unfortunately, took roughly 12 minutes for me to have been greeted but our server sincerely apologized. Yes you do have to expect that at the airport food will be on the more expensive side. However for 10 bucks CDN for 23 3\/4 oz of beer, I'd say it's pretty reasonable.\n\nOrdered the jerk chicken sandwich with the side of fries, sandwich was alittle small to my liking but the chicken was incredibly tender. Beaides, at an airport, ur not looking for gourmet cuisine at a discount, rather a quick perhaps filling bite that'll do the job before you get on your next flight.
