The chef's tasting menu salmon was delicious. Service was fine for me, but I can see why others reviewed negatively. Don't come here if you're pressed for time (I know it's at an airport and all, but they haven't mastered their operations yet). Allot about one hour for your dining experience, and you should be fine.
