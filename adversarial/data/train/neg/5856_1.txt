Penny Electric just got done doing my pool. They did and awesome job. I emailed my prints to them and got a quick response. They were referred by 2 people I know that did pools. I still interviewed other electrical companies but felt better about penny even though prices were close. They showed on the day I had them scheduled with 4 guys and blew through it. I had a little miss communication with the workers. I wanted  to install light controller I bought not the standard one. I didn't know there was more work involved to install. I payed in full then received a call few days later saying I owed hundred of dollars for labor and materials( pipe and wire) for controller they added. I spoke to one of there supervisors and explained situation. I then explained I didn't know extra cost involved. The workers didn't say nothing to me about it. I told them I will work it out with them just not paying full price for something didn't know was being charged for. Supervisor said it was a miss communication on everyone's part and that if I just paid the minimum hook up charge not even close to 100 he would eat the rest. I said I want to do want ever is fair for you guys also. Supervisor said just pay install and we all even. Excellent service. Penny didn't have to do that and could of leined my property if didn't pay whole thing because I technically added equipment. Want to say thank you to  Penny and all the employees I dealt with. They made it easy and simple and did a great job. Highly recommend them.
