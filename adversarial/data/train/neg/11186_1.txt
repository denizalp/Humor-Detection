Horrible place. This is my usual nail salon but after going in to take my acrylic nails off, the lady removing them for me was very rude and pushy. She used an electric filer to file down the acrylic but she continued to file down my natural nail!! It started to burn!! Will never be going back to Regal Nails.\n\nAnd if I could I would not rate this any stars.
