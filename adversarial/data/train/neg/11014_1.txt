This review is solely based on one visit: The first showing of the day on a Tuesday, while most kids are in school. Also, the movie had been playing there for a couple of weeks. 1. I realized I might not have enough cash as I stepped up to the ticket booth. Had one of these discount Regency theaters in LA, near where I used to live. They didn't take cards at first but now they do. This said \"$5 minimum for Credit Cards\" so I asked about debit. He growled while pointing to the sign, omitting the word \"Credit\" when he repeated what it said. A bit dickish, but whatever... Wouldn't have been a problem for a regular movie but I was there to see a 3D film. Found some more $$$ in the car and happily bought my ticket. 2. Perused the snack bar. Pretty much the same as the one in LA, in terms of pricing. Or first-run theaters, for that matter. This is where theaters make their money, the door receipts going to the studios. At least you can still get a hot dog for a dollar, though. Not bad. 3. The seats were surprisingly comfortable. In LA, the seats are old, worn cloth ones. These were fleather and quite comfortable. 4. Presentation. The first trailer was in 3D so I put my glasses on. The rest were in 2D so I took them off, then put them on again for the feature. Kind of silly. Maybe they could put the 3D trailers right before the trailer. UNFORTUNATELY, the image was a bit dark, blurry, and washed out. I'm not even sure how that happens. Lucky for me, I had seen the movie before and knew what was going on in some of those darker screens. 5. Hit the bathroom before heading out. It was very clean. Sort of surprised to see so many complain about it in their reviews. Maybe they took those comments to heart or maybe it was just because I was there for the first show of the day. All-in-all, very much worth that $2.50 I paid to see a 3D movie.
