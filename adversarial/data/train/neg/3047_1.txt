It was first time experience in SUSHISAMBA, Las vegas. My experience was excellent. My favorite was Ishi Yaki Wagyu beef on Hot stone and Yamato roll. Wagyu beef was just melting in the mouth and was interesting to cook on the hot stone. Wagyu beef was so buttery to eat as sashimi as well. It was just so good. And Yamato roll was very tasty. Combination of tuna, foie gras, osetra caviar makes great combination in the mouth and gold leaf on top makes pretty decoration. Their cucumber martini is excellent also. I wish I can go back there soon..
