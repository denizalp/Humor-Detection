This location is pretty luxurious for a Fit4Less location. It's in the basement of the East York Town Centre and just opened in August 2015. The guy at the desk was friendly when I bought a bottle of water and said please and thank you and told me to have a great day. That's a level of service I've never seen at a Fit4Less. The space looks a lot bigger than the other two locations I've been too. There is a lot more equipment as well. It was practically empty, but as a new location I'm sure it will pick up soon. The washroom was large and clean. The paper towel holders were full and the equipment was all put back where it was supposed to be. There was a guy with a checklist going around checking to make sure everything was presentable. They don't have a tricep push down machine, only a tricep extension machine which is the opposite of the other locations. The tanning booths are really nice and this location features hydro massage beds. I think the most exciting thing for me was that I had perfect cell service even though it's in a dungeon so I can see an incoming call from work if I'm on-call or add a new song to spotify if the mood strikes (wish that could be said for the North York location, which even though is above ground I can't get a signal). It still doesn't have showers or classes but for $10 - $20 you don't really need them. I'll go back to this location.
