This place is a hidden gem. Not very convenient for me and in a medical complex. But the food is worth every bit of the commute!! To start, the fresh squeezed orange juice (chilled) is so refreshing. Each table is given some bagel chips and choice cream cheese to enjoy while ordering. The menu is very large, which is expected for a place like this. Today, I enjoyed the western omelette with home potatoes and a side bagel. The omelette was large and full of meat and veggies!! The potatoes were perfectly cooked! But the highlight of the meal, was what my father ordered..... the almighty fruit and granola yogurt parfait!! This parfait was hand crafted with a lot of love! It was over flowing with fresh fruit (apples, bananas, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, mango, kiwi)!! You must see the picture to fully understand the beauty involved!! I can't wait to go back and enjoy one of these on my own! A+++++
