Ravi is a neighborhood favorite during lunch hour - the line up of comfort food seekers is to the door, but they move fast!\n\nI ordered the soup and wrap combo - mushroom bisque and roasted free range chicken wrap. \n\nWhen mushroom soup is offered at any establishment, I ALWAYS order it. Unfortunately, the mushroom bisque at Ravi's wasn't as impressive as I expected. The taste of mushroom was overpowered by the amount of pepper used - the soup was more like a pepper soup with pieces of mushroom. There also wasn't the distinct taste of truffle oil. \n\nThe wrap was A-OK because the skin was soggy and wet. It would have been delicious if the skin was grilled till it was nice and crispy, but sorry soggy skin is my biggest peeve when it comes to wraps. \n\nI didn't get a chance to enjoy their patio because all the seats were occupied, so I got take-out instead. I will return when I'm craving for some comfort food, and give their other options a try!
