We had an amazing allergy friendly experience thanks to the attentive and friendly manager, Rosealie. Going out with dietary restrictions is always a gamble. Rosealie was extremely knowledgeable about the ingredients in every dish and was able to make accommodations for an enjoyable, safe dining experience.
