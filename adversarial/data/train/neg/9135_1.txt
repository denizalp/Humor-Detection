The food was good, but the atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired. The booths we sat at were not bolted to the ground and seemed worn and cheap. Our table and booth kept moving the entire meal. We sat next to a window, the blinds were dusty and dirty. There was food between the table and blinds...this was surprising with the restaurant being so new. We ordered the pub chips, would have been nice if they were warm....not just a basket of potato chips with ranch. My husband really liked his burger and my chicken wrap was just ok. Not much flavor. Just ok. Beer prices are good. \n\nThe biggest disappointment and surprise came when we finished our meal. The waitress walked over with her iPad and asks, without giving us our bill yet, cash or charge? \nMy husband then asks what the total for the bill was. She announces our amount and stands waiting for us to tell her cash o9r charge. We still have yet to see a bill...just our total read to us. My husband charges the amount on the iPad,  signs the iPad in front of her...all while she watches the tip we put on the iPad. It seemed very odd, weird and rude. I asked if we could have a paper bill, she said only of needed and in the back. We could have had the receipt emailed to us.  What happened to dropping a printed check out, leaving for customer to review, sign and leave tip in private. \n\nOverall, it was a good meal...just some odd things. I'm not sure if we will be back..the payment at the end may have ruined it for me. Maybe I'm just old school...
