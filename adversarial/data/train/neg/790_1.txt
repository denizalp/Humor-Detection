My boyfriend and I are big fans of the Hub.  I was excited to try this place out.  We were a little underwhelmed.  He tried the New York strip.  Asked for it well done and it came out medium.  Other than being the wrong temp, he said it tased pretty good.  We both loved the fries that it  came with.  I tried the Korean Short Ribs.  Wasn't impressed.  The short ribs were without flavor, thankfully the soba noodles were tasty.  I doubt that we will come back.  We will just stick with the Hub.  The menu is bigger at the Hub and the food is better.
