Horchata. Horchata. Horchata. Love it. Plus it goes well with any meal you get at Rollies (nicknamed it that when we were in high school 10 years ago).\n\nBean and cheese burritos for the classic. Add the green sauce, you won't be disappointed. If you're starting early and want a quick but still authentic mexican breakfast you can count on Rolando's. The breakfast burritos are always on point...I mean cops even come to get them!\n\nThey used to be open 24hrs but that changed to closing at midnight but still opening around 6am. \n\nIf you haven't been it's a must!
