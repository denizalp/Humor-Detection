I wanted to really love this place and would have to say our overall meal was good. The service and cannoli were outstanding. We started with the calamari and had a huge pizza half meatball and half cheese (for my son). They were both good but the sauce was not my favorite it's thick and sweet, too sweet for my taste. The dough was awesome thin and crispy just like back east and the meatballs were solid. I will go back and try some non red sauce based pizza\/pasta dishes. Prices are fair, the staff is awesome, it blows away any chain and it's owned by a local. I will be back for sure but there are a few other places around here I would like to try before I settle on a local go to pizza\/italian spot.
