Horrible.  Had to wait almost 30 mins for a GREASY pameal sandwich that came with fries instead of the promised salad.  For just under $20, they should get the order correct and it should not have greasy dripping out of it when you try to bite in to it.  If this is Lynn Crawford, she should be ashamed.
