Is this place hip, trendy or pretty in any way? No. Do they make amazing food? YES. Ive eaten here many times and tried several things...many of the curries, soups, the phad eggplant (which I get cravings for all the time) as well as many of their shrimp, chickn and noodle dishes. I have never had a bad meal here. Ever. The food is fresh, authentic and tasty. They will respect your need (or lack of) for spicyness. The staff is very sweet. I will keep on coming here and would recommend this unassuming place to anyone!
