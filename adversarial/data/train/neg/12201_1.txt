This place was quite nice very coffee house typical. I bought a cold brew coffee with almond milk and a delicious fog toast! The coffee was ok, you get in a mason jar not so strong. I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't get a homemade pop tart, i was told they only sell them on Fridays! Boo that was pretty wiggity whack but overall a good coffee shop but I loved the prosciutto toast.
