I am the type of person that makes last min appointments because well life is just crazy! Palace Nails always gets me in the same day. I usually see Chris, who has great customer service and always makes my nails look exactly as I request. Last appointment Chris was out and I saw Paula. I am always nervous with new people doing my nails but to my surprise she delivered the same great customer care!! My nails were perfect, matching my Pinterest picture exactly! Thank you Palace Nails.
