New dessert chain from hk! Read about it on blogto recently & was surprised to stumble across the restaurant when i was having dinner at the same plaza! Very clean, nice , modern with fake greens\/plants around. Washroom was clean with qtips, floss & even hair-tie for the the ladies! Service was excellent - our soda drink was flat & they quickly made us a new one. Dessert overall was just average. Appearance wise for sure wins but nothing outstanding. Would definitely check it out before the hype though!
