Great hot dogs ^^^ perfect tater tot's *\nI stopped in for lunch*** vegan dogs are the bomb :) fantastic quality and amazing sauces and dips . ok so they took over an old 1960's bar which is cool, but unfortunately didn't put a much into the place. The drop ceiling looks like it's ready to cave-in...I love gritty+ grunge but it's seriously like having an awesome hotdog in a run down \"Elks club\". It would be nice if they put a little more into the atmosphere.
