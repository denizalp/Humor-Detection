Line was short on a Tuesday night, burgers were great but they charge for adding toppings like lettuce tomatoes and onion on burgers that don't include it. I wish they had more topping options and told you how much to add them on the signage. Fries were good but cheese fries were nasty, regular fries tasted like they have no salt on them but have a good texture. chocolate shake is kinda weird and has a powdered chocolate (think Ovaltine) texture. so I'd give it 3\/5!
