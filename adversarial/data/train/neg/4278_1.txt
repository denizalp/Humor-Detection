Rick saved me! \n\nWe were planning to have a birthday party for my daughter on Sunday so we wanted the carpet cleaned on Friday.  We bought a groupon from IDT Home Services and scheduled the appt 2 weeks in advance. They never showed! No calls or anything and we were sitting at home for 3 hours waiting for them to come.\n\nFinally he came in after I called desperately to find someone to clean the carpets. I found him through yelp and they had a deal so I figured what the heck. Awesome job and we will use his services again in the future.
