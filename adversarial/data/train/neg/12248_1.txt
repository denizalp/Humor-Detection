UPDATE*****Our car arrived 9\/18, after being pickedup on 8\/25, so one week short of a month and a full week after the gave us a \"worse case\" ETA, 9\/11.\n\nAdditionally, the car had \"grease pencil\" writing all over the windshield, like cars coming off an auction lot, with code #s etc.\n\nThe car was undamaged and in working condition though.
