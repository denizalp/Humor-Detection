This place is a bit Americanized and not super traditional Korean. Which is fine, just good to know beforehand. We wandered in after the wait at District One was too long. The squid and pork belly dish had good flavors, spicy but not too much so for me, while it made my friend sweat bullets. The bulgogi was tough, gristly, and slightly too sweet. Of the 3 ban chan, the kimchi was quite good, the tempeh strips just so so, and the macaroni was the usual meh. I was born in Korea and personally, I've never understood the macaroni stuff....\n\nThe most notable thing was that our waitress, a middle-aged woman, was quite friendly and courteous, which is rare for a Korean restaurant. I don't know why, but Koreans generally don't give good service so it's always worth noting when you find it!
