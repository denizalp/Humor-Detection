I had my wedding here on July 2014. We chose the 2nd Asian menu (upgraded) and my guest overall were happy with the food. Many of them were giving raving reviews as work as it was one of the best venue they have been to as there was tons of food and very good quality\/portions. They were not skimpy with the food portions overall. We didn't have any issues with noise level at all. We were the bigger party and had a very good DJ with awesome sound system. So hire a good DJ if you are concerned about sound :)\n\nThe only con is that some guests said they didn't get any abalone slices while some did. Some guests said the rice seems kinda dry. My in laws think that the food that we tried for the taste testing is much better than actual wedding day but then again all food where it is mass produced won't be as perfect on wedding day. We liked how everything was packaged together and the manager Edmund was very good. He was easy to reach by email and phone. He is very nice and attentive. \n\nThey will ask you for the $$ on wedding night so make sure to have the $$ ready to pay them and have someone else take care of it if you want to relax more as the bride\/groom to enjoy the party instead of dealing with $$. Better yet, just pay them the day before and get it over with like some western halls. Everyone said the service here was good. Only con of the service is that they threw away my food at the head table and clear the table way too quickly\/early without asking people first. Some of my guests and even myself, our food was thrown out. Make sure to tell them to package your food and do not throw it out without your permission! \n\nFood I would give around 9\/10 and service is 9\/10. Everyone loved the dessert buffet and Edmund makes really good recommendations. He is a great manager but his staff, some of them are just ok especially since some didn't ask myself and my guests for permission before clearing our table and throwing our food out! Make sure to have a prep talk with Edmund about this so this doesn't happen on your wedding day!\n\nWe attend a few weddings after where they bride\/groom had a much lower budget wedding where they only spend around $50-70\/person for western food. The portions were skimpy, the food was not good quality at all and service was not that great. So if you want a good quality wedding with good food & service, then you need to expect to spend close to $100\/person or more. Upgrade the menu if you can because it makes a big difference. You truly get with you pay for when it comes to weddings :) :)
