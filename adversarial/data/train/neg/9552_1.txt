This location is great - plenty of seating with nice views. Sashimi isn't included on the lunch menu and we were warned about eating the fish and leaving all the rice behind. Apparently their strategy is to fill you with the cheap ingredients - keep in mind that they bring things out bit by bit so you end up having to wait between servings. If you're with a larger group, it can feel more like snacking than eating a meal. Overall the place gives an impression of cleanliness and seems a bit better than some of the other AYCE sushi places.
