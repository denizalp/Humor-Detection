Came here with a few friends on  a week day. Was going to order from the regular menu but then we saw some lunch sets that comes with soup and spring roll so we tried that out. \n\nFood: We ordered the House Pad Thai, Street Pad Thai and Basil chicken. Street Pad Thai was my favourite, the house Pad Thai was a little bit on the sour side but it was still really good. It was really nothing fancy but I think food was authentic.\n\nService: Staff was friendly and was able to answer our questions promptly.\n\nCleanliness: I felt the place looked clean. Washrooms were clean. \n\nDecor: Simple decor, again nothing fancy at all\n\nCost: Prices seem very reasonable. I've never tried their buffet but would like to give it a try.
