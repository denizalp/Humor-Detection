Dar's store is the best.  She sells quality clothing that is well made and lasts a long time.  If you wear a suit or sport coat every day this is the store for you.  She also knows how to fit and alter clothing correctly so you get a perfect fit.  Don't let the price scare you off.  I have suits I bought years ago that wear like iron and still look great.  Cheap men's store clothing is no value!
