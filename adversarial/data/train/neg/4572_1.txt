Ira has fixed many of my watches over the years. The whole family works at this small business. The level of service and civility is paramount. Not something you can hire sales clerks for. When I was out of town once and had a battery changed elsewhere my watch didn't work right. I brought it here and it had the wrong battery in it. The level of experience and trust is worth the extra dollar or so because it is done right. I never go anywhere else in Las Vegas.
