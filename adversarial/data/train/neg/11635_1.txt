My friends love this place. They visit Vegas a few times a year and make this place a regular part of their trip. They usually go in a group of 3-4 and the staff always treat them really well. Even convinced me to tag along on occasion and I'll admit that I love how they clean up the dead skin around my finger tips - hang nail problems go away.
