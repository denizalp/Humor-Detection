I'm always generous with my stars so I guess I'll give this place 5 stars, never had any bad experiences here. I always drink the blueberry ale but I tried the \"punch in the nuts\" beer and it's easily my new favorite. Taste just like peanut butter, I love it. The food is always decent, I feel like ppl are so quick to give bad reviews off silly experiences, yes kitchens do make mistakes such is life.
