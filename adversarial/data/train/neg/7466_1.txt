Wonderful food, definitely authentic. My favorites were the red bean sesame balls (super fluffy and chewy), the fried taro, the shrimp dumplings, and the congee. The egg tarts were delicious, I just wish they were a little bigger. The server was a little aggressive however, and pushed us to get two of a lot of the items we ordered. We definitely over ordered and had a ton of leftovers... And our bill was heftier than it should've been. Otherwise, an awesome brunch.
