Awful experience. Drinks were empty, had to ask multiple times, 2 managers walked by and were too busy talking and laughing to notice. Crab was impossible to get out of shells. Went back 3 times for top round and gave up it was never there. The sushi was warm. So sad because the hotel is SO amazing. I'm honestly shocked and disappointed.
