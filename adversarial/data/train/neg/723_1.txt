First of all, Groupon users don't have to be aware of anything, as stated in a previous review. It clearly says 1 per table and the bar isn't a table. Duh!. My hubby and I went last night.  We were seated very quickly and our great server Ricky came within minutes. He is a very pleasant person and a great asset to the business. Also, even from a distance, a blonde girl, who bartending, beamed with energy and was interacting with those at the bar all the time. It didn't go unnoticed. What a great atmosphere. My husband ordered the pernil, as he does at the bistro. I had the chicken. We were given the chips and salsa, the salsa could use a bit more tang, but over all good. Hubby also ordered the fuego (fuego) margaritha, with jalapenos, chilis and habaneros. He loves hot and boy it made him sweat, so he loved it. I had the mojito, staying on the save, but yet yummy drink, side.\nWe were wondering how they ever got that great chandelier up, must have been a nice job to do :)\nThe place beams with atmosphere and I really hope they will succeed. Groupon is a great way to introduce your business to the people. We would have never found the bistro if not for groupon. We will be back and tell others about this great, little spot.
