Fast, friendly, clean service. Reasonably priced for the area.  Have the usual OPI polishes and another brand. Offer gel and artificial nails and fills. I got the lime spa pedicure and a regular manicure. Pleasant experience. Sat in the massage chair and sipped the drink that was complimentary with the service. \n\nLocated across from Publix shopping center and next to Dominos and Jersey Mikes Subs. Located behind Gate Convenience store off of 521. \n\nRecommended and will return many times to come.
