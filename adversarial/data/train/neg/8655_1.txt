We had the beef shabu for 2 for $28 before tax & tip. It was a large portion of vegetables with some beef, and it comes with a choice of noodles OR porridge.\n\nThey also have a lunch menu with your typical bento options such as kalbi, teriyaki, I think bulgogi? etc.\n\nBy the way, the front of the store doesn't say \"Four Seasons\" in English. It says SHIKI SUSHI (四季 sìjì or shiki which means 4 seasons).
