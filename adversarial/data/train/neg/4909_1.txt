I had such a great experience here that I decided to create a Yelp account just so I could review these guys. I went into this place because the trackpad on my MacBook Pro needed replacement and I was really happy with the customer service. Unfortunately, they did not have the part in stock at the time but Jeremy ordered it right away and I was informed of its arrival as soon as possible. I mostly dealt with Jeremy and he is great! The rest of the staff also seem considerate, respectful and professional. \nI could have gone to the Apple Store or another place in the meantime since I needed to get my laptop fixed as soon as possible - but I decided to wait and get it done at GlitchFix just because the service was so great (even though it's completely out of my way, geographically). \n\nAll in all - would definitely recommend this place!
