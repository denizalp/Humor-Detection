So I stayed at the M Resort for 3 nights & guess were I ate dinner those 3 nights.....Anthony's! In those 3 nights I've had the 22oz Rib-Eye, 24oz Porterhouse, and the I forget the oz Bone in filet. I've also had the Alaskan King Crabs, green beans, scallops, cream of corn, & strawberry shortcake, Everything was fantastic! Wait staff was great, nice atmosphere and never a wait. The only downside was I spent more money on the food than I did on the rooms
