I used to love this place and do think the food was pretty good. Service on the other hand is something to be desired. I usually don't complain or leave bad reviews but in this case it needs to be done. I came there a few months ago to meet my friends for lunch I had my dog with me. I was told that it wasn't a dog friendly place. Usually I wouldn't care and go somewhere else and not pull the service dog card. In this instance I was meeting people there that drove from north Scottsdale specifically to enjoy your tacos. I told the bartender that my dog was a service dog and that I was fine just being on the patio. At this point he said he needs to see paperwork. Strike one. Illegal. I told him that it's illegal to ask but luckily I did have all her papers in an email. It took me some time to find it since she has been certified for a few years now. At this point my friends showed up and we are standing around waiting on me. Finally I get them her papers. Bartender says he can't let us in !!!seriosuly?! We talk to a female manager that was the rudest person I have ever had a displeasure of meeting. She said I had to be blind or deaf and that's the only way they would let us in\n!!! How illegal is that? Learn the law. After wasting our time making me look for the papers then insulting me we still didn't get seated. We ended up going to farm and craft and talked to the people there who told us the owner of diego pops was a dog guy and they were very surprised by the way we were treated!!! I should sue the place and turn it into a pet store that serves tacos for the dogs! Teach your staff the law when it comes to people with disabilities!!! https:\/\/www.ada.gov\/archive\/qasrvc.htmhttps:\/\/www.ada.gov\/archive\/qasrvc.htm
