I gave this new location a chance due to their Groupon. I have been to the CenPho location twice and my hair did not look that good. I am glad I tried this place....my hair looked great! I think it will give DryBar some healthy competition being across from Scottsdale Quarter. \n\nThe only thing that prevented me from the 5 stars was the lack of a foot stool when you are getting your hair washed and the chairs were a little far from the counter. I had to reach far to grab my water or magazine. Small things but not comparable to the Drybars. Great place though!
