Staying at the hotel next door I went in to check it out. There were 3 people in the shop including the girl at the counter and a guy stocking shelves. I wanted to say hi but she wouldn't make eye contact, much less say hi. I read the reviews and thought I'd at least buy some bread or pastry. I like supporting local businesses but decided to leave and go buy traveling snacks at Whole Foods where the people are nice. I don't like leaving bad reviews but it only takes a moment to smile and say hi. Everyone deserves that when entering a business. Especially when the business isn't busy.
