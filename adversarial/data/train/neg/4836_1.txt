This was by far one of the best places I've tried, and I'm always seeking good places to eat. It was pretty much third time lucky when I ate there last week - one time, the girlfriend was too tired to eat out, at Christmas we got there to find they closed early. So it was pretty much a last attempt and boy! am I glad I persevered. I don't care if the logic of the theme fails, as someone noted humorously - the food is good, awesomely good. Add in friendly service and a pretty good wine selection and you've got yourself a fun evening. \nThis is a small place and seating is limited. But once you get your foot in the door be prepared for a gastronomical experience past compare. I tried the risotto with chorizo and it was melt-in-your mouth delicious; my gf reported equal delight in her gnocchi with vegetables. To top it off we split a desert of chilli-flavored chocolate sauce with a pastry. Unusual to say the least and very, very good.\nWe had to sit on the patio so we missed out on one of their attractions - the open kitchen where you can see your food being prepared. That would have been interesting to watch as well. Perhaps next time, and there most certainly will be a next time, though I have to drive from Tempe to downtown for it! By the way, don't forget to rub the stomach of the Centurion by the door as you enter, you may get a free dinner!!!
