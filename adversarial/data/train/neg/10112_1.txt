So I've been to other casinos here in Las Vegas and many of them we're smokey. the Silverton Casino does not have the smokey smell as others do. The buffet was also excellent especially on Saturday. They have a great selection of food on Saturday only between the times of 4pm to 9pm. Polynesian Buffett.
