I preordered cupcakes for a bachelorette party in Vegas. I'm from out of state and was super nervous about it. However, making the order was super easy through email and over the phone. Best part was that the cakes were a huge hit. Everyone loved them and it added to our day. I ordered their strawberry cupcake filled with champagne mousse. The service was excellent. I would highly recommend this place. You'll be well taken cared of. It's as good as the reviews say it is. This is the place I'd come back to order again for future events based on my highly positive experience.
