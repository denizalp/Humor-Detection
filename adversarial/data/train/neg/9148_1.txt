We visited this store today and were assisted by Cesar 90% and Matt 10% and I want to say that these two gentlemen were awesome, listened to our concerns and recommended the bed for us to replace our 15 year old spare bed in the guest room. We ended up getting a tempur pedic bed but the price was out of our range so Cesar came up with a solution he found our bed we wanted from his \"clearance\" center which still has a full warranty on it and completely disclosed that it was non returnable, it was 35% off standard price plus gave us $300 in \"cool cash\" to use on anything in the store so we bought new cooling pillows and all in all it was a painless experience and we were done in about an hour. Thanks guys for the easy buying experience! Will be back for our next bed.
