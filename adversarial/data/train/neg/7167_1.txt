The owner is usually here and he is very friendly. I had the lentil soup that everyone raves about, it is good but mine is better! The fattoush is fab and the veggie dishes are all great. I always get the Mezza appetizer-  a plate of pure deliciousness!! Their tabbouleh is some of the best I have had. Great little place with good prices.
