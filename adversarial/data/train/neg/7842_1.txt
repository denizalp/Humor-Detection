This place was amazing! Me and my boyfriend like to go to Vegas at least once a year just to relax and we decided to spoil our selfs and stay here, by far the best decision we made. We got a queen suite the bathroom was huge as well as the bedroom had a few steps that led you to the other floor. It's a clean hotel as well as the staff is super friendly. The only thing that was bad about the hotel was the complimentary breakfast, they could do way better especially for the price you pay for the room. But besides the food amazing hotel, and for the makeup lovers a huge saphora downstairs
