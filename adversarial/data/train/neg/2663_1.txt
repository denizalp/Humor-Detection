Love this show, love this show, love this show.  Having seen Mystere last, was quite done with Cirque de Soleil for awhile.  But this was incredible.  \n\nAdmittedly, I am a huge Beatles fan which is the only reason I was willing to sit through another Cirque show.  But my husband is not such a huge fan (knows some songs...can take them or leave them) AND he hated Mystere as well.  So getting him to pony up for the good seats to this was a miracle!  We were at eye level and those seats were worth every penny.\n\nAnd we both walked away thinking that was one of the best shows we had ever seen.  \n\nThe fusion of the music and the dance was great. For those few who complain it wasn't Cirque'y enough - I say yay.  It had just enough funkyness to it plus just the pure talent of the acrobatics and dance to keep your eyes glued to everything you possibly could take in.  \n\nI say if you can possibly see this show - do it!  I would go back in a heartbeat for a second show!
