Came to Federal Galley for the 1st time this week and wanted to try out a couple restaurants, so I kept my order to a minimum at El Lugar & just tried out their shrimp taco. The mole sauce, the lemon aioli, fresh shrimp & homemade corn tortilla blew me away. So much flavor! The only thing is these tacos run pretty small, so keep that in mind when ordering. The flavor and freshness was on point, though. Can't wait to come back and try more items!
