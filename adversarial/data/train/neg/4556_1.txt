Harold & his team are just great! We took our old jeep with a bunch of issues, ie transmission, to Harold's and he got it back on the road working like new. It's such a troubling task to find a good and honest mechanic but we found him! Make Harold your go to guy! We have for all our vehicles. Harold's is very competitive and they find the best solution for all your car and wallet! We are so pleased with the quality of work and the price too.
