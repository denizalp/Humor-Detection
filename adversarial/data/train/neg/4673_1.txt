Applebee's. That's about what I can say for the food. You get decent chain restaurant food here. The main reason I am reviewing them is they have a late night happy hour in the bar area from 10pm to close. There actually aren't a ton of choices to get some food after 9 or 10pm in Las Vegas. So if you are hungry late night, drop in, the bar staff is usually great!!
