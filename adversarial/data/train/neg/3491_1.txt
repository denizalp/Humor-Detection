4.5 stars. Pretty stoked to have these guys in the neighbourhood. As others have said, the great thing about this place is the vibe\/atmosphere: chilled out, lots of natural light, pleasant, bright, thoughtful decor. Add to that friendly service, good wifi, decent music, bowls of delicious pho for $7 and $4 bottles of Canadian. I also LOVE that this is one of the few pho places that lets you get grilled chicken thigh in your soup--that smoky grill flavour gets all up in the broth and it's SO. GOOD. So what's not to like? Well, a couple of things: My biggest gripe is that I wish you could get their \"special\" soups in the smaller size: I love Bun Bo Hue and would be interested to try the Oxtail house special, but $13 is more than I want to pay for a bowl of pho, especially one that I will never be able to finish (I have enough trouble finishing the small size). Other than that, my complaints are pretty minor: pints of Stella for $6.50 are not actually pints but smaller, and often come with a ton of froth. Avoid takeout here--the portions are much smaller than you get when eating in. I could do with a little more greenery (onions, herbs etc) with the pho, but I guess you could always ask for more. My husband thinks the banh mi are a little on the sweet\/sugary side. Overall, though, I am glad they're here--a great, non-hipster addition to the Dundas strip, and definitely worth a visit.
