One word...Terrible. My son wanted to come here because he and his friends love the Dells location. This place however is NOT the same. Items in my dish were over cooked and under cooked, the place seems run down and messy, the staff appeared to be wearing dirty uniforms, most of the staff seemed to be hanging around the bar talking and acting unprofessional. No thanks...won't be back
