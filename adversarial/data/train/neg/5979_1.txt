There are a lot of great things about Megabus.  The price is incredible (Pgh to NYC for $65 round-trip).  The bus stops were easy to find in both cities.  The buses left on time and got to the destinations early or on time.  The drivers and staff were courteous.  The bus was clean.  The ride was smooth and people on the bus were very considerate.   BUT, don't count on the advertised Free WI-Fi or outlets at your seats working.  On both trips, the wi-fi signal looked strong, but it was incredibly slow, and that might be based on whether you are in the front or back of the bus (we were in front on 2nd floor).   The outlet at my seat didn't work on the trip there, and the one in the row my daughter was in didn't work on the trip back.    They don't advertise that they take a rest area break, but they do - it's around the half way point of the trip, and there is a convenience store with a Subway there.  The bus stayed there for 30-40 minutes so it was plenty of time to get food, etc.
