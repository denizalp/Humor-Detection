This was such a fun exhibit for my  10 yr old son.   The science behind the avengers tech,  both real and cinematic,  was interesting - I just wish it were marked more clearly what is science IRL and what is stark-tech.   I know the difference but  most kids would not.   I Love the video game driving iron  man with your eyes and brain waves at the end! Way cool
