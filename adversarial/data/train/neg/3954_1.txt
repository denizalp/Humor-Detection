Part of the fun is exploring. Sure I love the paneer, masala,  saag, rice, naan, pakora etc  but some times something new to me blows me away.\n\nThis is what Chili Gobi did. Coli flour in a light egg batter stir fried with pepper onions and spice. It is India meets china and its great. I would never have thought to order this but the commitment free nature of the buffet made it possible.\n\nThe puri rice was great as were all the other items. The naan has gotten better and the service is still spoty, but luckily its a buffet.\n\nbottom line the food is great and at 7.99 its affordable.
