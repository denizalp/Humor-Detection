I came by Thursday after lunch and decided to give this new coffee place a try. I ordered a Matcha green tea latte with soy. Wow. The flavour was really unique. I've had so many green tea lattes from different places and this one rises to the top. I go to Starbucks a lot  and always have to adjust everything because it's way too sweet. I was concerned about the sweetness level here and ask whether they put sweetener. For the medium size which I had they put 1.5 scoops of matcha. I decided to try that as is and it was amazing. The drink was not too sweet, the flavor was spot on with a twist. It tasted like they added a little nutmeg. The top had little foam and a nice espresso flower design. They had dark chocolate truffles for sampling and it was so decadent and delicious. The store had a great selection of baked goods and other snacks. I will definitely come back again.
