$1 happy hour deals! :)\n\nI came here two nights in a row for their happy hour oyster deals. Super fresh, delish & best of all... dirt cheap! The first night we sat at the oyster bar which I highly recommend only because they will put your order ahead of everyone else's! There were about 15 orders ahead of us (that's how busy they get!) and we were able to get our oysters within 2 minutes. The second night we decided to sit at the bar where they served alcohol so we can watch the football game on the big screen. Our oysters took up to 15 minutes for each order! I didn't have a problem with the wait at all since my hubby and I were just chilling and drinking for the night.\n\nThe oysters are medium sized and shucked once your order is in. It comes with a few side sauces that you can top your oysters with as well. I ordered their crab cakes (which is not on the happy hour menu) and they tasted okay. It wasn't as meaty as I expected it to be. I probably wouldn't recommend anyone to order this! \n\nIf you're ever in Las Vegas, I highly recommend you come here for their oysters!
