@Anne O.\n\nYou're horribly wrong on the price of toppings there. They are .95 per topping on the G\/F pizza, as it is only offered in a 10\" As the size of the pizza goes up, the price of toppings do, which makes perfect sense. My suggestion, give it a try for yourself. \n\nSome of the best pizza in the valley. It's not your corer pizza joint. This is like.... Pizza's version of fine dining. Give it a try, you won't regret it.
