Deana is the best stylist I have ever met. She made sure that she understood what I was asking for before beginning and talked to me about all of the possibilities to see exactly what I wanted. Her creativity is truly inspiring, not to mention she gives wonderful scalp massages and is such a pleasant person to be around. I have never felt more comfortable in a salon than at Deana's. It is clear that she really cares about her clients and making them feel confident in their look. She is truly the best at what she does.
