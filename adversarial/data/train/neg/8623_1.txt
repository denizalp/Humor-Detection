As short as two years ago, RRBC was one of my favorite joints in the Cleveland area. Not a weekend went by that we considered eating there, and not a consideration went by before we decided that we'd go. Today, it barely enters our minds as a destination. Sometimes, when we drive by, I stare at it a little too long, wishing it was the RRBC of old, not the RRBC it's become.\n\nWhile the beer recipes may be what have been brewed since I first dine there in 2004, it's just not the same. While the food is likely the same recipes, it's again not the same. Almost as if someone switched from hand pattied burgers to pre-packaged Sysco and figured it was good enough for them and the bottom line. And the atmosphere tries so hard to be Tremont or Ohio City with none of the charm. \n\nThere are a few bright spots, however; the french fries are still wonderful. The Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza is good, and the meatloaf dinner rivals any blue plate special out there in CLE+. The taco salad is filled with meat and more than enough for the money. \n\nWe don't go here much anymore, but, I think about it, and wish that it was how it was, instead of how it is.
