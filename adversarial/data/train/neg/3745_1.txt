I would give it 0 stars if I could. This is for service\/management:\n- very slow and often missing items\n- certain items never arrive\n- when ordering sashimi, they always gave less than ordered\n- gave us attitude when we requested specific number of sashimi slices\n- I had a bit of rice left on plate. They wanted to charge us extra for leftover food, or we must clean our plates completely \n- manager giving us the stink eye often when looking over at us\n\nI have never seen such rude service, and unreasonable enforcement of \"leftover food fee\". They also applied service charge on our bill. \nStay away.
