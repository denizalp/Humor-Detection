I LOVE the shelac pedicure! I'm sort of annoyed because no matter how often I SPELL my LAST NAME for the girl, she still gets is wrong, which is annoying when your'e a regular. But that aside the service is quick and everyone is pretty friendly. I wish they had longer hours though and maybe more chairs.
