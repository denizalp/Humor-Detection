I was there the last week of May 2015 and was pleasantly surprised. I actually hesitated going to this location after having read some marginal reviews but I was close and short on time. Boy, am I glad I did. The service was prompt and professional. In addition to the basics I have a front piece of plastic, that sits under the bumper, that is slightly loose and I asked if they could fix it and while they didn't have the parts to do so they inspected it thoroughly and said if I returned with some zip ties they would be willing to stitch me up for free. Excellent service experience!
