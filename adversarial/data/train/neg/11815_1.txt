Driving down Borderline Road, looking for something to eat, went pass this place and was tempted, after going another two miles or so we made a U-Turn (Not sure if it was legal or not) so ended up here and we're very glade we decided on this place, the whole pizza is VERY good! (even at the crust part-which sometimes I don't) and I would come back here the next time we are in the Tempe area!
