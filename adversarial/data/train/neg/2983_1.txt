Tonight we had some of the best food at this location that we've had in a couple of years. However, that was after walking out last night and observing what appeared to be some very slow service. There is not alot to choose from in the Tramonto area, and it's nice to have somewhere close, but our last few visits here have not been very impressive. The key problems - slow service, less then genuine service and inconsistent food. At this time, it is unlikely we will re-visit this convenient spot . Hoping things improve! :)
