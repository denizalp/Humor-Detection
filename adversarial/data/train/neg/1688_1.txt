Love the fact that the range has electronic lanes (preset at 10ft increments, however custom distance also allowed), but I do not like how the countdown timer doesn't work. The timer stays marked at 60min and gives the user a false sense of remaining time. Still, the fact that the shop has a good selection of firearms, and bulk ammo available for purchase. On top of that, they let you swap rented firearms (as long as it's the same caliber you originally rented) at no additional cost.
