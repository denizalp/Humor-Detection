I haven't visited this location since I lived in Costwald (a loong time ago). I escaped here on my lunch break and made it a point to not check my phone and just browse. With the outside hustle and bustle that lunch time brings to the Park Road Shopping area, the calmness is felt and admired.\n\nEveryone was super friendly, the books are neat and in order (I appreciate that more than I could ever explain) and I even got a free bookmark. Free is always good.
