This was a sensual delight! The chef's palate is similar to my own which is why I chose this restaurant. I often have trouble enjoying high-end restaurants due to my inability to find \"just the right thing\" on the menu to order. The chef has a lovely cheese course where you can order 3 or 5 cheeses from a delightful selection and it is paired with yummy bits such as raisin and sourdough breads, quince, dates, walnuts etc. \n\nNext, there was a delightful list of entrees including what I came there for...steaks! I ordered the most expensive steak on the menu as a rare treat. (A5 Waygu Beef filet mignon) I was so excited! Unfortunately, the steak came overcooked. I ordered medium rare and it arrived medium and medium well on the ends. Bummer! \n\nThe waiter, Dewey, was prompt in asking me what I wanted him to do about it, although that made me uncomfortable. He did get the manager who offered to discount or to remake my order. I chose to take the unknown discount as I did not have time to deal with the re-do. This was not the best experience, but the steak was still yummy!\n\nWe also ordered sides of creamed corn and kale\/broccoli rabe which were excellent in addition to a lovely bottle of Justin Cab well priced at $65. My boyfriend ordered a porterhouse steak which was prepared perfectly and the red wine sauce (ordered separately from a list of extras) was textbook perfection. We were full and were not tempted by dessert, but I wish that I had been as I am certain that it would have been excellent.\n\nI would have no trouble recommending this restaurant to anyone looking for an \"old-school\" steakhouse experience. Most expecially, I would recommend Tender for anyone who enjoys being able to mix-and-match their own sauces, sides, etc. to create the best possible combination for their own palate.
