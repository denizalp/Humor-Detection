The food was her great, I liked the carne asada taco and nachos I ordered. This isn't the type of place you sit down in but the food does speak for itself. The service was friendly and the food seemed to be done quickly enough and it does stand out from many places when it comes to their carne asada. I would suggest they update their retail hardware as it is a bit archaic and it had some issues when I ordered.\n\nAmbiance 2\/5: Kind of dimly lit and definitely take out, it started out as a shaved ice shop so there are a few seats but I would recommend calling in.\nService 4\/5: Nice and prompt\nFood 5\/5: I don't have much to compare as I don't usually hunt for the best carne asada like some people I know but it's better than Americas Taco Shop(terrible), Rubio's(I am a fan of their street tacos),Baja Fresh, and any Bertos chain I have tried.\n\nrecommend:\nNachos\ntacos
