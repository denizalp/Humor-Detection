Exotic, fun, and delicious sharables.   This is our new State Street go-to for out-of-town guests.  We keep ordering the same things, trying new things, and there's still things on the menu we want to try!  Our favorites, in my terms, include, chicken in a bag, a spicy curry chicken, perfect for 1 or more, fish balls, with an addictive salt rub, and gravy in a box (what is that even?!).  I wasn't a fan of the milk tea with jelly, but that's personal preference, because, hey, they offer both bobba and jelly.  \n\nThere's an outdoor seating area, and inside has a lot of character. It's a great place to sit, chat, and like I said, share an interesting bite with friends.
