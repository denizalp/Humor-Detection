I go here almost every week because it's affordable and satisfies my sushi cravings every time. The food comes out super quick and the quality is quite comparable to other  expensive AYCE places. Without ordering a drink my bill is under $16 for lunch. The crispy crab, pink lady (only available at dinner) and 007 roll are my favourites.
