Hey if you wanna pay full price for a guitar that has been handled and dinged up by 1,000 people go for it!! It's amazing how beat up many of the guitars here are. The staff was annoying as all hell, bugging me every 2 seconds to see if I needed anything!! Go to Sam Ash or Sweetwater instead, you wont be dissapointed!!
