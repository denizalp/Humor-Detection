Lowe is amazing! He's been my nail tech since I've moved to Las Vegas, and after searching for a nail text for so long I am a happy camper! His nail game is on point, meaning the guy knows his stuff! He is an artist and his attention to detail is everything! I usually like to go 3-4 weeks between a bust and he makes sure I never break a nail! \nThe shop is beautiful, clean, and everyone here is professional and courteous!
