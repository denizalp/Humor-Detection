Well folks, I visited the the Greater Cleveland Aquarium last week. I wasn't impressed with the Lake Erie exhibit. The only fish to see were common fish found in the lake. I would like to have seen Some of the rare fish which reside in its depths and also some of the smaller aquatic life found in the lake. I was pretty impressed with the ocean exhibits, especially the tunnel where I could look all around me at ocean life. I spent quite a bit of time in there. Overall, I think it's a place to visit once and not return for several years. Also, I would love to see descriptions of the beautiful coral, which I thought was very impressive-so many varieties and colors to look at. I absolutely loved the building-very cool reuse of space.
