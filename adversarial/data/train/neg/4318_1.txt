I was a little nervous to eat at Texas Roadhouse, because of the poor reviews about their service, but my fianc√© & I decided to give it a go anyways. We got there at 7:40pm on a Saturday & there was a 25-35 minute wait. Which wasn't a surprised since it was Saturday. There was a ton of people waiting & it made it a little awkward to find a spot that was not in anyone's way.\n\nWe waited about 30 minutes before we were seated. Our sever, Andrea (Drea on her name tag) was fantastic!! She made sure that everything was refilled before we were empty, which for me is a huge deal. She was very friendly & checked on our table regularly. I give Drea alone 5 stars!! I was pleased with my rib eye expect for the fact I ordered medium rare & it came out medium. I think the quality of food for your money is great!!\n\nThe only thing that was a little off putting was the loud music & every once in awhile the servers had to dance. It kinda felt like we were having dinner at a bar, which I didn't care for.
