Horrible. Awful. I hope you see this review so you can steer clear. We ordered a good deal through car rentals.com. When we rented the car the man behind the counter took our reservation and told us to return the car by 1 pm on our return date. When we returned the car Nasir insisted that our original contract did not hold (literally - this was actually illegal), and charged us three times more than we originally agreed on. He was also incredibly rude and unhelpful. I'm shocked at how this place is still in business.
