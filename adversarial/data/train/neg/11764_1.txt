I was very happy with my service here, Selena did my nails and she listened to what I requested and did it perfectly ! Everyone is so nice and the salon is very clean. I have had a very hard time finding a nail salon that is clean and does an amazing job on my nails. I tried this place and after one time of going there I knew I found the place I will always go back to now :) it's my favorite place to get my nails done and the prices are great also! I definitely recommend for everyone to go there & feel the experience I did.
