The worst Chinese food, if you can call it that. Ordered the spare ribs which were like tire rubber, the eggrolls had no taste and tough, the garlic chicken was awful, beef and broccoli tasteless, chicken fried rice smelled old and was tasteless. So disappointed with the quality of the food. We had it delivered and it took 50 minutes, they got the address wrong. I will not order again from here, ever. Eater's beware!!!
