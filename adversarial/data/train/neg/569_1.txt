Their website makes it extremely easy to order online. I've ordered from them three times and they are, as people have said, speedy to Ohio City. The delivery guy is always pleasant. Definitely no complaints. It's not extraordinary food, but when you feel like Chinese, this is for sure the place.\n\nOrder the steamed dumplings served with a soy ginger sauce.
