First time trying Sushi Kee a few weeks ago. I ordered the hot poppers and Las Vegas roll. The hot poppers where wonderful, very good. I thought the Las Vegas roll was okay. It was to big to get the whole flavor of the roll into a one mouth full. Over all the staff was great the place was clean and very nice.
