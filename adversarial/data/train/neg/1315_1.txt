Needing some food after a long day of shopping, we stopped here on our way back from the Aurora Outlets. I had read the reviews so wasn't expecting anything awesome and pretty much that's what we got...just average bar food.\n\nWe started off with an order of boneless chicken wings (medium heat). They tasted like they had been heated up from a previously frozen status (like you'd get in the freezer section of your local grocer). Surprisingly enough, I really liked them, although I also really like the freezer ones that I heat up at home too...(Oh shoot that should be my little secret...hehe). Anyway, on to the main meal.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Whatcha Want Burger  (pick any 3 toppings, he chose cheese and onion straws). He ordered it medium and said that it was cooked right and tasted okay, but believes it was also previously frozen.\n\nI had the Pretzel Club (smoked turkey, ham, bacon, honey dijon and Swiss &\nAmerican cheeses on a pretzel bun). Again, not to repeat myself over and over, but I didn't find this sandwich anything to be excited about. It was okay.\n\nThe service was the best part of the place. We sat at a booth in the bar area. It wasn't really busy when we were there, and the bartender was also the server. He was quick to attend to us and friendly.\n\nSo in the end, not horrible, but not great. If in the neighborhood again will definitely try to find something else, but if this is the only place open I'd go again.
