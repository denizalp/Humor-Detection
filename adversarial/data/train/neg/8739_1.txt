I couldn't be happier about choosing Dodge Electric for a built in grill project.  I contacted four electricians.   Two missed their appointments and didn't call to reschedule and one made his appointment but took two weeks sending me a quote for exactly what I thought I wanted.  \n\nSensing this company and their quote to be a bit sketchy, I called Dodge Electric.  They came out to the project, asked me some questions, poked around a little and explained that I didn't want what I had asked them to do; there was a better way and I'd be much happier with the results.  They were right!  \n\nNot only am I happy with the finished product but Mike was great about scheduling and coordinating with my paver contractor.  His on-site crew was just as accommodating, respectful, and qualified.  Dodge Electric was not the cheapest, but they were the most professional.\n\nI would use them again and would recommend to my friends and family.\n\nThank you Mike, I appreciate your help with this project.\n\nTodd
