I was trying a new drink and didn't enjoy it, but the staff said they'd make my usual favorite.  The labels got confused so they had to remake it.  They were very kind and understanding about everything.  Not only did they make the exact drink I wanted, on the spot, they gave me a gift card for a free drink.  Starbucks is a solid coffee-shop and customer service like this makes them shine!
