Pressed for Juice in my opinion has the best tasting combos for their juices. They just know how to combine the ingredients so they don't taste weird. Plus I love that they come in glass, the taste is so much crisper in the glass as with any drink. The store is very clean and well kept on the daily.\n\nThe prices are a little on the higher side, but I don't mind paying a little more for good quality cold pressed juice. If you go 2 hours before closing they have a happy hour deal for 10% off which is when I go to grab my juices and açaí bowls. Ohh and what can I say about the açaí bowls, they taste so darn good and I'm going to go and say that this is the best açaí bowl I have ever tasted. They got the mix and ingredients down to a T. Lots of other places can do it how they do, sometimes it is to watery or too icy. My favorite bowl is the PBandA and during the summer I find myself getting the full Brazilian just because it's a little more refreshing since peanut butter is thick.
