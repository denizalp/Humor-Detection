Such a wonderful dining option less than a block from the Musee des Beaux-Arts Montreal! Beautiful interior, pleasant music, and delicious menu options. We tried soups and sandwiches and were very pleased with the presentation and quality of the food. We could not have been more pleased with our choice of having lunch here en route to the museum!
