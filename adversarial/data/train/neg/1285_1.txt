Ordered the rare beef and tendon pho with egg noodle, as well as spring rolls. Turns out they were out of spring rolls, so just stuck with the pho. Food came out quick...but incorrect. No egg noodles, they gave me regular rice. Since I hate sending food back, I just ate it. Noodles were borderline mushy, bean sprouts old and broth a little oily. My favorite part of pho is the broth, and this was not very flavorful.  There was not much color to it, which explains the lack of flavor. Also, they really skimp on meat. I think I counted maybe three small pieces of tendon and same with the steak. Staff super friendly, but I've had better pho at Kim long or Saigon 8.
