A new taqueria always draws my attention and when I read on A local blog that their current menu is gluten free I knew I had to go. Now. \n\nWe arrived early (6pm on a Friday night) and managed to score a table for two in the back before two groups of seven came in. We ordered one of each of the tacos and the cheese quesadilla. The tortillas were fresh, warm and flavourful. The grilled Oaxaca cheese on the quesadilla was a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed all of the tacos and the house made chorizo was tasty. Our only complaint (from two people who enjoy a bit of heat) was that a few of the tacos had so much heat that it over powered the otherwise amazing flavour layers of the tacos. I also found the margarita small for $9 and far too sweet for my taste. \n\nWe will definitely be back to check it out again!
