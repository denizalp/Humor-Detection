Beware of this location!!! I recently rented a car, and I EXPLICITLY told the rep that I did not want the loss damage waiver coverage. He smiled, said \"no problem\" then printed out my booking. When I returned my car, the bill was DOUBLE what was expected, because it was included. I explained that I specifically refused the coverage, and with a sly smile, the clerk said \"you should have read it first\". She's probably right, but this is a pure bait and switch operation. She basically admitted to me that that regardless of what you TELL them, the final contract is their legal, binding agreement. They've been trained to do this bait and switch tactic, and I'll never rent from Payless again.
