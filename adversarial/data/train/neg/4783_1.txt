Phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal. \n\nYou know a place really hit all the high points when you walk out saying that it is a MUST VISIT destination whenever you return to the area. This place is that good.\n\nFrom the breakfast sandwich, with perfectly crisped fresh bread complete with Wisconsin cheddar and the perfect hint of maple syrup to the presentation of their hand-crafting each of your drinks while you wait (this is what you pay for when drinks are $3-$6 to those who are complaining of the prices on Yelp) to the fantastic craft beer selection, complete with Bells Hopslam, a small selection of Ale Asylum, and 5, count em FIVE offerings of Three Floyds beers (Arctic Panzer Wolf the highlight of the bunch) while we were here, this place is just great. \n\nThey brew excellent Intelligentsia coffee (a product of the owner being from Chicago, one would surmise), provide free internet in a chill, laid back setting perfect for anything from a hangover brunch to cramming for finals, provide an incredible selection of different coffees (and methods to brew the coffee) and teas, and they bring the drinks and food to your table as soon as it is ready, with a smile. What more could you possibly want out of a combination coffeehouse\/breakfast place\/Starbucks with craft beer type establishment?\n\nWe will absolutely be back, and we will be recommending this place to everyone we know visiting the area - this place is that fantastic. Not to be missed.
