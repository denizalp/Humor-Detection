Over all loved the food but the happy hour tacos were misleading. Said we wanted happy hour tacos but when the check back was way more than the menu, were told we were served the regular \"platter\" tacos even though we wanted happy hour and were told we got a better deal if we left it and didn't argue for the happy hour price. How is it happy hour if it is more than the regular menu price?! If we had been clearly informed we would have ordered differently
