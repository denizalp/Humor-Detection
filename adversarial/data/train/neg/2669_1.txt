I generally like the pizzas from Pizzaiolo and this store is no excepton. I must give it only 2 stars, though, due to the lack of disclosure of the new debit policy and the debit policy in general. AFTER ordering one slice for $4.25, and with no notice indicating otherwise, I was informed that I had to pay an extra 25cents for all debits under $5. I feel that's a ripoff. Remember that although many of the slices are healthy this is still a fast food restaurant and debit purchases should be expected. I've come here often and certanly given them my fair share of business. i just won't pay an extra 25cents for the privilege of using my bank card, ESPECIALLY when there was no notice on this. On the contrary, this storefront now has large signage on its doors advertising that they take Interac, as if that's such a huge deal.
