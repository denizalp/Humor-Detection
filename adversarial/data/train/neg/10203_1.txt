Stayed there recently for a seminar for two nights and informed the staff that the televisions were not working.  Made arrangements to have the staff come to fix the television twice and waited close to two hours each time.  Spoke to management and the gentleman offered to waive the resort fee of twenty five dollars which I found somewhat insulting.  They asked if they could come into the room to fix the televisions but I replied would you feel comfortable if I went into your house when you weren't there and there was silence on the other line. What was really disappointing was that they would state someone would be there by a certain time and I would have to call constantly hours after the appointed time.  These resort fees as they call them are usu free amenities at other hotels and what it includes is extremely slow internet speed wifi and the swimming pool fyi.  Parking can be difficult depending on the time you arrive.  Next time I would rather spend a bit more and stay at a nicer facility.
