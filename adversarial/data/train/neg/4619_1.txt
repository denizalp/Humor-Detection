Came here after reading the reviews on the food. I was excited to try a ramen place that was not my usual go tos downtown. Have to say, was not disappointed. \n\nWe started with the gyoza, absolutely loved them. They were crispy on some places but soft when you bite on it as well. Also meat was not dry at all, which I have a problem with sometimes. \n\nI got the house Tonkatsu ramen, which was so good. I like how the noodles were cooked perfectly. The meat was a bit fatty for my liking, but still very tender when eating it. After reading the reviews about the boiled eggs, I was concerned mine were going to be over cooked, but they weren't. They were perfectly cooked in my opinion. Warning for those who not a fan of the yolk being not fully cooked, who was my mom, it is a bit runny. \n\nAs for the service, the girl that was serving us was absolutely the sweetest. She was always smiling and made sure that our tea cups were never empty. We also sat for a bit and we did not feel like we were rushed out of there at all.\n\nThe restaurant was small, but ramen places usually are. It was very clean which is huge for me.
