At first the female waitress seemed unorganized and didn't seem to care about customer service because she completely forgot to bring out the drinks we ordered then didn't even come back to take our order. However we soon got these two very friendly male waiters who weren't just friendly but helpful and very quick with our orders. food was great and the atmosphere is great and quiet.
