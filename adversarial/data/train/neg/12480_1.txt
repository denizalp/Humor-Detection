I swear, it's like the staff at Le Germain researched everything about me before my stay. Everything was perfect. The service was tremendous and everyone had a smile. The amenities were fantastic. The breakfast was stellar. I didn't go to the gym, but I'm guessing it was top notch. \n\nThe one issue I had was that the TV was stuck on descriptive video. I probably could've called down to have it fixed, but meh.
