Neon Garage was cool. \nShuttles around the track were unorganized and slow.\nFood and beer were on par with any big time sports venue. There were a lot of places to get food and beverages. Plenty of bathrooms. \nRacing- was kind of boring, not a lot of passing. Typical of the current 1.5 mile Nascar track's.\nWon't go back.
