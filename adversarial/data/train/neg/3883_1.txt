My hubby and I wanted to try something new for lunch ....we saw this place and decided to give it a try ... The atmosphere was pretty cool but the food was bland and just uneventful .. I got the laguna grande with a fish taco and three rolled tacos it tasted like it was frozen .. my husband got the carne asada burrito and there was nothing special there either .... really think this place could be cool if they got the food right ...here's hoping
