I've visited this place several times for basic colds and flus, and also visited them for 2 injuries. For the 5 or 6 times I have visited I've received spectacular service. If you've ever been to an ER or basic doc visit, you understand that waiting is not fun, and, the overall lack of communication and service. Arcadia Urgent Care processed me saw me quickly every time, and when there was a wait I knew where I stood from the excellent communication from the front office staff. The physician's and assistants are all friendly and very thorough! They all seem to be very qualified clinicians who cared about helping me! A couple of times I was shocked at how much time they took to explain to me what was going on with my xray, and also an issue I had with a neck pain. I felt at ease asking no stupid question and felt like they genuinely cared about answering me until I really understood. I found myself attending this place quite a bit more when I had to change to a ridiculously high deductible health plan, so it was actually cheaper for me to visit Arcadia Urgent Care than wasting my time with a primary care doc who would charge me their \"discounted\" rate. The flat fee made sense and I like knowing what I'm paying for. The location is outstanding and the hours are convenient.....easy to go in after work or on the weekend. I am sure I will be sick or injured again (sadly), and will definitely be back! Thank you for such excellent service and care.
