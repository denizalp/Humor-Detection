Bake Code is a small Taiwanese bakery that incorporates European baking techniques. The set-up is kinda cool, you can help yourself to croissants and other baked goods and then order the cakes at the front. \n\nI found the staff to be a bit rude, but I ordered a few croissants. The Matcha was way too intense for me. If you enjoy Matcha, you might like it. I also ordered the Hazelnut Croissant which is stuffed with Hazelnut Chocolate, that was okay. It was very sweet but not bad. My favorite was the Almond Croissant. Not too sweet, just the right amount of Almond Paste and Almonds. It was very flaky and enjoyable. \n\nKeep Eating,
