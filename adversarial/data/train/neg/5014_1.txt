OMG, we've been coming to Vegas for years and never tried egg works before - what fools we have been!!  We came here for the first time today and we're served by Carly - who was an absolute super star, so warm and welcoming :)\n\nThe food was Amazing, fresh tasting, huge portions and surprisingly cheaper than the big chains like iHop and Denny's.\n\nMy family didn't want to write this review as other folks might come and it will become more crowded.  But today was fine,  we sat straight down, even though the car park was jammed.\n\nSeriously one of the best breakfasts I have ever had in world, with such friendly staff with a great price to boot.  This place is the real deal.
