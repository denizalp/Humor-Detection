I just had a horrible experience with these people! I called to order funeral - flowers for a friend's father who had passed away. I did not know the father's name, but I knew his son's name. The father had also been the pastor of the church where the funeral was being held. The woman on the phone would not process the order without the name of the father! She said- the church usually has several bodies there for funerals--- but I was like- right but how many of the bodies are for the PASTOR of THE CHURCH! And she just wouldn't budge. It was ridiculous. I ended up putting the order in through JustFlowers.com- they allowed me to write in that it was the father of a person and attribute the flowers to the whole family, What a stupid woman.
