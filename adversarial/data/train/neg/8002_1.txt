This has to be my favorite Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas so far. My girlfriend and I really like to get the pineapple fried rice and the red chicken curry on a pretty regular basis. The red curry is delicious and very creamy and the pineapple fried rice is sweet and savory just as it should. Their Thai iced tea is actually some of the best I've had as well which I know is a very common drink but they do it great. Their service is always fantastic, and delivery, when utilized, promp. Hats off!
