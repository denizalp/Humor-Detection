First things first, MAKE A RESERVATION. The wait is usually long.\n\nI love this restaurant. I've been to the one in Miami and when I heard they opened one up here, I was so excited. The service is some of the best service I've ever had. Our server Luis M. was very kind and knowledgeable of the menu. We ordered 2 drinks, the Chicken and Waffles, Shrimp and Grits, Mac and Cheese, Bacon (thick cut) and the Fried Oreos for dessert. Our favorite item was the Bacon, the thick cut was so juicy and delicious. I order it every single time. Our other favorite item was the Mac and Cheese, it's so creamy and good. \n\nThe entrees were good but not our favorite items. \nWe also ordered a couple of drinks. The Blueberry Bourbon Lemonade was great. It was sweet but had a smokey flavor to it. My bf ordered the Watermelon Cocktail drink, I forgot the full name but it's on their Cocktail drink menu. It was also good but a drink to sip on because it was on the stronger side. Luis also helped decide on a dessert menu. We got the fried Oreos and it was also pretty good. I would've rather wanted to order the chocolate cake but it was my bfs birthday so he decided on the Oreos. When we made the reservations I let them know we were celebrating a birthday and we got the dessert for free. \n\nOverall this place is a go to, just try to make reservations.
