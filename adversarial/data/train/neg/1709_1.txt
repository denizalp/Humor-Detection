Love this little local breakfast spot! The menu is creative, the servings are big and the food is awesome. Especially love unique offerings like a burger steak on the side of you eggs and bacon or butterscotch chips on your pancakes- yum! Great place to bring small children too, they have a chalk wall and play area for them.
