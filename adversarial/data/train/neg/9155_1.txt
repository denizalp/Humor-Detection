The burgers are juicy and delicious however they're quite small. I ordered the 4oz fresh burger and the burger came smaller than I expected. However with the price of 5.49$ a burger it's a good deal. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you like a fresh juicy burger. However, it does take a while for them to cook the burger so if you're In a rush for something quick this won't be a good spot.
