I had an air conditioning problem and my warranty company sent Ultra!!  Pilot diagnosed my units with gauges and explained what was going on  in a language that I could easily understand.  Veronica was in the office and did an excellent job explaining and waited on the phone 2 hours with my warranty company to expedite the process. I was so grateful and still am. She is outstanding!!!  A true professional she went out of her way for me. Did I mention I'm soooooo grateful. Dear God it's summer for heaven sake. I could feel her smile through the phone. Way to go!!!   All my respect, PS referred by my dear friend, Susan H.
