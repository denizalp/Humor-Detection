If you're looking  for a big restaurant, forget it but, if you're looking for a cozy, warm, friendly place, where the people take the time to have a word with their customers, this is the place to go. I'll try to resume my experience in three steps\n1- the place itself is situated in the side of the river, wonderfull view! You look at the place and everything is spotless and the smell, wood burning in the oven? What can you ask more?\n2- service: greeted by the manager, place by the owner just there you feel you're important. The waitress (marie-soleil) even if she was busy as hell took the time to have a word with every customer at her table. Friendly, smiling and helpful in our choice of dish.\n3- the food itself: I've worked in the restaurant business for years and I can tell you this: this food was awesome. Plate and glasses spotless, serve hot, freshly made not like the frozen food or crappy pasta you're going to get in others place\nCongrats il fornetto, you've got someone hooked
