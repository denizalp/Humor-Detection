We use Boca Park Animal Hospital for grooming and veterinary visits. We love it here! Amy, is our groomer and is truly amazing with our girls. We have had some tough experiences in the past. We have shitzu dogs and like them \"puppy\" cut with longer ears and tails. Amy nails it every time. Most importantly, our girls LOVE her!!! Stacy has always been helpful in scheduling appointments and reminding us of our girls vaccination needs. We see Dr. Ensign for all of our veterinary needs and he is amazing as well. Our experiences have been nothing but positive and we are so thankful to have found such a caring team for our pups!
