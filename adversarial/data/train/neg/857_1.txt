Yes, I understand that everyone loves chipotle. But this place is absolutely terrible. The workers do not understand the concept of customer service. One worker stood there and made 10 Guac sides BEFORE she put salsa on my bowl because she \"didn't like when people asked for sides of guac\" so she decided to make a surplus amount of them. Also, the last time I went they had a 30 minute wait for white rice. WHITE RICE!! May I also add that this was at 530 pm when everyone was off of work waiting in a line out the door for their dinner. I mean honestly, this place needs a whole new line of workers because these people get absolutely nothing accomplished. They're lucky I like chipotle so much.
