Worst food ever.  Tasted like absolutely nothing.\nWe were traveling with another couple who wanted to go there to have the lobster tail.  I am not sure this was lobster, it was small pieces of something that resembled lobster.   The crawfish was well, shoulda been left in the bayou\nTons of crab legs, and all kinds of seafood, but it all tasted like nothing.\nNothing was labeled so you had no idea what you were having. \nThe lamb was ok, but gamey\nthe Prime Rib was super fatty.\nThe only thing I enjoyed was the cooked chinese food.
