Amanda is wonderful! The level of service and her attention to detail is unlike any other salon in Pittsburgh. From facials to manicures, she has always exceeded my expectations and is very meticulous. My skin and brows have never looked better. She will make sure you are 100% happy before you walk out. She is the only one I trusted to get me ready for my wedding and my skin and nails look amazing! I trust her advice and will continue to come back. Make an appointment!
