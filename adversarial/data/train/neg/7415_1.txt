First off, staff was really friendly and attentive to customers. Second, the peanuts are to DIE FOR!!!! If you are an old school traditional Chinese like me, you would love their boiled peanuts! (the owner even gave me a box togo!) I got the tofu soup combo with kalbi and a hot stone bibimbap. The tofu soup was like the ones you get in Cali and the kalbi is very well marinated. I am still thinking about back tomorrow even though I have already been there twice this week.
