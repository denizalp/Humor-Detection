I drove from Toronto to Elyria and checked in late. \n\nTheir building is impossible to get to if youre from out of town and don't know the area, and altho the building faces Midway Blvd the entrance is actually on Midway Mall Blvd. This was not included in our hotel information and we spent 20 mins driving around trying to get to the entrance.\n\nWhen we arrived I brought the issue up to the guy behind the counter and his actual response was \"I don't care about that.\"\n\nI told him he should care but that did nothing. We just checked into our room and let it go.\n\nWe walked into our room and the first thing we noticed was that the sink was in the actual room. In the hair dryer was a giant clump of hair. \n\nI walked over to the dresser and sat down my bags. I looked at the ground and there was a giant c*m stain on the carpet. The house keepers didn't even attempt to have it cleaned and disinfected for us. \n\nAfter going downstairs and fighting for another room we were switched. The old guy behind the counter has no manners and zero idea about customer service.\n\nNever stay here.
