What started as a need for a post-Costco lunch has quickly turned into a family favourite! Tasty food that is an unbelievably good value! For three of us (adults), we usually get three items and share, with enough leftovers for almost two full meals afterwards. The food is flavourful, spicy but not overly so (though I'm sure you can add more spice if you'd like), and the wine is really well-priced (extra bonus!). Definitely recommended, for a post-Costco lunch, or otherwise :)
