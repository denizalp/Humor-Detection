I want to give this place 3.5 stars but I'll round up this time. Drinks are REALLY expensive. Everyone gets handed 2 for 1 drink coupons but they only work on single alcohol beverages so you'll end up paying $13-$18 for regular club drinks. \n\nI round up because: \n1)REALLY GOOD DJ\n2)Chill Lounge to just sit and drink\n3)Bartenders are nice\n\nA lot of people go into the lounge and end up leaving because they realize its expensive and there's no dancefloor.. but I was happy to just sit at the bar.
