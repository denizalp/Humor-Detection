A good, solid burger that will fill you up.  A tad on the pricey side, however.  Their schtick is they don't serve \"junk\", as the waiter called it.  So that means only organic sodas, homemade sauces, etc.  They do make all of their own ketchup mustard, pickles, and sell them as well.  Some of their sauces are spectacular.  I also really enjoy their fries, here.\n\nThey also do special events, I think, as I have seen karaoke for a birthday party in here as well as watched a UFC.
