A word of advice to ANYONE looking to rent from Waypoint Home or Colony Homes. STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!! I'm only writing on this closed office because someone will see it and maybe I will save them. This company, once a lease is signed, they give zero s$&@s about you. We have (5) FIVE service calls they left us hanging with, refuse to respond to emails or phone calls. We are now looking into legal action.
