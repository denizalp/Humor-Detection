It was my first time at Klondike, and so I ordered the $1.50 Breakfast special to check the staple selling point of this place. \nI've had Rainbows breakfast special, and wanted to see how they stack up w Klondike.\nService was a bit awkward, the wait staff isn't really confident...it's not awful but definitely choppy. \nCafe is clean and open and not too smoky smelling. We sat outside as it was a nice morning. \nThe food was good-I being a vegan only ate my toast and hash browns (to which I had them add some veggies and it came out delicious!). They charged me $.50 per veggie added. \nI also got hot tea, which I liked the mug size was big & good, and the honey plentiful. Thumbs up on that. \nI'll definitely come here again. It's nothing fancy -but fits the bill for a quick-cheapy-breaky fix.
