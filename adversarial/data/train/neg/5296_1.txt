I have not been in this coffee house for sometime but I'm glad I stopped by! Since the new owner took over the place is so\nMuch more cozy and comfortable and you can even feel the happiness in the employees voices! There are more lounging areas outside now. The pumpkin latte was so delicious and the veggie sandwich was the best I've ever had for a long time! Bravo to the new owner! This place is a hit!
