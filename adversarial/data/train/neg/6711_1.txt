Very nice place. Amazing view of the city and harbour. Walking distance to CN tower, Ripley's Aquarium, Rogers Centre, etc. Great accommodations and attention to customer service. The room service even brought my son a chocolate chip cookie platter after our breakfast when they found out it was his birthday. That was a very special and highly appreciated touch. The perfect end to a perfect trip. Thank you so much! I would definitely stay here again next time we are in town.
