(Originally written in 2014) I took a 7 year old and 5 year old at 10am on a Friday and we left at 1:30pm. We experienced everything except for laser tag, arcades and the food but the kids participated in every other activity\/ride at least three times. Bathrooms were clean and the staff was wonderful with the kids. If a kid is looking anxious on a ride, then they will slow it down or stop the ride entirely. If a kid doesn't want to spin around, then the staff won't spin them. If there is no one around in line or waiting nearby, then the staff allow the ride to run for longer. There is SO much flexibility with a Park Ranger running every two rides that the kids, there were quite a few, don't wait long in between rides and you get a lot of individual attention. After reading the reviews for this park, I was a little nervous but at $12 per kid and the service we received, I was very impressed. We will DEFINITELY be back to this Phoenix location next month!!! I'm not sure what the expectations were from other reviewers but there were countless moms saying, \"Okay, but this is the last time, then we have to go home!\" and I was in the same boat. Kids LOVE this place and it is safe. Isn't that really what matters?\n\n(Update 2015) I have taken a 7, 5, and 3 year old here on multiple occasions. It is their favorite place to go. Again, I still think that parents need to keep their expectations in check and call before you go so you can make sure none of the rides are broken down. I generally avoid the weekend rush and aim to arrive when the park opens and leave when the kids get hungry.
