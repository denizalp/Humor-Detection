Wetzel Pretzels is a typical food court staple (that or Auntie Anne's). Their pretzels are pretty good when fresh. The dough is really doughy and it's amply salted (unless you ask for no salt). I think it pairs really well with the sweet glaze dip but it costs you extra $1.19 for each dip.\n\nThe food is kinda greasy but they don't give you any napkins by default, and when I went the napkins were nowhere to be found!\n\nCredit card minimum $5
