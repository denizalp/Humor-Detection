I Love this Place! I looked at 5 other uptown apartments and I am very happy with my decision. You get the more square footage for your buck, other places you will pay the same for 200 sq feet less cause they have a concierge.... Who needs that!? The staff here is Amazing and Attentive, couldn't ask for a better staff. I signed with Benjamin Potts and he has been Awesome! Any questions I have or concerns he is on point. Also Rachel, both of them are Superstars. Maintenance guys are super nice and quick. Love the Industrial look, very clean hallways, my view and the fact that I can go downstairs and Dunkin Donuts and CVS are right there.
