I will unfortunately not be coming back to this dry cleaners.  First, the positives.  The service was completed promptly, priced fairly, packaged carefully, and the email confirmation that your garments are ready for pickup is a nice touch.  Now the bad.  Customer service at the counter left much to be desired.  First, let's talk about greetings.  It is expected in any place of business for staff to greet customers politely.  I did not get a \"hi, I'll be right there,\" but rather a brusque \"picking up?\" from one of the ladies staffing the counter. She barely made eye contact and continued to do her other duties (wrapping other garments) and made me awkwardly wait by the doorway while she finished so that she can look me up on their system.  I understand the need to multi-task, but a polite comment of, \"I'm so sorry, let me just finish this and I'll be right there,\" goes a long way in making the customer feel acknowledged and welcome rather than interrupting.  I'll spare the details, but the lady at the counter was also very insistent on something about my garment that I was simply asking a clarification for, but instead of a polite answer, I received snappy comments that definitely did not make me feel appreciated as a customer.  After I paid, I did not even warrant a \"thank you, have a great day!\" but instead received an awkward stare while I gathered my garments.  I hope that management takes these comments as constructive feedback rather than criticisms.  These are behaviors than can easily be remedied with additional staff training.  Unfortunately, I greatly value customer service over price or convenience so I will be looking for another dry cleaner that aligns with this need.
