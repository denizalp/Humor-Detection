I would give this place 0 stars if possible. I dropped off my dry cleaning and received it back smelling AWFUL. The smell was overwhelmingly bad, even though the clothes were dropped off in nice condition. I absolutely could not wear these clothes to work or in public because the stench was overwhelming and almost caused me to throw up. I took them back to Martinizing and was told that there was a problem with the boiler at the store which was causing multiple people's clothes to smell. I asked for a refund, but was told they could not do that and I could instead have the clothes recleaned again to remove the smell. When I picked up the clothes the second time, they smelled even worse. This time I asked for another refund and was told that I could not receive one unless the manager Rachel was there. She was not in the store and they said they did not know when she would be in next for me to talk to her. \n\nThis is absolutely awful. This store failed at their one job and completely ruined hundreds of dollars worth of clothes. I wish I would have known about this before taking my clothes to this store which is why I am writing this review - DO NOT BRING YOUR CLOTHES HERE. I understand mistakes happen, but the same mistake should not occur multiple times, and if it does,  customers should be reimbursed for their money and time, especially if it is the store's fault. \n\nI will never use this dry cleaner again.
