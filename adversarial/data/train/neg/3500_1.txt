This was the worst experience I have ever had. The meat was over done and dry. We were not given a choice of how it was cooked. It all  tasted the same. Very bland. They didn't bring any chicken around at all. Very over priced for what little we got. Save yourself the trouble if you want Brazilian go to Texas De Brazil worth the few extra dollars if not almost the same price as this stuff was. Soda 3 dollars a can. Automatic gratuity and we had to wait on everything. Salad bar and hot bar was a joke to... Not to mention my houses stomach was not happy all night!!! DO NOT GO EAT HERE. what a rip off.. You upsize a package and didn't even get meat you got little pieces of bark and chewy crap with grissle and fats... Shrimp so dry you couldn't chew it...
