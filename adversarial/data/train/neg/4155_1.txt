Since I've lived here pastel has always been a great little gem. The crepes are always good, and extremely filling. I've never been disappointed with their food, and the service is always top-notch. It's not extremely sweet, and just how I like it. The sweetness is good for both me and my dad, who often finds other crepes too sweet. It's just right.
