My brother and I picked this place because it was on DDDs. At first you pull up and think it's kind of odd but in the end it was all worth the quarkyness of the stop. Great food, definitely recommend the Mac n cheese, and sit by the fish tank. I loved the huge sauce board and station. A lot of variety and stuff for the whole family to enjoy.
