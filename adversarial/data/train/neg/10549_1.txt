First impressions, I thought this was a joint.  Surprisingly, this restaurant was absolutely delicious.  Had breakfast at 10am accompanied by ginormous cocktails (It's Vegas after all).  The neon lighting and Amazon rainforest decorations truly adds to the dining experience.  Trips to Vegas must include this as a stop!
