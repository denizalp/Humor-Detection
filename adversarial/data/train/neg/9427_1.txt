I'll start off by saying I didn't eat anything or go bowling here. I stopped by while waiting for my friends to get to the Hessler street fair. \n\nI waited 5 minutes for a barmaid- with only 3 other customers- to ask what I wanted. I ordered a Hoegaarten, which admittedly is not the cheapest beer in the world, but when I took the check for $7.03 i was pissed. $7.03? I could have bought most of a 6 pack with that!\n\nThe other things that I walked away remembering are that 1) the bar stools were uncomfortable as could be. 2) The bathrooms are all the way upstairs. 3) It was hot in there. It's 80 degrees outside guys, turn on the AC. \n\nWould not return.
