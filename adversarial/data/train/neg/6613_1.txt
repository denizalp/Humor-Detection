Go here when the weather is perfect and you're with great company.   That's what makes this place worth it.   Otherwise the food is way too expensive for what you get.  I had the egg salad sandwich this time and there was nothing special about it.  Very average.   In fact $10 was kinda obscene for such a sandwich, but this is where we wanted to go.  I skipped the expensive drinks, sides, and dessert which all looked good I must say.   If you are frugal, just skip this place all together.   Otherwise it's got some atmosphere and charm included with the bill.
