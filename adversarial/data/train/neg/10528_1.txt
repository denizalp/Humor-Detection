I really wanted to Love this place! Great Rustic fun decor! friendly hostess and servers. The(Rojo Rings) onions Rings were Giant and breaded perfectly and just a little spicy..Yummy! I ordered a Pepsi since the only cold non alcoholic drinks were raspberry Iced tea( Isn't that a little played out by now?) sodas and Unsweetend tea!I  no Shakes nor Smoothies..a burger Joint without Shakes!1?? sigh! I could see as the server brought me the Pepsi it was flat..i swished around the drink & still no fizz..i pointed it out to her, she apologized & gave me water..\nHubby really enjoyed his Mac n cheese Burger it was big enough to save half for later. I had a pulled pork sandwich on a pretzel bun. It was tasty. \n\nThe food was a little pricey but food was tasty...I just wanted over the top goodness from Guy! oh and either a milkshake or Fizzy Soda!
