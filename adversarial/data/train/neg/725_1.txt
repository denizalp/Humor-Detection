We went to iFLY for my sons birthday. Everything was awesome. Amberlyn was the best with the kids. She took time to explain everything to them and made it SO much fun. The check in was a little drawn out (because we did a party) but nothing unbearable. The one thing that I took a star away from is there was a miscommunication about the videos we ordered. There is a stale date and we almost missed it being told more than once they would be emailed to us. I have to say the gentleman i spoke to on my \"last day\" was great and helped me get squared away, but I would have been very sad to have lose videos we paid for.
