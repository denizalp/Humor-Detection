We decided to try this place because my Hubby's boss said it was great. This place is amazing. It is our new favorite Mexican restaurant. We had the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp . All I can say is Best Fajitas is Vegas! Get here early the place fills up but the service is outstanding, Never asked for anything. It instantly appears. \nAlso had the Raspberry Margarita delicious
