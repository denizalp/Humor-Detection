My wife and I currently going through the pool building process with Desert Springs Pools & Spas and up to this point everything has been great! I agree with Kevin F. that when you are building something as major as a pool there may be some issues but we have yet to experience that. \n\nIn choosing a company to design and construct our pool we wanted someone that was honest, trustworthy and we just felt comfortable with, not so pushy on the sales end. We wanted someone to listen to what we wanted and not just force their will and ideas upon us. After six estimates from different companies and talking to designers we choose our company due to the salesman\/designer being patient, kind and understanding as to what we wanted. He listened to our needs and concerns. That person and company was Paul Buntrock and Desert Spring Pools & Spas. \n\nI will finish this review once the pool is complete and post pictures. So far so great!!
