Super delicious drinks! My first experience there was a pleasant one. The girls at the window were extremely friendly! They also have milk alternatives such as almond milk which is a huge plus. I definitely recommend coming here, the inside is VERY tiny so it's more of a grab your drink and go type of place - especially on busy weekends.
