Very clean and smelled delicious when I walked in. Ordered the pork dinner. I was a little concerned when she brought it to me 3\/4 minutes later but it was delicious!\nI was disappointed at the amount of fat on my plate and piled it on the side of my plate to show my server. She said she would let the kitchen know.\nI was surprised when she came back with a portion of pork larger than the fat I'd set aside. They seem to value their customers! \nThis will not be the last time I eat here and I will recommend this place to anyone who is wanting delicious Mexican food!
