-5 starts .Bad bad experience !!!! At Lincoln dealership  Ashley \"sells manager \" Terrible !!! They waist your valuable time , she never has nothing right or done , she withdrawals more money then she supposed to out of your account with out your permission,   Very poor customers service , she stuck up and rude with her thinking it's funny waisting ur time bringing you back in forth and have nothing done -.- . We gaved the car back it was toooooo much , if only it had negative starts for me to put  ....... but hey guys \"kia\" next door . Great deals ,great customer service ,you never walked out disappointed or end up giving ur car back for lack of getting  things done right the 1st time or underestimating you !!!!!!
