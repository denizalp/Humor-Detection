Went with the family and ordered the cubano, fried chicken sandwich, Italian beef sandwich, poutine, and the kale salad. First off, the sandwiches were phenomenal and the ingredients used were extremely tasty and top notch! The poutine was also excellent! Found out they actually make their fries from scratch every morning! Lastly, the kale salad was truly wonderful... very crispy and fresh. Overall, I could not have had a better experience. The service was attentive and the food is definitely some of the best in Toronto! I highly recommend this place to anyone who appreciates quality food and service!
