I've been to some really big Zoo's in the USA  and this free zoo is AMAZING. First of all, the animals are completely comfortable grazing a few feet in front of you. There are open spaces to take great photos. I'm still so pleased that the Lion was out and about. All of the animals were.\n\nThe other Zoo's I've been to that charged me a good chunk of money never provided this kind of experience. Take a trip here, it's worth it.
