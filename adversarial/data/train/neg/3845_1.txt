This is my favorite place for cheese steaks, \n\nThe staff is beyond nice and greeted me by name the second time I walked in the door. \nVisiting this place is like going to visit friends. I have gotten to know a few of the family members first names but I still do not know their last name.\n\nThis is one of the few places that carry Tasty Cakes.\n\nIt is noisy inside and I wish they had outdoor seating, but it is not so bad to keep me away.\n\nTry it out, take a moment and say hi to the staff and ask them what they recommend, By the time you leave, they will make you feel like family too.
