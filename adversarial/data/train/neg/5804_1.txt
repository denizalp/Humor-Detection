Still hit or miss with service and food. I like the deviled eggs and surf and turf nachos, but just meh on everything else. I had the TV dinner. It pretty much tasted like one - meaning nothing special and the metal tray got cold really fast so my food did too. The buffalo chicken Mac and cheese was just ok too. Needed way more blue cheese and chicken for that matter. I really want to like this more. The bar type food is fine. It's when you get something other than apps that it goes wrong. However....The manager is VERY nice. When she checked on us - you actually believe she wants to know.
