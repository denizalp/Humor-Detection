I have had a lot of pedi's but this was by far one of the best! The salon was clean, very modern and a warm atmosphere. They greeted me as soon as I walked in and offered me beverages. The service was excellent. Jessie took great care of me. She paid attention to my feet and did a fabulous job. I fell asleep which I never do at a new place. I was so relaxed.
