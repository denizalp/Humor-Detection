A lovely little cafe that is a great addition to the neighbourhood. The service is smiling, friendly and efficient, with plenty of treats to tempt you in the glass case beside the cashier. It was very quiet when we first walked in, with just two people quietly reading the morning papers but  quickly filled up with various groups. I ordered the breakfast burrito for lunch. It was a simple wrap with egg, tomato, cheddar cheese and avocado, but it was filling and delicious. No complaints at all!! A great place for lunch or a snack in a cosy welcoming environment.
