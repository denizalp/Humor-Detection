The Theater is beautiful and brand new! The bar is really nice! The one thing that I did not like although not Harkins fault is that if there if there is going to be assigned seating maybe having a message before the movie plays to please stick to assigned seating. I went last week for the first time on my birthday with a couple of friends, and while this theater is further from us we decided to go here because we could pay for assigned seating, so we should up right as the movie is starting because why rush? we paid for assigned seating to find the people who were seating in our seats would not move because other people were sitting in their seats. We had to come out and get the manager to re-arrange everybody and as we are politely waiting on the side as the movie has already started and lost 15-20 minutes of the movie, and another Harkins employee says well this is why you should come early. I stated I thought this was the whole point, maybe they should have an usher for seats in this Harkins. Anyways it was rude and then I think they realized and came back and comped us with popcorn when we already have our free popcorn shirts. The seating and bar is nice but if I still have to go early I will just go to my regular Harkins, down the road from me. I was disappointed at the rude comment. Horrible customer service and on the first visit.
