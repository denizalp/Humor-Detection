Huh, a lot of negative reviews lately.  We must be going at the wrong time because we've always been very happy with the food and atmosphere at the Bungalow. \n\nAs long as some self-centered douchebag's not out there smoking a cigar, the patio's a great place to relax with some friends, a beer and some very decently priced grub.\n\nP.S. They have a pretty good steak sandwich.
