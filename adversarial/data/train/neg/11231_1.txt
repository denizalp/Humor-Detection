This is one of the few places on campus where you can have a \"proper sit-down meal\" in a quieter setting at the University. It has gone through a few different name and decor changes over the years, and overall, the quality has stayed about the same.\n\nThey have a decent variety on the menu, though it is largely predictable: burgers, club sandwiches, quesadillas, etc. Don't expect to have your socks blown off, but if you are looking for a place on campus to have a grown-up meal, this is pretty much your best, if not only, option.
