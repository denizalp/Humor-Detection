What a beautiful day to enjoy a delicious brunch out at the patio of Metro with the live music. Yup, life is always good with great food and company.\n\nI got the French Toast this time, it was yummy! Very nice presentation,  two piece of triangle-shaped toasts along with some fresh blackberries, blueberries, bananas foster, crème fraîche and caramel sauce, sweet! Even though it looked\/tasted more like a dessert, I still really liked it! The girls got the Quiche Lorraine, the Omelette, and the French Toast(yay!). We all enjoyed!\n\nWe had to (yes, we had to!) get the Beignets to share, that's the only way to mark a ending for a beautiful saturday brunch, emmm, I love the beignets and the raspberry dipping sauce!
