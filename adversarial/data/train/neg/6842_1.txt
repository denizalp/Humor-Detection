I thought that this would be a fun outing for my daughters and me.  We decided to join the \"sherlocked\" room.  Being that this was my first time, I was not sure what to expect other than we would be in a room and had to figure out something.  \n\nIt ended up being a great experience.  After starting and just trying to get used to the room, we found that we worked well with the other group that was there and really had a lot of fun trying to figure out the mystery.\n\nI was a little worried at first that the experience might be either too overwhelming or advanced for a 13 and 11 year old.  That was not the case.  The staff was great and the adventure really resonated with them.  Definitely something I would consider doing again.
