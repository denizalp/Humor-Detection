I loved this great harvest! I have been to a couple and this one felt so home-like and it was cute inside! They had the cutest stuff to buy like aprons. The food was so good I had a turkey pesto sandwich and I recommend it grilled and it was so good. The bread is all so fresh and they make everything there! I love it!!!
