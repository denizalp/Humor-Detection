Stopped by for a quick snack before our dinner reservations at a different restaurant (we were starving after a long walk by lakeshore).\nDefinitely worth it! (Full review to come when we go back for a real meal)\n\nThe rolls came in a timely matter, and the service as good. The restaurant is quite small, could probably fit about 40 patrons. It was less than half full when we were there. The decor was cute, nice and clean as well. \n\nWe only ordered one thing off the menu to share and it was the Black Dragon Roll (SM13 on the menu). It was delicious, the ingredients were fresh, the rice was perfect and the sauce made it even better. I didn't even use the soy sauce. It had a really comforting feeling in my mouth, a feeling that you don't get at every sushi restaurant. We were on the verge of ordering more but we had to leave room for dinner but we will definitely come back for a full meal.
