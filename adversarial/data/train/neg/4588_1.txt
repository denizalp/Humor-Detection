My first visit to Nohea! Greeted with a smile. Everyone friendly. Shop is beautiful and clean and new. Amanda was my nail tech. She was professional and friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend this place! I will definitely go back! Oh.. and the prices are just right!! Ive tried some other places in the southwest and the prices were way too high. But at Nohea.. they are on point! Great job!
