Have been coming here for years and they are always spot on!  Service is always fast and the food is consistent. They run these daily lunch specials for around 6.50-8.00 and that includes your tea. Try the Baked chicken on Thursdays or my favorite is the Blackened fish on Fridays. They do a pretty good happy hour as well.
