We stopped in on a rainy night.  There was only one waitress & she was working the whole time we were there, but because she was alone, it took awhile for us to be served & we came close to walking out before we ordered.  I am so glad we stayed.  The waitress was super-sweet & went out of her way to make up for the wait.  \n\nI had breadsticks with tomato bisque & hubby ordered a sausage pizza.   The pizza crust & breadsticks were  crispy, with a cracker-like crunch.. The soup was rich & creamy, and it was served piping hot.  It rivaled the best homemade tomato soup I ever had. \n\nThere was no room for pie, but after reading the other reviews, we'll defy go back for some!
