The only reason I gave it 1 star is because the place is massive and I can't give 0 but it was literally the WORST customer service experience EVER. I mean EVER. All of the employees just stand around and talk to each other and if you dare ask them a question regarding the items located in the same exact area they're standing in they either say they don't work in that department and try to push you off on another employee. Of you don't get \"redirected\" again (i got redirected 6 different times) you will most likely have the pleasure of dealing with an arrogant condescending entitled little sh*t. Basically, if Kanye West was a white middle class nerdy kid who worked retail with all of his gaming buddies...yeah...total disaster...I have done IT for several years so I actually knew what I needed (which frys said online they carried it in the specific store I went to) which of course they didn't carry but not only that...I had to educate the staff who continuously tried to tell me I was mistaken and the item wouldn't work how I needed it to...but couldn't offer any type of alternative method that would work. I can't seem to grasp how such a large store can't seem to hire even 1 useful\/helpful employee.\n\nJust UGH!!
