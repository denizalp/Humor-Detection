I had the very best experience with Hendrick MINI and our Motoring Advisor Cody Martyna.  We've had the pleasure of working with this dealership initially through the Service Department when we moved into the Charlotte area already owning a MINI.  Hendrick MINI is top notch and then we ordered our 2nd custom built MINI with Cody.  Cody did an AWESOME job keeping me informed with the status on a regular basis as we waited for it to arrive from the UK.  Cody is a joy to work with and provided the very best in customer service - always with a smile on his face!  I could tell Cody loves the MINI brand and as a customer, this energy is contagious!  He goes out of his way and above & beyond what I would've expected so he far exceeded my expectations.  I look forward to a continued positive relationship with Cody & Hendrick MINI - I couldn't be happier!!
