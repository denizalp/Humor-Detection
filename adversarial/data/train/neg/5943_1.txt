Love, love, love this place. The Marketplace as well as the main restaurant. Had coffee every morning here while we were vacationing. Great espresso and friendly service. We especially loved their patio out back that overlooks the canal and into Old Town Scottsdale. Allie at the hostess stand is fabulous.
