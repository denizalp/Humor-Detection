I'm reviewing from my recent experience eating here. We came here after watching O (GREAT SHOW) and once we entered, we chowed down. There was a pretty nice variety of food but overall the food was just ok.\nSince I LOVE desserts I tried all of their desserts which was not disappointing but again, nothing I would try more then once.
