Vegas Vip Services made planning a bachelor party for 13 dudes way easy. They were responsive, professional, flexible, and very adaptable to our party needs. Gave them a deposit, met them at the designated location, they squared away cost with venue, then we proceeded with our party. That simple. I would def use them again.
