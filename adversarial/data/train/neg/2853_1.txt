One of our favorite restaurants. We dine here frequently and have never had a bad meal. Flavors are always spot on. If you like lamb, this is the best place in the area to get it. Their adana wraps are delicious too. One of our favorite dishes is Iskender, which is thinly sliced gyro meat in a butter-tomato sauce, topped with fresh yogurt. Vegetarians and omnivores alike will love the Zucchini Pancakes or Vegetarian Mixed Grill Platter (importantly, the vegetables are cooked to the proper doneness). The calamari here is about the best we've had, with the lightest coating of flour and a deliciious garlic dipping sauce. We always order one of their fresh salads, usually the White Bean Salad or Shepherd Salad. And do not miss the best baklava you may ever have. \n\nServers are always courteous and efficient. In warm weather, the outdoor patio is a lovely place to dine. Valet parking is available, but there is free parking along side streets. I could go on, but you get the idea.
