I've seen Britney and Gwen Stefani here, and I do love this theater. No matter where you sit, you'll have a decent view, unless some big tall person gets in front of you. For Britney, I was in the GA standing area by the stage, which was amazing and fun! For Gwen I was in the lower orchestra section, and I think I enjoyed that much more! Being able to sit when I wanted and not get bumped into every 2 seconds was nice. Getting through security is never a huge hassle, as they move it along pretty quickly. The only downside of this venue is the drink prices. I know, it's common at all shows on the strip, but it's still a downside. $13 for a single shot drink, $18 for a double, or $24 for a triple with an $18 refill. I think I paid these same prices when I saw Demi Lovato at another venue, so again, I get that it's common. But to be honest I paid for 3 whole drinks because I wanted the Just A Girl souvenir cup they came in lol. Overall great place to see great artists, and enjoy the show!
