Pretty good. \nWas recommended by a friend. \nStaff behind the counter was very friendly and very helpful.\nA nice menu, and you can't really get grilled cheese at a lot of restaurants.\nThey were helpful in preparing something vegan for one of our party.\nDifferent cheeses would be a nice addition.
