Cien Agaves offers a great blend of a few of my favorite things: happy hour, quesadillas, and margaritas. \n\nI've never been when it's not happy hour, so I always order the tinga chicken quesadilla and usually a margarita and the bill is less than $10. Hard to beat. \n\nI like sitting on the patio usually. Sometimes there are annoying birds or people smoking, but it's shaded and I prefer to be outside. \n\nWhy not 5 stars? This past visit, my server (Siena?) was excellent and the best I've had here, but my credit card was run twice somehow. Annoying that I have to deal with disputing a charge. Also, my quesadilla was 1\/2 crunchy and awesome as usual, but 1\/2 soggy and while still good - not as good.
