I wouldn't recommend this place. I was switched around 3 times. I was here for over 3 hours. The first lady didn't even know how to glue on my nails because two of them popped off when the guy was filling my nails. The one lady who painted my nails did a shitty job. Also, it's only been 2 days since I been here and my nail already popped off. This has to be the worst nail salon. It's a total rip off. I pay 60 dollars for this kind of service. I even called and the guy basically said oh well you're going to have to pay extra since it's not their fault.
