Solid British pub chain food. Three restaurants. Thats it on this strip.  We're not exactly talking major picks here but for what it's worth, the patio is huge, you get a nice view of the Toronto skyline, and you can't go wrong with the guaranteed quality carb pub style burger and beer combos. No signature dishes to give you that Marine Park Drive \"Ahh\" but, beers and patios. Solid B+.
