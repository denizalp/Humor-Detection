First time at an outback restaurant. Food was good. The flaming onion or somethings rather was huge, I helped eat it but I was almost full by the time the entree came to the table. Our waitress was nice but she seemed off of it (somewhat flustered) during our dining. It was a very busy Sunday that we went there though, so I don't blame her. Overall it was a nice luncheon.
