My dad's been coming to this cute little place for quite some time. He loves quality food and their bread and pastries are definitely fresh and delicious. \n\nB and I were feeling like something sweet so we chose an apple pastry and a pineapple one. We thought the pineapple was lemon so that was kind of a surprise but it was still good. My dad picked out a few loaves of bread. \n\nThe bakery actually supplies a lot of local businesses and is much larger than it looks. The front section is where you can pick out all of your items but you can peek into the back where all of the production takes place. All of the ladies working were suuuper helpful and friendly. It's just one of those quirky, cool little spots that's totally Vegas.
