I am very happy to say today we went after church and this time was a COMPLETE about face from our last experience.  We were promptly greeted and seated, very warmly and affectionately.  We were waited on by Bobbi Jo and she was fantastic.  She promptly brought  our beverages and was extremely pleasant and happy. We were practically greeted and smiled at from everyone in the place and the manager John made it a point to bring out food and thank everyone for coming and he came over to ensure our experience was fabulous. He had shared with us how he JUST took over this location this week.  AFTER our meal I  shared with him about my previous review and he said he had a note about it. He uses my experience as a coaching tool that is never to happen on his watch!  After this experience we will be here a lot more often!  Thanks for an amazing meal and restoring our faith in VI!!!!
