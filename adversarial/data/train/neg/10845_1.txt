For those of you looking for the Y2 experience further south... this AMAZING SPACE is your JAM. State of the art EVERYTHING- towel service, ice and filtered water for that Yeti...  HOT studio and amazing lighting and energy- the lighting is complimentary to the practice... you don't feel like your in a fluorescent gym lighted studio... early morning is dim lit, and awesome. VERY strong teachers... and vibe is awesome. Sound system state of the art...  perfect for that chest thumping power flow. Great intro offer to take lots of classes. A short dip down 77s to Fort Mill And it's directly off  the interstate. GO! get a hot sweaty practice in... grab a cup of coffee on your way out and have a quick chat with the friendly staff...   LOVE LOVE LOVE the vibe.
