Chenin Orthodontics treats you like family. They are so nice and professional in every aspect. I knew I was in good hands when I had my first consultation with Kelly and she gave me a free electric toothbrush, she just wanted me to have a great smile no matter what. The hygienists always greet you with a smile and have great conversation(that's important to me). Dr. Stephen and Dr. Dave are awesome guys as well! They bring a level of comfort that is top notch. I would recommend Chenin Orthodontics to anyone looking for some alignment. Thanks for treating me great and straightening my teeth just in time for my wedding!
