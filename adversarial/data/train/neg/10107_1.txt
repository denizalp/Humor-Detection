This is by far one of the worst.  I've been to a lot of different Wendy's around the US since I travel for work.  Wendy's is always my go to when the only option I have is fast food.  It's needs to to be updated.  It smells funny inside.  It doesn't have a coke freestyle like most Wendy's do which was a big bummer for my family.  It is pretty small and understaffed but that may be because they're hiring.  Over all it taste like Wendy's but just not as pleasant as others.
