I first heard about Paris to New York Nail Bar when a friend tweeted a pic of her nails.  They were so cute, a french manicure with Hello Kitty art.  They are near Anthem so it is a little way out for me well I finally made it to give them a try.  I was not disappointed.  I didn't have an appointment so wasn't sure I would even be able to get in but they got me right in without a wait.  They are in the same shopping center as Bread and Butter which is a huge plus.  I'll use any excuse to stop in there.  The shop is really cute and they have a few things for sale.  My pedicure turned out great and my 3D art stayed on for a long time.  I am surprised they have such a low rating.  I would highly recommend them.
