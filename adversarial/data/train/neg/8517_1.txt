One of my favorite neighborhood bars. Casual and low-key, but does tend to get down quite a bit. I have been there with my ex Billy Bob, but he prefers the bitter bite of  martini. However, we would get happily sloshed there and the decor is quite artistic. I can't really tell if I liked it so much because I was in love with him and all, or it was actually the place. Better give the place props just to be sure!!!
