I bought one of those one deal offers for a \"cactus body wrap\".  I didn't know what to expect, the place is a little far away from where I live, but for the price I decided to get it.  Noel did my wrap, she was really sweet and professional.  I loved the wrap.  I saw several signs that said they would give you a complementary make up touch up.  I was excited about it because I had not done my makeup (I had a migraine earlier) and I had to go pick up my kids from preschool.  Noel said \"oh yes, Zethina will touch up your make up\".  That was my only disappointment.  When I was ready to get my touch up, Zethina was busy fixing shelves.  Noel was nice enough to put some concealer and mascara.
