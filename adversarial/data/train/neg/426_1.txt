Took a while to get seated.  Then took a while to get our beers.  The food was very tasty we had sandwiches and wings after a ball game.  The wing sauce was good, but the meat tasted like premade frozen chicken.    I didn't think the bar was that busy but I noticed t took a long time for other tables to order and get service.  That should be addressed.  They have a ridiculous amount of beers to choose from and you better brush up on your beer knowledge to order a beer.  I told the waitress what kind of beer I like and she gave me a suggestion that was no way near the same type of beer I like, but that is my fault for not knowing beer well enough.
