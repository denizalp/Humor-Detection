Came to Dr. Standley for a 2nd opinion after being told I needed expensive gum treatment elsewhere. I had a wonderful experience here...The nurse made no mention of expensive work, and said my gums look great. They also did a wonderful job cleaning my teeth. I enjoyed the experience so much I already scheduled my next appointment 6 months down the road.\n\n Dr Standley is also one of the nicest guys I've ever met. He's the type of person who will make you happier just by being around him.\n\nIf I could give this place 6 stars, I would.
