I would give this 3 stars, but I really couldn't get by the \"greasy spoon\" atmosphere of this place.  It's not just the decor, the longer I sat here (which was awhile, kind of slow service) the more I saw how much this joint needs to be CLEANED.\n\nWent here on a Sunday at opening.  One waitress and a groupon special going on which I must've missed out on.  She was a little frazzled, and messed up every table's order.  We got vegetable curry, vegetable pad thai, and Tom yum soup.  The curry was very good, but the rice seemed to have been, ahem, reheated.  She brought a different pad thai to the table than what was ordered.  The soup was so-so, for the price I wouldn't order it again.  Everyone around us was sending food back.  \n\nAs a carry-out this place would probably rate higher.  The forks were in a coffee cup on the table, the \"condiments\" had been sitting out all night and everything in this place needs to be wiped down.\n\nThe kicker came at the end when I asked for a bag for the left overs....the waitress stuck her finger in the pitcher of water at the beverage table to separate the plastic bag from the stack.  Carry-out if you eat here
