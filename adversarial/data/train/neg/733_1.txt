decided to come here yet again with my boyfriend and the same woman from my previous review was there, running around every where back and forth seemingly overwhelmed although the diner was not too busy. had multiple arguments with the cook who was also helping by walking out the orders and serving tables... i took my food to go and it would have been fine but I asked for sides... extra fries, avocado and jalapeños on my burger etc & was charged for all of that but got none of it... didn't even want to say anything or argue it with the waitress because she already seemed a hair away from snapping. probably will never ever return. everyone in the diner was complaining. maybe waitressing just isn't this woman's forté, but man oh man has this place gone down the drain.
