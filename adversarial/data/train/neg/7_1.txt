I chose Luang Prabang out of the 20 or so food carts near the U of W mostly due to Yelp reviews (but partially because Laotian food sounded good). However, I had a fairly lackluster experience. They were out of most of their dishes already by 2:00, so I had a fairly limited selection (no spicy sausage, sadly). I chose the yellow curry, and it was just ok. The rice tasted and felt like it had been sitting a long time (very mushy), and the curry lacked pretty much any sort of vegetables despite the people there telling me there would be veggies in it - it was about 90% potatoes (I know, in the midwest they consider potatoes to be a vegetable, but they really aren't). I'll definitely come back to try out the spicy sausage, as it gets rave reviews here, but if they are out of it (and they told me they usually sell out by noon or 1pm), you should skip this place and pick another cart.
