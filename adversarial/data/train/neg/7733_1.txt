I was very happy with Sun Valley Stereo.  I just moved to the area and got a new (used) car and wanted to put a new radio in.  Due to the great reviews I went there and Ryan was there, very knowledgable and pleasant.  We got a Pioneer radio, new antenna for around $200 with blue tooth technology for the music streaming. Ryan showed us how to use it and was very easy to work with.  Great service, reasonable prices and quick work.  I am very glad to have found them.
