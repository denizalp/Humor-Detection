Ordered 6 hot boneless wings, got them fairly quick and I think these were pre cooked and sat under a light because some were warm on the outside and inside. But some were warm and cold on the inside. Only 1 though so not a big deal. Pizza was nice and cooked and good in flavor. Better for pizza and not wings.
