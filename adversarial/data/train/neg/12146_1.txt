Stopped in for a lunch date with my hubby. We ended up each getting 2 slices (that were very large) We wanted to try as many slices as we could. Shameful... I know... but we also got garlic knots. \nSlice 1- Hawaiian  the slices were all extra large, this one was perfect. It was my number #1, my favorite for sure. \nSlice 2- White slice, also pretty good. It was my runner up though. There was nothing overly exciting about it but it was a true solid slice. \nKnots- coming from NY I haven't really found a good knot yet. These tasted good but I'm still missing the light fluffy  knot. All the knots I have tried are dense and greasy. All though they are good, they are not what I am looking for. The side sauce was too tart for my taste but that's just my personal preference. \n\nThe restaurant was cute, a regular pizza joint. I enjoyed all the NY sports on the walls... it feels like home. The staff was super nice and friendly. I can't wait to go back and try more. Solid pizza here folks.
