I went to this restaurant on a Tuesday night. A friend had really wanted to go and I was like what the heck, I'll check it out.\n\nAt first impression it was busy-af. Especially for a Tuesday night. There seemed to be a lot of Korean patrons, so for a Korean restaurant it must be pretty legit.\n\nWhile in line I scrolled through some of the Yelp photos just to check out what they had. It really just seemed to be the same photos of the same thing... I was like ok well that's no help.\n\nTook only about 5 mins to seat. Once seated we were given teas and menus. There I came to the realization that the menu was actually quite a dense menu (meaning not a lot of menu items). There was perhaps about 10 things to choose from. No wonder the Yelp page seemed to feature photos of the same dish.\n\nI appreciate dense menus. It means they're jot trying to do too much, and just sticking to what they're good at.\n\nI ordered the combo 1, which is the beef, shrimp, and mussel soup. You can choose from levels of spiciness. I chose medium.\n\nThe soup was actually really good! Not too spicy but tasty. If you're looking for a hefty dinner, this isn't it though.\n\nYou are served a soup, with your chosen ingredients, and a bowl of purple rice and a raw egg to crack in your soup. Have a look at the photos, that description doesn't do it justice. The soup is quite tasty.\n\nService is quick, efficient and really to the point. Nothing too exuberant. Great for a quick bite.
