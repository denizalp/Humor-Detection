Couples massage after a three day road trip! Best part was that it wasn't your standard ladies massage place, had all this awesome rock music memorabilia ALL over the place! Such a unexpected twist on the decor, totally put my boyfriend's hesitations about getting a massage aside!\n\nWe went with a couple deep tissue, 50 minute massage, which was excellent after driving for three days to get to Vegas! Having never had a deep tissue before, wasn't sure what to expect, but it was just such a great experience! A $8 cab ride from our hotel on the strip, fantastic interior, and our room was ready quickly after our arrival! Another great perk was that it did NOT cost an arm and a leg for couples massage literally five minutes from the Vegas Strip, can't get much better than that! And afterwards, the girl at the front desk was able to call a cab for us! \n\nSuch friendly staff, awesome interior, great prices, and close location to our hotel! Definitely will be going back again!
