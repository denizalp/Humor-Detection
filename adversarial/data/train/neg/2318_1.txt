This is 1 of the best Thai restaurants I have been to. Especially being in the area it's in. As always, ordered Chicken Pad Thai, and veggie and chicken Red Curry. Absolutely bomb delicious!!  A glass of there Thai Iced Tea makes it even better. The one thing negative about that I'd there are no refills. I was kinda put off. Like what place charges for refills?! Especially being over $2 a glass! And I'm one that is sort of sensitive to heat, so I was disappointed about that. But overall, clean, friendly environment and great food!
