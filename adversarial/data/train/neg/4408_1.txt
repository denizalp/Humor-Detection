So I've been coming here for 3 months now and for the last 6 weeks, I've had two fills done on my acrilic nails. I'm 7 months pregnant and my nails underneath are growing like crazy from the vitamins I'm taking. Tonight, I took them off so I could just get gel manicures until after I have the baby. Two of my nails on my right hand have fungus on them! Never in my 15 years of getting my nails done has this ever happened! I'm so disappointed and grossed out. This is an unnecessary stress I need right now. I will never go back!
