We have been dining here since they opened.  Last night we decided to try two new appetizers that Dennis told us about.....they were excellent!  We had the salt and pepper shrimp which was\nvery flavorful and the sweet and sour wings which were a different way of serving wings.  This new twist on wings won us over!  We will definitely order these two appetizers again.\nJim and Cheryl
