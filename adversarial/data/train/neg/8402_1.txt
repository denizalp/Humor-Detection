This is the cutest, most wonderful ice cream spot! The prices are just right, and it has a huge selection of flavors! There's the usual flavors, cookie dough and butter pecan, but they have some really odd ones too- buffalo wing W\/ ranch swirl is currently on the menu. There's a small table for children and they have coloring books and crayons to help keep the little ones busy as well! Not normally a thing to think about, but in the bathroom they also have a toilet seat that can convert to a smaller seat for little kids, which is REALLY nice for a 2 year old! I will definitely be coming back for more sweets with my little ones!
