The huai du bop (spelling?) at Koi is a must-have when I visit Phoenix (let's just say they know me there). A massive bowl of fresh greens, daikon radish, a bit of spice and sauce, and amazingly fresh, flavorful fish. A sashimi salad, essentially, and one of my all-time favorite meals. We often split one of these and add a roll for a meal fit for a queen!\n\nThe rolls are flavorful and while some of the old standards are there, of couse, they have some unique ones as well. I love their state-themed rolls: a take on a flavor or ingredient you might expect traveling these united states... in sushi form!\n\nAnother favorite is the all-vegetable roll (damn, the name escapes me), that uses cucumber instead of rice and seaweed. On a hot day in the middle of the southwest desert, this is a light lunch that allows you to enjoy their amazing sushi without feeling heavy when you leave.\n\nThe food is fresh and tasty, the service is fast and friendly. The space is small, but there always seems to be room for one more table, one more person at the bar. Depending on the weather, go out and enjoy your meal on the patio!\n\nThe wine list could be expanded, but they have a decent bar selection.
