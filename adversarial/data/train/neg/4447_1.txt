First time last week for a large group dinner! The staff was friendly, just pretty slow.\n\nSalad on the fixed catering menu was great, as was dessert. The steak was just not as expected to match \"arrogant\" expectations. It was not cooked how I ordered and lacked flavor. \n\nGreat branding, fun atmosphere. \n\nMy least favorite #fox so far!
