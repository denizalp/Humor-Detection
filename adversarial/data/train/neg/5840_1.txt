Very small cramped store, but they've packed a bunch in. Nice people all the time. I was looking to switch my dog over to actual GOOD food and had a couple in mind after doing research. A girl in there talked to me forever and showed me all my options and I finally decided on Taste of the Wild. Great choice by the way! They have a variety of some things you cant find in other stores, and also have some horse tack and supplies in the back. They also carry livestock feed, have a small public bathroom and good prices.\n\nWatch what you get for feed from in back though. I got very infested chicken feed one time.
