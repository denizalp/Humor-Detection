If I could give zero stars I would . My daughter and I were not treated well yesterday when the cashier rang in our items incorrectly. They had an attitude as though it was our fault . We returned our whole purchase after my credit card was charged numerous times . I will be on phone today trying to rectify what the store manager kami could have done so easily.  I have been a a customer of this store for quite some time , but I will now either visit the boca park location or choose another company to buy my candles and lotions from. crappy day
