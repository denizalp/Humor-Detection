I loved their food. It was delicious and mouthwatering. We ordered Beef Bihari boti, kebabs and charge. They fry their chargah which enhances it flavoring. Loved their food. Even their chai is absolutely delicious. Our only issue was the prices. They were bit on higher side.\n\nThe reason for 1 star deduction is because of seating arrangement. With the amount of money we will be paying, we wouldn't want to wait in line longer, or be scrutinized by fellow diners on what we have ordered. There is limited privacy in dining and excessive noise. But all in all a good place.
