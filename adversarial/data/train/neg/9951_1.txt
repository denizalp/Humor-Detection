My parents and I own a few rental properties that have become a little challenging to manage. Instead of making money we have been losing tons of money because of all of the problems. We have been experiencing a bad tenants and quite a bit of damage to some of the apartments. It has been a little frustrating. I have had to take off of work to try to handle some of the issues which has been a little stressful. My colleague recommended I contact Active Renter Property Management. This was one of the best referrals I have ever received. They are excellent. They have been managing everything. They helped us with the tenant selection which was a blessing because we had tons of problems because we kept choosing the wrong tenants. They also took care of the damages and kept on top of the rentals. They took care of everything. My parents and I now have a piece of mind. Active Renter Property Management allows us generate a stress free income from our property. I would highly recommend them.
