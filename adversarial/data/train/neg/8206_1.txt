Excellent!\n\nI grew up on Malee's on Main which I think is the best. Living in Tempe & Scottsdale for years...\n\nHaving moved to the central corridor I discovered Wild Thaiger. \nAs good if not better! Bomb!\n\nWas able to chat with the owner last visit. Love that! She's charming!\n\nHighly recommend!
