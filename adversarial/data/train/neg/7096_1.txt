We went for the breakfast buffet which is at $ 20. There was a queue outside but when we got in there were empty tables so don't understand the queue. The server was good kept topping up our orange juice regularly. The ambience is not so great though. There is an omlette live counter which is quite good n they have crabmeat and shrimp as toppings. There was also salads, pizza, softee machine, fruits etc. What we really liked were the omlettes, danish, almond croissants, turkey sausage,waffles. Most stuff was good. Pancakes weren't tat great though, there was a guy making them but I guess the backlog made them cold n not so fresh. The muffins were dry. Not bad overall though. Definitely worth a try.
