Fantastic beer selection on tap, but food selection was so-so.  We started w a dozen of the buck-a-shuck oysters - and they only serve one type (kushi?) which was good but I would have wanted some variety.  For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the buttermilk chicken on waffles w\/ syrup - which was very yummy!  I had the \"can't believe it's not veal\" vegetarian sandwich and while it was good, it didn't come with any sides.  I just felt like something was missing!  They also didn't have any poutine today when we visited, so that was disappointing.  Atmosphere is pretty good, but was kind of empty.  And I also didn't like how our server was kind of clueless.  I asked him what the special was today and he straight up told me \"I actually don't know\".  Um...right.  So am I supposed to tell you or something?\n\nAnyway - it's ok but not memorable.  Would rather check out other spots in the area.
