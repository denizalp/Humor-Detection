The Halibut Burrito with everything rules.  The huge piece of fish was flaky, moist and fresh tasting.  I don't think there's anywhere else in the city you can get something comparable.  \n\nI've also had their quesadilla several times and love their sauce and the flavouring of both their beef and chicken.  You can't got wrong with either.\n\nOrder by phone if you want to save time, or avoid the lunch hour for faster service.\n\nIt's not a quiet place to eat when it's busy...so you might want to find a nearby park bench (weather permitting).
