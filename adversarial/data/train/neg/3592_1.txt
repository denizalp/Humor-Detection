Can only say great things about Elite! We were looking for a place to train our 13 year old daughter who plays volleyball. Chris talked to us for 45 minutes trying to learn as much as possible about her, her habits and hang ups, then put her through a great workout. She's trained there 3-4 days a week for 8 weeks and her block jump has improved by 4\" already. \n\nHer trainer, Tyler, keeps things fresh and challenges her regularly. He also educates her on nutrition and keeps her motivated. \n\n5 stars all the way!
