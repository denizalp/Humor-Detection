This place needs to make up its mind! Sometimes they're coffee shop sometimes they're a restaurant and sometimes they are a wine bar. I think they've tried music venue\/art gallery as well. They do none of these things with excellence. The coffee is fine, often bitter or weak. The staff can't be blamed, since they are not trained as baristas. Dont order dinner, i've tried several things and nothing is great but it's all more than $10. Honestly I come still from time to time because the place is so conveniently located and every time I go I regret it (I never seem to learn, I go three times a year and its been like 5 years). If you want to be a coffee shop be a really good coffee shop, if you want to be a bar be a really good bar, if you want to be a restaurant be a really good restaurant! Pick one, and focus and do it well!!
