Our server was very inattentive. Kept going behind the bar to fill drink. We sat there for approx 20minutes waiting for the bill. It was even worse when the server looked directly at me three times and saw we were waiting and proceeded to walk away from us. The food was phenomenal though. The steak was fantastic. However to me personally a server can make or break the experience. And ours broke it.
