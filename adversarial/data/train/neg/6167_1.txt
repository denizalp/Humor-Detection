So when you're seated server brings chips & salsa & water. So first impression since they serve u chips salsa & water you thinks it's a complimentary thing. So we ask for more chips a server says its additional $150 we say ok.  Another server comes back & say it's $4.50  we said ok since we got more guacamole left. We then get our meals but can finish it. After we were done eating we still had a half plate of food left on 2 plates server comes by ask if we're done we say yes but want to take food to go but jus grabs plates & stacks all plates on the food we were gonna take didn't even ask if we wanted to take to go. so then we get the bill and they charge for water. What's up with that. So bad experience.
