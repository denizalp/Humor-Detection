I never thought I would see myself and my company in an office building that was less than a high rise office building. We are in the commercial real estate development business and aesthetics, functionality and Class \"A\" office space is extremely important to us as a company. The Kierland Vision executive offices and suites have been a blessing. Not just from a company standpoint but for our employees as well.  We all appreciate the hard work and extra effort from the administrative and working staff at the property. We were just talking about it this morning that it is a great thing when the lunch room is always stocked with things that you need and always clean and plentiful with water, lemonade, sweet tea, utensils etc. You only appreciate it when those things aren't available to you on a regular daily basis. I would recommend this place as well as Theresa Laursen Joanne Sanchez and Gemini as an extension of your business.
