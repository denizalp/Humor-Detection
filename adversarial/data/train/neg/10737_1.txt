Stopped at Chica by chance.  \n\nWhere to start?   \n\nFlawless execution on opening day.  How?  Outstanding staff from the hostess who loaned me her phone for a half hour to Bo, Jessica and the entire group behind the bar.  I've walked the earth 51 years and never had shots this good.  \n\nThe food was simply incredible.  Chicken appetizer, jasmine rice, ceviche all out of this world.  My friend called the octopus the best he's ever had.  \n\nI've never posted a restaurant review.  But I could not wait to tell this story.   \n\nThe upbeat \/ family vibe is unreal.  Decor is stunning from the artwork to the ceilings to the floors to the flowers.   There are beautiful restaurants in Las Vegas but this one stands out.  Very relaxing.  \n\nChica is a 10.
