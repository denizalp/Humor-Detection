Taste: 2.5\nCreativity\/Authenticity: 3\nAtmosphere: 2\nService: 4\nBang for your buck: 2.5\n\nLas Vegas is an overwhelming place. there are so many places to eat actually finding a place to eat here is pretty difficult. Casanova not our first choice tucked away in the venetian (tucked away in the back) This place is \"OK\" there wasn't anything extraordinary about it, but there wasn't anything terrible about it either. Our service was excellent! Fast and Friendly. The pasta was ok - hit the spot! My GF and I couldn't agree on any other places in the area, it was either $17 lobster roll or this .Best thing in the area since the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed and the rest is food court food.
