I've been getting my waxing and eyelash extensions done by Lacy for about two years now. Before her, I had been getting Brazilian waxes for about 10 years. After the first time I tried Lacy out, I knew I'd been getting the wrong people to wax me. It was the fastest and least painful Brazilian waxing experience I'd ever had. Then, I tried her for an eyebrow wax and she wowed me again! I'd always gotten my eyebrows waxed at random nail salons and never had any complaints per say, but my eyebrows are naturally shaped well. But when Lacy got her hands on them, they became perfect! As long as I live in Las Vegas, no one other than Lacy will ever touch my eyebrows or any other part of my body that needs waxing. As for eyelash extensions, I've seen some bad ones, but I have no other technician to compare Lacy to because she was my first. And boy am I glad that she popped my eyelash extension cherry. I get nothing but compliments on how amazing my eyelashes are, and usually the people complimenting me don't even know they're not real. Lacy is a perfectionist and it shows in her work. Best in Las Vegas!
