The staff and the doctor were amazing: they were very warm and accommodating, made sure to inform you about all the fees, took care of the hassle of contacting your insurance, and made sure to facilitate a transfer in case you needed a specialist (like I did since I needed a wisdom tooth removed ASAP)
