It is absolutely crazy to see how much of this area is being gentrified in such a short amount of time. I am so happy that the east end is getting more recognized, but more importantly, aesthetically pleasing businesses as well. Staff here are friendly and their matcha lattes are delicious.\n\nBeautiful cafe, although it already gets packed. You can do work here, I've had the wifi in and out a few times but it's not bad. Great place for catchups, work sessions, and refreshing drinks. Gerrard St is going to be insane this summer! I am excited.
