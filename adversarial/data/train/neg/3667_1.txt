This is one of my favorite places to go out in Charlotte. They always have a great and diverse crowd (Check out their pictures on FaceBook). Everyone is definitely dressed to empress. The resident DJ plays good music (EDM, Top 40, Hip Hop). They have a dance floor bar, Patio bar and a side room bar so it's not real hard to get a drink. The ladies that work there are real cool. It's great to have a dance club on The South End of Charlotte. It's a real fun place to be on Saturday nights.
