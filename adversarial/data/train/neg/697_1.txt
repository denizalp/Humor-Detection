The management is terrible!!!!! I ordered a seafood combination ( lobster scallops shrimp ) they give me tuna scallops and shrimp forget to bag my salad and soup!!!! On top of that the seafood combination cost 4-8$ more I called to address this the Chinese lady offered me a four dollar refund after they forgot my stuff an over charged me sad business practice I'm never going there again poor management
