Love this place! Tight seating quarters, but don't let that stop you from enjoying some amazing ramen...or buns or sushi or all of these great offerings. I had the Miso ramen and it was delicious to the last drop. They bring the spices to you so you can spice it up, or not. Music was a little loud and a little chaotic, but again don't let that stop you.
