What an eclectic restaurant! They say they're Japanese and  Malaysian, but they also seem to have Thai and Chinese influences on their menu. I had the Curry Laksa, which is an amalgamation of a traditional curry and pho. It's a large bowl of either egg or rice noodles with beef, chicken, shrimp, and vegetables in a flavorful curry and coconut milk broth. My dining companion got the shrimp hibachi, which was delicious as well. A solid choice in an area of the city known for its Asian food.\n\n* Be sure to look for the Yelp check-in offer for a free glass of wine or domestic beer. :D *
