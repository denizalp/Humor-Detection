This airline is nothing short of a nightmare. The customer service is awful. I tried to get in touch with them to confirm a flight and after 36 hours of constantly hearing that my call could not be taken due to high volume calls we gave up and went to airport. Flight was delayed 4 hours for reasons never explained. Boarded plane 6 hours later only to be ushered off due to lightening and mechanical problems with the a\/c. 8 hours later flight was cancelled. From that point on it was as if a group of 5 year olds were put in control. Promised us shuttles and hotels would be aval. Ushered us all outside of airport in bad weather to wait on the curb for shuttles that were never called for. Hotels were never booked. We had to find our own hotel and shuttle. We were told we all would be reimbursed but not given firms , vouchers or a number to call. Just the response \" save your receipts\" they said allegiantwould reimburse us 250.00 per room only to come back and say they couldn't reimburse that much and didn't know what the reimbursement would be. When I asked the gate manager and the airline rep to provide blankets and pillows to those who could not afford to pay up front for hotel rooms or could not find an aval room I was told the airport doesn't have blankets or pillows and neither do the airlines. Apparently American Airlines was responsible for the baggage Cart that was unsecured and hit the allegiance jet. Another reason for the flight cancellation. An American rep was nowhere in sight to help with this nightmare. Our next allegiance flight is at 3:10 so we will return to the airport at 11:00 only to wait another 4 hours. They said we would receive free vouchers but with all the trouble allegiance is having it will probably be Monopoly money. Lesson learned \"cheapy buy cheapy get\"
