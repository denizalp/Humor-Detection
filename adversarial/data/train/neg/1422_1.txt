SWENSONS, AHH. What else is there to say?\n\nIf you're a northeast Ohioan, you already know. If you're not, you need to be simply just for this reason. \nThese burgers don't look like much, but I can assure you, they are everything. Their special sauce, their secret ingredients, their brown sugar, everything is right about these burgers. The Galley Boy is their signature, it's a big burger, with just about everything you need on a burger. Then buns are toasted, which make them look not-all-that-special to be honest, but that's the only way they do their buns, toasted. It's all about their hamburger patties and how they make\/cook them. Their special ingredients in the burger itself-is what makes Swensons special. Not to mention their fries, all of their fried sides for that matter, are awesome because they're, well, fried. Fried zucchini bites are my favorite.\nYou must take a milkshake to-go on your way out. They have so many flavor options, it's stupid. But you will find something that you will LOVE, I promise you. They change their flavor options up so much honestly, I think seasonally. There's no way to not love their milkshakes too. It's a great Saturday afternoon, stop after shopping and grab something to eat, kind-of-place, (also great hangover food).\n\nIt's a MUST-TRY in the northeast Ohio area for sure. If you find yourself going through Cleveland or Akron\/Canton area, you must give it a go-just to say you did.
