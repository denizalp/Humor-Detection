It was OK. My \"Buddhist Udon Noodles\" were tasty, but very salty. My wife's Special Fried Rice was salty, but not tasty. Overall better than edible, but not great by any stretch. And at $10 per, not a great value (a lot of mediocre food for a lot of money doesn't constitute a great value, y'all.). \n\nIf you're hungry, you can do worse, and unfortunately, it's hard to do better. There just aren't many good value meals at CLT. Charlotte's a pretty nice airport ... except for the food.
