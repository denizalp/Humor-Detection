If you're vegan this place is horrible!! I'm so disappointed. This is the first place I've seen that has vegan specific breakfast and it's awful. I had the soyrizo burrito, side of wheat pancakes and coffee, my mom had the mushroom spinach tofu scramble and tea. The burrito was so spicy that it literally hurt my mouth and throat. The pancakes were very undercooked. The coffee was watery. The scramble tasted like someone dumped an entire pepper shaker on it. The toast was dry. The sweet potato hash was tasteless and mushy. The tea was boring. Food was way too expensive. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T GO HERE!!! The only good part of the whole meal was that the manager refunded half our bill and gave us a coupon for two free entrees.
