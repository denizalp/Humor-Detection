MOST DISGUSTING TASTELESS PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! I SWEAR the sauce on the pizza was Hunt's tomato paste! And if it wasn't  that is what it tasted like! What happened with this location Metro Pizza??? The Tropicana and Flamingo locations are freakin amazing!!! This one is just BAD BAD BAD!! So disappointing :(
