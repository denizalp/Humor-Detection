This location was the best out of all the Demetres i have been to. The decor is superb! I ordered the my regular, which was the Machiatto with the Belgian chocolate and the crepe and Roche ice cream and it was divine!\nNatasha was our waitress and she was amazing. She checked on us numerous times and was very accommodating. \nNo complaints!
