This place doesn't seem to know what it is and has taken on too many things, all of which are done poorly. The food is bland and tasteless and overpriced. $6 for a mediocre latte? The market carries a random assortment of useless iyems. Avoid. I hope it closes and a better restaurant takes the good location.
