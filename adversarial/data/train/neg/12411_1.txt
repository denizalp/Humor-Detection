In the past I wouldn't go near repair shops due to how sketchy they felt and looked but I did not feel this way when walking into this store. Ubreakifix in Scottsdale was an excellent experience and I will absolutely go back to them if I ever need another repair done. I couldn't believe how fast they fixed my iPhone and how professional they were. Thank you Kelly and Ryan for saving my phone!
