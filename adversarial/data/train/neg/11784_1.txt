I came in for something other than an oil change this time.  Needed a new fan assembly.  I stopped here for a second opinion and glad I did.  I was presented with both the OEM product and an aftermarket product as my options.  We went through the pricing and I actually compared it to a previous estimate from a different mechanic.  The cost was considerably cheaper with Midas.  The reason- the other mechanic line-itemed the cost for a relay switch that actually is a part of the fan assembly.  Essentially, they tried to charge me twice.  Midas was straightforward and the team is again, the best I've worked with.  Superior service at a fair price.  Dependability and Honesty will always get my business.
