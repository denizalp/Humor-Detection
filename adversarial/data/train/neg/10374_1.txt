There aren't many spots in Vegas that I give 5 stars to, but every time I've come here I've had a great experience. \n\nFood: all of the food here is incredible and there is a really great selection to satisfy anyone and everyone. I highly suggest their Buffalo Cauliflower...unreal! There are also some awesome deals during their Happy Hour (M-F 330-630. \n\nEnvironment: it's a very cute theme and the restaurant is dimly lit and inviting. They have a great patio for the summer months with fun games\nand things. Nice spot to bring a group!\n\nService: the waitstaff is always great. Our server Mandi was so sweet and very knowledgeable of the menu, offering her personal favorites and suggestions. She clearly took a great deal of pride in her work and invited us to dine there again (which we definitely will!)\n\n5-stars, well-deserved.
