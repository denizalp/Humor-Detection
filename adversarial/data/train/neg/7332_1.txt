First, let me preface this review stating that a trip to the dentist is, or WAS among the top 5 of my biggest fears. So if you share my \"dentaphobia\" then come over and see Dr Villalobosin Ahwatukee. When looking for a new office, I narrowed it down to 2 but didn't even call the second one in line. You see office folk, YOU are the first impression of a practice. If you are rude or dismissive, guess what, we don't want to schedule with you. Ashley,(I hope I got her name right!) at Desert Dentistry clearly got the memo on this, because she was a class act, very friendly, and immediately made me feel comfortable. I was not shy about letting her know I was terrified, and she assured me I would be in good hands with Dr. V.\n\nI had put off visiting the dentist for a long, long time. I was ashamed that I had not gone in, but knew I most likely had cavities and chose to live in denial for awhile. I was also concerned about my old mercury fillings and wanted them replaced, but man, did not want to have it done!\n\nLet me tell you, everyone I came into contact with was excellent. The hygienist was top notch, the gal dealing with insurance saved me a bundle from the original insurance quote, and Dr. V was amazing. I chose to use nitrous oxide to calm my anxiety and what a life saver! Dr V is very gentle, she explained step by step what she was doing, and I finally conquered by fear. Dare I say, I am no longer terrified! I'm even going to go back in 6 mos like most normal people do! I am sooooo excited that I finally found someone I can trust. They are so gentle that I am moving my 6 year old over to this practice so that we can all be at the same office. Her current pediatric dentist could learn a thing or two about \"chair side\" manner from Dr V.
