Recently visited this place again and found that the food was not as good as I remember it from my previous visits. \n\nMy friend and I shared an order of turkey meatballs (6 pieces) and they were tasty. However, my entree, a chili rub pork tenderloin, was overcooked, so the pork tasted a bit dry. My friend ordered a brick oven chicken breast and it was also overcooked and dry. \n\nI actually liked the sides (shaved brussel sprouts, grilled pears, and fig mostarda) that the pork came with. The fig mostarda was especially delicious. The brussel sprouts gave the dish that crunch factor. Had the pork not been overcooked, this would've been a really good dish.\n\nI still like the place overall. Love the set up and the decor. Good ambience. Good service. Convenient to get to. Plenty of parking. If you've never been and you're in the area, it's worth giving them a try, but I wouldn't make a special drive just to eat here. There are plenty of other good American restaurants in town.\n\nNote: They offer a bottle of wine (all wines listed on their menu) for half off on Wednesday.
