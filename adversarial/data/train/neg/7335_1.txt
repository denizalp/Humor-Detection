I have been going here for years. They have the best twice baked potato. The steak is amazing and the fresh bread with there seasonings on them all warm is to die for. This place has great food and good prices. The reason it is not a 5 star is because the service is always painfully slow. If I am in a hurry I will not eat here. The staff is friendly and nice and I know its because they are busy but i feel like if you are consistently busy certain nights perhaps you should staff more.
