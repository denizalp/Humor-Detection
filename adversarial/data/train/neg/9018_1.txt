Hmmm....i come from LA so I eat alot of asian food and I eat alot of mexican food. To merge the two.....hmmm......all I can say is that its definitely different and one visit is not enough to really determine if this place gets a higher rating. \n\nI will say that the staff and service was great. They have it set up so you can taste test some of the fusion food together so you can make better choices when ordering. The employee who helped us we really nice and helpful. She helped us taste test some of the items and helped us order.\n\nI think the food is good. I am just not use to mixing the different type of food together in one dish so I definitely need to break down that personal barrier. I will have to visit again and try different combination. The jury is still out...
