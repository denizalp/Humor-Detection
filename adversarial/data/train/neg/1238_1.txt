I tried leaving the review on the location that is on 67th ave and bethany home but they dont have it.BUT Let me start off with the bad. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. Ive been here 3 times already and i get the same attitude each time.and by the same girls. They dont welcome you or even say thank you .They take their sweet ass time making the raspados as well VERY SLOW SERVICE on a SLOW day, each time i came there was just one other customer there. Also they dont give you receipts. I asked for a cup of ice cream with two scoops,they charged me and they only gave me one scoop saying i paid for a one scoop icecream,so i had to pay an extra dollar, so how am i supposed to know what she charged me if i dont have a receipt? . The girl somehow got bothered and went to the back and didnt finish our order and had the other rude girl finish it herself. Other than that, the antojitos are really good  and i would like to keep coming back to better custlmer service.
