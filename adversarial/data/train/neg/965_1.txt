This was first visit, I ordered the Super Nachos.  I like that they used nacho cheese and not melted shredded cheese.  The prices were very good compared to other places that serve basically the same items.  Service was fast and the food was pretty good.  My only complaint is the nachos seemed to have too much salt.  I am not a big fan of salt so this may not be an issue for other people who like a lot of salt.  Next visit I plan to try one of the burritos.
