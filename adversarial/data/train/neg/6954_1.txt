The only reason this is getting one star and not zero is because the doctor on hand doesn't seem so bad. The staff and the whole system there is complete trash. I came in the first time and signed a contract for my braces and everything and then came in for my second appointment. When I got there they asked me if I was a new patient and where I got my braces. They didn't even put me in the system and fully put me as a real patient. Then I needed an extraction AND THEY LOST MY REFERRAL AND FILES. I had to wait an extra hour or so because they had to call the doctor who is at a different location and have her fax the referrals. HOW DO YOU LOSE MY FILES. I made a appointment before and then i had someone call me leaving a voicemail saying i need to reschedule. When I called back they said there was no need and they don't know why I got that call. Then today was the last straw. I made an appointment for last week and they made me reschedule for today. I went in early in the morning and I get there try to open the doors AND THEY ARE CLOSED. THEY DIDN'T EVEN CALL ME TO LET ME KNOW OR ANYTHING. Oh and I mustn't forget when they wrote my contract they didn't put my insurance on there which I clearly put in my paperwork ( maybe it got lost when they lost my files) and they started billing me for my insurance portion of the bill. This place is complete trash. If you are considering this company please don't it's a waste of your time.
