I'm sad to say I've lived in the area for 4 years and today was the first time I stopped in. What a quaint little shop with a surprisingly big menu. I had no idea they served food here, well besides the usual coffee shop fare. I tried the cup of coffee breakfast item and it was great, eggs, bacon, stunning multigrain toast and what they call hashbrowns but were unidentifiable as food. The hashbrowns are the only reason they're not getting 5 stars today. I've never had barbeque sauce in my potatoes before and actually didn't mind it but after trying three bites, they were so hard and dried out that I concluded the sauce was an attempt to soften them.  It didn't work and they definitely shouldn't have been served. Everything else was wonderful though, make sure you are prepared for a wait as the usual doofuses working on their screenplays take up the majority of the tables whilst not purchasing anything.
