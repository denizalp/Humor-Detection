We have used Perfect Clean service since 2009 and they have moved with us to three different houses. They are reliable and trustworthy. We are set up on a regular schedule for every other week, which helps get us a discounted rate. They often have to clean the house while my two young children and parents are there but make no big deal about it. We have referred them several times and our friends have found success using them as a regular service as well.
