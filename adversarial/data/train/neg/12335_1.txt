A real gem for the neighborhood. They have a super friendly wait staff and delicious food. You'll find all your Italian favorites, plus and abundance amount of daily specials. \n\nThe restaurant starts you off with fresh bruschetta for the table and a bread basket filled with house made tomato focaccia, accompanied by a small dish of oil and balsamic for dipping. Not a bad way to start while you look over the menu.\n\nSquid Ink Risotto (a special): toothsome, fragrant, and rich in flavor. The squid were tender and moist, but the dish could have used a hint of lemon or some sorrel. The risotto itself was cooked very nicely.\n\nVeal Parmigiana (with a request of vodka sauce instead of marinara): kudos to making excellent pasta. It was perfectly al dente and the vodka sauce was delicious. The veal was moist and tender, had a thin coat of breading, which is what I like, and topped with fresh mozzarella. It's a pretty solid dish, although I would have liked my veal sliced a little thicker.\n\nMy father in law had their pan seared trout, which came super fresh. It sat next to a bed of spaghetti and marinara, again perfectly cooked. \n\nI wish we had room for dessert, which means we will have to come back again.
