I wrote a review for brunch now I'm writing about dinner. Last night was my first time having dinner there. I love everything about the inside of this small café from the art, to the furniture to the music! \n\nMy friend goes there often (he swears by there Americano which I've never had) and so we dropped in, in person around 4 pm to request a reservation for 2 for 7 pm that night. The waiter recognized my friend and took down his name. \n\nWhen we arrived at 7 pm our table was ready for us. We ordered from the prix fixe Winter menu ($25\/ each) for app, main, and dessert. \n\nI had the lentil soup with a dollop of sour cream and it was yummy. My friend had the pork pâté with baguette crisps, butter, & delicious Dijon mustard which made the pâté taste deelish. \n\nMy main was the salmon almandine in a lemon butter sauce with fries and a small side of ratatouille (roasted veggies the French are famous for). My salmon was lemony and ever so slightly over cooked but still yummy. She brought us mayonnaise & ketchup on request to dip our fries in \n\nMy friend ordered the flank steak which also came w\/French fries and sautéed onions. It was a bit chewy but flavorful. He liked my salmon better. \n\nFor dessert we got one chocolate mousse with real whip cream and one crême brûlée. Portion was small but that's probably a good thing as we were full! Both were decent and nice to finish the meal with something sweet. \n\nConsidering one main alone was $21-24, the prix fixe menu was a good deal. But I think the a la carte menu's steak is a lot better cut than the flank steak (purely a guess on my part). Something to keep in mind. We were starving so we were thinking the more food the better.
