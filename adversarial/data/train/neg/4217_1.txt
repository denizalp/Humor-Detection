First timer! Heard so many great things. Walked in three girls saw us stand there and didn't have it in them to greet us...say hello I'll be right with you...would have been nice! One walked by to stock napkins on the right hand side....still nothing. Not even a smile. Sign did say please wait to be seated. Waited five minutes finally one of the girls came over and said \"For two?\". That was it!!! She seated us and said your server will be right with you. Great! Thanks for making me feel welcomed. To be honest the girls behind the counter look miserable. They need to cheer up or look for another job. Thankfully Elaina came to the rescue. She was amazing! She made my experience worth coming back. At least you have an employee that actually wants and acts like she wants to be there. Don't forget you're on stage! Thank you for the great recommendations Elaina!
