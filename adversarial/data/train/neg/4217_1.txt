Sat at bar for business dinner and it was fantastic. Bar wasn't extensive in selections but it's a small place. Had the jam√≥n con queso and it was divine. And I'm Latin so that's saying a lot. My second plate was the pork belly which was so good I almost thought about doubling up both orders. Would strongly recommend. With their humo y vino cocktail, glass of white wine and 2 apps came out to $50. Very affordable and very worth it. Will return when in in Pittsburgh.
