Meh. \n\nThat's about how I describe this food truck to others. It's not horrible...but it isn't great.\n\nI work in Downtown Phoenix and The Grilled Cheese Truck was parked outside among two other trucks: The Pizza People and a creole-themed truck. There wasn't a line at the GCT, so I figured that was somewhat of a risk, but I decided to partake anyway.\n\nI ordered the Brie Melt which is different at this truck than online. It doesn't come with Roast Beef, but rather bacon. All around, the sandwich was not the best. It was too burned on the bread and loaded with more onions that bacon or cheese. I have read a few reviews regarding their sauce options, but the variety was lacking this time. The tater tots were cooked well. . . not burned like the sandwich.\n\nI'll have to agree the price is a little steep for what you get. I have frequented many food trucks and paid a similar price and feel I had better quality food and presentation than this place. \n\nWould I try it again? Perhaps. If there are no other food trucks I am interested in giving a try, then I may opt for another go.
