I needed to get my hands on Mario Badescu's drying lotion. Perfect, I'll just order it on Amazon. Oh, they don't deliver to Canada? Okay, I'll try Amazon.ca and see if they have it. They did have it, but it was $95 CAD! Insane. \n\nA Google search of \"Mario Badescu\" and \"Toronto\" brought me to Jacob & Sebastian's Yelp page, and I was thrilled that they had my beloved drying lotion, and at such a reasonable price!! It was actually cheaper to buy it here than online.\n\nI took an early lunch and went over to pick it up. The store is bright, clean, and well stocked with well-known skincare and haircare brands. They even carry my beloved Rahua shampoo. I didn't look around too much, but I definitely will next time I'm in the neighbourhood. The clerk was very helpful, and even explained how to use and store the drying lotion properly.\n\nA++
