I was very pleased with the service here and that they accept Rampart dining coupons!\nCasino outlets can be scary, with their long lines and frazzled employees. That wasn't the case when I was here. It's a smaller store, but inviting nonetheless. I used my $2 dining coupon for a breakfast sandwich, and the employee was friendly and pleasant. It's nice to have a Starbucks at the Rampart Casino\/JW Marriott hotel. I'll return to use dining coupons from the casino if i happen to get more in the future.
