I made my latest visit to Indie last Sat. evening as the venue was the 4th stop on a Brewpub Crawl Event I was attending with a social Group.  8 of us arrived around 7:20 pm at which time it was packed.  We were told we'd have to wait awhile for a table for 8 but if we were willing to split up into 2 groups of 4 we could get tables almost immediately.  This we did and we were all seated shortly thereafter.  None of us at my table ordered food and I haven't eaten there on any of my previous visits so can't really comment on their menu, but their beer selection has always been quite admirable.\n\nOn this visit I ordered their Breakfast Porter, made with lots of oats and malted grains that give a smooth, coffee and chocolate character.  It was delicious, and despite the venue being packed, our service was fairly prompt and quite courteous.  I should note that the venue also offers beer flights of 5, which I have partaken in during at least a couple of previous visits.  Most times when I've visited it's been pretty crowded, a testament to the venue's popularity and quality.
