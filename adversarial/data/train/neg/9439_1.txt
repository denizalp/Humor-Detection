Been here many times.  It has an enormous menu (almost overwhelmingly large) and very reasonable prices.  It gets quite busy on the weekends (and for good reason!).  My advice is come for lunch or early dinner and you won't be disappointed.  My favorites are the ramen, the gyu don and the chunky spicy sushi rolls.\n\nFrankly they did have a bit of an issue with service in the past.  To their credit they've hired new servers and more servers and it isn't an issue any more.\n\nBottom Line: Best sushi and ramen in the valley
