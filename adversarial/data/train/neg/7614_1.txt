I've had dozens and dozens and dozens of poke bowls here.   I used to have weekly Wednesday appointments in the neighbourhood which gave me a chance to have a poke bowl at Big Tuna every week.   Every experience there was a delight.\n\n  I initially started with the fixed bowls and loved them.   Now, I just ask Ahn, or whoever is behind the creation table, to make me something marvellous.   And they do.   And it is always fresh, creative, and delicious.\n\nSometimes I and they have time for a chat and sometimes I and they don't.     All good. \n\nNow, sadly, I no longer have regular appointments in the neighbourhood, so I get there as and when I can.    I do make the effort though because the food and the people who prepare and serve it are worth me showing up.\n\nHighly recommend.
