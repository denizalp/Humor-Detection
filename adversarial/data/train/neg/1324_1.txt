Perfectly competent Italian resto in a somewhat inaccessible area.  We were lucky to get street parking right in front on Jarvis, although maybe it wasn't really luck since the place was half empty on a Saturday night in June.\n\nFood was fine, run of the mill Italian fare, wine prices and selection were average for a place that fancies itself an \"upscale\" Italian bistro.  i'd probably go back if I was in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to dine again.
