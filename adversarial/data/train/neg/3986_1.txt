Reasonably priced restaurant for the Wynn! I ate here this past weekend, I had the 'pancake and 2 eggs with choice of meat and toast' for about $20. At first I thought, one pancake how can this be filling? However, the pancake was so big and fluffy and YUMMY! I thoroughly enjoyed every morsel of that meal! Four stars because of the wait, albeit the food was worth the wait.
