Excellent! \n\nMy friends and I stayed at The Luxor and decided to try Tender, we were happily surprised at the quality and service we received. \n\nDrinks were AWESOME, the cocktail waitress shook our cocktails for us table side... THANK YOU.\n\nThe cheese plate we shared was delicious, although it always amazes me why places give so few slices of bread for the cheese... there were like 6 slices and 4 girls. \n\nMy friend got her kobe beef burger and skinny fries... she likes her meat very well done but when I tried it it was still juicy. I had the meatloaf sliders which were pretty good, although the artichoke\/seaweed spread it came with just tasted odd to me. Wasn't crazy about the crab sliders, the consistency was a little rubbery and I'm happy I didn't order it. \n\nDecor is sexy, dark and comfortable... there's a lot of dark wood paneling, antler chandeliers, and very nice bathrooms that remind me of the Member's Only clubs in London. \n\nAlthough I was originally hesitant about trying Tender's I'm happy we went here and do recommend if you're looking for a better meal but don't want to deal the the hassle of those other trendy spots.
