Wanted a cake for a my gender reveal party. Asked for suggestions from the community because I wasn't satisfied with the custom work of bakeries I was familiar with. One suggestion was a local person whose cakes were gorgeous. I messaged her for pricing and to discuss my ideas for the cake. She quoted me $125. It seemed steep, but it was a custom order and her cakes really were contest entry worthy. I was ready to go with her, but had gotten a few suggestions for Golden Days Company and checked them out to do my due diligence. \n\nSO glad I did! Her custom cakes were impressive and when I called to discuss the same cake and the same details she quoted me $25! I had to double check that she really said and meant $25...and even reaffirmed at the bakery exactly what I wanted and that it would only cost $25. She did the cake exactly as I described and it was SO delicious! I couldn't have gotten a premade cake at some places for that price and they would have been half the quality. So, so satisfied and will definitely be returned for ANY cake I need in the future.
