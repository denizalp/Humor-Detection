I've been to boondocks 100+ times. It has great drinks (frozen margarita is bomb). The patio is a good time and usually has live music and a big screen tv. Tons of games as well such as bags, billiards, darts, boxing, basketball, etc.. They also do poker tournaments during the week. It's always packed at night but usually best around happy hour. The bar food is good as well.
