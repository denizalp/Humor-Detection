Good sandwiches and burgers!! The service was a bit slow Sunday morning (we waited almost 40 minutes for our food) because of a few large parties. They offer a brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday mornings along with their regular menu. We chose to order off of the regular menu, but the breakfast dishes that we say going by looked yummy! They offer $3 bloody marys and mimosas. I tried the bloody mary this time, and will NOT have it again- maybe I just wasn't in the mood, but it had a strange taste.
