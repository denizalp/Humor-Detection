I normally would give the Venetian 5 stars, but this last trip was only 3 star.  \n\nAmazing big rooms and bathrooms.  Great dining, good check in experience, valet guys are awesome, perfect location - I have stayed here several times before and its my choice among any other hotel.\n\nThis last weekend was getting ready to check out and my aunt pointed out how dusty it was.  I looked up on the top of the headboard and there was a lot of dust.  Probably adding to my sinus issues over the weekend.  Did some closer looking and the phone was pretty dusty and dirty too.  On our last night housekeeping failed to leave a bath mat and wash clothes, wasn't a big deal and i didn't feel like calling to have any sent to our room but i think from this stay they need to step up their game on the housekeeping.  \n\nAlso paid an extra $50 a night for each room - we had 3 rooms for an upgrade of a view of the strip, which was a waste of money.  We got a view of a parking garage .  Don't waste your money with an upgrade.\n\nOther than that the stay was pleasant.
