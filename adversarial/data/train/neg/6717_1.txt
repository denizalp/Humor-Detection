The nurse told me that they had a test that was equivalent to getting your eyes dilated. I thought, \"GREAT! I hate getting my eyes dilated!\" During the actual eye exam, the doctor asked why I didn't get my eyes dilated. I told her what the nurse told me. She didn't deny what the nurse said, but told me I should have gotten my eyes dilated as well. I thought it was really strange. I later looked into it and what I found suggested that some insurances do not cover eye dilation so I'm thinking she just wanted me to shell out more money. I picked out my glasses and the woman who helped said it could be up to two weeks before they call for me to come pick them up. It's been over two weeks so I called to check the status of my glasses. I told the man who answered the phone the situation and he told me, \"It's only been ten days, you have to wait at least fourteen.\" He immediately hung up afterwards. The thing is, he never asked for any of my information so how would he know it's only been ten business days? I feel like he just didn't want to take the two minutes to look me up. Needless to say, I am very unhappy with the service I have received from this place and will not be using them ever again.
