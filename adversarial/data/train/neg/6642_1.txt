DJ Sean was extremely helpful and a pleasure to have at our corporate end of year event. Not only did he show up when he said he would (to the minute!), but he made himself available under extreme short notice (24 hours before the event was scheduled to begin). My company utilized him for a one-hour workout class where he motivated participants to push through their class with his high energy mixing and music playing. Price was unbelievably reasonable, and we would definitely hire him again\/recommend him to others.
