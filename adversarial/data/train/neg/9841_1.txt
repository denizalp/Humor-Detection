Since discovering this place 2 weeks ago, I've been addicted to the Lao style Papaya Salad and the chicken noodle soup. \n\nThe papaya salad which is $6, a good helping and for a dollar more they can add the crab.\nChicken Noodle soup- $7 also a good size helping. The noodles were perfectly cooked, chewy. Broth was super tasty.\nWe love their pork jerry too. That about $6 or $7 per pack. \nLarb- $10, it was ok\nSticky rice is $1 per bag.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is they kind of skimp out on you if your not Lao or Thai. As many times as I've gone here, they never give me all the extra items for either my larb, the soup or salad. I'm missing the cabage for the papaya salad, missing the extra veggies for the larb, missing the fried garlic or shallots for the soup. Some times they add no garnish to any of the dishes. I constantly have to ask for the items. \n\nWe order our food and then we see other people order their food. And it's completely different but the same items. Lol. It's funny but also sad becuase it makes us not want to come back. Which is probably what's going to happen.
