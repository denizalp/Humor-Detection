Location: Up in Mile End, not too far from Olimpico. Street parking is available but hard to find (and you need to pay). \n \nThe place: Cute little spot, simple and clean.\n\nThe goods: I stopped in for a snack because I was famished. I grabbed a chocolate croissant that was pretty darn delicious - basically it was a fresh croissant that was cut in half and there were chocolate chips inside (or that's what they looked like). I believe they also serve breakfast\/brunch. \n\nService: Good\n\nPrice point: This is where I have an issue - $4.50 for a chocolate croissant is pretty steep and higher than most places I go to. Is it delicious? Absolutely! But I'd knock a buck off the price.
