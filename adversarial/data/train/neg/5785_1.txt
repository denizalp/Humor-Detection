Came to check out this location on a whim when I realized it was literally NEXT TO MY HOUSE! sweet deal, right? Unfortunately, it was not to be. :( \n\nI walked in, went straight to the lady working the register,  showed her a coupon that had been sent to me via email from bath and body works, and she said (with the condescending tone of an assistant manager, which she probably was- no regular employee would ever speak to a customer this way for fear of termination) that they don't accept those coupons because anyone can get them and that b&bw didn't send it.  Like I'm trying to steal lotion and pull a fast one. LOLOLOL Say what? It was in my inbox under \"bath and body works\", who the hell else sent it? \n\nThen she just walked away and disappeared behind some door, leaving me standing there in an empty store. Wtf?!? Did I steal her husband in a past life or something? Who is that RUDE? Sorry you were having a bad day, lady. \n\nNeedless to say, I was extremely uncomfortable and, honestly, a little offended, not to mention pissed, and just walked out. I'll never come back. By the way, I went to Boca Park and used the coupon NO PROBLEM.
