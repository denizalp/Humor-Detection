So delicious.  Got the Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger without the donkey sauce.  I also took off the tomato uncooked onion and tomato.  Normally with burgers I need ketchup.  Tried it both with and without and like it without!  My family would say that speaks volumes!   Christopher was our waiter and reminds me of Guy especially the personality!
