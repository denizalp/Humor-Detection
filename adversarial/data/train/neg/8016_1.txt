Delicious Asian food ranging from 4 different kinds of curry, a variety of stir frys, and local favorites like pad thai and orange chicken (which has been voted best orange chicken in the valley multiple times). Definitely better then Pei Wei and always excellent customer service. They really will make it EXACTLY how you want it.\n\nI'd suggest the Hot Korean, Stir-Fry Crispy Beef, the Wonton Soup, or the Cantonese Chow Mein. Tell Young Rachael sent you. :)
