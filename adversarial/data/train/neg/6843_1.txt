Pros:  The drinks are delicious, from light and refreshing Italian sodas to succulent hot coffee drinks (served in glass mugs if you wish) to decadent blended coffee(or not) drinks I don't find it a small thing that they use the tiny, almost crushed, ice cubes (No pun intended.) It makes iced drinks so much more delicious to me. Lots of sweets\/pastries.(but priced high.)  The Green Card sandwich (turkey, cheddar, bacon and guacamole) was delish.  Various healthy and vegan choices, even almond, coconut, and hemp milk for your drinks.  The coffee beans' flavor is so rich and not bitter.... Board games to play.... Menu is a lot easier to read\/understand at this location, rather than the DI location .... I like it when their music is chill or jazz, anything without lyrics so you can hear each other talking better and be able to read\/work better too. :) .....\n\nCons:.   The prices are a little high, especially for the quality\/quantity of the food.  Herbal tea choices are sparse....Only one outdoor table.  Unexpected for a coffeehouse....  the prices are a little high, especially for the quality\/quantity of the food.  The tuna sandwich is flavoress and dripping in mayo-type spread......
