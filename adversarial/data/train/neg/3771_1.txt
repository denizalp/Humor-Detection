Great place, long waits, great food.\n\nCame here for brunch several times with a friend from far West. While the waits are a bit nuts if you're looking for a good \"meeting a friend from Mississauga on the subway line\" type of place this is a good location with great food.\n\nThere is a tiny balcony patio that we have yet to be lucky enough to snag. \n\nThe food - the reason why you are waiting? - amazing. Between the great mimosas, delicious pancakes, and actually very hearty egg breakfasts we walk away satisfied and happy.\n\nI do second the suggestion that \"reserved\" signs would alleviate the feeling that you're being made to wait, for waiting's sake.
