I visited on their second night of opening. Service was great, although it took an hour for our food to get to the table, when the restaurant was not very busy. The manager came to our table and sincerely apologized and comped our meals. I will definitely be giving Hot Taco a second chance, great atmosphere and another future hot spot in South End!
