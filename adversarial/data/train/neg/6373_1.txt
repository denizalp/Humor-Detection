This place is so delicious! It is very expensive though! But it comes with entertainment, so it's great for an occasional group gathering or birthday party. The salad dressing (some sort of ginger dressing) and the rice are the most delicious and I could easily just sit there and eat salad and rice all day long. I haven't tried the sushi or the part of the restaurant that isn't the teppanyaki tables, but I would like to someday.
