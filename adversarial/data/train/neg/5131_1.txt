This is one of our favorite \"celebration\" restaurants.  The kids (12 and 14) really enjoy watching the chefs cook.  There is definitely a difference among the cooks in terms of entertainment value - I'd say about half the time we get a playful cook who really does a show.  We've ordered nearly everything (not all in the same visit!) off the hibachi menu and have never been disappointed, although the salmon is not as good as the other choices.  The servings are huge and we always bring home leftovers.  We really enjoy the seating - if you wind up with others who are outgoing and talkative it can be a lot of fun to chat (and be prepared to chat, because the service can be slow).  If you go at a popular time, be sure to make reservations!  Overall, a good solid meal and great for kids.
