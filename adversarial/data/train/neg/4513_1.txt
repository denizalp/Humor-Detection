My mother and I attended a bridal shower at the Estate Banquet Hall last month. From the moment we entered the facility, everything looked so clean and presentable. Your attention is easily captured by this beautifully decorated venue. The banquet hall was set up so perfectly. The afternoon ran smoothly with the great help of the servers and other workers. They were all friendly and helpful. \n\nWe were presented with a generous portion of the mixed green salad, chicken breast with potatoes, mixed vegetables and dessert. The quality of the food was excellent! Everyone in the room had something good to say about it. I have already booked my bridal shower here for 2015 and am considering having my wedding here as well. I feel that this place offers high quality food and service at an affordable price. You cannot go wrong with the Estate Banquet Hall.
