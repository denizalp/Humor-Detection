I was in Scottsdale for a few days and tried two vegetarian restaurants. Urban Beans is far better in quality and taste than the other place (Green New American). The food is excellent. The ambiance like a coffeehouse that invites you to stay as long as you please. I tried the jackfruit carnitas club sandwich (minis the mayo) and my husband (non-vegetarian) had the southwest Caesar salad and said it was one of the best salads he's ever had. We loved it so much we had the same thing for lunch a couple days later.
