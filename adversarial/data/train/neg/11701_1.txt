Made a reservation for a 25th anniversary couples massage while in Vegas earlier this week.  They called the day before and wanted to reschedule it an hour later. I was a little grumpy about it but I agreed.  The shuttle was right on time and we were there in just a few minutes.  We were greeted and sat down in the \"mellow room\" which got us in the proper frame of mind before our massage.  The ladies were complete pros and did a great job of massaging away our aches and pains.  No upselling, no hidden charges, and wonderful shuttle service make this a must do in Vegas. You could pay double at your hotel, but why?
