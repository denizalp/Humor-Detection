I found this place this evening while searching for the Monongahela Incline. It's located across from Station Square.\nCollege Football was playing, so it was really loud in there. \nIt was a good thing the place is large and spacious.\nIt was a beautiful day, so they had all the big doors open. The patio had a fabulous view of the city, but I chose to sit inside 'cause I wanted to see the game. \nThe food here is really good and I had a great service. I was  served very quickly after sitting down. It wasn't very busy, but the people who were there seemed to be enjoying themselves. \nI had the Blackened Fish Po'Boy and two glasses of their signature lemonade. (I ordered the Raspberry and Pomegranate) Both were sweet and delicious.  \nThe Fish Po'Boy was huge! It was definitely an oversized sandwich. It had chipolte mayo, lettuce and tomatoes and came with a side of olive mix and french fries. It was really scrumptious.   I scarfed down every morsel. Yum.....\n\n\nThey have free Wi-Fi, but spotty.\n\n 4 stars fabulousness.
