The octopus is nothing short of perfection. When I vacation in Spain and Portugal, I eat octopus at least once a day and Milos is the only restaurant in the United States who can replicate my experience. The way it's tenderized and then grilled for that perfect light crunch outside and tender meaty inside makes my heart pitter patter. Inventive wine list with many spectacular Greek wines ( hey, they did plant grapes before the Romans and French) freshest fish in the desert and great staff. Great for special occasions. Expensive but worth every penny. They have their own signature Greek olive oil that enhances their simple grilled bread and pretty much anything. I know this because I've bribed the waitstaff on more than one occasion to look the other way when I steal it ( they won't let you by it)
