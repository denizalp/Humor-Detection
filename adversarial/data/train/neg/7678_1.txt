I waited almost an hour past my appointment (I called in to book ahead) with no apology or explanation. I've also had these nails (extensions) for a week now and decided they're a bit too long to be functional - called in to ask if they could shorten it and was told it would be $10! Will likely not come back because the customer service is seriously lacking and they seem to want to charge you for every bloody little thing. Even their prices aren't so cheap that I can overlook everything else.
