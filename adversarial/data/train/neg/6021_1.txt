When you want a break from Luce, Toscana or Fiamia (all excellent Italian restaurants) and you crave Italian food as you remember it from little Italy in NYC. Give Mama Mia a try. I had lunch here today and not only was my dish delicious but the lunch prices were real inexpensive, half the dishes were under $10.
