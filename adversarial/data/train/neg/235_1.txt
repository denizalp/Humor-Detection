My granddaughter and I just went for a Parafin manicure. We never received the wax treatment. Then an elderly senior lady did a horrible job on my granddaughters nails. She even had polish on the back of her hand. She didn't show me until after we'd left. She said the owner sent the woman away and tried to fix her nails, but didn't start over. I had to clean off extra polish from her hands, but the basic polish job is caked, splotchy and basically a mess. Also, they make you feel really awful unless you pay cash.
