Immediately upon turing onto Johnson St we were able to distinguish Johnson Public House by the significant number of people sitting outside. Once we walked in the door, we were overwhelmed by a mixture of students studying for classes and families grabbing Sunday brunch. It was extremely warm inside, so be sure to dress in layers! In terms of the menu, you can definitely tell that Johnson Public House specializes in beverages. The tea list was extremely extensive and the number of ways one could order their coffee was significant. The brunch menu was pretty limited, containing mainly breakfast bowls and sandwiches. Despite having a limited food menu, Johnson Public House managed to master the few menu items they do have. I ordered the \"Regular\" sandwich and was extremely impressed by the flavor of the ham and perfect preparation of fried egg. I would definitely recommend stopping by if you are looking for a homey place to get work done, a grade a coffee or tea spot, or a delicious brunch sandwich!
