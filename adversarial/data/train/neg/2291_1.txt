Been coming here for over 10 years! Love these two docs and love how they simplify things for real life. They don't gouge you on their prices either. They provide proper care and do what's necessary. They are honest and matter of fact. If things escalate to where the price gets overly expensive, they lay out ALL of your options and help you make educated decisions about your pet's care. Thank you, Dr. V and Dr. Wilson and all of your wonderful, polite and friendly staff.
