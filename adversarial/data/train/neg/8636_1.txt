First, I would like to thank Sergio for providing the best customer service I've had in a long time. He is AMAZING & his service alone is worth returning. As far as the food goes: it was just as good as the service! The crust was thin and crispy and the ingredients added to it were fresh and delicious.  Pizza was made fast and nicely. Definitely will be returning here again & would recommend this place to others.
