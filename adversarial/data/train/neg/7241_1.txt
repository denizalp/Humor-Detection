Great drinks, great atmosphere, great food. Even though JPH is a little bit of a trek from my apartment, it's become one of my favorite coffee shops to do some work because it's just so darn cozy. The interior is eclectically decorated, with mismatched chairs and tables and mugs. The baristas have always been nothing but friendly to me and they seem to have a stream of regular customers that they'll chat with at the bar. I have had coffee, iced tea, hot tea (they have a great selection of teas, which I appreciate because I'm more of a tea drinker anyway), as well as their sandwiches (the grilled cheese is absolutely scrumptious). I've ordered the avocado toast too, which is big for me because I usually find that at most places, avocado toast is like six bucks and totally overpriced. Here, it's a more reasonable $3 and you can add an egg for like a dollar to have a pretty filling breakfast-while-you-work for four bucks! Obviously, you can make it for cheaper at home but hey, then you'd miss out on the lovely ambiance of JPH. \n\nThere's also some nice picnic tables outdoors that is a great place to get some sun on nicer days -- the outdoor seating + indoor seating does fill up fairly quick though so if you're coming on the weekend, be prepared.
