3 Brewers is a great little brewery for sure! I do love the brews here as well as the atmosphere for sure! I am of fan of darker beers so of course I loved the brown they offer.the beers come in 3 different sizes,6,18 and a 36 (which is a bargain) by the way !Multiple levels of bars and dining areas as well! \n\nThe food here is rather unique and tasty as well! The maxi  fries are pretty bad ass and happen to be battered! Yum! Tasty, crispy! The sausage and kraut is great as well!\n\nI'll certainly come back here when I'm in the Toronto area for sure!
