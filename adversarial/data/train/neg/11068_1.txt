So I call this Chilis location to place an order before leaving work because I know it's going to take 20 mins. One of the female workers answers and places me on hold, by this time I'm leaving work and driving to this restaurant. Surely they will pick up before I make it there, afterall its now been 3 mins. that I'm on hold. Five minutes later I pull up to the restaurant and I'm still on hold. I walk in with my phone still counting down and ask for a manager. I show the manager on duty (Z Morris) my phone and tell him that I called to place an order 8 minutes ago and was placed on hold. He gives me a rushed unsympathetic apology and looks at his phone, realizes it's true then hangs up his line (keep in mind there's hardly anyone in the restaurant). He proceeds to ask me what I would like to order. I place my order with him. At no point does he give me a discount or a free appetizer or anything for my inconvenience. Instead he tells me that he will rush my order, 20 minutes later I'm still sitting here waiting. Needless to say, I will never spend my money with this location again. Good customer service doesn't seem to exist here, beware!
