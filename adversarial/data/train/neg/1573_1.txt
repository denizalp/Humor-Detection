Absolutely love this place. Wish I found it sooner to be honest... they do such an amazing job. They really pampered my mother and I when we went in. \nAna did an amazing job on the design I wanted on my toe nail.\nTheir always busy when you go in but they will always try to serve you and they don't make you feel rushed in any way.\nDefiently happy I found an amazing, clean salon!
