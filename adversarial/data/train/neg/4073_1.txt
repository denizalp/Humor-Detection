Not a bad place for a cup of coffee when you're strolling around on 4 St on a Sunday afternoon. A big draw seems to be the free Wi-Fi (which I will likely never in my life get around to using), though it does have blackout periods. There were quite a few people studying, so the tables were hard to get at, and with the nice weather, it was best to forget trying for their outdoor seating.\n\nFood-wise, it was unexceptional. The latte was serviceable, and fell far short of P&S's, though their strawberry cheesecake was moist and delicious. A good independently owned business to support if you're in the area, but not a place I would go out of my way to.
