My first experience with Marble Slab was through my job, they had it catered in for our annual \"Ice Cream Afternoon\" and I was instantly a fan. \n\nWell when it was the first warm day we've seen in a while I was happy to stop by this location. The service was fast and there were plenty of delicious flavors to chose from! What I like more about this place, is you can load up as many toppings as you like in your sweet treat. \n\nFor this visit, I went with the Sweet Cream (I know, I know) on a chocolate and peanut cone with M&M's, chocolate drops, and sprinkles. It was delish. Super creamy, mixed just right and the cone had just enough crispy goodness! \n\nI'll absolutely be back, especially with the weather starting to warm up! Oh and there's a lovely space to enjoy your ice cream right outside the shop behind the fountain!
