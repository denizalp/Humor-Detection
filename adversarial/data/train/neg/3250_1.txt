I am mainly going to use this review to shoutout the J Crew Outlet, as well as Brooks Brothers! These places have insane savings deals! The outlets as a whole have top name brand clothing retailers at discount, outlet prices. I can speak with certainty in saying there is no way shop here and pay retail prices; so unless that is just your thing, the outlets are for you.\n\nJ Crew had a new lineup of winter sweaters, cardigans, and flannel shirts up to 60% off. I took advantage of all 3! The flannel shirts were $20\/each and the sweaters (retail $70) ended up being around $30. All winter accessories were 60% off as well. I pride myself in collecting an assortment of unique socks; a few were added to my wardrobe today. I have always had great help from the sales associates at this store, and always great customer service. \n\nBeing in the hunt for a good suit landed me at Brooks Brothers. I tend to shy away from this store but today changed my perspective entirely. Help, greeted me from the moment I entered the store until I exited. When I finally decided on the right suit: they were out of my pant size. Luckily, another store had them in stock and they coordinated to ensure the process of my receiving them went smoothly.
