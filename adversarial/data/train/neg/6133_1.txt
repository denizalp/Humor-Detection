We took a friend for his birthday, there were 7 of us. From all the reviews I read I thought it was more of an upscale restaurant but it was more urban bar. The place was very noisy, the speakers blaring music above our table made it hard to hold a conversation even across the table! For a Monday it was fairly busy when we got there at 6PM, The service was OK, our waiter forgot our appetizer so we had to remind him. The food was very good, worthy of another visit. This would be a great place if the music was turned down!
