My friends and I enjoy meeting up here on Thursday's. In fact, we used to meet here before it was renovated and the name changed. When we stopped back in, we found that it had been greatly upgraded from what it once had been. Part of me kind of misses the \"dank\" of the former Roses, but this place is a good bar to sit in and watch a Pens game (or any other game for that matter) thanks to the myriad of available TV's.\n\nThe bartender we see every week when we go in is also extraordinarily friendly. I'd recommend it.
