Very average. I tried all four tacos and they were bland and flavorless. My wife had the veggie burrito, they forgot to put the guacamole in it. It was also quite bland. Hopefully it's just growing pains, but I won't be going back any time soon. \n\nAs others have mentioned, the portions are tiny for the price.
