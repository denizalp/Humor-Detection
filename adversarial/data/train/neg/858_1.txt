I came back here again for my birthday dinner. This is the first time I've been back since they have redone the back patio renovations and I'm glad we did. The environment oozes romance. The food was exquisite and service impeccable. I wish they still had the BYOB option (corking fee applies) because I had tasteful bottles of wine I would have loved to pair my meal with.  My date loved it too. I will definitely be back with my plus one.
