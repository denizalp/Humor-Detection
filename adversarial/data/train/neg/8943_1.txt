Terrible service. Been going here for over 6 months. Several experiences with rude\/unfriendly\/unprofessional staff led me to send a message over Facebook to the manager. Apologies were delivered and commitments were made to address the person---only to go in the next day and experience it all over again! Appears the owner \"cleaned house\"  this week (which seemed to be a good solution); however, he turned out to be less than \"accommodating\" to his long term customers (like myself). They made the wrong drink and instead of apologizing and correcting it, he argued for 5 min. about how it was my daughter's (12 y\/o) fault for ordering the wrong drink and that making her a new ice tea costs him \"a lot of money.\" He then publicly humiliated us by vocalizing (as he made a poured a new tea) that this is a \"teaching lesson\" for his staff. He was sure to mention how he was doing us a favor too!  The only lesson he taught his staff was how to effectively lose valuable customers. Oh, and he taught me how powerful a negative review on Yelp can really be! And for that, thank u!!
