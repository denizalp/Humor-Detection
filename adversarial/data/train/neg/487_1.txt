This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. The food is always great and the service never disappoints. The only bummer is that they close on Sunday's but I understand everyone needs a break once in a while. My husband and I come about once a week. When we moved back to Phoenix after being out of state for two years this is one of the first places we had to come back to. Yum!!!!
