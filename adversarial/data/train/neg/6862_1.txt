Right across the street from work so this was a breakfast option.\n\nPretty extensive menu for breakfast. I got the classic egg's benedict. Can't go wrong with this. Pretty filling. I was expecting fresh potatoes, but hey, the fried cubed ones work as well.\n\nThe co-workers enjoyed their omelettes as well.
