I never visited the showroom - I bought my couch online, and I could not be more pleased.  I absolutely love it.  It is just as good, better even, than described, and was delivered the same day.  There was an error on the website related to delivery costs, so I called their 800 number.  The CS Rep, Cynthia Holliday, was more than helpful, the error was in my favor and she honored it, and I am sitting here on my comfy new couch that I absolutely love.  It was LESS THAN $300.00, i's made by Ashley, who could ask for more ?  Love it !
