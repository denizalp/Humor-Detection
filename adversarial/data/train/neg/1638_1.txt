Not bad food at all.  I had the chicken BLT sandwich - it was fresh and plentiful.  For a brewery, they didn't have a very large amount of microbrews - I think they had 7 or 8.  I tried the Czhech Pilsner and it was darned good.\n\nThe only thing bringing them down is the service - we sat outside and had to hunt down our waitress a couple of times.
