First time here and we loved it.  Started off with the fried tomatoes and cheese bites.  Simply fantastic.  The sandwiches are huge!  My wife and I split the Cuban warpig.  It was filled with flavor and we enjoyed every bite.\n\nMy younger son got the Mac and cheese sandwich be rated it as one of his favorite meals of all time.  My older son got the godfather and enjoyed it but wouldn't order it again.  Service was great and we enjoyed our meal.  Will come back again.
