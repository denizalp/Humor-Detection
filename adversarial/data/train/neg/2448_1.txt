Well the food was bad and took longer than if you went to the store bought the ingredients and cooked it your self! No joke I was ready to leave before I ever received my entree. Slow service for no reason. The restaurant was half full and employees just not on the ball here. I've been going to Claim Jumper Restaurants since early 90's. I started going to the restaurant in Long Beach Ca. My first experiences were spectacular! Beautiful rustic restaurant with stone work and fantastic service. The food at this location never changed and is of top quality. Shows having inexperienced staff and management can not up hold a high quality culinary experience that folded this restaurant chain. Regional Management needs to step in and clean house of staff. A half full restaurant unable to serve their customers is a disgrace.
