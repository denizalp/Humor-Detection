very disappointed for many reasons...\n\n1.  i had to ask the desk 3 times to have the floors of my room cleaned\/vacuumed.  The cleaning staff apparently eats sunflower seeds, because they left them on the floor and after i asked again for them to vacuum the seeds were STILL THERE. either no cleaning or they are blind.   Room was not as clean as the last stay, last year\n\n2. a co-worker of mine had cockroaches in her room\n\n3. upon check out i told the front desk clerk who didn't even respond, just said \"oh, sorry\".  That's not how you treat a return guest who booked 3 rooms for 7 and 8 days.\n\ni travel extensively and expect more, i doubt we will return.
