My first 3 star review. I usually only review a place that is exceptional or poor, but since the choices for good Chinese food are so scant in the valley, one has to make concessions.\n\nI've been here twice, the first time being told by a couple of friends how good it was, but it was rather lacking. Same as Panda Express.\n\n2nd time, much better. I asked for extra spicy and that's what I got, but the flavor wasn't compromised. Good job. Still, nothing great, but I would return since there really is nothing else around.
