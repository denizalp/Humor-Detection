I'm a fan of all Postino restaurants, and this is no exception. They have a large selection of wines and a small selection of beer, but they all seem to be good! The food is good too, but I've only had snacks - bruschetta, olives, bread, cheese, etc. It's good for a \"girlfriends\" night out or a happy hour. Just as a note, it's beer and wine only - no liquor. So no bloody marys if you're going for Sunday brunch!
