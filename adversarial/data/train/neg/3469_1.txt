Let me start by saying that I generally enjoy Indian food, my problem is usually the restaurant itself: cleanliness, staff attitude, atmosphere. \nChoola was above all my expectations for an Indian restaurant and the food was amazing. As I walked in I noticed the cleanliness of the place, everything was spotless. Restaurant cleanliness is very important to me and I wasn't let down, at an Indian restaurant of all places! :) It was my  first time there so I asked the cashier to help. She recommended the lamb meatball meal with the tiki masala sauce. The food was PHENOMENAL! I don't say that about many foods. So many different flavors, all individually good and even better combined. The naan bread was perfect. The cashier even came around to check up and see if the food was satisfactory which I have never experienced in an Indian restaurant. The icing on the cake was the \"jacuzzi for your hands\" which is their hand washing station, it just washes your hands but it's something new and different that just adds to the wonder of Choola. I love it and would definitely recommend to friends. In fact, I already have. :)
