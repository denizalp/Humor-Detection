Frustrating experience here.  The guy sold me hard on a detail service, so I took it.  He said it would take 40-45minutes.  After an hour and a half, I insisted on leaving because I was already very late to take my child to an appointment.\n\nI plan on calling to ask for a refund since they didn't finish the detailing.  Beware, they sell you hard and over-promise.  They are paid on commission obviously...
