I came in yesterday to withdraw from my loan and the chick looked new and asked if I had my car with me. Take it I live 20 mins away and have my kids with me and I have NEVER been asked that after years having to take out loans here and there. What an Inconvenience. She didn't ever pull up any account information. I will NOT be doing business here because of the bad experience. I will stick with the one in North Phnx.
