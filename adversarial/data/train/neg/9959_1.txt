WOW...The place is phenomenal.  The owner (Randy) is onsite and fully involved with what is going on.  I really appreciated the mechanic taking me to my truck and explaining exactly what the issue was. On top of that, they gave me a ride home and back to the shop when my truck repairs were complete. This is my new go to auto shop!
