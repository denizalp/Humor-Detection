Wahoooooooooo's!!!!  I love, love, love that they have vegetarian everything---veggie taco's, burritos, enchiladas AND options:  Tofu, bonzai veggies, or mushrooms to base whichever delight you desire.  YAY!!\nAlso, the bar staff always greets us with smiles, stories, and more than happy to handle all of my questions and special requests.  LOVE it!\nOne thing I would change; they don't have any super-hot sauce.
