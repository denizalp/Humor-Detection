I had to bring my wife to this quick care....instead of our normal Doctor.\nWe actually had a great experiance..\nchecked in, was seen by the admin lady, who was very pleasent.\nOur PA was very friendly & helpful. She spent a lot of time asking my wife questions and checking her condition.\n\nMy wife needed blood work & a CtScan all of which wer done in the same building.\n\nThey do not take my insurance, HPN. But they do take others, and my wife's was OK.\nFor everything, (initial visit, blood work & ctscan), we were in & out in about 3 hours...\nnot really that bad considering how busy they were.\n\nThumbs up from us.
