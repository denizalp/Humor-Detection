Have I really not reviewed my favorite donut spot in Las Vegas!? Oh my. \n\nFor the reader, I consider myself a donut connoisseur.  It's not something I'm proud of. If you are looking for that Ma & Pa donut shop you had when you were a kid, look no more.  Yes, the prices aren't what they were when we were young, but are gas prices the same? A good donut is worth every penny (in my bible). \n\nThey melt in your mouth at ANY time of the day.  I went in around 11 and they were still fully stocked.  They have the regular donuts for the plane people like me (maple bar all the way), and they have fun toppings such as fruity pebbles if you have a sweet tooth. Every bite will be soft, moist, and delicious.  I promise you will not be disappointed.  The location is kind of hidden, but if you see the barbershop you are in the right spot! Staff is awesome, and you will thank me later :)
