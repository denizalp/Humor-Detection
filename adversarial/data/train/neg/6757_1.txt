I am obsessed with the buffet at the Bellagio. There are so many different choices that it makes your head spin. It's difficult to not want to indulge here! For breakfast they have amazing meats, breads, fruit, fish, porridges and so much more that it's difficult to list!! During lunch they have fresh sushi, steak, salads and soups that are all so delicious that you have to try a little of everyone one. Yes they are more expensive, but the quality is honestly so worth it for what you get. There are\nSo many buffets in Las Vegas, but I believe that this one tops them all.
