These guys are completely unprofessional. They did the plaster for my pool and it was probably the worst experience ever. They did not properly cover areas of the pool that did not require plaster. We had real boulders on the edges and they were covered in plaster. They also did not cover or protect near our house and our house got plaster all over it. Called them back to repair 2 times and they argued every single time. So it's never their fault. Please do your research and do not use this company. You will be happier in the long run and will probably receive better work from another company.
