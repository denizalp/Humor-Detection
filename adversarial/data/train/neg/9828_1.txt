The service was fast, friendly and accurate. EXACTLY how I want it. The food wasn't as tasty as I was hoping. Maybe cause I was craving another Hawaiian restaurant that sadly just closed. I could almost taste their garlic shrimp. We decided to venture off to this spot since it was the closest. The mac salad wasn't the best or worst I've ever had. The fried shrimp was nothing to brag about. And the spicy kim chee was anything but. I'll give this restaurant one more shot. I'm hoping the shrimp sandwich will WOW me :)
