I don't know why this place got such bad reviews. Yes the ambiance sucks, yes its a hole in the wall.... But the food more than makes up for it.  Its not exactly selling itself as high end. \n\nSomewhere between a \"Dai pai dong\" (cafeteria-style) and an actual restaurant. Service was quick and the food was yummy! We had the peppered beef tenderloin and udon noodle stir-fry.  The meat was soft and tender, and the noodles were cooked to perfection. The black pepper sauce was bursting with savory goodness.  The zing of the black peppers and the soy sauce mixture = one satisfied tummy!
