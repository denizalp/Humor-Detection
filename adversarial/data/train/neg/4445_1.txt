Loveeeeeee this place and I'm so glad I found out about it! The workers are so sweet, enthusiastic, and welcoming - it's kind of contagious! There's a variety of toppings so that you can make the pizza of your dreams (Did I mention unlimited toppings?). I thought the size of the MOD pizza would be too small, but it was actually very filling. I will definitely be coming back as many times as I can to explore all the pizza options available!
