Wife and I gave this place a try for the first time. Will not return. Several reasons but first the good.\nThe space itself is very nice and nice bar area. The service was acceptable. \nNow for the bad.\nPrices,food quality, portion size, overly salty everything.\nWife and hours we were there. Very limited menu and we certainly were eager to try the Latin flavors.\nWe started with various small plate items. Pulled pork tacos, quacamole, Corn Pops. The Corn Pops were outstanding however 4 pieces equaled 2 small ears for 13.00 a bit much. 3 very very small tacos, extremely salty. Almost could not eat them as they were leased with salt. 3 sauces for the quac, were not tasty and again, laced with salt. Plantain chips were so salty we could not eat them. We ordered two cocktails that were not good either for having a mixologist. They were very heavy with mint. Overpowering. With that we decided not to proceed with dinner given the portions were so small, even for a small plate appetizer, it was a total rip off and again, over salty on everything. The waited asked what happened, we told him and he said oh well we have heard the salt thing before but that is Latin food. I said we have had Latin food before and it is not that way. With that we paid our bill and left unhappy. By the look of no one else in the restaurant I can't believe we are the only ones complaining about price, quality portion size. FYI the restaurants around them except for Delmonicos were fairly crowded. So that is my review. I think the celebrity chef should actually be there working instead of putting their name on a restaurant and letting someone else run it. Either you are committed or you are not. She obviously is not.
