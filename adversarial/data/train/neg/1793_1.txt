While in vegas, our family friend who lives there recommended Ping Pang Pong in the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino since we were craving dimsum.  It was solid and pretty consistent for Dimsum. Fresh, the restaurant staff spoke Cantonese (which is the kind of Chinese that dimsum comes from). I give it a 4 because the dimsum is what I would expect out of a decent dimsum, but not AMAZING. For being in a hotel\/casino, it's pretty good as well. Dimsum is usually either good or really bad. LOL It's tough to make it bad, but it happens quite a bit.  Whatever chinatown you go to, usually the crowded dimsum places are the best and having to wait in a line in vegas for dimsum meant Ping Pang Pong was decent and it was.  I would say it's a little bit above average.  \n\nAlso...I'd have to say...dimsum and blackjack is quite a kool combination ya? lol. Not to mention the sports betting section being right around the corner =P The hilarious chinese restaurant name is funny too =D
