Went to meet up with some family on the East side of town this weekend. I told them I had some diet restrictions and they suggested Pita Jungle, which I was stoked on as I love me some PJ! I didn't know they had expanded that far east! \n\nIt was a Friday night and the place was hopping! We were seated pretty quickly and our waiter was on point all night! \n\nThe food came out a tad slow, but it was all great and everyone enjoyed their meals.
