I came here on a hot day with my friends we had very high expectations and were very excited to come. The place was very cramped and much smaller then expected. It was very hot and humid although it was very modern and nice. The lady who helped us was very informative as it was our first time which was very helpful! We got two Taiyaki filled with Nutella and vanilla black sesame swirl topped with condensed milk, and fruity pebbles and Oreos which tasted okay. The black sesame was very overpowering and everything was pretty messy. Overall it wasn't bad it was something new and exciting in Calgary. Stop by if you're in the area!
