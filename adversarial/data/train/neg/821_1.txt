I order from here all the time, and for the most part my order is always correct and tasteful. But this time I experienced bad customer service. I ordered and PAYED for extra cheese. So you can imagine my surprise when I receive the pizza and see that there is little too no cheese on it. I called to complain and the girl over the phone said they put extra cheese on it and I told her if she wanted me to send her a picture or bring it back to show her how little cheese there was. She replied with a smug attitude about it and said too bring it back. I did not appreciate the attitude whats so ever. It would be an inconvenience for me to go back and show her. All I wanted was a credit on my account but instead I was treated rudely.
