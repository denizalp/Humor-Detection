When we got there they were very nice, and seated us right away for pedis. BUT, then we just sat there and you'd think they would have gotten the water going so we could have soaked and relaxed until they got to us. Needless to say, we sat there for about 10 mins.  Then, the man I had was so sweet, but, did not understand English, and I kept having to say to him several times that the water was cold. Finally he got it lukewarm, he cut me, did not file my toenails very evenly and my polish was not great at all.  It was smudged, put on unevenly and on my skin.  Needless to say, I won't be back.
