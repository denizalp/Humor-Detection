There is this thing that happens, on a twice weekly basis during the summer. My husband and I will be sitting on the couch in the evening, reading or writing or watching tv, when one of us will look at the other, and say \"Hey, um, what about - \" and, seriously, before the word \"ice cream\" is even pronounced, we are halfway to Bo-Bec. \n\nALL of their home made ice cream flavors are delicious, they also have a fairly good selection of sorbets. I'm not totally clear on the vegan options, and I don't think that there are a ton, but I'm sure they exist. I find that no matter what kind of mood I'm in - from mango sorbet, to kulfi (a somewhat chai-like concoction) and pistachio, to crème glacée molle dipped in dark chocolat belge, this place satisfies. \n\nAlways follow a trip to Bo-Bec with a walk around Parc Laurier. Them's the rules.
