Everything I've eaten here is really good! I don't like breakfast (at all) but I do like pastries and I've had an array of delicious brownies, cookies, and parfaits at Jewels! The two times I've eaten in was with breakfast-loving people so I couldn't escape a real meal. So I chose the fried chicken and waffles and OMG they are SO good! They serve them with this hot sauce\/butter\/sugar mix that is yum! \n\nI don't have a gluten-free diet but everything I've tried was really good, I couldn't tell anything was missing. \n\nThe service is pretty sucky, hence the 3 stars. I can't really gauge if the staff is rude or just awkward, either way it's not the most pleasant experience. The last time I was there, a gal came up to our table and said \"are you finished with that?\" and pulled my plate away before I answered. It still had food on it and I had my fork in my hand en route to my mouth! Haha. And we couldn't have been sitting more than 10 minutes so it's not like we were \"camping\" and she was politely telling us to move along. \n\nI will be back because the food is good but I will take-out. I don't think I will eat in again. They're not the friendliest of people.
