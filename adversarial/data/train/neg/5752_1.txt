As a student, it was the sliding pay scale at TAS is what drew me to the studio, but certainly there are so many other things that have kept me here! Walking through the doors is an immediately calming experience and the smooth way in which the clinic runs is highly professional. At first it was unnerving to see other people in the common treatment room but I quickly found it became an unspoken support group for people like me, people who had chronic issues that Western medicine just can't treat. The practitioners give everyone individualized attention they deserve and truly understand that they are not only providing relief for so many people, they are offering a haven from an intense and stressful world. \n\nI have been treated with acupuncture by other practitioners and my experiences with both Daryl and Ash at TAS have been comparatively the best (I have not had the opportunity to be treated by anyone else at TAS, but I'm sure there technique is just as strong!). I really have the best experience of my body and mind at TAS and my migraines are reducing in intensity and frequency since starting treatment there.\n\nOne note, however: due to the number of people that the clinic serves they can run about 10 minutes behind. This has often happened to me in ANY healthcare office though, and I just make it a nice 10 minutes of relaxation to prepare my body for the ultimate experience that is acupuncture!
