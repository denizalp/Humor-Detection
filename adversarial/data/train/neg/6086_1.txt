Fantastic margaritas complemented by excellent food selections. A healthy variety of tacos which can be mixed and matched. The chimichanga was just the right level of spice. And, oh the great margaritas. Highly recommend the Cadillac. And save room for the desserts. This is an excellent night life hang out on weekends, or a pleasant dinner for two during the week.
