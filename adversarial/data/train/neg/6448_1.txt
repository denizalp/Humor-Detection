I go to Angela's a lot. Generally speaking, tasty food and fair prices. \nThe quarter chicken meal off their daily menu is a ridiculous deal. $10 buys you a plate of chicken and fries, a bowl of soup, coffee and dessert. Amazing. \nUnfortunately there have been a few times when I've gotten food burned or underseasoned, or meat that is a little dried out. Nothing terrible, but there have been screw-ups. \nAnother thing that needs to be said: the service is just no good. Some nights the whole restaurant is served by one woman, in her 60s, who always seems distracted or disinterested and will only rarely visit the table. It's also not uncommon to have to walk into the restaurant past a number of staff members smoking on the front steps. Not crazy about that. \nHere's some other good things about Angela's, so you don't think it's all bad news. The pizza is just delicious, I would personally recommend \"the Angela\" or a sausage and onion. Pizzas are big, good amount of toppings, good flavor, good crust, just a great pizza. The prices, however, seem a touch on the high side. But it is undoubtedly a high quality product. \n\nUltimately, I stand by Angela's as a good place to get a bite to eat, but I would really only recommend that you get take-out or delivery.
