This is such a neat place to dine.  My colleagues decided to take me out for a birthday lunch a few weeks ago to a place I've never been before ... The Farm at South Mountain.  It was 5 of us in total and we all ordered different items.  Unfortunately I don't remember everything everyone ordered but I do remember items that stood out to me the most:\nThere was a special sandwich which features chicken, Granny Smith's apples, bacon, avocado and something else.  It was called the California Club or California Cobb I believe.  I did not get this sandwich but wish I had.  If you're at the Farm and it's on the menu do yourself a favor and order it.  I PROMISE you won't be disappointed.  The Tuna sandwich was also a winner in my book.  It tasted really fresh as if it was made to order.  I'm not sure if it was or not but it definitely taste like it.\n\nI did not care of the side order of potato salad (too bland) and the spinach salad.  There was nothing spectacular about the spinach salad it all. We all also really enjoyed the Citrus Green Tea.  Be sure to a lot ample time for lunch because you'll wait a while for your lunch.  Not a problem when it's so fresh like that.\n\nI'll can't wait to return to try some of the other sandwiches.
