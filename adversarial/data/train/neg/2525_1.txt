Came here a while ago but to get my nails done for prom. I walked in the lady asked me what I wanted I told her a full set she said okay sign in and that I need to make an appointment I said okay what times do you have open today she said 6:00pm. I said okay cool I'll be back at 6. I come back at 6 and she tells me to wait and like 5 different customers come in and she's does their nails before she gets to mine. By that time it's 7:30 and she doesn't even start my nails until 8. I asked for a simple matte black, coffin nails with silver nail polish. I even had a reference picture and my nails turned out NOTHING like the picture. Then she charged me $60 for them when she originally said $35.  I'll never come here again.
