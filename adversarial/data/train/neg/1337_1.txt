Having lived in Texas for 11 years, I've had a lot of brisket.  The chopped brisket sandwich I had there yesterday was among the best... if not the best I've ever had.  So glad I got there before they were out for the day.  Also thanks to the staff for providing a safe, out of the way storage place for our luggage before heading back to the airport!
