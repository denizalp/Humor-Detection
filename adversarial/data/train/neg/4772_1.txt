This place had some fantastic ribs, the barbecue in general was really good, the sushi is definitely not their strong point, so if you go to buffets for the sushi this is not the spot for you. The unlimited alcohol was a big plus, they had a pretty good Chardonnay and Cabernet, this was definitely surprising as it was free alcohol, the wine alone makes the price reasonable if you like to drink wine as I do. I would definitely recommend this place for a good buffet, but not a great one
