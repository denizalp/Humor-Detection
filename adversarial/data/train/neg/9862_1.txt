Delhi Palace is hands down one of the best Indian places in Tempe. Only beaten by Royal Taj (which is truly wonderful and I suggest you try it).\n\nThe service is so-so. Half of the service men don't come by regularly but there is at least one guy who is super attentive and does pretty well about re-filling drinks and finding out if you are doing ok.\n\nI've had many of the dishes there including their Chicken Tikka Masalla, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken and Lamb Vindaloo. The garlic naan is fantastic. The best dish of what I tried was the Tikka Masalla. The vindaloo is off somehow, it used to be my favorite dish back in San Francisco but I haven't found an Indian place here in Tempe that does it right. However, their Masalla is amazing. That sauce with garlic naan is MMMMM.\n\nThe decor is very authentic, so is the smell of the restaurant. As with a lot of good Indian places it can get kind of cloying but if you are into the Indian culture and food you can easily get past it.
