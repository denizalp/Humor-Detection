Happy with the outcome. Not happy with the service. I walked into the building on my wedding day for my 4p appointment. (No prior hair trial.) We waited for 10 minutes without any greeting. I walked back into the salon and was told then that she booked me & my mother-in-law at the same time -- which was never discussed. I waited for the hair dresser to finish my mother-in-law's hair & walked back to her station again at 4:35. I asked when I would be seen and she said \"I told you already. I will get to you when she's done.\" Not what a bride wants to hear hours before walking down the aisle. Once I got into the chair, everything was great and the \"do\" actually looked fabulous. More communication would have gone a long, long way. It was the only sour part of my big day.
