The Dr was amazing and great with my kids, she answered all of my questions. However there was a dental hygienist who was beyond rude - she has a blonde bob hair style. I brought all 3 of my kids there at the same time. Two of my kids were scared and not being very cooperative. She said FOUR times that if they weren't going to cooperate then they had to be done and rescheduled because there were more appts - come to find out we were the last apt of the day! For being a KID'S dental hygienist she did not have the patience that is required to work with kids. Because of her I am not sure we will be back.
