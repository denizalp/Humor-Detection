Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday before they started cranking out their new menu which they let me preview.  I was happy to try their veggie options just for fun. I went with the tofu chorizo concoction which was interesting but what do I know since I'm not a full blown veg or anything, but it was tasty and and that is all I have to say. Then I tried their veggie tostada which was surprisingly good, that I actually ordered another one.  I stopped by real quick and the place filled up for lunch by the time I was leaving. The server was very friendly and was able to explain a lot about their new menu and handled the large amount of people that came in over the course of the 30 minutes or so that I was their. With this simple taste test I will definitely be coming back to try this place out for their full on flavor, I think it is going to be a good addition.
