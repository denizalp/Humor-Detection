Rented a suit with a jacuzzi online, when checking in got told that they didn't have a suit with the jacuzzi , I understand they get busy but when you prepaid for something it's because your guarantee that it's going to be available. Got into our room and found roaches and the ac didn't work bathroom was dirt, overall was disappointed as its nothing like the pictures online.i had no hope for the hotel until we went to the bar and met Kenny aka Enrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrique the bartender. He made the stay better I would stay again just for the bar. If you stay please ask when he is in as he will make your stay one of a kind.
