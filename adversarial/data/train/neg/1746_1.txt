Mexican food is one of our favorites, and Blue Agave was okay. What stood out was the server. She was extremely attentive, polite, and quick to answer our questions. The food itself was average Mexican food. Some of the steak fajitas were somewhat fatty and tough to chew. My wife had the tres enchiladas and was not too big of a fan of the red sauce. The portion sizes were great. Overall, some decent food, but there are better Mexican restaurants out there.
