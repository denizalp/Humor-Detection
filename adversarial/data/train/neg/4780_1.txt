I was a huge fan of this place last year, but things seem to have gone down hill for their opening weekend (perhaps an aberration?).\n\nCame here with family for brunch. We ordered a variety of things from the menu including eggs benedict, tofu scramble and a sandwich. \n\nI had the benny and it was as bland as can be. A barely toasted english muffin with some avocado and tasteless hollandaise served with about 10 cubes of potatoes that were insufficiently cooked. My partner had the tofu scramble and it was also bland - no flavour whatsoever. \n\nThe server was pretty good - he was friendly but clearly had too many tables since he was being flagged down by everyone for things like ketchup and drinks. The food came decently quickly. It's just a shame that it sucked. We chose this place over the Rectory which is more expensive but I'd be happy to pay extra for palatable food. \n\nI'll be giving this place another shot later in the season, but if it's similar to this experience I'll be relying on the Rectory from then on.
