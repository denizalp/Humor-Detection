This place is great for something quick. The crepes are $10, and if you want to maintain your buzz, you can get Bailey's for your coffee. I had the Bayonne, and woowhee! I was stuffed after about half the crepe. There's proscuitto in there that gives just enough of a salty taste, and enough cheese to coat the whole damn crepe. \n\nI want one. Right now.
