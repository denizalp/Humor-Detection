We had our home inspection by Will and he was amazing! He was very thorough and professional. We loved the Homeowners book\/manual he sent to our signing with our realtor, along with 'we moved' cards. Those were a very, very nice touch. Will was very thorough and explained everything that he found, even down to the chip in the countertop. He talked us through how a couple small tasks could be completed by us. If you're looking for a home inspection company, we highly recommend using them. You will be extremely happy with their service.
