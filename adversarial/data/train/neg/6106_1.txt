I love this place! My parents started taking me here as a little kid and now I always go back when I'm in town visiting. I love the interior, each room\nIs different and super cool. It feels very welcoming and traditional. The service has always been friendly as well. I love love love their salsas that they bring you for free. I try to always order a different meal and they've all been good so far! The chicken is always really fresh tasting. The margarita (fresh lime) is also very good. I will always come back!
