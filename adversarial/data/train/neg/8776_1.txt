We stopped here for the first time and the froyo was amazing! The atmosphere is fun and family friendly with cool games and decor. \nWe got a mix of froyo and toppings. I like that there are different cup sizes and a variety of toppings to choose from. \nWe found out they are recently under new ownership run by a really nice family. We will be back for sure!!
