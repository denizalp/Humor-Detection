I ordered over the phone. She told me it would be ready within 5 to 10 minutes. Parking was tough. When I arrived, my food was being bagged. Perfect timing. I was helped right away. In and out in less than 3 minutes.\nFood was okay. CA turkey, and I tried a seasonal potato soup. The soup is kind of spicy (also not creamy), but it mixes well with the avocado & cucumber on the CA sammich. Give it a dip... you might like it.
