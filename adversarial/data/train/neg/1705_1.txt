Quicken was wonderful they closed my loan in 16 days.  I called them because a local mortgage broker was not being responsive and escrow had already started for purchase.\n\nI've had about 11 real estate transactions over my life time  and this was by far the easiest most pain free of them all. The website is easy to use staff was very responsive, the rate and cost of loan was very competitive.
