My boyfriend made reservations here for a special occasion. From the moment we arrived they treated us like we were VIP. At least three different people consistently coming around to offer more cocktails, refresh water, check on us. The steak I ordered was yummy but not the best I've ever had in my life. The chocolate martini made my night though! I liked the live music, far enough away from the restaurant so you could make conversation. I loved the fire and chandeliers setting. Romantic and trendy.
