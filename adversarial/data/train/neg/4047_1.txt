I really like the atmosphere here, especially the back patio. Been here twice and this place is good for drinks and fish and chips. \n\nIve sampled a few things here like the Fries and curry, sample platter, haggis, fried pickles etc. And I find the food here too salty. Having said that, if you like to snack on salty foods with good beers then you're in luck. \n\nService here is good, but honestly would only come here for drinks if someone wants to come here.
