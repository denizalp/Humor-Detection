Lately I've been trying to try several different Korean based stores to find some good sauces so I came yesterday to see what I could find. When u first get there it's across the street from target and actually next to a Korean bbq place lol. That's fairly decent. The parking lot is pretty clean, when h walk in there's several kitchen on both sides and and as u actually get to the market side u begin to notice all of the Asian snaks, chips, etc. They have a nice selection of fruits and vegetables, and they beer selection is a bit small, but has the essentials, I bought me a case of Sapporo and a screwdriver for my girlfriend, and they have a meat selection that fairly decent. When u begin to go to the aisle, it's super crammed, we didn't have a shopping a cart so it wasn't a big deal, buy if I did, I'm sure it might have been hard to navigate through the aisles. The merchandising of the areas were definitely taking quite a bit of space, could be a bit cleaner, but like I said not a big deal to me. I'd say the biggest issue I had, is the security that kept walking last us as if we were gonna steal a jar of marinate, seriously? The place overall was decent, nothing special, but think I might go pack to Maryland parkway plaza with the other markets
