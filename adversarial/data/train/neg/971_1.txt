Service not very good.  Not attentive, literally had to walk from my table to the front to get the things I needed throughout my dinner.  Looked like they wanted to get rid of us.  The gratuity was auto charged, otherwise they would not have gotten a good tip.  \n\nThey get 2 stars for some of their food was good, especially crab and lobster.
