Very good sushi! I mean it was so fresh and good I can't wait to go back! Downside you have to wait until your entire party is there to be seated but that's fine because it's not the biggest restaurant. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. Huge menu with plenty of options even things for people who don't care for sushi. The food was very nicely plated and a nice sociable atmosphere. I would recommend this spot to anyone who loves sushi!
