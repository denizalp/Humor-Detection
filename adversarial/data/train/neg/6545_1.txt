I purchased a maintenance plan which includes 2 service calls a year and 1 plumbing inspections a year. What a bunch of baloney. They are very difficult to schedule appointments with. \nWhen I had an AC leaking through the bathroom ceiling, I had to schedule 2 appointments. One for the repairman and another for the semi-annual service. The repairman can't do annual services and repairs can't be diagnosed by the service man ? On the day of the scheduled 2nd service I called to confirm the time and they said I never made an appointment. \nNow the repairman has quoted a higher price for a new drip pan than the follow up service guy and the service guy found repairs needed that repairman never addressed. \nHow can I trust these guys if they aren't even on the same page?
