This gem of a burger place is tucked away in a small plaza on the corner of leslie and 16th. The place itself is small with a few tables for those who choose to eat in. We wouldn't have thought of trying this but for the great reviews in Yelp. Soooo worth the visit. The burgers taste fresh (hence the name) and juicy. I ordered the standard 4oz and it was perfect. The fries are also perfectly crisp and seasoned. The poutine is worth the extra money to upsize your combo. We'll definitely be visiting this place again for any future burger cravings.
