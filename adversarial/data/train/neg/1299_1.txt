My go-to Chinese take-out place when I'm in that part of town.  They have been there for a while and they know what they are doing.  Every dish I've had from there has delivered.  The portions are hardy, the prices are affordable and the sauces and flavors are excellent.  Excellent neighborhood Chinese food spot!
