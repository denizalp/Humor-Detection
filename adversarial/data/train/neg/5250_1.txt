Due to the large amount of pollen this year and the winds of March in Vegas, the windows were filthy and I had to wait about 6 weeks for an available appointment. I thought a team of window cleaners would show up but it was just one very skilled guy with a tall ladder, multiple cleaning brushes and scrapers. It took him nearly 2 hours and he did a fabulous job!
