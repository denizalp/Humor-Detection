My husband has had abdominal surgery and has some swelling. He's not in anyway Huge. He wears a 40\" waist under 275. I say this because if you're pregnant or have a larger belly I'd avoid. Every seat is a booth and very tight. It hurts to have things rub against abdomen so we had to leave. There is no accommodating larger people or wheelchairs that I can see. I asked. Before you blast him for being fat please note. He has brain cancer and steroids and medications caused weight gain and bloating.
