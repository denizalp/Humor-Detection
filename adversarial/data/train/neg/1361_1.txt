This is my second time seeing the Lion King and it's just as amazing as the first time. Luckily for us, we are locals so we were able to find a steal on the tickets. The seats were basically in the first section, center stage for more than half the price! Just make sure to shop a little if you plan on going.\n\nThe music, stage, and performers were all amazing. They definitely did the movie justice, if not made it even better! This still is my favorite theater show. I have been to a few other shows out here in Vegas and would recommend this show over some of the other cirque de soleil if you are into musicals. It's unique, fun, and the number one show in the world. =)\n\nGo watch it!
