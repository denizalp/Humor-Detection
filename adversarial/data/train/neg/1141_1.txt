In need of some lovely bakery items\/pastries to take to a dinner party, someone recommended this place to me.  Walking into this small and dark - dark in a good way - place takes you into a another sensory world.  Fresh baked breads, cakes, cookies and croissants are just a few of the things you can get here.  There is also a section for both fresh and frozen meals - Mac & Cheese; Pasta; Tuna Casserole among other dishes.  The great thing is that they come in different portion sizes - the one for the single gal is about $7.50 - which is good for 2 lunch portions (for me anyways!).\n\nThe cakes are Martha Stewart lovely but also a bit pricey - but being on Eglinton?Avenue area it isn't surprising .  I selected a few chocolate croissants and some butter tarts (caramel and chocolate).  Both were nice but nothing that blew my mind.\n\nThere is an area in the back where you can get hot\/fresh food and sit and eat.  If I were in the area I would definitely stop in and grab a cookie...or two.
