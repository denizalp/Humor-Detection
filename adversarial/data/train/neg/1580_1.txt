Hoover Dam is a good place to visit when you're in the Las Vegas area since it is only 40 minutes away.  We did the shorter power plant tour which shows you the power generating facility. The tour guides were great with some \"dam\" jokes and it gets a little cramp in the elevator ride when you are pretty much shoulder to shoulder. But it is a short ride (5-7 seconds).  Be sure to go to the top floor at the end of tour where you have a great view of the dam from top and the Tillman bridge. Overall, it is an good tour and a good place to visit.
