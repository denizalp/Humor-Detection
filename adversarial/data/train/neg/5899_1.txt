I was only able to spend 30 minutes there but Donny was so helpful with our Gunner and finding booties to protect his paws from the Vegas heat. The staff we entered acted with were so welcoming and knowledgeable about their animals and in general.  I was definitely impressed and am looking forward to our next visit.
