I went to sign up for a grazie card, there was only three attendants at the front desk. Im waiting in line for about 5min. A couple comes and stands behind me, im waiting another 5 min when an attedant walks up to them and helps them out. Im thinking, ok ive been waiting 10min here and Im skipped. Another attendant at the desk is done with a customer, at this point its 15 min in line and im approched by an attendant to be skipped AGAIN and then they call up to the desk the person BEHIND me. What the hell do you think im doing there standing for???\n\nGreat way to piss a customer off. I'll remember this when giving my money away to a casino. Ill keep my play at the cosmopolitan, always great customer service there that goes way beyond expectations.
