I've lived in Japan and eaten ramen all over the world. I'm going to be brief and cut right to the point. The ramen broth is a failure.. Too thin and salty and not creamy and rich enough. All it takes is to boil the bones longer and they are taking a short cut. Reading the reviews and it's clear that people are starting to figure it out. Until they upgrade their broth, my go to for ramen in Charlotte is Yume nearby. Yume hits a home run with their ramen broth which is creamy, rich, and delicious. Yume's sushi is the best in town too.
