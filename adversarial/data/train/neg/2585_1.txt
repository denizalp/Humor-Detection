This spot is awesome if you're coming with a group of friends who you're looking to catch up with and want a variety of tasty snacks. Theres a wide selection of various skewers which are all prepared fresh to order and placed on a hot plate at your table to keep them warm. Aside from skewers they also have a variety of bbqed seafood, veggies, rice, soups and mini build your own hot pots. The skewers are the reason I go to this place as they're so flavorful and juicy, however do prepare to down 2-3 bottles of water as I'm certain MSG is blended into the seasoning (however bottled water here is complimentary which is a nice touch). Drinks are also self served where you grab what you'd like to drink from the bar fridge and bring it to your table, which will then be totaled onto your bill in the end. I truly love the vibe of the place, however although it feels like a bar where you'd enjoy to eat skewers, down some bottles and watch a game.... they don't put any sports games on the screen here.
