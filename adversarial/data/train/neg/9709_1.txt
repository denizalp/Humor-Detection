Horrible service. Placed order online, had picture with pickup time. They said they didn't get it, but would place it now if I'd wait 20-25 minutes. Didn't offer a discount for their poor system, or poor service. Just asked if I'd like a water while I wait on them. Don't think I'll ever use them again. 0 stars! Over 45 minutes after my pickup time I get my food. Outrageous!
