I've been to this place quite a few times now, I'm shocked I haven't wrote about it, it's almost a shame. Anyways, time to give Cafe Darak some credit! (Not like they haven't been getting some already I mean cmon hahah) \n\nThere's nothing like cute little cafes that make you feel tingly inside. You walk in and it gives you that Landon Pigg, \"Falling in Love at a Coffee Shop\" feeling. The decorations are so beautiful and artsy, it's like a little art gallery in a coffee shop. Also a part of that, something I find so unique and cool is that they have a few notebooks on the side of the wall that anyone can grab, read, and\/or write in.  \n\nNow I know you're curious about this \"honey toast\". Well I always get it with Nutella and man oh man it is so delicious! I'm a bit of a honey toast fanatic and a HUGE dessert lover and this place is one of my top two places for honey toast. Depending on my hunger, I almost always eat a whole one by myself (it's true, ask my girls). \n\nFor drinks: they have it marked on the board as \"green tea\" for the frappe and latte, but I'm no fool, that's straight up matcha and it's straight satisfying. You can never go wrong with a frappe or latte that has that REAL matcha taste. As for the green tea, I've had it iced too! Quite refreshing and light. \nFor food I've also tried this cereal and ice with strawberry dessert and I wasn't really a fan. I think I was just sad that we didn't get the honey toast instead lol. \nThis place is great for a late night sweet fix due to its late hours!
