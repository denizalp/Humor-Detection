My five year old daughter and I had a wonderful first experience at Mais Nails and Lashes today. Cynthia made my daughter feel special today as she got her first pedicure. I thought the place was very nice, clean and best of all it did not smell like a nail salon (no strong smells). We are happy with our mani and pedis and will be going back.
