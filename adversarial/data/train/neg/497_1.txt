I went here on new years eve, had never been here before, they had some special for NYE, I got the pork tenderloin was pretty good, came with a ton of potato's. They were three smaller tenderloins wrapped in bacon. There was a belly dancer dancing while we were eating that was balancing candles on her head and stuff. was pretty interesting. when we were leaving they were bring out swards and fire or something. We got a hookah, lasts about a half hour. They were out of mint chacolate chip so we got mango-watermelon mix that was pretty good.  When we were leaving there was kareokee going on in the bar area but didn't stay for that.
