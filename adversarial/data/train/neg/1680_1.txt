We had the Kung Pao beef, garlic chicken with broccoli and Wuxi pork ribs.  My beef dish was nothing to write home about.  In fact, I found the beef to have an odd texture to it.  The garlic chicken was very garlicky but okay.  The pork ribs were supposed to be marinated with a ginger soy sauce, but it tasted like hoisin to me.  But it was still pretty good.  Overall, this place was decent and the service was very prompt and attentive.
