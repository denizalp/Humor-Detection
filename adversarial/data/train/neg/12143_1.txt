Today was my first time trying il Forno and I'm happy to say that It not only met my expectations it surpassed them from the Excellent service to the Great food tonight was all around Spectacular.\n\nI ordered a 12\" mushroom and onion pizza as an appetizer and it was hands down the best pizza I've had in A while, the wood fired hand tossed crust is light and Scrumptious, the sauce was perfection. It's safe to say i will be getting my pizza from il Forno from now on.\n\nI had the Lobster ravioli it was honestly Amazing, my brother had the Linguini Frutti Di Mare wich he also enjoyed very much. The meals included a basket of warm fresh bread that was Delicious. \n\nThe atmosphere was very nice, And the service was very nice I was attended quickly and respectfully The young lady who served me was Very polite and never gave us a bad tone she was very respectful we tipped her very well I very much enjoyed my first time dining at IL Forno. I Highly recommend this place and I will DEFINITELY be coming back soon.
