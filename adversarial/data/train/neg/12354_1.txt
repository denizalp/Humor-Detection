This place is really comfortable.  It is not flashy like a chain, but it is friendly and has good food. On wing night, you can still get them the way you, the customer, wants them - unlike BW3. \n\nThe only complaint is the bartenders talk too much. They talk to each other and customers. Not just to be friendly...they camp out and ignore the other customers.  One waitress apologized so many times for forgetting stuff, it was embarrassing. She even said she talks too much.  \n\nOther than that, very nice place.
