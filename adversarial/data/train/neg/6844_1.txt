My wife, my parents and I came here for my wife's birthday and had a pretty good time. The drinks were good, they had one my favorite bourbons which was nice (although I'd like to see more) and my wife loved the Rosemary Margarita.\n\nThe appetizers were excellent as well. The Venison was cooked perfectly and the pork belly was phenomenal. \n\nFor entrees my wife ordered the Duck breast which was tender and juicy, with flavors that paired very well together. My mother order the Filet which was cooked a very good medium rare. My father ordered the Diver Scallops which were cooked perfectly and the flavor was immense. \n\nI ordered the Bone-In New York strip and requested it in between rare and medium rare, what I received was more raw in the middle and blackened on the outside. The center was  bright pink, almost like what you would see with seared tuna,and was cold. I'm used to seeing a dark red center on New York so this was surprising and a little concerning. I have never seen a steak with inside color like that before in all my years of steak eating. Perhaps I just needed to order it medium rare?\n\nThat aside, the glazing on the outside of the steak and the side items on the plate were very good. I enjoyed the casual atmosphere and the live music was very good. I would definitely comeback for the appetizers and drinks but I will try some other items on the menu before ordering the steak again. The burger looked awesome, and the ramen sounds interesting.
