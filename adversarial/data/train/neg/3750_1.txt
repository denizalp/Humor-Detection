Airline broke my luggage (120.00CAD value).\n\nPaid 1418.00 for 7 nights for 2 adults.\nDue to hurricane, we did not use 4 nights.\nReceived 75.00 credit that can be used only through Air Transat and within 1 year and is not transferable. Essentially that is 18.75CAD for each night stayed at a 3-star all-inclusive resort. And as I have no plans on going on another trip through Air Transat for the flimsy 75.00 credit, in essence I lost money.\n\nThe 35 CUC paid for fare which was promised to be reimbursed over the phone before is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe 52.00CAD paid for duty free purchase has not yet been refunded and I am still chasing after the airline trying to get my money back.
