Over the years, Yorkdale Wellness has continued to serve our family with excellent quality massage therapy. They set a high standard for any new RMTs they hire, and they're typically trained by the Sutherland-Chan School. My former RMT, Lori Strathdee has now retired and sold the business but her excellent team of RMTs are still there to assist us. Today my daughter's regular RMT, Stacey Grigsby, was unavailable. My daughter suffers from fibromyalgia and has inherited ankylosing spondylitis (AS) from me, so we both have chronic severe back pain. Without periodic massage, neither of us could function. Since my daughter had a flare up of sciatica, she couldn't wait for her regular appointment with Stacey. So we opted for a newly hired RMT, Natalie Aviles. We really lucked out with her, because she herself has experienced sciatica flare-ups and has fibromyalgia. She knew exactly what to do to give my daughter substantial relief from pain. My daughter couldn't sleep all night last night cause the sciatica kept waking her up with excruciating pain. Now after an hour's massage from Natalie, she's feeling much better. I would recommend the caring and very competent Yorkdale Wellness staff, especially their Registered Massage Therapists, to anyone. You're in good hands with these people!
