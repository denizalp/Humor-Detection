This is a great burger joint. The balance of meat and bun is perfect.  Just enough fat juicy beef that you an still taste the soft toasted bun. \n\nDefinitely one of the best burger in the Richmond Hill\/markham area.  \n\nThe place is super clean which is a nice bonus.  Oh and the ventilation system is pretty good you don't smell like beef after going to the shop.  I think I still smelled a little beefy but I assume that was my beef sweats from the double burger I had :P
