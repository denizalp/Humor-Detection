Went in to try the chili size...a meal that's always been one of my faves.  Got mine with the homemade chips and the whole dish was just excellent.  Even though the chips were really good, if I would do anything different it would be to skip the side, but add extra chili to the dish.  I'll request it that way next time.  My wife had the hot roast beef sandwich special, which she really enjoyed.  Service was excellent.  We enjoyed this place so much that we went back a few days later for breakfast...chili cheese omelettes, absolutely terrific and again the service was just excellent.  It's very easy to suspect that we'll wind up being regulars here.
