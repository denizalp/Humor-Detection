My friend and I shared 2 sweet crepes, one dark Belgian chocolate and raspberries and one nutella ricotta cheesecake. \nBoth of them were absolutely delicious! I personally preferred the Belgian chocolate one because it was a little lighter than the cheesecake one. For the Belgian chocolate and raspberries, don't expect the whole crepe to be filled with raspberries, only the edge has the raspberries... So you'll have to ration yourself if you want some with every bite.\nThe cheesecake crepe is literally a crepe with a chunk of cheesecake thrown on top, so it was a little heavy, I also thought it could have used a bit more nutella, anything can use a bit more nutella\/chocolate really, but otherwise it was perfect.\nThe service was fine, a little slow since there was only 2 people working, one to make the crepes and the other to serve so it did take a while for us to get our food.\nI would definitely go back, at least for the Belgian chocolate crÃªpe!
