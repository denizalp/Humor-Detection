My personal experience at this office has been nothing but PLEASANT! After researching a handful of OBs in the area, I decided to go with Dr. Brenda Martin. My mother in law (not knowing I've already went with Dr. Martin) also highly recommended her. My mother in law is a labor and delivery nurse so she knows what she's talking about when it comes to OBs!\n\nI will be 6 months pregnant this week & all of my visits with Dr. Martin have been great. She is such a sweet person. She also makes me feel comfortable which is a plus!\n\nI've also had nice interactions with the front office. Sweet group of girls!
