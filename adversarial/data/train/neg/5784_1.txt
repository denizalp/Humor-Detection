Delicious !!!!!!! Delicious !!! Best desserts \/cupcakes I've had here in Nevada !!! The cupcakes are soooo good you could tell they are made fresh daily and made with fresh ingredients , I had the strawberry shortcake cupcake and wow it was like a bite in heaven !! You could taste the fresh strawberries the frosting wasn't too heavy and not too light it was perfect !! The gooey bars were super good too they are a mixture of many flavors!!! It's a nice little family owned shop I had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners and he was extremely nice you could tell him and his family really take pride in their business I will definitely be stopping again !!!
