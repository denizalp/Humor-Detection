The apartment locator told me not to go here but I went anyway because I'm stubborn. I'm actually sitting in the parking lot as I write this. I entered the leasing office and was ignored for a good 5 minutes before Abel decided I was important enough to acknowledge (there was no one else in the office). He then told me that I had to move in within 14 days for a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment although that's not the time frame that I need. His overall attitude was unappealing. I see that he is responding nicely to reviews here, but clearly, in person he doesn't know how to make someone feel welcome. I don't know how the actual apartments are because I didn't get that far.
