I've been to two Duckworth's in the area and this one is far superior to the one in Ballantyne. The beer menu is endless and amazing but the real attraction here is the cheesesteak. I've been here probably 6+ times and although I tell myself to order something other than the cheesesteak, I simply can't resist. I've had many cheesesteaks in Philly and this is just as good if not better than many of Philly's own famous spots (I'm looking at you Pat's, Gino's and Tony Luke's). I get it with onions and cheese whiz, quite frankly, if you get it any other way, I'm going to judge you and we probably can't be friends. The fries and onion rings are also always on point.
