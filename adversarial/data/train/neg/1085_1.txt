I can't say enough good things about this place.  Quality food and clean environment. Their lunch specials are a total bargain.  The seekh kabob is my favorite but be warmed it is spicy.  I like the ease of ordering.  Order at the counter and they bring your order to your table.  The nann is freshly baked too.  I'd eat there everyday if I could.
