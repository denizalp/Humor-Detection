It was a Friday night. We arrived around 12 so cover was 20$. But i will say the drinks inside were well priced at about 6 CAD for most that i got. Note, they only took cash but they have an atm near the entrance. Music was mostly dancehall which was a plus. Vibes were nice and not a rowdy crowd.  Seemed like everyone was there for a good time.
