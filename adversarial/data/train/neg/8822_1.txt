Pamela the retail agent provides extremely poor service.  I got stuck in the car wash for 15 minutes due to technical issues.  When I called the store she said said \"we don't stare at the thing all day long what would you like me to do?\"  Ummm i think let me out.  Called to complain to imperial oil.  Well they don't care either.  Asked for refund. Pamela refused and asked that I leave and never come back.  Explained that I paid for services not rendered and asked for a refund again.  Once again she refused and printed off a new access code.  Not well handled by pamela to throw a customer out because they asked for a refund for something that wasn't working properly.\n\nUpdate:  i used the above mentioned new access code.  Well can you believe that the touchless system turned the arm right into my vehicle.  Pamela came out and tried to offer me a cash refund.  I declined.  There is now a dent and a scrape on the passenger front of my vehicle.  Pamela once again handled this with poor skills.  She blamed me for the touchless machine hitting my vehicle.  WOW.  I was sitting in my vehicle following the instructions on the screen.  Pretty tough to follow DRIVE SLOWLY and STOP.  Instead of taking ownership of a machine malfunctioning not ONCE but TWICE is incredible.\n\nJust to top everything off for a machine that is doing nothing wrong why was a repair technician brought in that I had the pleasure of \"staring through the window\" to make repairs.\n\nSteer clear of this monster of car wash machine.  And defiantly don't expect anything less than blame from Pamela if anything goes wrong.
