I went to Brilliant Bridal for their opening weekend. I wasn't planning on buying a dress that day, yet my Maid of Honor talked me into trying some on just so I would have a rough idea of what I like. She pulled a few dresses for me, and one of them was identical to a dress I had seen online that I loved. The dress was so inexpensive and it fit 100% not even needing alterations, so I bought it that day. All of the ladies that work there are very helpful. I have recommended Brilliant Bridal to a friend who is getting married in a week and she needed some last minute alterations done. They assisted her as well! great service and great value.
