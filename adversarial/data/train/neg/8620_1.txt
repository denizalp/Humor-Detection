Last night a large group of us met at the Franklin, and had a fantastic time. The drink prices are a bit shocking at first, but well worth the cost. The staff made perfect recommendations. They quickly assessed our preferences, and recommended the perfect drinks and cautioned us against ones they didn't believe we would\nenjoy. They made truly classic cocktails right down to the block ice and care for detail. Thank you!
