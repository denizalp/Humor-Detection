Contrary to the name of this establishment, this place also sells turkey as well (for my Jewish friends). I honestly think they have one of the best sandwiches around. They offer a lot of different sandwiches on the menu and for lunch, you can make it a half sandwich + side (soup, chips, or potato salad, etc) + drink combo for less than 8-9 dollars. I usually get the Southwestern turkey melt which is stuffed with turkey, pepperoncini, lettuce, tomato, and red onions. \n\nThey also have a fair amount of coupon deals going on where you can get a lunch combo for less than 6 dollars. Another plus is that they offer free samples and you can order feasts for holidays.
