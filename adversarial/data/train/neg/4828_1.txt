I can't think of anything bad about this place. Luckily I've never had a bad cup of coffee. The atmosphere is very kick back where you have the choice of sitting outside in their relaxing patio or staying in. I noticed that the owner is always there making sure everything is in check. I now live in Queen Creek, AZ so its a long drive to this place but I make the effort to stop by at least a few times a month only because the coffee is sooooo good.
