Pretty Awesome. Got a screaming deal on my dog crates that I got. Saved me at least $50 between the two of them by getting them here instead of anywhere else (including online). Pretty good prices on the little things too (toys, leashes, etc.). It makes sense I heard from this place from someone in the industry because they have commercial size grooming products and commercial style kennels. \n\nThe place is bait difficult to navigate around. They give you a map if that gives you an idea... I mean to be fair the reviews I read set me up with proper expectations, but once I got there I was lost in the warehouse even using the map. Also, the owner (co-owner? not sure) is cranky and rude. She is quite old, but that shouldn't be an excuse. The front desk staff definitely made up for it with how great they were. Hats off to you!\n\nOverall excited to find Ryan's and will definitely be back.
