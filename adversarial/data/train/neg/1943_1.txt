We had a four hour layover in Charlotte. It had 6 tv screens on one wall, which was important for my husband. Sandra was our waitress. She is fabulous!!!  Bloody Mary's were good. We had a sampler plate (he loved the wings with Mamba sauce). Onion rings were good, fries could have been cooked longer. I think this food would be consistent if I traveled here often. \nI rated it a 3 but I give Sandra 4.5
