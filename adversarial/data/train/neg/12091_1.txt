I'm amazed I've never reviewed this place, I've been here many, many times. Generally I love it. The salads are outstanding. The drinks are outstanding. The burgers are great. Where they lose stars are the bowls, which are consistently disappointing. The desserts are also just OK. Overall though, coming in for a salad or even a soup is well worth it.
