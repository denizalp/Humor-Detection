I am usually not a fan of KFC, wife and kids wanted it.  I tried the new Nashville Hot Strips and loved them!  I had a three piece as did my wife.  The had the perfect amount of heat and the crispy was different tha normal KFC, something different and very good.  I am looking forward to having it again.
