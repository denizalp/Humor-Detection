I appreciate the one year guarantee on implant crowns, particularly because mine broke just shy of that year! Perhaps it was because the crown was sort of hollow, like a shell; odd, since it was made to replace a molar.  Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised and grateful Angel Dentistry eventually honored their verbal guarantee, even if the front desk initially tried to tell me it was past the 1 year guarantee. (Thank God for credit & debit card transaction records!)
