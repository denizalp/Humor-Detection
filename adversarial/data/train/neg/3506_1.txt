Great late night eatery.\n\nWas a little reluctant to try it. In the end I had not choice. Was starving at 11PM and didn't want to leave the hotel to get a bite to eat.\n\nTried the burger and a flatbread pizza. They were both very delicious. Wolfgang Puck is known for his pizzas and the flatbread was totally up to that standard. It was very delicious. Also the burger was awesome. It was perfectly cooked. When I was ordering, I told the waitress I wanted the burger well-done and she recommeneded that I get it medium. I am so glad I went with her suggestion.\n\nAt the MGM late at night, and your hungry. GO to Wolfgang
