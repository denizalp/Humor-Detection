We made it here before the rush and after closing up a tradeshow. Great hospitality and attentiveness from the moment we walked to to our awesome waitress to the servers and bussers that brought food and collected plates and refilled water.  \nGreat service!  \nThe food, boy, where to start. After a long day on our feet and a relaxed atmosphere the food was excellent. Hot, spicy and full of flavor. I wish I could eat more. Tried some toasted  jalape√±o peppers, taco platters, cold margaritas and left stuffed and satisfied.
