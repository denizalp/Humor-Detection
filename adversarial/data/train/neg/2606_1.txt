While you can grab a six pack at almost any bar in this lovely neighborhood I call home, I was really missing having a legit beer distributor within walking distance.\n\nThis place not only supplied me with Dogfish Head Punkin' Ale AND Tr√∂egs Mad Elf, but a usually great array of delicious variety beers and old standards for when I'm not looking to spend a pretty penny. \n\nThey offer a walk in with a lot of awesome beers already chilled too.\n\nThe best part though? At the register the owner has a huge variety of trading cards. I'm not talking brand new baseball cards, this is Yo! MTV Raps, 80's baseball and hockey cards, and Michael Keaton era Batman cards. It's a fun surprise when you're walking out with your beer pruchase.
