Cool lil spot. Enjoyed drinks and music with my love. Would recommend!! Very small inside, but cozy. They have live music and open mike nights! Also, a piano. It's not too trafficked, which makes it a nice spot to hang out and not be bothered by hustle and bustle. It is a popular spot, however!!! People stay and chat here. It's a nice place to consume alcohol!
