If I could give this place a zero, I would. One star is very generous. Do not waste your time or money in this place. Although Nekter Juice Bar is a favorite of mine, this particular location is beyond disappointing. The customer service is severely poor. From the get go, B (part redhead, part blonde) was beyond rude. It's clear that she is not only unhappy working, she clearly has ambitions to take all others down with her negative attitude. It is not surprising to see that the reviews support my experience. However, it is surprising that the management has not taken care of this very obvious problem. In the end, I'm pleased with our decision to exit this place without dropping a dime. Thanks Smoothie King for a great smoothie!
