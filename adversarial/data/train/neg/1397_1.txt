My husband and i designed wedding tattoos for each other on our wrists and Ritchie did a great job! He did our tattoos back to back and helped us tweak our designs so they would wrap around our wrists nicely. The shading is great and we get tons of compliments from strangers all the time (even over a year later now). Thanks again Ritchie!
