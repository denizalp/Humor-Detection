Eaten here at least a half dozen times between flights.  For airport food it is good, more on the mediocre side on normal standards.  The win for this place is the service and the speed they get you fed and out the door which is nice if you have only 45 min to an hour free. My wife and I were sat, made our order and ate within 30mins.  Staff are always friendly and attentive, no complaints with this place during any meals there.
