I'm a big fan of this place. It's great to find a gem, where the prices are truly worth what you're getting! You have great gourmet meals at just a decent price tag in the 20s. I have had the Paprikash soup, which is rich, creamy and delicious. I have had both the beef short rib dish and the seafood pasta, both are items I can't steer away from when I go there.\n\nI was a huge fan of the bone marrow appetizer special, but this is not for weak and weary. If you are not a fan of meat fat texture, this is not for you. Otherwise, for those who don't squirm at mushy, greasy deliciousness, GET IT. Your taste buds will thank you, while your arteries rebel.\n\nService has been very good the few times we have gone, with the wait staff being extremely knowledgeable of the menu and friendly.\n\nI have seen their Monday\/early bird prix fixe menu (3 courses for $22!), which is next on my list to try!
