I usually would give 4 stars to Wendy's as I always find their food quality good, service acceptable, and I have a \"free frosty\" keychain. However, this Wendy's has more restrictive hours than most other Wendy's. They are not open until 9 am, while my experience with other Wendy's has been that they are often open at 6 or 7 am. Since this is located smack in the middle of Tempe's ASU area, I would expect that they open at least by 8 am as there is a ton of demand for fast food in that general area.
