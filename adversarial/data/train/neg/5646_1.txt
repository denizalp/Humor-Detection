First I have to say that the place looks amazing!!   I have been there a couple of times already and like how they really took the time in every detail for decoration, even the center pieces. For me that tells a lot about a place. I really feel comfortable in that place. Let's  talk about the food. I tried their crepes and waffles. All of them prepared right in front of you, simply delicious. Fruits are fresh and the plate itself looks beautifully decorated. \nOne thing I love is that their tea are hand filled tea bags, Good Tea!!\nI strongly recommend this place!!! Not even mentioned the customer service. Everybody is really friendly and welcoming!!!! I love the food and the place!! thumbs up!!
