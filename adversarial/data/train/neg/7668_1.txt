I unfortunately didn't get a tattoo here since I was just in town for a few days on vacation BUT I did manage to squeeze in time to buy some shirts and my gosh the young lady that helped me was SO FREAKING NICE!!! If you are looking for a friendly and clean environment to get some ink done at I would totally say you need to check this place out!
