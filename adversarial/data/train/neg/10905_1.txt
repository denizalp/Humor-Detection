For AYCE, it was a little more on the expensive side, and no discount for using cash. It came out to $27 per person on a weeknight including tip and tax.\n\nHowever, the food is yummy, there is very wide and unique selection, and the staff are very friendly and prompt, so it's justifiable. \n\nThe mutton skewers were VERY salty, I didn't like them very much. The meat was cooked deliciously, but all the salt really took away from it.\n\nI did really like their baked cheese oysters though. The fact that they even serve oysters here is a big plus, however it appears to be a limited seasonal thing or something. Call ahead to ask if you're unsure.\n\nI also really enjoyed the fried squid skewer. It was like a miniature version of those you find at Night it Up or Taste of Asia.\n\nThey also had calamari maki or handrolls which was a surprise for me because I never usually see those on the menu at sushi AYCE restaurants. The handroll was amazing, I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe interior was okay-looking, nothing spectacular. It actually kind of felt like I was sitting in someone's house because of the carpet and how there's only one light source in the room I was in. The music taste was all over the place; they played a lot of instrumental piano music or jazz music, but then it suddenly switched to traditional Asian music, and then a lullaby. But we didn't come for the music, we came for the food, soooo......\n\nOverall, it was an enjoyable meal! However I wouldn't come too often because of the price.
