Love the cheesecake here. The best Japanese cheese cake in town! It is not your typically New York cheese cake. The texture is smooth, sponge like and super moist.   If there is no line up I would definitely pick up one. I saw this new location when I walking around downtown. There is no line up here when I came on Saturday night whereas the other locations had multiple people lining up. What's new here is the angel hat which was sold out by the time I got there. I would recommend picking up one earlier to avoid disappointment. There is also a cafe upstairs where you can enjoy your slice of cake and tea. The waiters are dressed up like Japanese waiters which I thought was different and unique as this would be the first. I can never get sick of this cheese cake as it is not super creamy\/cheesy. Has just the right amount of sponge and cheese.
