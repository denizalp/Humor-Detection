They shut your water (multiple times!!) & electricity off for hours at a time without any warning! It's rude & the polar opposite of hospitable. The manager is never in the office. Literally never. I have never seen her face. I'm lucky when she responds to emails. I had the upstairs leaking into my bathroom for about two or three months before they did something about it, constantly reminding them just to be shown that they don't care. I also had termites & it took them about two weeks to do something about it. \nThe only thing I like about this place is the countertops & stainless steel. \nTerrible. Don't waste your money here.
