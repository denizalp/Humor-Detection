Honestly it is a highlight!\n\nThe fried chicken itself tastes crunchy on the outside with a succulent meat on the inside. All the sauces they have available on the table are fun to mix and match and try out with the chicken. They all taste great so you can't go wrong.\n\nThe staff are super friendly to the point where they randomly asked us to try out their new recipes they were working on in return for a opinion. Who am I to refuse! So we got 8 pieces of free chicken wings!\n\nLove it! Definitely thinking about this fried chicken all the time
