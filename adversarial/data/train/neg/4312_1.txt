It is the Venetian ... the experience starts when you enter the hotel, with that fabulous lobby, and then goes up from there.  \n\nOne of the real gems there, was the restaurant there off the lobby at the bottom of the escalator.  It is owned by CPK (dont judge it on that) and served awesome food.  One couple warned us to split something as the portions were huge.
