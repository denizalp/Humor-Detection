I absolutely love Chatime, so this is a great alternative in North York with additional food items but the classic teas. Parking was tough to find, so we ended up paying for a spot just outside on Yonge Street.\n\nWhen we came in, there weren't too many people. I ordered a Lychee Slush, and my friend and I each nabbed a table. The tables are quite small, with just enough room for a laptop and notebook. After about 1pm, the bakery got really busy with a consistent line-up. There aren't too many seats, but luckily there were a couple of tables outside as well. Bake Code could definitely use some more retail space, but that's tough to find in the area.\n\nI didn't try the pastries this time, but would come back as it's so close to home.
