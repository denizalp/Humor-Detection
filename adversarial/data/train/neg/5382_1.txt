I have been to MOOYAH twice, and the food was amazing both times!  My husband said the beef burgers are fresh, juicy and delicious.  My son loves that you can order avocado for a burger topping.  Their veggie burger is tender and well-seasoned, and their freshly baked buns hold together and are yummy. (I'm craving their veggie burger right now as I write this!)  Both the potato and sweet potato fries are out-of-this world delicious, fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside.  MOOYAH's shakes are thick, creamy and decadently rich.  They will make your eyes roll back in your head!   They are THAT good!  The service was friendly, attentive, efficient and speedy.  We will definitely be back!  MOOYAH will be our treat after our weekly Costco run, for sure!
