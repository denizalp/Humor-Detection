We brought our geriatric dog here when our regular vet wasn't able to see her due to a temporary staff shortage. Our old girl had a large abscess that had started to drain, and needed to be looked after. The staff seemed very compassionate and knowledgeable, even though we were squeezed in last minute and ended up staying past closing hours. They took very good care of our 15 year old pup, and, although not pretty to look at, her abscess has been drained, shaved, and she's been put on antibiotics for 2 weeks. The vet was caring, *definitely* knowledgeable, and very patient with us and with Dixie... even with our 4 year old, who wouldn't sit still for love nor money! If we ever need a \"back-up\" vet (they're a bit far for us to travel to on a regular basis), they're the ones we'll be calling on!
