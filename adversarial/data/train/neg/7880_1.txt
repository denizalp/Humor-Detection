Well, what do you expect from a local college bar? We went here with a conference group to do trivia. It was ok, but all of the questions were science-related so that wasn't fun at all. It seemed like everyone who came were big science nerds, which really didn't make me feel comfortable at all. I just don't feel super comfortable when there's a lot of nerdy scientists talking about random sciency stuff. Eww. The drink selection is ok, they have a couple single malts, though not many. And very few liqueurs and cordials, as expected. But it's reasonably cheap and reasonably close to stuff. They don't have a drink menu, so you have to ask them exactly how much each thing costs.
