After about 20 u-turns I finally pulled into Mimi's expecting a great breakfast.  Mimi's is located in a busy area, crowded with restaurants and retail, but it is a terrible location!  It's hard to see from the street and the entrance\/exit is tricky.  \n\nAnyway, I have only been to one other Mimi's (on several occasions) and the food was always very good.  I have eaten there once or twice for dinner and it was pretty typical fare, but the breakfast has always been a standout for me.  The pancakes at \"my\" Mimi's were daydream worthy.  \n\nSo, kids and I arrive expecting similar fare.  I must say I was kind of sad.  I ordered pancakes for all three of us and they were less than impressive. They were literally \"flat as a pancake\" (couldn't resist)!  They were so super thin and wimpy.  I think the batter maker was having an off day.  I have eaten much better pancakes at IHOP.  My son's chocolate chip pancakes were just regular pancakes with some chips sprinkled on top.  Seriously?  I ordered the seasonal pumpkin pancakes with cinnamon apples.  They were almost too sweet to eat.  Bummer.  The bacon was great though.  The muffins going by looked awesome and I almost ordered one, but didn't want to look like a total piggo with my already full plate in front of me so I stopped myself.  The muffins are always a Mimi's highlight.  \n\nBut, the upside to Mimi's is that we had a great waitress.  I'd peg her as career type waitress, super professional and on top of everything.  All of the other staff were friendly and helpful.  The place was clean and neat and charming in that comforting always-the-same chain restaurant kind of way.\n\nI would def. give Mimi's at least one more try because I know the potential is there, but if it is a dud again then I am off to brave the IHOP crowd.
