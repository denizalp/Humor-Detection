We came to this restaurant to celebrate my 21st birthday. The service was absolutely awful and the staff was extremely rude. We were sitting there for an hour before they even took our order. After we ordered, our sever came back and said they were all out of what we wanted so we had to order something else. Then we sat for another 45 minutes waiting for our food. My plate, which cost $50, came with one tomato, 3 green beans, and a TINY steak. And if we wanted a refill on our drink, we had to wave someone down. They kind of made up for it by bringing me a chocolate mousse for my birthday. But I still wouldn't go back. If I'm spending $200 on dinner, I want to be treated right.
