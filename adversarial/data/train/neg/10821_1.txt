This McDonald's is located inside Walmart. We just ate here since we didn't want to get lost looking for something else.\n\nIt's not much to look at, but it was fine as far as McDonald's were concerned. I think other than not having an internal restroom they had the same offerings as a normal McDonald's, including fountain drinks. However, they did need significantly more time to prepare one of the items we bought.\n\nThe staff seemed to try too hard to be nice to us, but at least they tried to be nice.\n\nThey didn't have ordering kiosks so we ordered verbally.
