Incredibly rude first impression. I sent a message inquiring about a group package because the website was not clear if the pricing was per the group or per person (this could be the difference of thousands of dollars). The response I received from Carla corrected me by saying, \"the website states its for six and it does give you the total amount for six...\". Really? I'm inquiring because I want to book services for a large group. If the website provided the necessary information, I wouldn't have wasted my time sending a message requesting it. Terrible first impression and as a result, a potential customer lost. If you want to be treated respectfully when spending $1000+ for a large group, don't start here.
