First time inside the discovery centre and I'd say it was worth the money and my time. I can see many people on this review weren't satisfied over the pricing, but that's because they're expecting some sort of Legoland theme park or resort for adults. I understand the high value in general admissions, but lets not forget about a few things, 1 being the brand, and 2 the upkeep to run and maintain the attraction. There's a 4D show that last for 15 minutes each with 4 different types of show. With the prices of movie theatres now, wouldn't you say paying around $20 a fair reasonable price to watch the 4D movies as well as enjoy their attractions? The foods are decent, the usual pizza and snacks, but if you want something different, there's an entire foodcourt in the mall you can walk to...\n\nI took my 5 year old nephew (who loves lego) and my 8 year old nephew (who's grown up with lego) here and they both loved it. The 5 year old one actually cried when I told him we needed to go home 3 hours later. Their favourite part was the soft play, an area where they can run around like wild animals without worrying about getting hurt. I see other solo kids making new friends there, which is a benefit if your trying to get your kid socializing. My favourite part was building a car and racing them, spent a good chunk of the time there building legos with my nephews. Overall, the experience was great, not sure why I see bad reviews, but lets not forget that this place is for the kids, treating them to a lego experience that's close to home.
