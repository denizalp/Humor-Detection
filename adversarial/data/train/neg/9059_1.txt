It's a Feast buffet so don't expect much from the food! It was $12 for lunch with my players card. I got my money's worth but I cant mention any notable food that tasted good. It all tastes like frozen reheated food. It's all served luke warm or cold. I feel like if the food was actually warmed or hot it would make a difference. Small selection also. My three stars all go to service. I had to tip $10 because my server was so awesome!
