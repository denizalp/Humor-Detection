This was my first time coming to Jazzy's bakery. I've been looking for a new bakery since I moved to Charlotte from Greensboro. Walking in, I was greeting right away. They have a wide variety of cheesecakes and sliced cake option. I'm not a cheesecake person, but I was impressed. I decided on the Red Velvet, Double Fudge, and Vanilla pound cake. Overall, I was disappointed in all of them. They had very odd textures and flavors that did not match the description. I don't think i'll be returning. I don't even think i'll be eat the slices I bought. Very Upsetting. \n\n2 stars for variety and friendly service.
