This review is mainly only for the actual bakery item. \nOrdered their fresh fruit cake for my MIL's bday since Asahi bakery was closed for vacation for a few days. The girl who took my order was really nice so customer service wise, so far a good experience. \nWish I could say the same for the cake. Hands down asahi is so so much better. Everyone at the party agreed. The cake wasn't as light and spongy, the whip cream frosting was off for some reason and the fruit was just ok. Even my mom thought it was ok and she's never had asahi's cake to compare to. \nWould still be up for trying other cakes there though and their baked goods.
