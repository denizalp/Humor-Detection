In Phoenix with my brothers. One of them had back surgery the day prior. We wanted to get out of the hotel and find something to do and being guys who love golfing it was a no brainer. First time at top golf. Signed in, asked for a bay with a couch so my brother who had surgery could be comfortable while we played. Alex came over set everything up for us, was very patient, friendly and was always around when we need him. He even kept the ice packs my brother needed for his back in a freezer and switched them out as needed. We started with one hour and we were hooked immediately. Before we knew it we had been there for 3.5 hours. The environment, the food and beer were all great. They have found a way to make a driving range fun not just for golfers but for anyone! From now on I am going to be planning more vacations in cities with top golf!!
