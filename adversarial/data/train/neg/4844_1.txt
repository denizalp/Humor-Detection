I received a gift card as a gift for my birthday.  My friend was going through cancer so I used a portion of my gift card to get her a massage.  I went to book a massage for myself come to find out my balance was zero. I called to find out what happened as the massage I booked for my friend was $55.  They stated the remaining portion was left as a tip. A $38 TIP SERIOUSLY.  When I booked the appointment I stated to leave $10 for the tip and they took it upon themselves to use the entire rest of the balance for a tip.  Now they will not do anything about it.  This place is a scam.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY
