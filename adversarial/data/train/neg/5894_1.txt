Place was decent. Our server was personable and attentive.  The food was less than whelming - appetizers: tater tots with bacon only came with 4 tots for $7. The Cutting Board consisted of 3 small portions of artesian cheese, stale bread that was soaked with butter, a huge pile of olives, candy coated nuts and three small pieces of cured meats for $16.  Both were overpriced for the amount and quality of the food.  Dinner wasn't any better.  Prosciutto and Arugula pizza was weird.  The cheese didn't incorporate the toppings, just piles of arugula and pieces of cold meat lying on top of the pizza.  Made it very hard to eat without all of the toppings falling off - $15.  The Margarita pizza had limited toppings, hardly any cheese.  The best part was probably the crust.  Drinks ran $12 for a cocktail, we got there for happy hour which included only rail alcohol.  Expensive outing, left hungy.  Wouldn't go back.
