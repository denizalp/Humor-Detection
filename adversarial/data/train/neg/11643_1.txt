My boyfriend and I were craving some chinese food, so I looked on yelp, and I was shocked from all of the 5 star reviews this place has considering that it's right by my house, and I've never heard of it. \n\nWe had the Vietnamese chicken ravioli for an appetizer, and they were delicious. I especially loved the sauce that you dip the ravioli in to. I will definitely be ordering these next time I go!\n\nI ordered the Pad See-Yew with beef at a 5\/10 spice level. For me, I thought this was supposed to be medium, but it wasn't spicy enough. Luckily, they bought over 3 different kinds of chili sauces and spices to sprinkle onto my food to make it spicier. Much better! The beef was cooked perfectly, and so were the noodles. The combination of the hot beef, and salty noodles is one that can't be missed! \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Stir Fried Linguine with Beef. I know it's really odd for an Asian restaurant to offer linguine, but it was great. The noodles were cooked perfectly in combination with all of the vegetables. From what I tasted, it was a great dish.\n\nI'll definitely be returning!
