This is one of my all time favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Although it is not on the strip, I feel that this Hawaiian chain is as good as any of the top restaurants on the strip. Every time I go to Roys, I receive exceptional service and fantastic food. I love to go eat with my boyfriend and order a bunch of apps. Some of my favorites include, the backyard poke, lobster pot-stickers and the pork ribs. Will return as much as I can.
