Trendy Brunch with Big Portions\n\nEggstasy is a beautiful, modern restaurant that serves tasty food and a lot of it! My first visit I ordered the Greek omelette, which was a little odd, but yummy. Most plates can come with a side of pancakes, and there's the option to upgrade them to certain flavors! Because of the amount of food, I split the Steak and Eggs plate my second visit. It was just the right portion for us and cooked well. For the pancakes, we upgraded to raspberry white chocolate, which were very sweet but tasty. We also ordered the Eggasm (easy egg over potato pur√©e). Potato over bread was a bit much for me, but the egg was cooked perfectly, and the presentation was beautiful. The menu is extensive, so I'm excited to go try something new here!
