i've picked up food here a couple times and I still can't pronounce the name.  \nFood is tasty & there's lots of it for the price.  Similiar to Chipotle, but less expensive.  The food is very filling & one burrito lasts me about 2 meals, which is fantastic!  \nThe 99 cent margarita tastes exactly what a 99cent margarita should taste like: BLARG-Y.\nNo complaints, but it's not quite a super-awesome-bring-the-folks kinda place.
