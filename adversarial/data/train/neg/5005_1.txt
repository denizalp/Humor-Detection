This place is cute. It seems like my youngest (3yrs) enjoyed the rides more than my oldest (6yrs). The price is decent if you stay for at least 2 hours. I think they could take the arcade out in the back and perhaps add on to the rides. Perhaps a pool table or another ride. The manager is very friendly and the workers are not extremely nice or rude. Just indifferent. I would suggest this place anytime.
