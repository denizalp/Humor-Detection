La Palapa is located on a \"quieter\" block of the South Side. From the outside, they could benefit from some brighter lights or more eye-catching signage to draw in more people. There's seating for about 30 in this small Mexican restaurant. It never seems to be very busy, but the food is great! My girlfriend and I started with chips and salsa. We got both the verde and pico salsas and both were very good. I like that they warm up the verde salsa. For entrees, I ordered the Lengua en Salsa Verde (beef tongue) with rice and beans and Toni ordered the chicken Enchiladas Verdes. My beef tongue was incredibly tender and flavorful. The meat just fell apart. I used my corn tortillas to create tacos with the beef, rice, and their very spicy hot sauce. Toni's enchiladas were tasty, but the chicken was a little dry.\n\nAll in all, this place has consistently good and AUTHENTIC Mexican food. $33 for 2 entrees + chips and salsa is slightly higher than some Mexican joints, but the quality and portion sizes make it easily justifiable. I'll be back.
