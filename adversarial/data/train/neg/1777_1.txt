My wife and I decided to finally purchase an RV! After visiting other dealerships, we decided that the one-on-one training\/orientation, 2 night overnight camping after purchase, and the professional and courteous team, made Johnnie Walkers our dealership of choice.\n\nSales: Overall, our salesman, JJ, worked with us to find the best RV that would meet our needs.  He was extremely knowledgable and very patient with a couple of RV newbies. \n\nService: Jose, was responsible for setting up our travel trailer, providing RV training and making adjustments to anything we wanted corrected. He was amazing! Jose, resolved our minor issues with a can do attitude. He made our lives so much easier and he was thorough. \n\nThe service and parts team was also extremely helpful and friendly. All of them provided support as though we were family members each time we had questions. That's rare. \n\nWere there things they could improve upon? Sure. That happens with every large purchase. \n\nMy only suggestion - do your own homework. Make sure you gather your own information regarding what your vehicle can actually tow. Go by your truck dealership and get the actual facts. Don't rely on the Internet or people's opinions.\n\nKudos to the staff at Johnnie Walker's. We would definitely purchase from you again!
