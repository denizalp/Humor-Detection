come about 2 times a month for a good fast dinner ! staff is very nice and always gets my order right every time ! I always get 5 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole and a cheese quesadilla ! my boyfriend always gets something different but his favorite is there carne asada burritos ! this place is a must for fast good Mexican food ! I will always come here ! love it !!!!!
