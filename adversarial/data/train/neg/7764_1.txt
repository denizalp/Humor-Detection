I used to purchase ice cream cakes from this location for every special occasion and it's been a while since I've had one. I am obsessed with what I think is their strawberry shortcake ice cream cake! \nSo for my mom's birthday on Friday, March 3rd, my boyfriend and I decided to pick up one of those already made ice cream cakes to surprise her with. We had just gotten done eating breakfast and decided to swing by this location even though we knew we would be there before the store opened. We arrived at 10:49am and just waited in the car until 11am when the store would be open. 11am hit but we decided to wait a couple minutes longer because the lights still weren't on and it looked like no one was in there. At 11:03, we get out of the car and of course, there's a sign on the front door that says, \"be back in 10min bank (ty)\" \nFirst of all, we were there BEFORE opening time and did not see ANYONE walk out of those doors. So I'm wondering, at what time did this employee put that sign up??? So without any other options we just sat back in the car and decided to wait 10 more minutes. At 11:16am, past their \"10min\" time cap, we finally decided to leave. Ended up going to the Albertsons next door and got a very good tiramisu cake. \nI wish I would have looked at the reviews before I chose to go to this Cold Stone Creamery location.. Based on the reviews, it seems like management does not care one bit about their store and it's honestly very disappointing. From what I read, who knows, an employee could have just wrote that sign and decided to chill in the back with out anyone knowing. \nI will not be purchasing from this Cold Stone Creamery location ever again. If I could give it negative stars then I would.
