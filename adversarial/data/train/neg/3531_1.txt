Truly terrible service. They sold me a $300 plant that was infested with spider mites---something that would have been obvious to them, but not to a layman such as myself. The plant got sicker and sicker, and I took it back after three weeks. They promised that they would treat it and call me in two weeks. I waited over a month--still no call. So I tried contacting them. They were extremely difficult to get on the telephone. I eventually had to go there, at which point they told me that the plant had been stolen. Very strange. Then I was told that I'd need to come back to get refunded because neither of the owners knew how to give credit card refunds. So, I had to return again. The refund was granted. At this point, I would have quietly left the store, but the owner, Marcel, felt that it was necessary to say a bunch of abusive, xenophobic things to me. They sold me garbage, gave me the runaround, behaved dishonestly, and then acted like it was my fault. Customer service does not get any worse than that. Do not give them your business.
