I've been getting my nails done here for over 2 years. The owners are friendly & keep the salon very clean. Every time I leave I am extremely happy with the results. I recommend M nails to anyone in the area and send a lot of my own clients to the salon for there wedding day nails as I work in the bridal industry. I've had my nails done by almost all of the staff and everyone has done an amazing job. I love being a \"regular\" here!
