ordered $15 eggplant parmesan that was soggy and cold. Told the waitress and she took it away and brought it back. Assuming it was microwaved.. it was still cold.  Way overpriced average bar food. $6 for a pint of beer! Salad that came with the meal was wilted iceburg.  And the bartender didnt say much for giving me cold food twice.. love the their patio though
