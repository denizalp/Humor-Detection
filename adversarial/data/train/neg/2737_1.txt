We arrived on Saturday brunch and expected a line up as we had heard great word of mouth. \nWe got the dill ceasar, with the deep fried pickle, YUM!!! Worth the extra couple of bucks! \nI ordered the breakfast quesadilla, it was huge and so delicious. I ordered a side of the latkes and have determined that, with the special hot sauce, I could eat them all day!
