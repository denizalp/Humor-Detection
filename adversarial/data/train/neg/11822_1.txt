I have to say, I have been here a number of times since it opened in 2014. \nThe menu is small but very adequate. The food preparation is exceptional, the flavours and textures are great. The staff are very friendly and efficient. You will always find at least one of the owners there. They are very attentive and do an absolutely great job of making you feel so welcome. \nThe other thing is the location. Sitting eating a delicious meal overlooking mussel mans lake. Beautiful sun sets all thrown in. \nI would have no hesitation in recommending this place whether you want just a bite or a romantic dinner. Five stars.
