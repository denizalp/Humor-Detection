This place is the bomb. When they say so fast it is freaky, they mean it. One time they knocked on my door just as I was picking up the phone to order...\n\nNo not really, but pretty damn close. They are fast, delicious and the prices are good! Everything has always been fresh, the employees are friendly and helpful and I smile every time I order. \n\nI am not a sandwich person. The only sandwich I enjoy is the meatball sub from subway with lettuce, tomatoes...wait, stop looking at me like that. The people always give me that look too..whats wrong with veggies on a meatball sub? And oil and vinegar? \n\nAnyhoo...I am not a sandwich person at all. I never make them at home and think they are pretty useless to me for the most part. However, Jimmy Johns has shown me a love of sammiches. An obsession. I literally ordered six days in a row the first time I tried them. I know they probably tought I was an mmorpg nerd  who doesnt leave the house for food ever. \n\nTry them...you will not regret it!
