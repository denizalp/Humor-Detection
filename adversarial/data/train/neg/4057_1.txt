The front desk staff is not friendly or helpful and are very unwelcoming! \n\nTried 3 times to go, and couldn't make it past the front desk due to the rudeness of the front desk staff! If I'm going to be paying that much for classes, I'd expect some courtesy from the employees....its yoga after all...
