By far the WORST buffet I have ever been to.  How can a 4star Hotel like WestGate allowed this to happen is beyond comprehension. \nThe name is Fresh Buffet but nothing in there is fresh.  \nPrime Rib was chalk-dry. \nShrimp cocktail smelled like it has gone bad and slimmy. \nThat was the last draw for me. \nAbsolutely horrible.
