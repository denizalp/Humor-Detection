The hype over this place is silly, the sandwich i got wasn't anything to write home about or fan over. I'm not a fan of this place, it's over overpriced even for Vegas and not really any better then Jack n box breakfast sandwich that you can get for under $5! Don't get me wrong its not horrible but i just didn't leave going wow this is amazing. The size of the sandwich left me hungry. The line was ridiculous long 15-20 min wrapping around corner probably more cause of the hype. Plus the wait varied all 3 of us ordered 1 after other and there was a 5-7 min difference in order being ready. The kitchen appears to be efficient but its not. Skip it save yourself $10 and go to Jack n Box off strip. But if you want to improve reduce the cost of the sandwich a buck or two or offer a side of hash browns and work on the efficiency of the kitchen, you have eggs, bacon, sausage ready i saw them. Work on getting the orders out faster and the line moving quicker.
