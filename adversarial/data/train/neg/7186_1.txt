I got my nails done by Lindsey and I was very happy with her work. The only negative I would say is that some nails were a bit too thick with nail polish (got gel nails) but the polish was done very well! What's really important for me is the atmosphere which  was very friendly with lots of smiling faces. I will definitely be back for a polish change and just let her know to put one less nail polish coat. Great job for a great price! :)
