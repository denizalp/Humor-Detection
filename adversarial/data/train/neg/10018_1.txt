This is a great place to go for take-out! My family & I stopped here for a quick meal on a Friday nite. We got one of the specials - Pepper Burgers & delicious homemade potato chips! The burgers were big half-pound Angus burgers with jalepenos, banana peppers, and cheddar cheese. I wasn't sure I would like this combo, but it was so delicious! I grabbed a menu, and Stoke's Grill also makes pretzel sandwiches, quesadillas, salads, soups, wrapitos, and classic deli sandwiches, too! There are so many choices, I'm not sure what I'll try next, but I'm sure it will be tasty! :)
