Tom was the best! My husband and I moved to area, but we wanted to find a short term lease at first in order to explore.  Tom was the only agent who could land us this, as we had a dog and cat, so it was difficult to secure.  After we got settled in the vacation rental, and did several weeks of exploring on our own, Tom found us our house in ONE day.  He was a committed, honest, kind and a caring agent, and I would highly recommend him!!!!!!!
