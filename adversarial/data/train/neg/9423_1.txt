I remember the first time I tasted your tacos... it was at an event. It was outdoor, so even after a couple hours the tacos and sides were still warm aand tasted freshly made. I later found you were in Henderson ! Not your typical white walled cafeteria looking taco spot , which is a nice change , and you.still.have the same kind.of prices but better.taste ! the meats are juicy, toppings fresh, I particularly recommend.the barbacoa and carnitas . The bar is what I'll try  for my next trip.
