This is a plain little jewel in China Town.  Most of the clients are Asian as they serve both Chinese and Vietnamese food.  Food is excellent.  You should look for the elevator (it is old and hard to locate) as the restaurant is upstairs.  My favorite is rice egg rolls served with a large bunch of herbs including lettuce, mint, cilantro, basil, etc..lwrap the egg roll in the lettuce and dip it in the sauce they serve with it.  Yum!  Also recommended are all the seafood dishes including live lobster you see before it is cooked.  Lunches are $6.95, $7.95 and Seafood ones are $8.95.  These are served with a large bowl of white rice, a teapot full of hot tea, and chopsticks!  I have eaten several Pho dishes and have never been disappointed.  Also, if you like pork chops, they serve huge ones covered with a delicious gravy and steamed rice.  I love their food!\nThey have a large dining room and can handle large families, etc.
