This place is the downstairs bar\/restaurant of Jimmy D's.  Recently remodeled but not the best spacing for seating.  Our waitress was not well trained for serving dinner.  We were not offered to taste the wine first, she just opened the bottle and started pouring our glasses.  The pizza was extremely thin with tasty crusts.  Not very filling so don't split a pie unless you order something else.  Our salad was plain, but fresh and dressed perfectly.  Nothing for dessert because they don't have dessert!
