Decided to try this place after friends of ours raved about it - so glad we did!\n\nIt's right in downtown Waxhaw, and looks like just another storefront. However, it's quite cute inside with about ten tables and a small bar tucked away in back. Lighting is just about perfect and atmosphere is subdued but still casual. \n\nService was topnotch: we had three waiters who covered our table, including one who double as a sommelier with spot on wine recommendations. We never waited for anything and the timing was great. In fact, the owner and chef came by twice to check on us, which is a nice touch and shows he cares.\n\nThe menu is really interesting and ever-changing since the chef (Paul) is very true to farm-to-fork. On our night we had the sunchoke chips with buttermilk dip, a lovely sweet potato soup, the black bass and the scallop entree. All of them were GREAT - complex flavors, imaginative presentation, and served at the correct temp. In particular the Black bass is dynamite - the combo of collards, black-eyed pea's and fish are exceptional. Oh yes, try the deviled eggs to start: even if you aren't a fan you will like them.\n\nOverall this was one of our best experiences in Charlotte, probably only behind Barringtons in service and food. I encourage you to make the drive and check it out.
