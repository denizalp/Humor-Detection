I had a great experience taking my vehicle to Mike's for repair after a fender bender. I used the Geico express service - I booked the estimate and repair online for the next day. When I dropped off my car, they were expecting me, it took less than 30 minutes and every single person I encountered at the shop was helpful and friendly and showed concern for me. The damage was minor, and the repairs took less than 48 hours to complete. My policy provides a rental car, and Enterprise was there when I checked in with my vehicle and the rental process was streamlined and easy. When I picked up my repaired car, it was just as efficient and friendly. Getting into an accident is frustrating and inconvenient and costly but Mike's Auto Body made the process of fixing things and getting me back on the road into a good experience. I wish more businesses treated their customers like Mike's treated me.
