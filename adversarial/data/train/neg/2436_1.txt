Tuesday night dinner. Not very many patrons. One of the best wine lists around with a good range of quality wines at reasonable prices. We each had an entree, no starters. The lamb portion was generous and done perfectly. My chicken dish with a tarragon sauce was very flavorful since I asked for the garlic to be muted. Both entrees were excellent.  We ordered the souffle while eating our entrees (takes 15 minutes to prepare). It was pumpkin based and out of this world. James our server is the ultimate pro.\nAll in all a very, very nice experience.
