There are lots of great brunch places in Vegas, and this is one of the best. The specials are always tasty and generously portioned, and I really enjoy the breakfast skillet with sweet potatoes and hash browns. Some of the daily coffee cakes are delicious, and some are just okay, but I love that it's a different flavor every time I come in. The clam chowder isn't my favorite. Service at the counter is always fast, friendly, and accurate, even when it's busy.
