Dr. Cool does it again!\n\nIt's summer service time and I called Dr. Cool to come and check out my A\/C unit to make sure it was ready to handle the hot summer months. I made an appointment and the professional service tech from Dr. Cool showed up on time as promised to complete my service. The tech took his time, checked everything with a fine tooth comb and gave the unit a clean bill of health.\n\nDr. Cool was on time, completed the work in a timely manner, the tech was friendly and professional, I can't ask anything more from a local business. I'm very happy with the level of service I received and will continue to use Dr. Cool for my heating and cooling needs.
