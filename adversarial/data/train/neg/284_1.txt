We landed at Olive and Ivy at the suggestion of our Uber driver.  Listen to your Uber drivers, folks.  We were able to score an outdoor table with the firepit in the middle.  Great ambiance with the water behind us and the rustle of the wave sculpture (don't know what it is called, but super cool).  We started with the bacon wrapped dates and the salmon, avocado and prosciutto bruschetta, all of which were fantastic.  We all ordered mixed drinks, and we all enjoyed them.  I ordered the fig & ginger mule...then I ordered another one :).  For my entree I devoured the scallops, which melted in my mouth.  Others at the table ordered the wild mushroom pappardelle and bacon wrapped tenderloin and we were all very impressed.
