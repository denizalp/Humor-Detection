Ate here during the Taste of Danforth after being hungry from the small sample sized foods and long lines of the festival.\n\nPizza here are \"personal sized\" thin crust neopolitan style. Or two people can share and also get a side of delicious Ricotta Gnocci Fritti. I enjoyed the Duck Confit pizza with a white base instead of the usual tomato base.
