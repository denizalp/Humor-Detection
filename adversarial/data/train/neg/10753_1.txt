The food : amazing 5\/5\nThe service : extremely lackluster 2\/5\n\nI got the Spicy Tuna bowl. My mom ordered the Salmon bowl. Hers was good but she said mine was definitely better. There was a ton of flavor in the tuna.. I loved it. For the price it was also pretty filling. I would recommend it as a snack or an app before your ramen. I am currently pregnant and I was totally starving so I ordered both the bowl and a ramen and was pretty full ahaha.. No complaints! \n\nThe ramen I got was the Nishikawa Black Ramen. Really good, more peppery than I expected but I really enjoyed it. I definitely would come back to try more flavors. \n\nThe biggest downside to our visit was the service. We were brought the wrong ramen.. my mothers came out so late the rest of the family was done eating and she basically had to get it to go. The girl forgot my brothers drink. She took over twenty minutes to get our check but closer to thirty just to bring us our to-go bowl for the late ramen. It got really frustrating because she kept forgetting about us and helping other customers. \n\nI'd still go back and try it again. Everyone has bad days so maybe the service is consistently as slow. However the food was consistently pretty dang good all night... which is why I gave it 4\/5.
