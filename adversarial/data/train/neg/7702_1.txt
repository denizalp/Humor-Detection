I've been in this shop a handful of times now.  The shop itself is awesome, the walls are filled with tons of super nice bikes, wheels, helmets and really anything you would need if you are looking to blow through some serious cash.  I stopped in to have a wheel looked at, after waiting for a good 5 min before someone even said hello.  I was quoted a crazy price to even look at the wheel. I felt as though they were not in the mood to help me, so they just threw out a number that was so high I would go away.  The worst part was they acted like I was wasting their time.
