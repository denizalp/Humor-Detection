Absolutely terrible! The owner Holly is a horrible business person and very immature.  She has no clue about customer service and takes no ownership in her company's mistakes.  There have been times when they've cleaned the pond and hours later it was pea soup green. We've had her staff come out to determine where a leak was coming from in our pond and they claim they had to do some major repairs which would cost $5000!  We found out later that this was not the case and it was actually a very simple fix.  She wanted to charge $300 just for a slice call for a leaky filter that she sold me.  Avoid this place at all costs and save yourself the stress and money.
