This place is hidden but now that I found it I will be returning for my nail services. It's a cute little shop that has lots of services to offer besides nails. It was a good atmosphere very relaxed and they care about making you feel at home and enjoying your time there chatting it up. the girls there were very friendly and made me feel comfortable.  I have to say that the massage was the best part because they actually asked me to tell them how I liked it, instead of just squeezing my legs and doing whatever they wanted. The whole experience was great for the price I have to say. My nails look amazing great polish on my toes(they have all the brands) and my hands look awesome! They have a wax treatment to make them super soft!!
