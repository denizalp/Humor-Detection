If you're a female do not come here. The service staff is condescending, especially Mike Rich the man that I didn't have to pleasure to deal with. I was told my car would take 2-4 hours to be fixed for a recall and I just called to see when it would be done (it's been 3 hours) and he told me it would be another 3 hours before it was done, totaling 6 hours for the job. I proceeded to explain that I planned to drop it off early this morning with the 2-4 hour window because I work this afternoon and then his answer changed to, \"Well ugh do you need it sooner?\" like my time didn't matter. I also was told over the phone that I could get an estimate on what costs would be to get my seatbelt replaced and Mike responded with, \"I'm not a mechanic, that's what a diagnosis is for and that's $125. Since the airbag has deployed they're all tied together, so it probably has something to do with that. It could be $150-$2000 to repair. \" I'm not a mechanic either, but I know the seatbelt locking mechanism has nothing to do with the electric airbag component and I'm pretty sure O'reilly's or my dad would've been more helpful than this guy. Just another classic case of an auto repair place treating a female like they don't know anything and trying to pinch money out of them.
