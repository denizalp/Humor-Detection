Awwww zimbania!  You can't get any more Broadway than the Lion King.  We were so lucky to get our tickets with a package deal through Southwest.  Our seats were super high, but we could still see the whole play.  Man as a theater minor, I just loved all the scene changes, costume design, lighting and acting.  This is a theater lovers dream creation.  The story stays true to the cartoon.  There are a couple of different songs, but they are so catchy.  It is a great play if you have kids or not, check it out.\n\nJust a side note, if you take the tram here, be sure to leave right away because it will most likely be the last one of the night after the 8pm show.
