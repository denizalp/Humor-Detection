David was great! My husband and I married last year and were worried about his previous debt. We went to Haines and Krieger for a second opinion on him filing bankruptcy and they were awesome! He actually looked up information and claims that could be open and found that everything had taken care of itself. He was way more reassuring than the previous guy who suggested we may want to get a divorce until his debt was cleared. Definitely recommend their services and information provided to us.
