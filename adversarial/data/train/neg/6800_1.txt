So beautiful the water show! It started with the titanic song. \n\nWe waited about 15 mins for it to start. People were already waiting. More & more gathered as well. \n\nThe show starts every 30 mins after 9:30 it goes on every 15 mins. \n\nDefinitely want to see it again but during night time. I saw it around sunset. \n\nThe show only lasts 7 minutes. One song only.
