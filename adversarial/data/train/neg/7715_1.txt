I had to go inside the Chandler Mall to get some candy for my trip to the East Coast, where one lady I am going to see told me she loves See's Candy. I remember when we used to get this stuff for around $5 per pound...now, $33 for a 2 pound box!  It's still worth it! And the friendly staff inside the store is willing to offer a taste test!.\n\nI hope all those people in line behind me were not just there for the free sample, but actually bought some chocolate!
