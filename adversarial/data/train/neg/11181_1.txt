My Lady & I were looking for a good place to grab some pizza. We stopped in to Barros & were amazed by the service. The building is very nice & atmosphere was great! Ordered the all meat pizza, switched out the bacon for chicken & let me tell you it was awesome, we ate till our hearts where content. Woke the next morning n ate cold pizza straight out the fridge, now that is when you know you got some good pizza! Keep up the good work Barros!
