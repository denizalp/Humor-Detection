I moved in down the street and ate here 5 times in 2 weeks sandwiches and then one day we're like lets order a pizza we pick it up and it's so soggy there's liquid dripping out of the of the dough it was a soggy disgusting mess so gross so we called and they said it was our fault cuz we took too long to pick it up which we were there within 15 minutes of ordering the reason it was soggy on bottom is becouse they put it on top of a hot oven which draws the moisture down into the dough. They said no they won't make another Pizza and no refund no credit sucks cuz now it's been 8 months and I have not eaten here again which could have been another 30 times they would have made their money back on that s***** pizza \n\nPs I worked in several pizza places as a kid never seen Pizza like this. It's crazy cuz I thought they were nice when I first started going there and then the way they acted just so unprofessional it's the customer's fault
