My husband and I typically try to avoid places that look touristy. Even when we're tourists. I don't like Hard Rock Cafe and other tourist traps like that. The food and service are usually terrible and they usually have terrible beer selections and watered down cocktails. When our group chose this restaurant we were skeptical but starving so we took a chance. We all LOVED it!!! All the food we ordered was amazing. Great drinks! The service was awesome! The server brought me the wrong dish and when I pointed it out she was very apologetic and the meal I originally ordered was at our table within a few minutes. The manager came out and apologized. They left the food I didn't order at the table so our group could eat it. The manager gave me a free beer. The way it was handled was very impressive! This place was very good and everyone in our group was pretty amazed by our awesome experience.
