It's hard to review a place from one experience and on only one dish.  The dish was the Buffalo Soldier.  It's essentially a blue cheese mac 'n cheese with buffalo chicken on top.  The reason it gets 5 stars is because despite the fact that it wasn't super busy and in fact, by the time I got my food, I was the only one there, and despite the fact, I am not the demo who lives in and around the area so am obviously there for the first time, the service was great and not overwhelming.  The chef greeted us and offered that he can make whatever, however we want it, and the wait staff offered helpful advice when torn between the Buffalo Soldier and another dish.  So...based on the one dish, the pasta was not overdone (big deal if you are a pasta shop, right?), and the flavors were really balanced, which is hard and tempting to overdo, especially on a buffalo and blue sort of plate.  I finished the order (with some help from my \"not really hungry\" husband), and was left with a great impression.  Will definitely revisit when in the area and in the mood for pasta.  Nice work, guys!
