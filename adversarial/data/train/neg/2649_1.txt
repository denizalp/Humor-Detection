Great location, great atmosphere, decent food. \n\nThis place is good for large groups for a casual lunch due to the large amount of seating area both inside and outside, but it's also suitable for a casual solo lunch.\n\nI got the grilled cheese with tomato and the sun dried tomato pasta salad, which came up to just under $8.\n\nThe sandwich was okay. It had a lot more tomato than cheese, which left me wanting more. It was also a tad soggy, but I guess that's the price you get for having tomato in your sandwich. It was also cooked using a panini press instead of being fried in butter or oil which is advantageous for health conscious foodies.\n\nThe salad was light and delicious.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty sufficient meal at a good price.
