Decent experience! Visiting from Los Angeles and the food is authentic here but some of the items are lackluster. Great customer service and little wait time on a Wednesday evening. \n\nReally liked the sweet and sour pork, their soup, roast duck, and the veggies were fine. \n\nSome of the plates were dirty, and the lobster was bland.
