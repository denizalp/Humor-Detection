I have been coming here for years and always enjoy myself. Fish is fresh and the seaweed salad always delicious. Also a fan of their Iced Green tea.\n\nLately, the sushi chef -- which is very nice -- doesn't speak very much English. But, that's OK. \n\n Be sure to check out the lunch special as well as the all a cart happy our selections.
