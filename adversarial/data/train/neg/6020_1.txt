I usually just go for their tortilla soup. It's something about those little fried tortilla strips that really make it special. I was in the Detroit Int. airport the first time I tried their soup and man was it awesome. \n\nI've also had one of their salads. Can't remember which one it is at the moment but it was pretty good as well. I guess with a place like this you can't really go wrong. The service was prompt and our waitress stopped back frequently to check on us. Why can't all waiters and waitresses be like that? \n\nAny how I would recommend you stop on in and try their soup at the least. Sometimes the local newspaper has coupons for lunch and dinner if your on  a budget.
