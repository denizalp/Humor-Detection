You are an idiot if you book this place. Cost for this place over Presidents' Day weekend was $111. There is a club right next door that blasts music all night long. Loudest music I've ever heard. Even brought earplugs and could hear the music through our vibrating glass window. We had prebooked and when we realized the bass of the music would keep us up all night, we asked for a different room or a refund. They would not refund us or even prorate the place. The front desk person is rude and a liar. He kept saying no one has ever told him the music was loud even though you will find reviews that say otherwise. We didn't look at reviews before booking. Big mistake. We left not long after we paid and headed 4 hours home. The only reason we booked it was to visit my Girlfriend's grandma for the first time, who is 90 and in poor health, in Mesquite, NV. All of the hotels in Mesquite were booked days in advance, so we found this place online. Wish we would have burned our money in the parking lot, would have gotten more use out of it. Even if this is the last place on earth, don't waste your money. Even by Vegas standards the owner is cold and heartless. Read Smosh's review. Same experience. The people that work here aren't helpful.
