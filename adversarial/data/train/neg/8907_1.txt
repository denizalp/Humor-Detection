I don't shop at very many department stores (macy's, dillards, kohls, sears are regulars for me), so until I went into this outlet store recently, I had no idea. \n\nI was very surprised to see LeSportsac handbags here, as well as the Tokidoki line, one tote was $39.99. It wasn't the same exact styles or prints (or variety as the LeSportsac outlet, but some of the bags were much lower, much more affordable (at the LeSportsac outlet, unless it's 65% off, the bags are higher-priced, suppose it's the newer prints versus the older prints). There were good prices on Michael Kors leather bags, too. I didn't really look at anything else but the handbags. I was impressed, though, because I had never been. \n\nBecause of this, I have checked out the site online as well, and visited a couple other times that we've been to the outlet mall, too. I have my eye on a couple bags.
