If I could rate it a zero star I would.  My three year old daughter who plays Doc Mcstuffins would have diagnosed him better.  After listening to this urgent care doctor about my son being fine who is experiencing heart and chest pains tells him he has nothing wrong with him.  We continued the Tylenol and motrin for a whole day and he was still so sick.  I decided to take him to another urgent care on Gilbert and Southern and he has pneumonia and was given a breathing treatment right away.  This facility should be shut down.  They care more about closing than their young patients.  My husband took him at 4:45 am because his heart was beating really fast and was struggling to breath.  He comes home by 5 am and the doctor said give he Tylenol.  Really?  Shut down this place before someone's kid dies.
