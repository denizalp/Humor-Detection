My stars:  (5=epic \"best of\") (4=really tasty and want to go again and again) (3=good and will go back once in a while) (2=fair, might return for a visit if there was some glimmer of hope) (1=avoid at all costs)\n\nGo or No?  Go!!!   \n\nTease:   Top Chef Master Champion, Rick Moonen's seafood restaurant in Las Vegas.\n\nWhy I went:  Because Rick Moonen is known to be a darn good chef!  We were in Vegas, and this stop was a must for us.\n\nWhen:  11\/18\/13\n\nFood:  My wife and I ordered up!  We started with some cocktails.  My wife had a Down for the Count, which was very refreshing.  I had Coffee & Cigarettes (with Fernet Branca and Laphroaig Scotch I believe).  It could possibly be THE BEST COACKTAIL I'VE EVER HAD!  Not kidding!  You have to love bitter, intense drinks...but man was that delicious!!!  The mixologist has won a number of competitions, and it's no wonder!  I had one more cocktail after dinner called a Boulevardier, which I think was a take on a Negroni with Scotch.  Another home run by the barman!  To start the meal, my wife had an amazingly well prepared Caesar salad and I had a clam chowder that was out of this world!  It was just rich enough without being too much so.  The littleneck clams in the soup were fresh, plentiful and tasty!  My wife and I both got the Surf & Surf.  It is 3 big shrimps on a mushroom mix, and a  1\/2 lobster pouched on a truffle risotto.  We also added a  1\/2 lb. of king crab.  It was a shellfish spectacular!  Every item was cooked to perfection!  The shrimp has a nice snap, the lobster was simply ridiculous, and the crab was just plain darn good.  We also shared some garlic bread and Brussels sprouts to add to the fun!  The garlic bread soaked up the wonderful sauces, and the sprouts kept us honest with some vegetation!\n\nService:  Simply excellent.  Carlo did a fantastic job in explaining all the dishes and making recommendations after talking with us about our likes and dislikes.  He did equally well with the cocktails.  Anyone that gets Carlos will have one of the most attentive and cool waiters one could have.\n\nHints\/Final thoughts:  What's left to say?  If you like seafood and you're in Vegas; it would be a crime to pass up on RM Seafood.  Even if you were only to grab a cocktail and a snack...it's well worth it!  If you are up for a robust drink, ask for the Coffee & Cigarettes!
