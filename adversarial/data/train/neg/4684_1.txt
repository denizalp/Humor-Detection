After searching online for places to clean my wife's wedding dress, we decided on Grace's because of the great reviews online and the fact that they specialize in wedding gown cleaning. The experience and cleaning did not disappoint!\n\nWe went in for a consultation where Nadine took a look at the dress and explained the many stages of cleaning and what goes on behind the scenes. It took 8 weeks for my wife's dress to be cleaned (which we were informed of ahead of time). \n\nOverall, they seem like fantastic people and with their great service, I highly recommend them.
