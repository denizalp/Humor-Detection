This place is great! Was hesitant ordering from here and not a Lowes or Home Depot but decided since the prices were better and Staff was friendly. Jay and Brett have excellent customer service! Jay was really patient with me and all my questions and helped me figure out the exact things I needed for our project. \nI would say some items took a bit longer then they were supposed to but everything came in finally and correctly. \nAnytime we need anything like this I will make sure to give this place my business!
