I personally think you can find better roti in the city. The last time I was there I got the Jamaican pumpkin roti. I felt as though they didn't put enough filling in it and was all roti. The BBQ tofu dish is pretty good. I'm not sure where else you can get bbq tofu like that in the city hence why I am giving them a 3 stars.  If it wasn't for the BBQ tofu I think I'd give it a 2.5 it's not really because of the food but sometimes when I go in the i find the costumer service a bit poor. I also sat down and ate there rather then take it to go asked if I could have a cup of water and they told me they can't give out cups. . I also really didn't like that.  Would I go back there again, maybe it's defiantly not the first thing on my list...
