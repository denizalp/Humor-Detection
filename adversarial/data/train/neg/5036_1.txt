Walking in we notice the live music, great singer. The interiors were beautiful large chandeliers, fireplace, walls of wine.  Really romantic setting for me. We chose a bottle of Duckhorn Merlot really enjoyed it.  To my surprise the Canadian oysters were delicious!  He ordered surf and turf and I had the bone in ribeye. Ribeye is my favorite cut because of the marbling. I actually liked the flavor of the filet a lot better and texture was perfect.  The lobster was perfect and served with candle melted butter. Service from aerating the wine to never empty glasses, as soon as we ate the last bite of each course the plates were cleared and the next arrived. This dinner made it as one of my favorite dates!
