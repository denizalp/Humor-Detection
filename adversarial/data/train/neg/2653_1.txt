Food = awesome! Service was lacking, but this place has such a great  variety of Japanese food and sushi!!!! the food makes up for it. my friend and I shared one of their specials (fish cheek? that was huge!) and a specialty roll all for about $20... and we were stuffed! I thought this place is a must-go-back-and-bring-my-friends. (because service was not up to par, I only gave it 4-stars)
