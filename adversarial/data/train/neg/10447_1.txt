We were visiting from Vancouver and came here on a recommendation last Friday night.  We were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary so it was a special meal, and just the kind of place we wanted to eat at.  The general manager noticed the gift and card on the table and asked us what we were celebrating.  When we told her she comped us some drinks, which made an already amazing experience even better.\n\nThe food was amazing.  I had the fried chicken and my husband had the spicy italian sausage pizza.  We also ordered the beet and goat cheese salad.  Everything was perfectly cooked and fresh.  I can tell their chef has a fine dining background.  We also enjoyed some of their own beers which were quite good.  And they went out of their way to seat us at a nice table away from the area with kids, at my request.\n\nI would definitely come back here on my next visit to Toronto!
