Favourite place in Yorkville for window shopping. Go in, enjoy the dazzling magazine-quality interior, and don't bother checking the price tags on the lovely furniture. However they do have a collection of pretty and amusing accessories at relatively reasonable prices which makes it fun to gift-shop.
