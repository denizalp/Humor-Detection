Went here for dinner after finding it on Yelp (or course). The food was good. We got the pizza with the figs and arugula (sp?) on it and it was delicious. The owner was friendly but maybe a little too friendly. It's hard to eat when someone is trying to talk to you the whole time. We had 1 slice of the pizza left and asked for a box. He took it to box it up. Finally when we paid and were wanting to leave we asked for our box and it turns out the food got thrown out instead of boxed up. No big deal since it was just 1 slice but if it had been more we definitely would have asked for another pizza to replace it.
