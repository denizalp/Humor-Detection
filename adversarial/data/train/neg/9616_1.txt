Had a lunch and a breakfast there.  \n\nThe lunch was good.  We had the lobster Mac and cheese and the street tacos.  Both were good but would probably try something different next time.  With lunch, we had their version of the Moscow mule. It was good, so we had several.  Our service was good.  \n\nTheir breakfast was amazing (5 stars) . I had filet mignon eggs Benedict and my wife had the french toast.  We both loved both.  We won't change our order next time.  Loved it too much to try something different.  We had great service.
