Absolutely delicious and inexpensive brunch for two people. My boyfriend and I got the whole shebang with the eggs, bacon, sausage, home fries, toast and a  couple pancakes; not greasy at all. Amazing buttermilk pancakes, I would probably get a pancake breakfast next time with a side of bacon or sausage. Daaang.
