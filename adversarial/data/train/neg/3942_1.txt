Rating 2.5:  \n\nI  like the savings one gets when shopping at IKEA. However, customer service is lacking. They only had 4 cash registers open for checkout. There was probably over 50 people that needed to be checked out. They also need more People on the floor to help assist with locating items you can't seem to find. \n\nThe food here is good. You should check out the cafeteria for lunch or dinner. \n\nJust be prepared to waste a lot of time if you come to this IKEA location.
