The service here is mediocre. Maybe because I'm from Los Angeles this does not compare the the Cheesecake factory is California, the food is meh! I asked for a side of sun dried tomato and the server has no idea what I was talking about... Omg the pasta was so bland I couldn't believe this was the Cheesecake Factory.  It's pale in comparison to US location.
