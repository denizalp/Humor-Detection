First time coming here, tattoo artist was Eric Alvino. Let me just start off by saying this place is very clean and tidy, very friendly people off the start. Eric did an amazing job on the tattoo on my wife, we originally came in to both get tattooed but he did us a favor and didn't want to charge us the shop min for the little work I needed done as well. Man of integrity right off the start, he wasn't like the rest of the world and just wanted to take our money and be done with us. You can tell he cares deeply about his worth ethic and what he is gonna put on your body. He knows what he's doing will be a representation of his work. So when you go to this guy you are gonna get honest hard work. Because of that I will always come to this guy to get our tattoo work. Definitely not a standard shop where you can go and pick what you want off the walls or photo galleries lol. So whatever you want is going to be specifically drawn for you. I couldn't recommend this place enough! Make sure you ask for Eric!!
