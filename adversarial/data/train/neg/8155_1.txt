I really, really wanted to love this place but it left me wanting much more. I stopped in for breakfast and got a smoothie and a breakfast burrito - neither had much flavor. The smoothie was really somewhat tasteless which was odd because it had a handful of ingredients. Kind of like how la croix sort of tastes like fruit. The Southwest burrito was almost there but needed something to pull it altogether. The eggs were sitting around or microwaved (sort of tasted like liquid egg or powdered egg), but either way were not made to order. Healthy food can be incredibly flavorful but both of these items just missed the mark. Staff was friendly but they seemed a little distracted by the catering order they were working on - I was the only person in there and it took around 5 min before they even started on the smoothie.
