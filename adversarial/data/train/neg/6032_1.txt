Update:  This place is usually amazing.  Great fish and the BEST rings you will ever have - anywhere - by far, and they now have deep fried breaded mushrooms, and they have AMAZING tartar sauce, and dill dip too.  (Hey guys - how about adding some Shrimp sauce\/seafood sauce?)\n\nI changed my rating back to 5 from 4, because they are USUALLY great.  It's just too bad that on Friday and Saturday evenings they are too busy to cook their onion rings - because those take up way too much space in their busy deep fryer at those busy times.  And - sadly, they don't deliver the amazing onion rings - because they turn from the best you've ever tried - to soggy during the delivery trip from store to your home.  Shame.\n\nUpdating my review again:   I hate inconsistency.  And it bugs me that one time this place is GREAT - OUTSTANDING - and the next time the service and food is - meh.\n\nThe second last time I was there I was just blown away.  The onion rings were BY FAR the best I've ever had - anywhere.  They were AMAZING.  And the fish was great too.  Great batter.  Excellent.  About the best you can get - but, then, the last time I was there - things were not nearly as good.  My last visit found the batter (on rings AND fish) to be very thin - and disappointing.  (I asked the cook about this on my way out the door - and got a lame response: \"maybe the humidity in the air ....\")\n\nAnd the SERVICE!  I just have to vent a little.  I gave my order to the woman who seats people, and didn't see the waitress nearly enough for her to notice that I probably would have liked a refill on my water glass - that didn't come until I was finished my meal.\n\nI know I'm whining - like Trump whines like a 'whiny little #$%^' but don't you just hate it when the food is spectacular one time - and you go back and it's NOT the next time?\n\n\nPrevious review:\n\nI've been back a couple of times, and waited longer than I thought necessary for food again on one of those visits.\n\nThe first time I had the onion rings I was amazed.  They were the best I've every had - anywhere.  They were crispy on the outside and hot and moist on the inside.  Absolutely wonderful.\n\nUnfortunately - the second time I had rings they were not as good.  But they deliver them to your table on a unique stack piled like the tower of Pisa with a stainless steel rack that piles them high - but I immediately dump them into a smaller pile to TRY to keep them bunched together so they stay warm long enough to eat a few of them.  (Because - like most food - when they are no longer hot - they are no longer ANYWHERE CLOSE to being as good.)\n\nI tried the trout.  Didn't like it - but if you like trout it just might be good - I can't really say.\n\nTheir fish is among the best I've had compared to other places.\n\nAnd the food is fairly expensive.\n\nUpdate:  I went back again - and the waitress was helpful about the onion rings getting cold VERY quickly - and the Halibut was nice - but I STILL don't understand why it takes so long for them to prepare the food.  It seems to take them 15 to 20 minutes to drop a little fish in the fryer.  I just don't understand.  Still - great food.
