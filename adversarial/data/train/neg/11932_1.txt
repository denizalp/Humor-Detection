Stopped by this place with a few friends when I went home for Thanksgiving.  Our wait was about 20 minutes, which honestly for a Friday night wasn't too bad considering we had a large group.  I really liked the vibe of this place.  Very casual, but made me feel a bit classy at the same time.  I felt like there should've been a fireplace somewhere. \n\nThe menu had so many options -- mostly sandwiches\/burgers, but a good amount of salads and entrees as well.  Of course, coming back down to North Carolina for a few days, I had to give their Pulled Pork Plate a try.  They also have a BBQ sandwich, which I would have gotten if I didn't see the larger plate.  Sandwiches come with fries (which looked so good I had to snag one from a friend), while plates come with your choice of two sides.\n\nOur food came out relatively quickly, especially given the full house that night.  I took one look at that Pulled Pork Plate and knew I'd hit the jackpot.  A heaping pile of pulled pork, coupled with some garlic mashed potatoes, cole slaw, and baked beans -- classic Southern fare.  It was even topped with a large piece of garlic bread, to my surprise.  The presentation was on point, and the food was absolutely fantastic. \n\nI can't speak for any other items on the menu, but I would highly recommend that you give this BBQ plate a try if you're in the Charlotte area, but stuck closer to the suburbs\/SC.  Definitely the best I've had outside of the uptown area, and it probably even tops some of those places.  The best part?  $11 for all that food -- what a steal.\n\nIt's a real shame I only found out about this place after I left!  I'll definitely have to come back.
