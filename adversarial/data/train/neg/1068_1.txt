Came to Cleveland to see our Son and have a Sushi lunch. Found Mizu on Yelp and after reviewing the menu and ratings we decided to give them a try. They have a large menu and the \"Sunny\" roll was excellent as was the Unagi.  Overall, we had a good experience . Food was above average with good service. We'll definitely return the next time we're in town.
