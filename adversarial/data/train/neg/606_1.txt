Always first class work. These gents use old school practices. I've brought many pairs of high end shoes most of which have Goodyear construction. One of the few cobblers that uses upper tier JR leather soles and stitches them. It's a costly service but for anyone looking for impeccable work on $500 plus shoes they are amongst the best in the GTA. For simpler half sole and heel replacement expect the same workmanship for a very fair price. Also there's an excellent selection of shoe care products from many of the sought after European brands.....excellent work as expected. Thanks guys
