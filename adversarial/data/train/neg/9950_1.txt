I met my friend and ate at Honey Salt for the first time and was super excited to dine there.\n\nWhat a GREAT meal!!!!\n\nService was flawless...the server, did not get her name :-(, mad props though, was super friendly, able to answer any questions, and had a great sense of humor and definitely made my friend and I feel welcome.  The assistants were great about clearing plates, refilling drinks, etc...\n\nWe were there on a Sunday morning and she stressed getting breakfast items because it is the only day of the week they offer breakfast,\n\nMy friend and I started with sharing a bowl of fresh fruit and had a nice surprise of fresh mint that added a little extra to the flavors.  I enjoyed a great breakfast frittata with potatoes, tomatoes, and other vegetables.  It was hot and super delicious.  My friend had a buttermilk fried chicken sandwich which she could not put down!  I could see the juiciness of the sandwich and hear the crunch!  She really loved it!\n\nDespite being stuffed, we shared a giant caramel chocolate crunch slice of cake.  It was rich and delicious.\n\nDefinitely would go back to Honey Salt again!
