Interesting place to tour , for free.  Went on a Sunday to see the \"museum of toys\".  You see the purple couch as you enter, walk into a large building with dozens of cars, bikes and other interesting objects that you see on the show.\nGreat selection of things to see; gift shop area interesting to browse.  Prices for tshirts and other items are reasonably priced.\n\nTime well spent.  Not into \"fancy personalized\" cars for myself, but I can appreciate the work that goes into the masterpieces.
