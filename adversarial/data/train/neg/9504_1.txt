Had the tasty meaty crab cake in a bun and lobster grilled cheese. The lobster grilled cheese did not disappoint. There were many plump succulent lobster in  every bite. Both sandwiches came with chips ( made with real potatoes). Ordered oyster rockefeller to start with. The oysters were baked with cheese and spinach and they were pretty awesome.  The service was not too shabby either.
