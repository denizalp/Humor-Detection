So you think you had a great long island???  Well try them here.  They are cheap and not drowned out.  This is a perfect place to pre game for a night out, although not a place to go if your trying to have a conversation with your buddies.  The music is loud that make it hard to hear your friends.  It could be worth staying if you come early enough to get a pool table, but if you come to late then you end up waiting at times more then an hour to play pool.
