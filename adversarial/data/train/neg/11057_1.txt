After two amazing trips here, I'm happy to give a full 5 star review. Our food was always cooked perfectly, and out pretty quick. Most steak houses you order sides with your steak that you have no intention of eating cause, well, the sides usually suck. Not here. The mixed veggies are seasoned, buttered, and roasted. So is the asparagus. The rice is cilantro and has great flavor. French fries are some of the best restaurant fries around, and the chicken strips are hand breaded with very thin breading and a whole lot of chicken. \nEach time we've been greeted by a manager and our servers (Naomi the 2nd time) were attentive and fun. Can't forget the amazing half baked cookie. So good. We'll be back!
