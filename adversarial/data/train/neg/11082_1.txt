This place has a pretty nice vibe. It's kind of an upscale fast food taco shop. The ordering process was odd. This line for this and this line for that. Definitely not fast food taco prices. We had 2 bowls and 2 fountain drinks and it came to just under $30\n\nI had a chicken bowl. The chicken was good but overall the food lacked flavor. You definitely have to add some from the salsa bar which had tons of options to choose from. \n\nIt was very clean and the staff was friendly. They have a ton of seating downstairs and upstairs. I went early in the day during the week so it wasn't very busy. \n\nI noticed you could order adult beverages at their bar which would be awesome if I was going for dinner.
