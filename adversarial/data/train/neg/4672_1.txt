Came on Nuit Blanche night. Food was decent and for a Yorkville location the price is quite low, so value is there... if you do not get a waitress who simply does not care.\n\nThe food were simple dishes, but they were done well. However, the waitress had a lack of smile all night, and simply grabbed the wine\/dessert menu from my hands while I was holding it and asking a question about items on said menu. Her attitude was questionable, and I wondered if she cared about her tips at all.\n\nWhen the bill came, all my questions were answered. She automatically applied a 20% gratuity to our party of 4 (I thought 15-18% was standard, if it was applied automatically at all); no wonder she did not care about serving our table properly. Our party did not feel like arguing what amounts to a rather trivial sum of money, but it certainly did leave a sour taste.\n\nIf you do eat here, pray you have a better waiter\/waitress.
