A group of us went to celebrate a friend's birthday and had a great time! We were given easy to follow instructions yet still encouraged to add our own flair to our paintings. Anthony is friendly and funny and at the end he even showed us what some of the paintings looked like framed - though everybody's piece was unique and beautiful, they looked AMAZING with frames around them! I purchased a voucher to go back and plan on going regularly!
