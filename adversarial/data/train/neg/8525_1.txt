Food and service are great.  Wide variety of pizza, salads, and pasta.  My favorite pizza is Fran's Favorite.  The wings are great too.  I also recommend the Greek salad.  It's a little on the pricey side, a few drinks and a  pizza  will run you about $40 for two.  But I do love the great food, ambiance and friendly service.
