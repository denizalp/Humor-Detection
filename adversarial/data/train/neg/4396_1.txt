At first I was nervous about changing up my hair after 3 years of growing out my damaged hair. I used to be the girl that gets her hair done because I would get bored easily, but then I started experiencing my hair getting thinner And it would shed like no tomorrow. So, I told myself enough is enough! No more heat, no more bleach no more products and my hair became very healthy after 3 long years.\n\nSince I was getting married this year, i wanted to look different for my engagement pictures so I decided to get on the ashy balayage train! My friend had recommended Lisa's hair studio and after visiting the first time, I had a great experience. Jessica was the one who made my hair a dream! She really explained everything and she even trimmed my hair to give me beautiful face framing pieces which complimented the colour! She took her time and she reassured me how it would exactly look like. The owner Lisa was very kind and accommodating by making sure all her clients were not bored and perfectly comfortable and I appreciate that! \n\nApril, the lovely lady with the pink hair finished my hair off by giving my hair a thorough wash and massage, blow dried, and gave my hair the softest curls! I came out of there feeling so good! \n\nI already booked my next appointment going back to get my hair done right before my wedding!
