This is my second visit. I enjoyed it as much as the first. Traditional Italian food the way I like it!  We had a very good dinner the first time, just stopped for pizza today. The food was good and there was plenty of it for everyone. We all brought something home. It is good for children too, enough choices for the little ones and plenty for adults as well.
