Great songs and great show. its my 9th or 10th show frm Cirque de soleil and it was another great one. There is a lot going on, so you dont want to sit too near to the happening, try to get tickets somewhere on row o or p, from there you can see everything without missing out on too much.\nSo much better than Michael Jackson One, which was the worst show from Cirque de soleil and I visited 2 days ago.....
