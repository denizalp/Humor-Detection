This is the second time in a week that I walk into a UMC quick care with my daughter. Because of our experience with the first visit, I decided to give it a go. We usually are able to get in with her pediatrician but of lately they are overbooked. We usually end up at Southwest medical urgent care but after a 5 hour or so wait, they usually send us home and tell us to let it run its course. Well yesterday, my daughter was not able to hold anything down and she was pale as a white pice of paper. And I knew she needed to be seen. They took us back after only 5 mins of paperwork and took her vitals and took us directly to a room, where the nurse stayed with her while I ran to my car to get a list of medications she cannot take. While I was gone, for what seemed 2 mins. My daughter managed to vomit in front of the nurse and lucky for everyone she was prepared with a bag. Then, a few minutes later the Doctor came in and stated ordering test and medications. Long story short my daughters blood pressure dropped and was dizzy and weak and decided to give her IV fluids. My daughter was able to hold down some liquids and then finally send us home. I walked in with a pale, weak and almost lethargic child and walked out with a somewhat smiling child that had color on her lips and cheeks. When we got home she said she was hungry and gave her apple sauce and a few crackers. Yes, she's doing so much better. I will never step foot in any other urgent care. The nurses here are sweet and explained everything to my daughter of what each procedure entailed. We are very happy with the service we received. And my daughter is almost back to her normal self.
