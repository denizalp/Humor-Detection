This is one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had. After a 45 minute wait to speak to someone about an upgrade, I then waited 3.5 hours for them to complete my transaction.  The sales agent had no idea what he was doing nor could he explain the feature differences between two phones. When he could not resolve my upgrade issue we  enlisted the help of the manager.  He unfortunately was unaware of very important company procedure changes that happens over a year ago.  I was either misinformed or bold face lied to.. Either way unacceptable! \n\n Fast forward to my next bill I received... They changed my plan without informing me and increased my bill significantly. \n\n\nPlease do not waste your time or money at this location.
