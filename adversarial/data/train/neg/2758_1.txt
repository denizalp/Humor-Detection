Met a friend who lives in the area and had never heard of this place nor had I ever been to a restaurant or sushi place with a conveyor belt. \nThe sushi is perhaps not world famous quality but I had no issues with it, and I can't say I'm a sushi snob just a sushi lover. \nI don't know how often I'll be coming here because it's far from my house but definitely a different experience that I'd do again.  Much like Katie V. suggested it's fun to be able to visualize your sushi and pick and choose and see the plates just piling up. For some you get to feel like a competitive sushi eater...well maybe not but you know what I mean.\nThe service is maybe lacking but if you like to try a little variation on your typical sushi meal this is definitely worth trying.
