Don't, Don't, Don't Go Here! Especially an 1 1\/2 hours before they close! It's one thing to be a rude Doctor but.....They took our $150.00 dollars, did an EKG, then said they couldn't do anything more because they were closing and to just go to the hospital! Why didn't they just tell us that when we got there...Guess we looked like easy money I suppose. Went to another one and received the care we should have received from this one!
