I'm not sure what all the hype is about.  It was good, but I was expecting amazing.  The brisket biscuits were good, same with the Lewellyn's chicken.  The BBQ chicken was dry.  The drinks were also good but it was so busy I ordered the second drink before I finished my first.  The waiter came back surprisingly fast with the second drink and took my first drink away with a little bit still in the bottom of the glass.  For a $10 drink, I'd like to finish it.  That's a no-no in my book.  It would've been proper to ask if I was finished first.  I used \"good\" a lot in this review.  That's what it was.  Not bad, not amazing.  In the middle, but highly overpriced.  3 drinks, 1 biscuit appetizer, 2 chicken meals came to almost $140 after a 20% tip.
