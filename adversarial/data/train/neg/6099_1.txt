Green Mango was a Regent Square institution, which left some big shoes to fill, but Thai Cottage fills the void and delivers all of the hits with quality to boot. Before you devour your favorite dish, peruse the appetizers. The obvious favs are the crispy spring rolls, chicken satay and samosas, but you can't go wrong with Cottage Combo I or II -- something for everybody! The curry options include seasonal variations, but ye olde standby order is usually the pineapple tofu, yellow, or massaman. The standard 1-10 \"how spicy?\" scale is nothing to be scared of, so go big or go home. If you got noodles on the brain, then the classic pad thai or see ew always hits the mark.
