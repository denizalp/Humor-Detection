Wish I had read the reviews first! Car seems cheap, but there are a TON of hidden fees. \"concession recovery fee\" of 11%!! Kiosk fee, \"maintenance\" fee, \"energy recovery fee\", plus outrageous gas fees. They charged for gas, even though the tank was on full, because I hadn't filled it up to the top a mile away from them I guess. \n\nAfter all the fees and charges the rental cost MORE THAN DOUBLE what the quoted price was, and they didn't give a receipt showing all this garbage until I demanded it AFTER they charged my card. \n\nNEVER AGAIN. Go with someone reputable like Enterprise or Budget.  You definitely will not \"pay less\" with this company!
