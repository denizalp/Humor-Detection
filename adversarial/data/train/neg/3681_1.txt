I just renewed my CPR certification through Heartsavers this past Saturday at the Greenway\/26th St location. I am a Licensed and Nationally Certified Therapeutic Massage Therapist. This is the third time I have done my CPR class with Heartsavers, and Mike Camden was the instructor. THIS WAS THE BEST CLASS EVER!!! The instructors in the past were good, but goofed around a lot while teaching. Mike, on the other hand, was extremely thorough and knowledgeable.  The only time he wasn't talking was during our break. And when it came time for us to do our hands-on on the mannequins and babies, Mike was right there and diligently watching to make sure each of us understood what we were doing and that we were performing the CPR, rescue breathing and choking properly. The three hours just flew by!!! Thank you, Mike, for your knowledge and teaching skills!!! I hope that when I have to renew my CPR certification again in two years, I will be fortunate enough to have you as my instructor!!!
