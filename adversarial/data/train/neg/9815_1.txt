I Was really impressed with the service and the food. Papaya salad... Yes please. I took an extra order home with me. Their coconut ice cream was amazing too!\nParking was a little shady, however that's what DT phoenix offers for parking. greeted with a smile at the door and everything was very organized. I'll be back!
