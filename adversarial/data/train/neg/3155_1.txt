Well. It's definitely a place that should be quick and on the go unless the staff member doesn't want to do her job which seemed to be the case in our situation.\n\nI bought 4 bottles of water for $21 so if you're looking for cheap don't come here. Find a water fountain or wait for complimentary drinks on your flight.
