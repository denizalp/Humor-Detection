I've been in for dinner a few times and definitely will keep coming back for the Local Vegetarian Burger.  As a vegetarian, it's always a treat to see that someone has crafted a unique and tasty item as their veg option.  Their burger is 'home made' and  uses tofu and black beans as a protein.  The rest I think is potato and onion but I am not sure.  Anyway, it holds together well, it's filling, and goes down well with a beverage.
