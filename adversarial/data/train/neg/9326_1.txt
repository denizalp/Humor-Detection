Just got off the plane and needed some food. Yelped and found Aladdin's Eatery. Loved that their menu indicated allergens so no need to ask your server \"does this have nuts\"? Husband ordered the Aladdin's favorite and I got Jasmine's favorite - mine was ok, so once I tried Aladdin's favorite I was loving his plate more than mine. Love that my hubby switched plates :) Good food, big portions and decent prices.
