We came here as it was near the place we stayed. It was ok, there were not any other customers in there which wasn't the best sign.  We had a few different donuts, the apple, the fig and the chocolate. They were ok. We also had a meringue.  \n\nThe breads looked great, but we didn't eat a ton.  It does look great inside, the pastries do all look amazing.
