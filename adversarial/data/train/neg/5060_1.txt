Ok so it's a sports bar pub with the bar segregated from the restaurant. It's a Bronco fan favorate and has more than a enough large screen HD tv's. Service is good and attentive. On the app menu we tried the sweet chili habenaro wings\n (6)for $7 and (12) for $13. They are crispy on the outside and juicy inside = perfect! The duck fat fries weren't my favorite but the regular frys were decent. The Angus burger was med rare and I asked for med. Didn't much care for the  pre formend bacon on it. The sriacha chicken sandwich \nwas superb, light and crunchy and a very decent breast. Very clean and comfortable\natmosphere and overall a good experience. We will ne back. Go Broncos!
