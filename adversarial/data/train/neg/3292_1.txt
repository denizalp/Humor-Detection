I would agree with Jim M.  A 1 star is not low enough for Carey Moving and Storage.  Along with Allied, they were horrible to deal with.  My belongings arrived at their destination destroyed, cracked, broken and they packed us.  This was a turn key corporate move.  Working with Carey and then Allied for the damage claim was a nightmare.  I have the pictures, emails and videos to back my claims up.  Do not use these people and I would not suggest them to my worst enemy.  Their attitudes, lack of professionalism, talking down to you, what a nightmare.  Please be warned.
