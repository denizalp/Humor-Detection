Went here last night for my fiancé's birthday.   Our server, Erik, was great! The food was delicious (especially the Flemings potatoes and carrot cake)! My fiancé said it was the best dining experience he's ever had. Erik made us feel like VIPs with complimentary chocolates and $25 gift card to return...and even the manager stopped by to see how we were doing. The complimentary bread is really good too! Sure, it's a little pricey but totally worth it! Thank you Flemings!
