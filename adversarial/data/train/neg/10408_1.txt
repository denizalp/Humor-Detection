Awesome restaurant!  They even created a special \"Happy Anniversary\" flyer custom-made with our names and they inserted it into the dinner menu. Before we left, they removed both flyers and wrapped it up for us to take home as souvenirs. What a nice, personal touch. Food was fantastic (of course) and service very good too. Chocolate souffle was so rich and creamy. Oh, and they also gave us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary too, with chocolate words that said \"Happy Anniversary\" with our names on the plate of dessert. Beautiful touch!
