This place is AMAZING! Anyone with challanged credit should stop here before you try anywhere else. I have been shopping for a month and these guys are by far the best. most places tries to get me at 24% intrest. These guys highest rate is 18%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nLittle bit about myself....\n32 year old female with a 530 credit score. \nvegas residence of 2 years. I work part time as a poker dealer. Proving my tips was a little difficult but they made it work. \nI personally worked with Sean And Anthony ( ask for either one of them) \nThey were able to get me approved within an hour. Not only did they work with me on my down paymet, I got it cut into two payments $700 and $300 next pay period ( two week from today). They had 100's of cars to pick from in my price range.\nAnd they helped with finding good cheap insuance. \nThey are all so their own bank, so my credit wasnt ran more than once. \nthey had many options if you are looking for a 2 year 4 year 6 year payment program . \nPlan to spend at least 4 hours for paper work and finding the vhical that is right for you. \nBest part of this experience\n*Sean got me started, very pacient and understanding to my financial situtation. NO JUDGMENT AT ALL about my challenged credit! \n*Anthony helped my find a vehical that would fit my needs, and me personally. He even talked to the insurance company on my behalf to help me get a better rate ( witch he did not have to do)!\nThese guys all so seem to have a great knowlage about cars , what brands are good, miles, tiers... ect. \n*ANY QUESTIONS THAT I HAD THEY HAD THE ANSWERS! \n\nIF THIS REVIEW GETS YOU INTO A CAR, PLEASE TELL THEM THAT KRISTINA MOHALLA SENT YOU. MY FRIEND REFERED MY AND SHE GOT $200 JUST FOR RECOMENDING THEM! \nGOOD LUCK WITH YOUR NEW CAR, I HOPE THS IS HELPFULL! \n\nAGAIN....\nANTHONY AND SEAN ARE YOUR GUYS! \n\n.....OH ONE MORE THING... THEY ASKED TO TAKE A PICTURE FOR THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA !  YOU CAN FIND ME ON THEIR WITH MY NEW CAR!
