Love chilis,I think it's better than applebees. But this was the first time I've been to this location I see the food they have improved on and I love the new menu items but.... I was not pleased at all with service maybe our waiter was tired or overwhelmed,but I don't see anything to be overwhelmed about.. he only had us (my fam,just my boyfriend and daughter) and another couple that was sitting behind us. He was only serving two parties... \nLater one more people came and that's when it got even worse. We waited 15mins to get our drinks refilled and I noticed that he was paying more attention to the other people dining in the area than he was with us maybe he was racial profiling? As we are Asian and everyone else is white. But oh well, just serve your diners right! It took us another 20mins to finally get our check then my bf decided to just let us wait in the car... For another 20mins which felt like forever I thought my bf was in the bathroom lol. But goes to find out that he waited a long period of time just for a check and to go boxes because it wasn't worth waiting to eat the rest of our food when we weren't getting the right amount of attention our waiter shouldve been giving us.. he didn't even apologize or say anything...  Just do your job right even when you're tired or just whatever is wrong with you and you wouldn't have been given a 50CENT tip. (Better than nothing)
