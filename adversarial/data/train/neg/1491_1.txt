This place is A-ok for a AYCE Korean BBQ. went here because of all the great reviews and 4-star. Place had lots of choices in meats, and side dishes. Love how they have two different kinds of bean sprouts to try. They also had some hot foods that you can find in a buffet (mussells with mayo, potstickers etc). Went here on a sunday night,  they were pretty slow, but did get busy after 20 mins. Meat quality was good. Not a fan of the pork belly i've had better. service was a hit and miss. they did refill our drinks after we asked. but had to flag them down to change our grill. overall it was ok.
