I drove to Tuffy Auto Center on Friday, July 25, 2014, and had brakes and tire problems.  It was my first visit there, and I was slightly reluctant to be there.  However, I had been to a dealership beforehand and was not satisfied with the care given to me.  The service advisor was not interested in my car problems and seemed to be more involved with talking to people on the telephone.  I waited too long and then decided to leave.  So my neighbor recommended Tuffy Auto Center at Rocky River Road to me.  I realized at the start that the service advisor was direct and seemed to know his auto business.  Sure enough after an hour's wait my brakes were adjusted, and my tires were inflated properly.  I thought that I needed new tires.  After an honest and thorough job, I will return to Tuffy Auto Centeer and will recommend others to do the same.\nNina G. of Charlotte, North Carolina
