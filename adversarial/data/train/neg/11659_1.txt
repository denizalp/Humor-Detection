I am not a fan of giving negative reviews without giving the mgmt\/owner a chance to correct an experience.\nWe notified the manager of our experience via email and in written letter form.  We did not receive a response from the manager or owner.  I completely understand the complexities of operating a restaurant and I'm disappointed.  \n\nBack story:  our 12 year old son specifically chose this restaurant to take his grandfather.  He placed his order and received something else.  He told the waitress this isn't what he ordered. She said if you want something else you'll have to pay for both.  Unbelievable!  We know for a fact he didn't order what was served (he doesn't like chocolate chip pancakes). He didn't bring enough money to pay for 3 meals and therefore he had to settle for something he didn't order.  Shocking!!!\n\nSo very very disappointed in this level of service and management's lack of response.
