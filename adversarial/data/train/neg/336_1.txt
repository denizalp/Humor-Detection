My cousin referred me to this place, and Im glad I listened. Overall, The biggest part of my rating was the quality of the food; It was amazing! I was in a moral dilemma between the brisket and the pork. I tried the pulled pork burger and it did not let me down! It was probably one of the best things I ate while in Vegas. The service was decent. There was a large table next to me and our server spent a it of time checking on them. It would've been nice to get refills on water from time to time. However, He hustled hard and the girl that bussed the tables really moved! I wish I knew her name so I could include it in my review. They seemed to work well together! I left a big tip in the hopes that it would find her pocket! Overall great job. I will return and refer.. Chris from Hawaii
