I just ate at Pit Stop restaurant. It has a quaint, welcoming interior, combined with friendly staff and good food, which ultimately lead to a great dining experience.\n\nmozzarella sticks 8\/10\nthey were flavorful and not overly greasy, just overall very good and enjoyable. \n\n\"pit burger\" + bacon & cheese 9\/10\nthis burger was exceptionally good. I especially liked the smoky flavor that I assume either came along with the way they cooked the burger or the bacon that was on the burger. \n\nfries 10\/10\nto be honest the best part of this meal was the fries. they were crispy and seasoned perfectly and I very much enjoyed them\n\noverall I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone passing through Boulder city, or anyone who lives in the area. it's a good place to get a good meal for a reasonable price.
