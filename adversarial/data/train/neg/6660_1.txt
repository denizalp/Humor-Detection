I had an order of the bun bo hue. The flavour was good but was not too authentic. The pig foot consisted more of meat rather than the juicy skin and tendon but was not a bad thing either. There was a shortage of noodles and meat and was not worth the bang for the buck. If you decide to order this dish, there is a 10 minute wait (which they state). The portion was weak and it costed me about $10 for a bowl.\n\nThe service was medicare. The servers would greet you and ask politely for what you would want but it took a while to get a server's attention because he was on his phone. Maybe because I came in an hour before closing and they were on shut down mode.\n\nIt's a friendly and warm environment. Everything was quite sanitary.
