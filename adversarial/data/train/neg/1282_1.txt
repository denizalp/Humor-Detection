The ENTIRE Olmstead Team has been so incredible to work with.  We have had the pleasure of knowing the Olmstead's for many years but through this process we also got to know & work with Laura, Mark & Tenisha.  Each and every person on their team is professional, personable, extremely knowledgeable about the industry and such a joy to work with! They make themselves available for you and are quick to answer each and every question you have.  Laura's negotiation skills and expertise helped us get our dream home even with us not being the highest offer.  She knew just what to do and it spoke to the heart of the seller.  Mark knows all the in's and out's of this industry and has so much knowledge about everything!! Tenisha is so detailed oriented and provides all the valuable and important information that you need. What could have been a stressful time with all the paperwork, phone calls, emails, etc. was really not stressful at all.  The Olmstead Team made this whole process so easy and was unlike anything we have ever experienced before. We would give our highest recommendation to anyone looking to buy or sell their home. You will be so pleased with how well they take care of their clients from start to finish!
