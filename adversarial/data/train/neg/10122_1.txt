I really enjoyed my introductory class at AerialCLT. It's conveniently located in uptown Charlotte and the space inside is very spacious , and visually appealing. The instructor team was very friendly and supportive, making sure to give key information before we tried different poses with the 'silks'. As far as exercise is concerned , this is definitely something you can count as physical activity. After about 45 minutes of activity, I could feel a slightly warm (not a burn, but this was also my 1st class). I enjoyed this experience enough to buy a class pass and try some more Aerial yoga. I highly recommend you do as well.
