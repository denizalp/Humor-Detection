Stumbled across their flawless Instagram account earlier in the day, and I just had to drag my friend with me to get our nails done!  They met all of my expectations on all fronts; we were even offered a $5 coupon as one of us had to wait either 5 and 20 minutes, which sweetened the experience.  We both opted for a shellac manicure, the $20 price also covers a removal of a previous shellac.  \n\nThe service went off without a hitch for both of us.  My nail technician, didn't catch her name, was very meticulous throughout.  She made sure to examine my nails from different angle after coating each one coat, and again before and after I let my nails cure.  In the end, the total came to $15 - thanks to that coupon.\n\nOverall, both my friend and I, had a great time.  I was also very impressed by their nail design examples as they seem very on trend with current Japanese, Korean, and Western styles.  (Glass, marbleized, and negative space, to name a few.)  They also provide an eyelash extension service that I'm very eager to try eventually.\n\nThank you for the amazing service WonderNails!  Can't wait to come back to get my nails done again!  :)
