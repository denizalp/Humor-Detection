This place use to be a sushi place and it was good . But hey it's ramen now so we'll give it a try. We came in on a Thursday around 740p for a party of 4 and already there's a 30mins wait. The area isn't that big so I get it. We did get seated in 20mins but took the server 10mins before she even came and took our order. \n\nI'm definitely not happy with the service, very slow took forever to get appetizers! A second server came to check on us finally but to tell us our ticket was dropped, but it's been put in now, omg this is crazy we literally sat here for 40mins before they even came to notify us or even check on us. \n\nDon't get me wrong the server was nice but I think if they would of checked on us they would of notice we sat here for now 49mins before our appetizer even got to the table. 20mins later no food and every one that came in after us already got their food, I would think if our ticket was dropped you would push our order up before the people that came in after us but instead they did their order first. The booth behind us even ordered a second round of appetizer and got it before we got our food. \n\nThe cook and almost every server did come apologize for the wait but then I don't understand even after they found out we been waiting why did we wait even longer while everyone around us got their food. They gave us 20% off our bill which was cool but again they missed our order but didn't push it up. \n\n2hrs later we are leaving the restaurant. Yes we did get our food and honestly it was good no complaints for that I will give 3 stars but because of the wait it just ruined our appetite.
