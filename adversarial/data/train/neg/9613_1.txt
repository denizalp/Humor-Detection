Tony was fantastic! We had such a blast! This is the nicest escape room I've done so far in Arizona and I've tried three different ones all around the valley. I will definitely come back and try another room. The staff really gets into character and the building is pristine and looks almost brand new. The staff is fun and really made the entire experience extremely enjoyable. Great for families, date night or team building work functions.
