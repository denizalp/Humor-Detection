Absolutely incredible food in an unlikely spot. \n\nWalk through the church's back door, head down the steps, and then make a beeline to the little order window in the back. \n\nIt's worth a little wandering for the best doubles ever. Savory and spicy, sweet and sour, all the best things in life smashed together in tender little baras (fried pancakes) with crispy edges and tamarind chutney. Just unbelievably good. The roti was wonderful too, but I would probably double down on doubles in the future. Vegans, rejoice! This is easily one of the best veg meals in Toronto, both quick and affordable. It's especially appreciated given the lack of good options in the neighborhood. \n\nThe proprietor is lovely, and made us feel right at home. I can't wait to enjoy more of her food!
