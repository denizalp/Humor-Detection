Overall, the experience was good. The nachitos were ordered as the appetizer and I loved how the salsa and sour cream was served in little tortilla bowls! I had the West Coast Veggie Burger and my partner had the Smokehouse Deluxe Burger. My partner actually said that the burger was better than The Works! Both burgers came with fries that were crispy and cut thinly. \n\nDefinitely a nice place to go with friends!
