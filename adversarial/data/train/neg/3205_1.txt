This is delicious New York Styled Chinese take-out.  The food has excellent flavor and the dishes are inexpensive and loaded with veggies. \n\nMy husband and I spent 3 years looking for a New York style Chinese restaurant. We had so many disappointing meals all over the valley.  Then we found this place, in our neighborhood! It was so wonderful.\n\nThis is not a place to sit and eat unless you're looking for a fast meal. It's a great take-out place, I can't recommend it highly enough. \n\nThe owners are very friendly - go there a few times and they'll remember you.
