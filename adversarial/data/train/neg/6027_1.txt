I love ordering delivery or take out from this place.  Super fast, inexpensive, delicious, and you get a lot of food for what you pay!\n\nThis is the only local place I've found to offer honey walnut shrimp, which I fell in love with at a hole-in-the-wall place in SF Chinatown many years ago. It's a large serving, and doesn't reheat well, but OMG its so freakin' good!\n\nThe only thing I've tried and didn't like was the chop suey - it just wasn't what I expected.  It had a lot of sauce and not many crunchy vegetables.  It tasted good, it just wasn't what I wanted at the time.\n\nThe dining room is small, and I've only seen people sitting down eating in there once (while I was waiting for my take out). I'd recommend trying them out.
