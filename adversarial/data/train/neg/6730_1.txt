Amazing!! Worth the time trying to find this place in Mandalay Bay. We didn't have reservations so we say at the bar but the ambience was just as amazing. We went on a Sunday to try their famous brunch and it is one worth the hype. Make sure you go with a totally empty stomach so you can savor all of those dishes. The chicken and waffle, the biscuit and gravy and the seasonal fruit plate were or favorites, but everything else was nice too. They were also serving complementary steak tacos tapas switch was delish.
