Came here to try the infamous mac and cheese burger. We ordered triple T fries for the appetizer. Both did not disappoint at all. The burger was shared between two people because it seemed really big. One of the most popular restaurants in Vegas, this is a place you must check out one time! The burger and fries were very greasy but very good! Honestly the fries were so large that this appetizer should be for 4-5 people! Insane portion size!!!! Waiters were very nice and attentive. Offered water and did not need to ask. Now that's excellent customer service! Guy fieri, you always amaze me!
