On November 17 my grandmother fell ill and we visited Mountain View. She struggles with bowel obstructions and was in a lot of pain. The blond nurse at the front was no help at all and even went as far to roll her eyes at a 74 year old woman's groans of pain. We arrived at the hospital around 8 and were not helped until 12. At which point my grandmother had already passed out and had to be placed in a wheel chair. Her hands were clammy, she had cold sweats, and her skin was grey. By the time Dr. Albacord saw my grandmother she was in to much pain to be very responsive. I told him what I knew. She has Chrons. She often struggles with bowel obstructions and the symptoms she was experiencing were similar to what we've witnessed before. He disregarded what I said. He sent her to a bed and had nurses care for her. He wanted to give her a CT scan, but as she's super sensitive to iodine she couldn't have one. He sent someone on two occasions to try to MAKE her get the CT scan. He didn't visit her room until 3 am and then he released her stating he didn't know what was wrong. \n\nSo tonight my grandmother has been in pain all day today, on November 18, she has been admitted into St. Rose hospital on Eastern. They told her she has a slight Obstruction of the bowel (hey what do you know)\n\nI believe that if  Dr. Albacord does not have compassion and does not wish to do his job he should probably pursue a career in another field.
