I highly suggest Dr Evens and his great team!\n\nLocated on Tropicana beside black bear diner, in the Smith's shopping center\n\nNo more silver in my mouth which is beautiful and much more healthy. \n\nThey have good rates but most important is the 5 star care you receive. They're thorough at answering questions and making you feel comfortable. Very skillful and knowledgeable and all around great office. \n\nHave been many times and will be back. \n\nThanks Spring Valley Dentist Office!
