The food was great, basically the standard that you'd come to expect from a Cora's location, but the service was terrible that I won't consider coming back. We came on a Sunday for brunch and I guess this is when they are the busiest, because even though we arrived at 10:30am it still took us 30 minutes of waiting for get a seat for 2. \n\nWe were greeted by a server, but then she sort of just disappeared that we had to get somebody else to come look for her so she'd take our orders. I ordered the Egg Benedict on English muffin and the portion was great. Really large serving and super delicious eggs with loads of veggies arranged perfectly for photo taking...though it still took them like 20 minutes to serve the food. When it came to getting the bill it was hell trying to look for our server again. Btw she didn't come check on us once during our meal and it was somebody else coming over to refill our drinks. Apparently only the server assigned to our table can ring in the bill for us so it was once again more waiting for our server to show up. I'm pretty sure half of the time we spent at the restaurant was just waiting for the server and our food to come. \n\nI understand it's challenging to work during a busy time, but the manager should have known that Sunday brunch is their peak hours and they should hire more servers to fill this shift. Or, I don't know, just make it like an Asian restaurant so that you can call on any server walking by to fill your order to make it more efficient and customer friendly.
