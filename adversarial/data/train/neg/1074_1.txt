I've had pretty good experience here and I've been to the other locations also.The dishes, the service and atmosphere seems to be consistent. The place is always clean and the walls are decorated with art by local artists.\nMy favorites in the menu are the the falafel platter, lentil fattoush salad, grilled portabello mushroom burger and pepper hummus.  The veggie wraps and lavosh pizza are also good choices plus the portions are huge!\nI'm so glad they are opening a new location in downtown phoenix. (Next to Lola's Coffee house)  It's refreshing to have a healthy restaurant within walking distance to my humble abode. :)
