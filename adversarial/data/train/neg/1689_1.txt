This place does really really good sandwiches and salads, and it's super cheap to boot!\n\nA small sandwich and a large salad is probably more than enough for most people, and costs less than $7. Their egg rolls are home-made, and are a good fast (but not too unhealthy) option. The large sandwiches are 2x the small ones, and are more than enough to fill me at lunch time.\n\nThis place can get pretty busy around lunch time, so try to come just before\/after if possible. Even if you come at peak hour the service is good, so you won't be waiting too long. You can get some sandwiches\/other lunch options from the fridge (if you're in a rush), but I like mine freshly made.\n\nMy favourite is their salami sandwich, but they have a lot of other toppings to choose from (including vego options), and you can make your own. \n\nThey also have a range of sweets (chocolate muffins, banana bread, etc) which I think are mostly from Costco, but I still buy them regularly ('cause they're good).
