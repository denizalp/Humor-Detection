Salon is clean and neat, but my fave operator left so had Kim.  Kim seems to not understand if you don't want the bottoms of feet scrubbed hard.  Plus, the polish lasted 2.5 weeks before big chips came out of the nail itself--on one big toe and one smaller toe--probably cause they were not cut short enough (I have not had this happen ever before there).  Also, the big toes are unequal size in length due to not clipping them the same.  Enough errors that I am moving on...sorry, Modern Nails, cause I really did like your salon....just not this operator.
