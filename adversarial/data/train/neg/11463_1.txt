Best fish and chips I've found in Arizona!!! Perfectly dry and crispy on the outside and hot and moist on the inside! \nService was great. Garlic fries were a bit rich for me, but everyone else at the table liked em. \nMy daughter liked the kids pizza. \nDefinitely will go back next time I'm hungry for fish and chips!
