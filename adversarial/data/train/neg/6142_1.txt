Ok, I know that all Vegas casinos (at least most of them) are enormous, but The Venetian kills me every time. I have a pretty good sense of direction, but every time I'm in this hotel\/casino I get lost. \n\nPerhaps its due to all of the beautiful scenery, but I feel like each and every time I find an entirely new section which blows me away. \n\nMaybe I just need to spend more time here to find my bearings.
