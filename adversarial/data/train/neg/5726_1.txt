Went in today and was greeted by one of the workers. Great customer service. Told him I wanted to sample some flavors and what kind I usually enjoy. They had a mod for me to use and brand new disposable drip tips ready to go as well. The tester tanks are not cheap either! Tried quite a few flavors and honestly can say though they weren't all for me, not a single one was bad. Ended up deciding on Icy Blue Razz and CTC (Cinnamon toast crunch). Both are great. Only 38 for 240mls of juice? It's a steal. Only thing I have noticed is the juice seems to be a little thin to be an 80 VG blend, though it doesn't taste harsh like it has a lot of PG either, so this may be due to something else in the juice, truly not sure but doesn't seem to be a problem yet. You can also order in advance for higher VG ratio juice. I may try this in the future.  I'm going to be coming more often to try some more juice. Ill keep this review updated as time goes. Also the inside of this place is awesome as well. Clean and HUGE. Well staffed. \nOne last note if you do stop in here leave a review! They need more.
