Definitely a neat spot. Look for the half beer can establishment, which houses a bunch of local artists. Bump elbows with the locals and pound some good brew. Outdoor and indoor seating. If you're hungry there's plenty of nearby options within walking distance, which walking is all you should be doing after drinking one of their high octane beverages!\nDog friendly.
