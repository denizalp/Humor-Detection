I had dinner at the Bellagio Buffet last night.  Although the line to get in was long and time consuming, the food was worth the wait!  Once sat, I was greeted promptly by a server and provide with a drink.   I started with the seafood section and the crab legs were delicious.   Next I hit the Asian and BBQ sections of the buffet.   Both had many different options.   Service was great and the good was second to none.   If your in the mood for a superior vegas buffet, I strongly suggest Bellagio Buffet!
