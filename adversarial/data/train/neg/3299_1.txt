She really understands curly hair and did an amazing job at fixing my weirdly shaped hair! I hadn't had a haircut in two years and had some parts of my hair longer than others and a weird looking thing going on with that back of my hair and she evened everything out and made my hair healthy again while trying to keep my hair the length I was looking for!
