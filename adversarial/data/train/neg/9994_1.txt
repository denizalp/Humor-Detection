Amazing hotel right in the heart of \"Old Montreal\"! A 5 minute walk to Rue Saint Paul, Basilica Notre Dame, and the closest metro stop. The room, lobby, and pool felt super clean and the beds were really comfortable! The only 2 (minor) things I wasn't happy with were that we had no choice but to pay $20 to valet our car, and the pool area did not have a hot tub. Otherwise the hotel was great and so conveniently located.
