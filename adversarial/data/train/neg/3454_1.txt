Being new to Vegas (10 months now), I've been looking for a quality vet. I had used the one minutes from our house (Centennial Hills Animal Hospital) as we had an emergency with our Tibetan Mastiff within in days of moving in and I knew where it was. I was completely dissatisfied with that clinic and vowed to find a new vet when time permitted. \n\nI had months to scope out vets in advance of neutering our terrier puppy and finally found Boca Park Animal Hospital. It is a 20 minute drive from my house and I pass many, many other clinics on the way, but it is worth the drive!! \n\nThe common business model for veterinary clinics in Las Vegas is something I am not used to seeing and very unimpressed with. These clinics that have 6-8 vets on staff, with no appointment necessary, are set up with the first priority to generate revenue for the owner, and the second priority is the quality of care for your pet. It's as if you are stopping at a 7Eleven for your veterinary needs. \n\nBoca Park Animal Hospital is the model I am used to, and will pay extra for their services. I have met both DVM's, and highly recommend each of them. Yes, I could have had the neutering done elsewhere and saved some money, but it's only done once and I prefer to spend my money where the quality of care and concern matches the price.The vet techs are very impressive as well. Being new to needing a groomer for our terrier (our Tibetan Mastiff never went to a groomer), I like the communication and services of Amy, their groomer. If your are looking for quality, focused care for you precious pets, this is the vet practice for you.
