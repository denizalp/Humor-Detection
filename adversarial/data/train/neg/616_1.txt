Found Joe Filter online--and all the great reviews are spot on!  They came out yesterday to clean the bbq grill and to clean the dryer vent.  If a customer has two services done during one call there's a discount on a service so the pricing was excellent.  When I made the appointment Mitch was so helpful explaining how they cleaned the grill and the safety checks.  He even sent me a video.  The dryer I knew about having had it done a year or so ago.  Joe Filter sends you several confirmations; day of they call and\/or text.  The technician sends a text 40 minutes out.  He arrived on time did a great job.  He was amazing!  Very helpful.  I've already scheduled them to come out in the late fall to change RO filters and some other things!  Highly recommend.
