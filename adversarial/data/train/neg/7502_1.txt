Frenco has an incredible selection of nuts, dried fruit, coffee, grains, & fresh produce too! But I go there for the things you can't find else where; oregano oil, brazil nuts and my next trip will likely be for a selection of essential oils. True, they can be bought elsewhere but I find the staff well-informed and approachable.\nI also usually also partake of the snacks, yum! I get to try a few things as I can get just a handful of each.
