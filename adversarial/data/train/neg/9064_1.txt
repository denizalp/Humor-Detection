I ordered the sushi and shashimi platter and watched my chef make it.  I loved it but was never informed on what i was eating.  I can tell you if you sit at the bar and watch them, they are also watching you. I love the compassion of the chef - I happen to read something very sad on my facebook and cried a few tears, the poor chef didn't know what was going on. I was able to gather myself but he took the time to lean over and say, I hope you have a good night. What a sweet man!
