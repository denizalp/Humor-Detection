I had read Art of Flavors featured in the Weekly and had been meaning to try them for a while now. The only reservation I had was it was December and it was during that cold streak we were having. \n\nUpon walking in my girlfriend and I were warmly greeted by what I assume was the owner's family just kinda hanging out in the store. We were asked if we'd been there before and once they recived our \"no\" response the tour began =) We were immediatly handed sample after sample, we felt like little kids with our \"ooooh look pistachio... oh mango!... look they have peanut butter!\" We decided on having 2 double flavor sized cups (chocolate chilli\/berry mix & pistachio\/cinamon bun). The gelato was creamy and very flavorful and pair perfectly with their hazelnut chocolate latte we ordered. \n\nOverall it's a great place to go no matter what weather, flavorfull gelato, friendly enviornment, modest prices. The flavors are constantly rotated out I'm told I just wish I had tried it sooner so I didn't miss the Pumpkin Spice flavor..... Here's to catching all the flavors in between and getting my Pumpkin Spice NEXT YEAR!
