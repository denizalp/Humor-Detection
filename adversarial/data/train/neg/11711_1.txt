Fish tacos and Brussel sprout nachos are a MUST!!! I never would have though anyone in our family would be a fan of the Brussel sprout nachos but WOW are the delicious, I could literally eat those as my meal and get nothing else. They also have a pretty decent happy hour $5 margaritas and $4 beers. It's fun and trendy but on top of it all they actually have good food. I was really happy with this place and I will definitely be back.
