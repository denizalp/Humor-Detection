For the most part, everything has worked out fine but I like to get things done early and Sundays are about my only day to do it. Not opening the gates until 10:00 on Sundays may be convenient for them, but not everyone else and certainly not for me and especially in the summer. Then, I called on Labor Day and was told the office was closed but gates would be open...50 miles later I arrived mid-day with a truckload to find closed gates. How hard is it to get the person answering the phones the correct business hours?
