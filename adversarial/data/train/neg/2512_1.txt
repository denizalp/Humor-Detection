Was here on a Friday evening. Dropped by to put my name down, then went back an hour later for a pager. The wait was like 1.5 hours? The closest location would be the one in Buffalo NY, which I went a few times (big portions but food was below par). I didn't have high hopes when I came here for dinner. But I was surprised by the food at this Toronto location, it's surprisingly good compared to the buffalo location. The Cheesecake is on the sweeter side though. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta, tacos & coffee cheesecake. I would come back again if there was no lineups.
