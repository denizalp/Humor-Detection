Worst Pei Wei branch ever.  Service sucks big time.  I ordered for dine in and to go.. They served one entree took the number from the table even though the number is not yet completed.  My to go order was even worst.  Vietnamese spring rolls was not in the bag.  Manager came to give me the Vietnamese spring rolls but NO peanut sauce included.  I asked one of the waiters for the sauce and gave me one peanut sauce and one sweet chili sauce. Since when you use chili sauce for Vietnamese spring rolls?  Furthermore my order have three rolls, the sauce they gave is only good for one roll.  Lastly my to go chicken lettuce wrap order,  yeah it come with lettuce but they just chopped the lettuce and gave me a quarter part of it.  Yeah right How can I wrap the chicken with a quarter wedge of lettuce? WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS LOCATION EVER!!!!!
