\"Hey babe, what's that restaurant over there with no marquee? It's packed.\" That first observation speaks monuments about a place. All tables are taken and a line to order in a place that's tucked into a corner of a strip mall with absolutely no signage, I'm in! Tucson has very little to offer, but they do have great Mexican food which is impossible to find in the PHX area... until now. This place feels like it was transported from tucson to chandler. A must try!
