I've been to Christine for several body parts for hair removal and I am thrilled with the results. She is professional and very well informed about laser.  I have no hair left on my underarms and feet and plan to continue to other areas. Her office is small, but you won't get better service or results anywhere else. I've been to another very high priced spa for laser hair removal before but the results were nothing like what I got with her yag laser. My skin is fair and my hair is dark, but the treatments also work for darker skinned individuals.
