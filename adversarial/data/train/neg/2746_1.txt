This location feels isolated for some reason but it's just off of the 215 & jones. I've never been to this complex, maybe that's why. They have multiple locations & I asked the workers if there was a difference between this new location & the other ones & one of them said that this place has teriyaki bowls. \n\nI arrived at around 5 something in the afternoon. The place was dead. There 3 workers, who were on point with greeting us. The girl who took my order was a delight. She had a big smile smile on her face the entire time. \n\nI ordered a twin dragon. She asked if I wanted soy paper or seaweed & I ordered soy. I personally would like it more if they asked if we want white or brown rice cos she started making the burrito as soon as I said it & felt bad she had to change out the soy paper cos she already put white rice on it. Sorry! But anyways, the sushiritto itself was good. There was something a little sour in it?? Which kinda turned me off. Idk what it was but kept eating anyway LOL. The original taro chips are my absolute favorite!!
