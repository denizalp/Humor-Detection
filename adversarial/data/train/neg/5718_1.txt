The store has a decent inventory,  although their vocal books are almost non existent.  The low rating is for the complete and utter lack of customer service.  I have been to this location a number of times with my husband who is a professional musician,  otherwise I wouldn't set foot in this place.  I have experienced only neglect and severe rudeness from the staff.  The straw which broke the camel's back was when I asked a simple question about a portable speaker and was laughed at and called \"stupid woman\" by not one,  but two employees.  Sexist, appalling service.  I'm amazed anything gets sold! Never, EVER again.
