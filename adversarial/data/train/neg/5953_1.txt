Would I recommend them?   Absolutely. \nInitially I had contracted with ERX.  Our water damage started in August.  After a plumbers recommendation  and knowing nothing about these types of companies I went with his HIGH recommendation.  I was promised by their Forman that they would come in, remediate then turn around and restore the property in about a 2 week period.  The next day a crew showed up and for 3 days, tore apart doors, floors, walls and left me with a concrete floors and lots of open walls. After waiting almost 2 months for them to return to continue, I looked in yelp and found Pro Restoration. The same day I called Nick arrived at my home  (last Thursday ). On Monday restoration began and today (Thursday a week later) my house is BEAUTIFUL! They did alot of work to re-floor 2 bathrooms, repair walls and a ceiling in the kitchen.  I have new beautiful wood floors and now have really nice tile in my bathrooms.  It's so much nicer than before. \nThe reason ERX waited so long is because they wanted thousands of dollars more than what the insurance paid, and when the insurance refused to pay more, they kept on them and kept pushing back my Restoral date.  They buffered their numbers 3000.00 too high. Nick at Pro Restoration however said that the numbers the insurance had was right on and agreed that I suffered enough and he would help me get my home back better than before. The guys at Pro Restoration are very polite, work hard and really know what they're doing. Their goal is to make you happier than you were before the damage began, and they succeeded.  My home is absolutely beautiful. More than before.  Thank you guys! I just wish I had chosen you first.
