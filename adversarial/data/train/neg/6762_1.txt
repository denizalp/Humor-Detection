Had I filled this out last month, it would likely have been 5 stars dealing with Karla.  I just had the absolute worst experience with the \"new\" manager, Cleva.  Obnoxious, belligerent and rude.  I just put in a complaint with their corporate offices.  Their office made an error that could have easily been corrected - instead of even offering to correct it, Cleva continuously and loudly spoke over me, and in the end told me to go ahead and make sure my things are out before my next payment was due if I wasn't happy.  Absolutely horrible customer service skills!  I do NOT recommend this place so long as this individual - or anyone like Ceva - is employed here!
