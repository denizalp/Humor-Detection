visited : Friday March 09, 2018\n\nMy wife and were in the mood for Italian, and Remezzo happened to be close by when I picked her up from work.\n\nThe service was very good so I left an ample tip to our server, which I don't usually do at Chinese restos.\n\nNow, I would like to offer a warning for those that manage gout to be careful when dining at this resto.  There are potentially many items on the menu that may trigger a gout flare up.  Lots of dishes contain spinach and beef.  There were some chicken options as well, but not paired with pasta.\n\nWe were so hungry on our arrival, I had completely forgotten to take pictures of our appetizers.  We did order veggie spring rolls with came with plum sauce + wasabi mixed dipping sauce along with escargot, the appetizers alone almost ran us $20 CAD.  Oh they did provide complimentary bread basket which was served warm.\n\nAs for our main dishes, my wife ordered the Cannelloni and I had the Spaghetti Bolognese.  We shared the 2 dishes.  Both dishes were tasty, except the Cannelloni was a bit too salty for our palates, along with containing spinach.  I do wish there was more anti-gout friendly options.  I didn't finish all the sauce that came with my Spaghetti Bolognese due to the meat sauce being beef based and there was a lot of ground beef left on the plate.  Our main dishes also came close to another $20 CAD.  Total bill hit us for $47 roughly.\n\nSince there were so many dishes that could potentially trigger gout..follow up repeat visits may restrict us only to the appetizer portion of the menu, since that menu had the items that would likely not trigger a gout flare-up within the next few hours.\n\nThe calamari seems overpriced @ $11.00 CAD in my opinion, at least for an appetizer (and I do really like calamari).  Would definitely go back for the escargot again.
