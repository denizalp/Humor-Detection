Ate at the casual restaurant downstairs. I really don't know how it's considered \"casual\" (with the prices and services seemed like fine dining to me.) \nWe started off with a selection of oysters ( variety of six oysters) fresh and delish followed by the Escabeche which was meh okay and proceeded to our main dish King salmon was good and Fish and chips was also good, we finished off with dessert of course, Angel food cake Harry's Berries sweetened Whipped very yummy. Overall it's better than okay but doesn't make my fan list. I would definitely give this place another shot but next time I'll visit upstairs and see what the raving is all about.
