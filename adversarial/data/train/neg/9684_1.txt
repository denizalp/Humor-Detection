My daughter had a severe headache since eight pm so we went to urgent care around 12. The  front  desk told us it takes 1hr wait cause they have only one doctor and thrs two patients ahead of us. It's already 2am there's still 2 patient still. And when we arrived the front desk person called southwest to check how long is the wait. And she told us it's also the same here. So she said we'd rather stay. And when I'm complaining that's it's taking so long she told me that you are free to go somewhere else. And a nurse called us in a room and she told us oh we only have one doctor. And I told her why don't you hire more doctors. And she answered me in a rude way that nobody wants to works nights. They put us in the room but we are still waiting for a long time. This is the worts urgent care crew and staff that I ever Encounter.
