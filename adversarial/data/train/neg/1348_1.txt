I can only comment on the AYCE lunch. So at lunch they have iPads at  each table to order your items rather than using paper & pencil like other places. The server still needs to come over & review the order before sending it through. The cooked food is average at best and the sushi is questionable. Why I come back is the aburi sushi on the AYCE menu. It's not the best but it's relatively cheap compared to any high end sushi place that offers this aburi style sushi. I find aburi is hard to find in Toronto. If this wasn't on their AYCE menu I definitely would not come back.  Also, this is a chinese operated sushi restaurant, need I say more.
