We are huge Pita Jungle fans and have been for the past 10 years. However, tonight we placed a takeout order which included the side order of garlic new potatoes. We got 10 small chunks of potato in our order. I would hardly (actually not at all) call that a side order. More like two large bites. Skimping on orders because it's takeout is a HUGE turnoff and quite a disappointment to a longtime customer.
