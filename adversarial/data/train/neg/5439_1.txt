All of the pizzas here are personal pizzas.  You can catch some good deals here at Brixx.  On Mondays you can enjoy all American craft brews for $1.95.  This is a good deal especially if they have the more expensive craft beers on tap like Stone or Rogue.  Some of the Brixx in town offers half price pizzas and apps after after 10:00 but I am not sure what the half-price status of this one is.  The one on Rea Rd definitely has the half price after 10 deal.  \n\nThe pizzas are pretty good.  The thing you need to know is you can customize your pizza for no charge.  I like to get the wild mushroom pizza add red sauce, pepperoni, and pineapple; hold the arugula.  I try not to \"over-do\" it because I do not want them to stop not charging for toppings.  The Brixx salad is also a great addition to your meal, a light spring mix with pistachios and goat cheese.  If you decide to get the spinach and artichoke dip, I recommend getting the warm pita triangles instead of the croutons.  They just taste better.
