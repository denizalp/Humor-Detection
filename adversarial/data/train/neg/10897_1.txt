I really wanted to like this place and have Zero Degrees Westminster location on my bookmark to try when we visit SoCal.  I was surprise to see the 3 star rating since the Westminster location had 4 1\/2 stars with over 1500 reviews.  After our experience, this location deserves their 3 star review.  We arrived at 9pm and was surprised to see there was no line.  We placed our order at 910 and saw our cups placed next to a line of about 15 cups.  The cashier said our drinks would take about 15 minutes.  We waited 30 minutes for our drinks.  We got there just before the rush.  After we ordered the line was almost out the door.  I cant even imagine how long those people had to wait for their order.\n\nWe ordered Mangonada, Ube Milkshake, Sea Salt Green Tea and Strawberry Horchata.  The Mangonada was an interesting mix of salty and sweet with a kick.  My husband and friends enjoyed the mangonada but I'm not a fan. It killed my taste buds...too salty.  The Ube milkshake was my favorite of all the drinks we ordered. This drink was decorated with a toasted marshmallow, rainbow marshmallow twist, and airhead.  Blended well and creamy but could use more ube flavor.  This drink is on the pricey side at $6.50...not worth it.  The sea salt green tea was standard.  The strawberry horchata was a disappointed.  We all took a couple sips and agreed that cinnamon flavor was too much.  I could not taste strawberry at all.  You can see the strawberry chunks but no strawberry flavor. \n\nI would give them 3 1\/2 stars for their drinks and 2 1\/2 stars for the the long wait.  They have been open for over a month and would should have figured out they need to increase staffing for Saturday night crowd.
