My boyfriend and I basically live at this Tijuana Flats, and it has never not been good. They did change the menu recently, and the black bean and chicken flautas are no longer there, which sucks but I just get a combo with black beans and the problem is slightly solved. Customer service is always great, and I am always asked if I need refills or if there is anything else I need. They have discounts for college students and faculty, I'm not sure if that would ever include regular K-12 teachers like me, but the prices are low anyway so it's not a big deal. \n\nThe only thing I don't really understand is the tipping protocol, I usually tip a couple of dollars but I don't know if they are being paid based on tips or if they are paid hourly. Also if it is your first time there, yes, they clear the tables for you, you can just leave your plates on the table.
