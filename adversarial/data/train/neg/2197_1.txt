So, I am a HUGE Dr Pepper fan, and it is so hard to fine fountain Dr Pepper anywhere in Vegas, at least on The Strip, but here, they HAVE IT!!! So I was very happy. The buffet is not the most expensive and we went for the Champagne Brunch so it was great. Unlimited mimosas is always a good idea, especially if they will give you just the champagne without the o.j. ;) . I've been with a group and I've been with just my husband and both times it was easy to get in, not a long wait. \n\nThe last time we went for mid morning and the buffet had good food, but didn't seem to have a whole lot of variety.
