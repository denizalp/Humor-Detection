I've been getting pierced here since I was 15 and I am now 26. I'll never go anywhere else, because they keep up with the upmost professionalism and cleanliness. I've gotten many different piercers. Always satisfied. The last time I went, I went with a couple friends. We all got pierced and we all got Nicola. She was amazing! She was so friendly, open, and warm. She made us all comfortable. And dropped some major piercing knowledge on us without sounding condescending at all. It was overall my best experience at HTC and I grabbed her card so I could go back to her specifically.
