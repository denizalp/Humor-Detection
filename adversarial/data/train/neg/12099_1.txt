My mom and I stopped here for lunch and we both had the turkey sandwiches since it is fresh roasted turkey. They were excellent sandwiches and came with a mini cookie that was excellent and a perfect dessert. The fresh squeezed orange juice was great and reasonably priced at $2 for a small cup. There were a couple of breakfast sandwiches that intrigued me, so I'll have to come back during breakfast hours.  This is A cute little place in the corner of the strip mall right on the corner of Indian School and 32nd street.
