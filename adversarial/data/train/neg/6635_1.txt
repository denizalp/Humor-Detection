Its A-OK, but its not fantastic. \n\nWalking in on a Sunday evening you would think a place with high marks would have more than 0 people in it. Walking in i was a bit surprised that the walls were drawn on with crayon and markers, as it was not very creative for a decor direction. If the place was a kids spot, or even a cheaper fast food style option for a burger then maybe but not when i am paying $10+ for a burger and an additional $4+ for a side of fries or tots. I ordered the \"Bacon\" for $11, medium rare, and it came out cooked as such. Presentation was in a plastic basket where again if your at a fast food spot then fine, but not a $10+ burger as the presentation on your website on the cutting board is so much more appropriate and creative. The burger tasted just ok also, the meat wasn't wowing me with flavor or seasoning, but the bacon and fried onions on it had to come in and save the day\/burger. I ate my meal happily but knew half way done that i would not return here for all the reasons above. Even if i am just going for a burger, id like to not feel like i am sitting in a cafeteria in elementary school (decor). And feel like i couldn't have had a better burger from Habit Burger for half the cost. If you live close then maybe this spot is for you, but there are too many better options closer to my home to ever come back here.
