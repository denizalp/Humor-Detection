I revisited this restaurant with my mom.  We both chose the Traditional Breakfast.  I had it with bacon and my mom had turkey sausage.  We both had coffee.  The Breakfast was good. I also wanted to try a slice of their french toast. The waiter told me that it would cost an additional 2.49 for one slice.  I passed since i could get an entire loaf for the same price. There was ample food so it was filling. The cost was $22 both of us which I thought was a bit pricey.  We did have a gift card. I would go again and try lunch.
