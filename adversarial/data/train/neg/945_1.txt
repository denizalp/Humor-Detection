Looking for a reflexology spot on yelp I found this place since I needed some TLC with my best friend. So around 11am we arrived with no appointment but immediately got accomodated in a couples area\/room. The salon smelled like menthol and alcanfor which is very relaxing and soothing for me. While we waited we had an ionic detox and later followed by the best massage I had in my life! We both had the foot deluxe but the massage is a whole body experience for 40 dollars that you do not want to miss. It is not fancy but it is professional, economic and the best thing you will do for your body.
