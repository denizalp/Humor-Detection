This is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants in the downtown core. The food is quite authentic and the service is good.  While it may not be as traditional and authentic as some of the other Japanese restaurants that I've been to around town, it is a convenient place for lunch if you're craving sushi. They have 2-item or 3-item lunch sets that you can choose from (which includes soup and salad) and you can choose from a whole menu of items (some cooked and some raw). It has items for everyone... so if you're lunching with some co-workers who're not die hard raw fish fans, there are menu items for them too. The lunch set prices are quite reasonable and in my opinion, very good value.\n\nNot only is it good value, but the texture of the rolls and sushi is very good. I personally can't stand sushi rice that have been pressed by a machine. I'm pretty sure the chefs at Fuji yama hand squeeze the sushi rice as it is reflected in the texture of the sushi.
