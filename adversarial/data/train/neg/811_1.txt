I would want to give this place another go before finalizing my opinion. I thought the atmosphere was very cute, country feeling. For dinner, I ordered the swordfish ($27). Honestly, I thought it was okay. Not the great as Tripple George downtown, but up there. My friend ordered a pizza. It was cooked perfectly. The service was pretty good, but the hostest seemed a bit overwhelmed at times. Would visit again.
