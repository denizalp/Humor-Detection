I loved this store. The best part is everything which defines my personal hippie-chic look can be found here at a very affordable price.\nThe sales were legit too. They took 50% off the lowered price, not the original price. \nThey sell funky headbands, beautiful, comfy clothes and oil necklaces.\nThey sort of remind me of a less expensive version of Anthropologie.
