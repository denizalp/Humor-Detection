I absolutely love this sushi place. It's much more pricier than most AYCE in Toronto but it's sure well worth it. The service is always amazing, the food always piping hot and delicious. Absolutely nothing to complain about.\n\nThe restaurant is always clean, every time we are seated, there's never a crumb on the table and they always have the plates and chopsticks ready. The servers are super quick to remove any unwanted dishes as well and top your water off.\n\nMy favorite dishes that I love to get is the spicy salmon sushi and spicy salmon maki. Takoyaki (AMAZING), croquettes, their bbq eel is okay. Their tempera shrimps are always good but sometimes I find that there's too much breading. \n\nI love their new drink menu, they have amazing cocktails that start at 5.99 and up. I've tried their island icetea which is delicious but my new fave drink would have to be the Lychee Mojito.\n\nTIP: They do not take debit, make sure you bring credit or cash!\n\nHappy Eating fellow Yelpers!
