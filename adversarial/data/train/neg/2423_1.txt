Back out on vacation, and Safelite saves us, AGAIN!.\n\nSame drivers window, similar problem, and again, they fixed it for FREE. This time, Peter Zack took care of us, he is the Quality Manager for Less Vegas and Honolulu.  What amazing service! \n\nSafelite has earned me as a customer twice now, and wouldn't let me pay them. THIS, This is what service is people!
