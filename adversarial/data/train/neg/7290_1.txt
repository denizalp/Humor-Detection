Jessica was recommended by one of my mom's coworkers, so I decided to try and get a color and cut done by her. I called and made an appointment to see her. I showed up and she was in the middle of doing someone's hair. She didn't say anything like \"Sorry, I'm in the middle of this. If you wait, I'll get to you. Or you can have your hair done by one of our other stylists.\" Instead, she just indicated to another stylist to do my hair. I know I should have said something, but I did not want to make a fuss and I needed my hair colored. The stylist who did my hair did a suitable job; however, I will not return. I made an appointment to see you Jessica. Just poor customer service. Disappointing.
