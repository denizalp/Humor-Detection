Decided on these movers after getting several quotes from other moving companies because their pricing is affordable.  We were thoroughly impressed by the service during the move.  We had 2 guys moving our furniture (9 pieces) from a 2BR apartment into a 2-story house about 16 miles away.  \n1) Firstly we were impressed by their speed - they did not waste any time at all!  Not while moving the furniture and not while driving to the destination (very impressed).  \n2) We were also impressed by their work ethic - it's 105degrees out on a June afternoon and they didn't stop to take a break.  They moved us in record time (under 2 hours) because they were working so efficiently.  \n3) We were impressed by their attention to detail - they didn't just plop things down, they took care with our furniture beyond what was expected and they were mindful - I noticed they paused to wipe their feet before stepping on the carpeted stairs, despite holding a heavy piece of furniture.  It was extra effort, but it was respectful and we appreciate it.\n4) They worked well together, communicating to maneuver the furniture through tight spaces without damaging any walls or the furniture themselves.\n\nWe'll definitely use them again and will be recommending to anyone we know.
