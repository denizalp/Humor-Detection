I went to this studio for my first yoga class (thanks to a great Groupon), so I am nowhere near an expert.  However, I will say that I was extremely comfortable for it being my first visit.  Everyone, including the instructor, was very knowledgeable, friendly and open.  The studio is very warm and inviting.  I have already scheduled two more classes!
