I used to hire for my department. Finding folks who want to work and are reliable represent the difficulty of this endeavor.\n\nThe staff at Bob Taylor's Ranch House epitomize these qualities.\n\nWhen I am in Las Vegas, I make it a point to eat here.\n\nI am biased with Aprel taking my reservations and Judy serving.\n\nHowever, with visiting with new friends, I have to say that Sally was incredible!\n\nMy steak was cooked to perfection.\n\nThe venue is \"old school\" yet extremely comfortable.\n\nThe staff, incredible.\n\nOne side story to this review; this is my second visit this week. I called ahead and my partner is disabled. Aprel and Judy came through. Made me look great!\n\nThank you.
