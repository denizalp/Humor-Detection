Saw Dr Randi Rubenzik for a skin screening. Very professional, gentle and caring! Highly recommend. My only negative experience was with the front desk... they appeared very annoyed and chaotic! It made me anxious. I was happy to get called back for my appointment and wait in a calmer atmosphere. Hopefully it was just a bad day for them and not the norm!
