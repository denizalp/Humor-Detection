Favorite place to go for a tried-and-true breakfast! Absolutely adore their smoked salmon eggs benedict, but also love their aged cheese (n thick bread!) tuna melt. Can't exactly make up my mind, but I know for sure that the sunny disposition and happy charm of the staff will keep me coming back here time and time again.\n\nThey offer home fries, fries, salad, or soup with almost every entr√©e, so it's quite filling, although the soup portion is more like a cup (but the salad is huge, so go for that if you're feeling like an actual meal). Sucks that they open at 7 and close at 4, with no foreseeable change in the schedule, but this is definitely a treat to college kids everywhere, ruined from the all-nighters, and in need of destressing with some genuinely fresh food.
