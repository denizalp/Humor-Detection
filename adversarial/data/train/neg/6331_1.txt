OK so I go to watch \"it\" with my friends n so like my friends dad was wit us so we could get our tickets dunno y the movies 18+ but we anyway so he's like I'm not going in only the kids are ok n the workers are like alri, as soon as he leaves they're like o u can't buy food cus u need an adult o shit u can't even watch the movie n wouldn't let us EVEN IF WE HAD OUR FUCKING TICKET. Treated us like sht n went around telling all the workers to not let us in or let us buy food n kept pointin to us so we ended up changing our tickets to Annabelle which btw already seen it so yay I payed to watch a movie twice.
