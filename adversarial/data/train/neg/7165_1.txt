Stumbled upon this place when looking for somewhere new to eat at lunch.  And let me tell you, it was such a great find!  \n\nMe and my friend both got the daily special, which our server just called an \"upside down.\"  It consisted of some very moist and flavorful spiced shredded chicken, which was then layered with some eggplant and peppers and then covered with rice.  This was all placed into a bowl and cooked and then flipped \"upside down\" onto a plate so the rice was on the bottom and the chicken was on top.  It came with either a side salad, or a side of hummus.  Or you can opt for half salad\/half hummus like we did.  The food was absolutely delicious and totally hit the spot.  Plus, we both left with enough leftovers for another meal.  \n\nOur server, Sonny, was super helpful, down to earth, and fun to talk to.  Great experience all around -- I'll definitely be back!
