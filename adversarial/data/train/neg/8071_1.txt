Went to Kaya with my dad before a Pirates game, as it is one of our favorites, and it did not disappoint. We had the same waiter we have had the past few times we have eaten there over the past 3 years and the service was as good as ever. We ordered a FEAST. The waiter had several \"courses\" brought out to us so we could pace ourselves (and have space on the table). We first got the Fundido and the Yuca Bean Dip. Both were fantastic. The fundido was creamy with a good spice and little bit of sweet from the onions with a great cheesy flavor. The yuca dip was a perfect spicy, bean compilation that always has been good. Next, we got the crab cakes and calamari which were both good. The crab cakes had a refreshing salsa on top that balanced the heaviness of the cake well. The calamari also had good zest, as well as fried jalapenos which are always a plus. Next, we got our conch hush puppies and the jerk wings. The jerk wings are possibly my favorite with a great crunch, delicious lime sauce, and tender chicken. The conch hush puppies were good as well but they were filling especially towards the end of the huge meal. They were also surprisingly spicy. The final thing we got was a fried chicken sandwich that we took to go since we had to go to PNC Park. It was delicious (better than chik-fil-a and I love those sandwiches). It was perfectly crunchy with a bit of spice and tender chicken. Perfect meal.
