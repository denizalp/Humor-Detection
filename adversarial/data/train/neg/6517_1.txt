First, the staff were very friendly. I got there 40 min before closing, they never rush us. Their skewers are amazing. I ordered beef tongues, bacon scallop wrap, pork, and sausages,  they are extremely soft not chewy or dry at all. All skwers are only $1~3. I also tried yellowtail carpaccio, and gyoza they are very delicious!  Oh and must try their yellowtail collar! Other reason i like this place about, their sake and beer are pretty cheap, they are also on a beer promotion. Love this place I will definitely go back.
