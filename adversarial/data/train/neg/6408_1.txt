I expected a sparse beer hole with a handful of craft taps.  And of those taps, I expected a bunch of pseudo-craft beers...the Firestone Walkers and the Odells and such.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, mind you, just that it's what I figured I would get out of a small strip mall spot.\n\nWhat I got was a well put-together and nice cozy place, bigger than I thought, with 35 or more taps of fantastic variety.  They had a slew of Belgians on tap in honor of AZ Beer Week and this was a killer list.  Delirium Nocturne and La Fin Du Monde and Judgment Day, and the rest of the list was just as good.  \n\nLenny, one of the owners, clearly gives a shit and it shows.  A smile and a good attitude really does count for something.  I'm going to spend way too much time and money in Hop Central and that's just fine by me.
