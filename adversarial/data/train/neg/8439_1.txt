What else could you want in a donut shop other then great donuts.  You'll find them here.  Obviously hand made in the store from start to finish.\n\nThey have some imagination...  They're not all the same filling in the fruit filled and the glazed were light and airy.  I didn't have any of the cake variety but if they are as good as the yeast ones, they'll be delightful too.
