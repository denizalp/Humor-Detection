Yasu is on par with the top notch sushi restaurants in Tokyo.  It is expensive by Toronto standard but the same meal in Japan could easily cost double or more.\n\nOther reviews have gone in depth to describe the food in great detail and thus it's hard for me to add much value in that regard.  However, a relative ranking should help highlight the food quality.\n\nYasu is a hair better than Shiro's in Seattle, which is head by a chef who is an apprentice of Jiro Ono of Dreams of Sushi fame.  That's how good Yasu is.
