Wow!  wow!  \nGot the recommendation to visit here from the good folks at Free Range Brewing and we were really impressed.  I did the Pho Tai and the Summer Rolls (with the awesome peanut sauce), and both were really delightful.  I added a good amount of the table spices and it only enriched the delicious broth.\nThis place doesn't look like much but it's absolutely a hidden gem in Charlotte.
