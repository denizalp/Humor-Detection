Oops! Long overdue review for this place\n\nI got my ears pierced here by Alex about 2 years ago. 1) one done on the helix 2) one for each side of my ears lobes, this is the second piercing on my lobe. Alex was really nice about the process and took a long time to thoroughly make sure they were even and proportioned to my previous piercing. He was also accommodating about allowing me to use my own earrings. I get a slight reaction when I wear anything silver or steel in my ears. \n\nI haven't pierced my ears since I was a kid. Vaguely remember having it done by a family member with a needle and ice cube. Old school style! Lol. Anyways, I was wary of having the helix done cause I heard it hurts a lot. For anyone thinking of getting a helix piercing, it actually wasn't too bad. The recovery period I found actually hurts more. They say it takes 6 months to heal... But I would say for me, it took almost 9 months to a year. On and off, I would experience intense swelling and irritation. Sometimes it hurt a lot. However, Alex was very understanding and answered any concerns I had. I religiously applied the sea salt and water solution he recommended, which really helped with the swelling. \n\nTotally recommend this place. Just know it is pricy $$$, don't come expecting to pay what you would for a piercing at Claire's. Lol. But as they say, you get what you pay for. They are very professional.
