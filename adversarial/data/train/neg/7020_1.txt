Went here yesterday morning April 23rd 2017 Started off really good Way truck was vacuumed and placed in the tunnel really fast was power sprayed everything was going great right up until the exit the tunnel apparently it does not rinse off  your vehicle, about 70% of it is still covered in soap as it exits the tunnel I automatically assumed my vehicle would be re rinsed, boy was I wrong. my vehicle literally sat out in the Sun and the soap dried on my truck (my truck is black) I sat there and watch them spray something on my truck and wipe it down with towels instead of just re-Running it to rinse it.  when I was called up to take my truck I noticed so many things wrong with it, I didn't even say anything, we were already there 40 mins and I had a crying infant. I simply left pulled into the adjoining lot and took these pictures. Apparently this is what $24.99 will get you. My kids could've done a better job than this. Definitely will not be returning.
