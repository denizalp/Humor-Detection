We had a LOVELY brunch here earlier this year. I'm bummed I didn't write our server's name down because she was amazing. I do remember she had a beautiful accent-maybe someone will be able to fill in the blank here!!!\nPerfect during the spring months while the weather is gorgeous and the little boutique is adorable.\nOne of our favorite spots, still!
