To really have a great time at these types of places it really comes down to the company you keep but overall as an experience it was great!\n\nThe host was very nice and enthusiastic!\nWe chose the Ancient Egyptian themed room and of course I wont share spoilers but it was loads of fun and even if some puzzles were more difficult than others they weren't irritatingly difficult.\n\nThis was my first attempt at an \"escape room\" and the fish out of water feeling goes away quickly and you can easily get to solving puzzles.\n\nI'm glad a place like this exists in Madison and I will definitely be coming back for their Sherlock Holmes themed room as it's said to be their most difficult.\n\nI highly recommend checking this place out even if your new to these types of places!
