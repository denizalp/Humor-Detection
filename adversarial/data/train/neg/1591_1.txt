If you're considering engaging Miguel de Maria to provide music for a special event, do it!  He recently played for our 40th wedding anniversary celebration at CopperWynd in Fountain Hills, and his music was perfection.  He is so easy & pleasant to work with - gives careful attention to detail - will readily add any special musical pieces that you'd like to include - arrives & sets up on time.  Overall a delight to work with!  And his playing is superb.  Our guests loved his music!  Thank you, Miguel, for helping to make our celebration such a pleasure.
