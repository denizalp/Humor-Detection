I'm new to the area and was super nervous to find someone new for brow waxing. I have thin brows that grow in all directions so its hard to find someone who doesn't totally mess them up. Luckily Shaina was the first person I have tried and I am so impressed! My brows look beautiful and are a great shape and thickness. Shaina even gave me a few tips on filling them in which were very helpful. Now my brows look amazing all the time!! I will 100% be going back to Pink Cherry!
