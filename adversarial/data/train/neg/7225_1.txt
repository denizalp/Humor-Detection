It took about a month to find an appropriate time for a our reservation for two....\nhowever, it was so worth it.\n\n12 seat Sushi restaurant. Two chefs working in unison. Reminded both my wife and me of our sushi dinners in Tokyo.\n\nFish was delicious. Fresh and flavourful, Some from Japan, such as the big eye snapper, but the fish from Greece (ie Sea Bass) was also awesome.\n\nFirst time for cod sperm sack (from Japan) and trust me, it's very delicious... don't worry!! it's good.\n\nvery friendly staff were extremely attentive. \n\n$80 per person and we had a 15 course Omakase menu... all nigiri except for a hand roll.\n\nFresh wasabi! loved that too. Rice, perfectly seasoned and slightly warm (as it should be!!)\n\nOverall I would give it 6\/5 if I could.\n\nThis is a must try if you enjoy sushi.
