It was good. The portions were huge and the prices reasonable.  Service was outstanding.\n\nI had the chili and some french fries.  The chili was very good, the fries were frozen, but they had no salt at all.  My friend had the crazy omelet.  It must have been made with 6 eqqs, it was huge.  He also had the home fried potatoes.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly and the portion huge.
