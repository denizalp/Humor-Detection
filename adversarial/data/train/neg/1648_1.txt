Absolutely worst experience ever! So many issues but space is limited.\n\nFirst went to this office w\/a mouth infection on Nov 16. Needed extractions & new dentures. I was told by receptionist, Karen, I could probably have them by Dec 20, but may have to pay  $85 rush job. \n\nAfter xrays she went over proposal.  In patient column was $400. She explained \"Medicaid makes crappy\/poor quality dentures.'  I couldnt afford the $400 & my daughter used Medicaid & has beautiful teeth.\n\nWent in to try on prototypes for uppers only. Carol-Ann messed a bit fitting them in & then handed me a mirror & said, \"smile.\"  To my complete shock, no teeth showed! After telling her I wanted my teeth to show, she told me that people don't like to see teeth in others when smiling. I didn't think I heard her correctly & found myself looking at her tech who was smiling a gorgeous smile & her teeth showed! \n\nFinally, I told her I wanted teeth like my old ones & insisted I wanted teeth to show when I smiled. She took a picture of my old dentures with her cell & with much disappointment I left. Since those had to be sent back, I was told they would not be back by Dec 20, & Xmas might be iffy. \n\nWent back to try on 2nd prototypes. Same thing, no teeth showed. This time she came up with a different silly excuse saying, \"You know when you get older, your top lip starts receding over upper teeth.\" I'm far from there!\n\nAgain, I left disappointed. No appointment was made as Karen said the holidays were too near. \n\nI had no confidence in her ability to simply measure & fit for uppers, how could I trust her to pull the 2 broken teeth & 2 roots? It scared me to death!  Proposal shows 5 extractions needed, but at new dentist, only 4 showed.\n\nIn 5 visits & 3 mouth infections from the 1st visit to last, we weren't even halfway done.\n\nThe new dental office can do it all within a week. I've been there & have seen their work. I called Carol Ann Rowe's office, spoke to Karen, asking for them to return the money they had already billed Medicaid. This has to be done before I can start the work at new dentist & hopefully before more mouth infections. Karen said she would talk to Carol-Ann.\n\nNever received a response, thus, a week later I call back. Karen said she had told Carol-Ann, but has not received an answer. The lack of response angered me, since I had to go to Urgent Care over weekend with 4th infection. This time I had lumps on my throat. The doctor at Urgent Care, also said I had been given the wrong antibiotics by Carol-Ann.\n\nI had been willing to not post a review (shame on me), if they would do the right thing. When Karen said Carol-Ann had not told her anything yet, I lost my temper. Their sitting on their butts while I'm going thru dangerous mouth infections. I told Karen, if I got an answer by the end of week, I wouldn't add to the bad reviews. Carol-Ann came on phone saying they don't resort to blackmail.\n\nThere is so much more that could be said.
