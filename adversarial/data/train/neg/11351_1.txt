Was here last week to grab a quick lunch with a friend. It was fairly empty, and the restaurant is small, however, the lunch specials are worth the price. We shared Lunch Combo B and C, and she had asked to change the California Roll in her special to Spicy Salmon Roll. The roll was nice and spicy! Lunch Combo C, my order, came with a Dynamite Roll, which tasted like it usually does. It also had several pieces of sushi. Very filling for a good price and the service was very nice.
