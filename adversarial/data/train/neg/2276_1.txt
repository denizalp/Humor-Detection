Although you can eat in the restaurant at one of Double 10's four tables, The Wife and I have been using it as a good option for carryout Chinese food in the West Madison\/Middleton area. The online ordering system is easy, but I find that calling is the easiest way to place an order.\n\nOn the positive side, Double 10 serves really good dumplings (and dumpling sauce), has fair prices, and is convenient for pickup purposes (right along University between downtown and Middleton).\n\nOn the neutral plane, Double 10's food is A-OK. Like previously mentioned, the dumplings are very good, but everything else has been just OK. The notable exception has been the egg drop soup, which is very bland and much more watery than we've had elsewhere.\n\nOn the negative side, Double 10 is somewhat disorganized and has been overwhelmed every time I've gone in to pick up food. There seems to be only one guy working the counter, taking phone and online orders, and helping people get their pick-ups when they come into the store. The last time I was in, I arrived at the given time only to be told that our food wasn't ready yet because they were \"very busy.\" (On a side note, I've never been asked to give a name or credit card when placing a phone order. I'm still surprised that they work on the honor system like that).
