Do yourself a favor and don't go in the last hour they are open because I just had a very mediocre service and the thing was our server was friendly her name is Kylie but it took forever to get greeted forever to get chips for ever to get refills and she never even bussed our tables left our dirty plates there the entire time.   The food was really good otherwise it probably get it one or two stars in fact I got the extra third start just because the churros Sunday was so amazing\n\nSomeone did say in Kylie's defense she was the only server in the whole restaurant I don't know but that shouldn't be my problem anyways. There was a Giants night game so they should of staffed accordingly
