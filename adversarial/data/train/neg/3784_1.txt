I'm a huge fan of the food network and Diners, Drive ins & Dives so I knew I had to stop in! The over all look of the place is rocker, which is expected. The menu is really heavy, you figure it must be expensive to produce so the content inside must be amazing. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with what was on here seemed like your cliche burger joint with some fancy wording. I will give them, presentation was amazing of all foods but nothing out of this world. Had the nachos and the meat was slightly undercooked which lead to a slight upset stomach. Drinks were small but tasty. If your visiting and love the show, check it out for the photo opportunity.
