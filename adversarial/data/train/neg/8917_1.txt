This show is spectacular and well worth the price or sitting through horrible time share presentations. I'm not a huge Beatles fan, but I was really blown away and had no idea how many Beatles songs I truly enjoy. The theater is small and intimate allowing you to really experience the show... especially with the out of this world surround sound system.
