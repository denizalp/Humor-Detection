Great neighbourhood cafe. Good background barista chatter if you're trying to concentrate and looking to keep up w it you're screwed. \nOld restoration hardware worn leather comfy chairs barn board decor creates kitsch warmth and appeal. \nThe best part is the view of the park and the spectacular view of downtown Toronto.
