Would have given a 5 star rating but we were seated outside the restaurant on the \"patio\" staring at the exit doors to the casino, looking at a crane, and watch the people ride the escalator.  The noise was horrible but the staff did their best to try and make things better.\n\nThe food was excellent.  Sit inside!
