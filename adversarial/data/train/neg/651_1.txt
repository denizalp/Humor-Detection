Not saying this is the best Mexican food I've ever had but it is very good, especially for the price. I would say far better in price and food quality than you would get going to places like Filiberto's or Julioberto's. Consistently tasty, and the ladies that work there are always kind. I especially love their sopes, it's around 8 dollars after tax for 4 sopes, rice and beans. \nDefinitely my favorite work lunch grub out spot.
