We love Escobar! Found this little gem on Yelp. what a great find. I almost don't want anyone else to know about it because then it will get busy and we won't get a table right away. that's greedy though and unfair to such an awesome restaurant. Keith is great and must work 7 days a week because he's always there. Take a day off buddy. actually no...don't. We want you there to make a signature margarita for us. The food has so much flavor and is not heavy or greasy. everything we have had has been terrific! props to Escobar!
