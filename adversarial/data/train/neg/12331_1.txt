DESERT FOOTHILLS AIR CONDITIONING & HEATING is the absolute BEST! I had a rental that suddenly had the air conditioning STOP WORKING when it was 120 degrees out.  They were referred to me by another air conditioning company (which is amazing) and I ended up dealing with the owner of the company who personally drove and got the unit and COMPLETED THE installation in less than 20 hrs. of getting my call.  They are EXCEPTIONAL and THEIR PRICING IS AWESOME!  I compared their pricing to another company, who was giving me \"preferred pricing\" and this company was only $50 more than the other company AND THEY DID MORE AND PUT A BETTER UNIT IN the home.  They are honest and gave GOOD VIBES from the very 1st call!  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM.  Thank you DESERT FOOTHILLS AIR CONDITIONING!
