I've come here several times, more often during lunch time. I have to admit. The food is good. There's no doubt about that, but there were two occasions where my order came so much later than my friends' orders. One time I can forgive, but two times, really? It feels like they had a vendetta against me, but I probably just had bad luck. \n\nYou guys are lucki (ha, get it?) that I'm still giving you 4 stars. Your food is way too good to pass up. Not only is the chicken Pad Thai delicious, but the Pad see ew is such an incredible dish as well. Other dishes I would recommend would be the spicy basil chicken, the papaya salad, and their Lucki wings. \n\nHopefully next time I won't be forgotten during lunch. Third time's the charm.
