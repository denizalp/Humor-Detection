The restaurant advertises itself as having vegan friendly options...could not be farther from the truth.  When we walked in and asked about vegan options they looked at us like we were crazy but offered some of there standard dishes without meat and dairy.  Since we were with other folks who were not vegan, we had to eat something so we tried modifying a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich without meat and cheese.  What came out of the kitchen was a cold bun with a couple slices of tomato, a few pieces of uncooked bell pepper and onion and side of fires.  No seasoning was added to the veggies to try and make the meal eatable for us... and we were charge full price, $13.99 for our \"salad\" sandwich.  The non-vegans who were with us ordered Chicken Cesar Salad.  They complained that their salad had very little dressing and the chicken was overcooked and dry.  We had no time to complain to management since we had waited a long time for service and we had to leave to catch a flight.  This place is clearly another Vegas tourist trap not interested in return business.  Highly overrated.
