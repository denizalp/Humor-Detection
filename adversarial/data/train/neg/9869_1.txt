It's so easy to overlook the options on the second floor of Sears.  The optometrist there was very cool and the first of any health professional to provide me answers and solutions to my chronic dry eye here in the valley.  \n\nThe staff was super sweet and helpful...one was finding me the perfect frames while I was in with the doc.  Fast service since they are hiding in a sears.\n\nGreat new frames\/lenses for $30 copay in just 10 days.
