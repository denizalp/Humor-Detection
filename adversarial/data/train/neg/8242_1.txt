This restaurant fails on delivering on common courtesies - water, cleanliness (grease and dried chicken on my seat), place settings, kindness. They act as though they are doing you a favour even though you are paying a premium for inferior service and food. Severely disappointed with the poor service from the establishment but didn't leave simply due to the fact that we were meeting family here. I won't return.
