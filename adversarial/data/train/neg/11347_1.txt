I bought the $20 Groupon for a Spa Pedicure with Hot stone massage. When they started the massage the lady said that I would have to pay $20 more. I asked why and she said the scrub, mask, callus removed & hot towels were all $5 more. I asked what came in my Groupon which was valued at $40 and she said it's just the basic pedicure with a stone massage. They sell the basic pedicure for $20 in the salon so the Groupon had no value. When I asked for a design on my nail she said that's $5 more and I said I would pay. I asked if she could do something other than a flower, since that's what I had when I came in and she said she knew another one. I left with a different flower design. I won't be back to this loc
