We moved into The Wyatt last August, and so far we're very happy. I love my kitchen! I love the mini dog park out back too. There are a lot of grassy areas for my furbaby which is nice, considering a lot of Vegas isn't too pet friendly. After reading some reviews, I will mention I've never seen a scorpion inside or outside, but I have called and put myself down for pest control preemptively 3 times this past year because... Desert! And I aspire to never have to see one! :) I think their company comes Tuesdays or Wednesdays to spray? My neighbors are kind so far. The pool around the corner has been great, and a year later I learned that there is a second one a few buildings away! Lastly, kudos to the staff. I have an Amazon addiction, and they always sign and hold my mail for me. We've decided to renew, but aren't sure how long yet.\n\nUPDATE 8\/1: I just renewed for 6 more months. We are hoping to buy a house this winter and we had the option to renew for 1-15 months. It ended up being about an extra $40 per month for the shorter term lease but at least we don't have to move in the meantime. :)
