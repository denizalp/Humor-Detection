Being vegetarian, we walked around a few buffets before deciding our sunday brunch...we saw wynn, cravings and treasure island and decided on the mirage buffet. Excellent selection, great service and quality food.\nWe walked around the susi bar but saw no vege sushi, the cook there promptly rolled us some avocado and vegetables sushi...\nThe selection contained both breakfast and main meal items...The spring rolls, pizza, mex wraps, waffles, thai salads and dessets were all excellent. In drinks, they served champagne, lemonade, orange juice etc.\nOverall, we enjoyed the lunch.
