Best buffet of the few my girlfriends and I tried. I went back for more plates than I should probably admit to! Lunch was definitely the only meal I needed that day.The food was wildly rich, so I tried to fit some veggies on my plate when possible.\n\nMy buffet favorites:\nsmoked potato salad (ohmigodddd...need this recipe)\nseaweed salad\nhijiki salad\nshrimp cocktail (delicious smokey sauce)\nterriyaki strip steak \nkobe prime rib\ncreamed spinach (the best I've ever had in my entire life!)\nmashed potato and beef gravy\nflan\nbread pudding with peaches\n\nOf all of the dishes that I sampled, none of them disappointed, rather some were better than others.
