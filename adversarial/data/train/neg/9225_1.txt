I wish I could give this disgusting place no stars at all. I struggled to find something good about it, I suppose the fact the toilet flushes is about it. Past that, the bathroom has a light out, the towels didn't seem so clean, no hair dryer, the AC is crazy hard to use- I had to call housekeeping for help but they didn't know how either and then sort of got it working but I had to call them again when it was leaking water down the wall and they told me to leave it off AND the remote to it was broken anyway, the toilet seat is half off the toilet, the wall has a few big ass gouges into the drywall, the TV remote wasn't working and when housekeeping was here about the AC I mentioned the TV- they checked and confirmed then confiscated the remote. Oh, and that's all before mentioning how cheesy the gimmicky place is which is a total gross sex hotel- the kind some creepy old dude who's still \"kinda married\" with the weak stache would take you to. There's two in the lobby now, even. Creeper hotel for sure. Afraid to touch surfaces, and certainly NOT using a black light or the in room hot tub (that's how you get STD's kids). Yuck yuck yuck I want to leave.\n\nAnd I didn't even get to the check in- took for freaking ever and the girl who checked me in was SO rude. I was answering a question she ask me and then phone rang and she just picked it up and then had a very casual weird convo with the other person while I'm RIGHT THERE. It was clearly someone she knew, she finally said \"ugggghhhhhhh!!!!\" And slammed the phone receiver down to the base with an eye roll. Seriously.\n\nSeriously, stay elsewhere. This place sucks. Worst hotel I have ever stayed at.
