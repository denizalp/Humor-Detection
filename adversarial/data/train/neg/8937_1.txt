In the past 24 hours I've received 3 calls from 440-942-8175, with no voicemail left. A quick google search of the phone number lead me to the company Hoernig Heating & AC. I've never contacted this company before... I've never even heard of this company before. I'm assuming they are trying to contact a customer - but then why would you call 3 times within 24 hours and not leave a single message? So unprofessional.
