I bought 10 sessions through Simply Sculpted with the intention of sliming my jawline and lower abs. \n\nAfter purchasing the non-refundable sessions I was informed that the jawline\/face treatment was an additional fee and instead of honoring my 10 sessions - in order to get the same amount of treatment for he target areas - they would only honor 8 of 10 sessions (equating to 4 half hour visits). Ripping off your first clients is not the right approach to starting a new business. \n\nIt would have been good business to either honor my 10 sessions or to knock my socks off with service. Instead, they chose to be stingy, greedy and they actually did not deliver on he value that I had paid for. \n\nThe place is clean and the staff is cordial.\n\nUltimately, I would not do business here again - the results are menial at best. You are better off just spending your time doing cardio and dieting right then to spend money at Simply Sculpted.
