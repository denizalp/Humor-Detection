We went downtown to see the Bodies exhibit, which rocked and then we stopped in for some Lizard fare.  Sorry to report, I ordered the same old, same old - steak wrap with fries.  It's so delicious that I order it every time!  This visit was no disappointment either.\n\nThe steak was cooked perfectly medium and the fries were off the hook, as usual.  I dipped both the wrap and my fries in their yummy BBQ sauce which is conveniently located on every table.\n\nOur server was unusually friendly and talkative.  He was very curious about the Bodies exhibit we had just visited, so we gave him our pamphlet from the event.\n\nAnother great meal!
