Coming from an area where there is a Korea-town nearby, I've been to some really nice Korean restaurants, and Green Pepper didn't even come close to the places I've been in the past. \n\nTo start off, the service is extremely slow. Despite the fact that there were two open tables when I talked into the restaurant, the waiter refused to sit me. When I insisted that they just sit us down for the third time, they simply put two white sheets of paper over the table and then went about their business. Seriously? Just sit down your customers next time, since your waiting area is literally just one small couch that is placed uncomfortably close to another dining table. \nThe waiter I had also had no idea what any of the dishes on the menu were. I get it that the menu is large, but you should probably know what Seafood pancake is if it's literally the most popular appetizer on the menu. \n\nAs for the food, I was not impressed. The Seafood Pancake appetizer looked ok, but was just not really flavored well. Everything was really bland, and the mixture was a bit messy. Also, there just wasn't enough seafood, so it ended up being a salad pancake with an occasional shrimp. \n\nFor the main course, the bulgogi, I was really disappointed. The meat was not even cut like bulgogi should be, which is thin slices. Instead, I received short noodle-like meat cuts that you would find at a Chinese place. The meat was also too sweet so it didn't really taste like Korean bbq. \n\nWhat a disappointment.
