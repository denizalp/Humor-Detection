This is the BEST cappuccino I've ever had. Everything was absolutely delicious!! I had ravioli and he haD lasagna. We shared the soup and salad and both were amazing, ( I loved the salami and cheese in the salad!) wine was house so it was alright but was definitely good enough to not pay extra for! The garlic bread was soaked in garlic-absolutely amaZing! We heard about this place from a local and thankful we did! Soup,salad,  BOTTLE of wine, garlic bread, two entrees and two cappuccinos... $66..nothing better than that.. we are stuffed and have a whole meal basically to take back with us!! \nP.s. There is a little man with an accordion and he's the cutest thing ever, such a nice fun little touch!
