I absolutely love the pharmacy here. They are so helpful and kind. They have helped me several situations including calling my doctor to question directions on a medicine I needed to take that seemed off. Just because I felt uncomfortable. I love my extra care card and use it religiously and therefore I have saved a ton of money! My go to pharmacy and cosmetic, vitamin, health care item store!
