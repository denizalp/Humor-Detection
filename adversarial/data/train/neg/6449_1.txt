I had an enjoyable experience at Golden Nail Lounge. The staff members were courteous and professional. I called ahead to see whether there were any available pedicure appointments, and they were able to quickly accommodate me. They also earned points for being one of the only nail salons, in this area, without gender differential pricing (!!!). Quite a few of the other nail salons impose surcharges for the services offered to men (and the reason for this wasn't glaringly obvious to me). I was visiting from out of the area, but I would certainly return to Golden Nail Lounge in the future. The nail technician that serviced me was way more thorough than others I've had. The only con is that the basic pedicure, here, is a tad pricier than the ones in NYC; but, all in all, it was well-worth it!
