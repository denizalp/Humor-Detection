Amazing.  Authentic Italian.  From the moment you walk in the cozy restaurant, your senses are greeted with the most amazing smells.  We ordered the swaybosa fish (very mild, similar but tastier to a sea bass, in a Francaise batter) and rack of lamb with a wine reduction.  Both cooked to perfection with a side of pasta served with blush sauce.  Our server recommend wines we both completely enjoyed. The chef\/owner (I'm guessing) came and talked with us.  I loved the entire experience and will definitely be back!\n\nI also tried this restaurant because of Restaurant.com.  Clearly stated that you had to order 2 meat or 2 fish (or 1 of each) dishes to use $25 coupon.
