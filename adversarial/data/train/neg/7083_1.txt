This was our second time to this location. Previously when we were here it had been snowing and the place was empty. \n\nThis time we met friends for brunch on a weekend and the place was crazy busy!! We waited approx 15 minutes for a table and it was another 15-20 minutes until our server finally came to take our drink orders. Granted she did stop by and drop off water (thankfully because it was smoking hot out!). There is a small patio area as well.\n\nThe food was consistent as always which is why I still gave this experience the 4\/5 stars.
