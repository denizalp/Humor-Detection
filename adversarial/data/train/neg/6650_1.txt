Working for a couple of days next door I visited Koffee Kup for lunch twice, the first time I had the meatloaf which I thought was pretty run of the mill the second time the wing plate and that was by far the winner. Huge wings paired with great mac and cheese, greens, corn bread and a sweet tea and now we have a meal. Its true cafeteria style soul food cooking and its very affordable. Not everything on the menu is great but one thing that is divine is the peach cobbler, save yourself some room for it if you can.
