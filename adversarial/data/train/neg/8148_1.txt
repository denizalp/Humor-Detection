By far the bottom of the list for Pho in the nearby area. There are at least 6 Phoenix restaurants in a 2 mile radius and unfortunately we choose Pho King this time. Over salted, lukewarm, and overpriced are the three comments we both agreed on. My Pho was served without noodles as well. I had to ask if that's how they served it and they added cold noodles to the already lukewarm broth. Even the garnish bar was sad. Empty trays missing limes, basil, and jalape√±os. The staff should spend more time taking care of customers, cleaning, and replenishing rather than gossiping and texting. We were truly disappointed and left still hungry.
