I was in the flamingo \/215 area when gf proclaimed it's dinner time - first thought was a burger but found out kilroys kitchen is not open ( also noticed while driving to kilroy's that joe's crap shack closed - that surprised me. ) We were then thinking bbq - i prefer Buzz but the gf wanted to give Famous Dave's \" one last chance .\" \n\nI've now been to this location two times, and the Blue Diamond spot three times. \n\nFor a \"chain\" the place ain't bad. As with most bbq places, they have consistency problems - especially the brisket and pulled pork - of the 2, i favor the brisket. The chicken is ok but truthfully, i try to avoid bbq chicken when i hit a bbq place. \n\nI like the sauce variety, love the corn muffins and the mac and cheese works for me. the ribs were meh , the bread pudding - love the sauce the bread is way to light for my taste - more french toast like then bread pudding. \n\nI'll stick with Buzz but in a pinch, sure, I'll hit Famous Dave's ( even if their commercial's annoy me ! )
