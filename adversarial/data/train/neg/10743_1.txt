If you love pinball you should LOVE this place. They have new and old machines and some that are very old and most of the machines are in good condition and working order. They also have old school arcade games that i remember playing as a kid after not eating and saving my lunch money so i could stop at Farrell's or the local liquer store on the way home from school to play my favorite games and get my daily fix, haha. I remember getting really good at some of the games i played and played for hours and hours on one quarter. . .good memories, great times. When Shanna and i went to the Pinball Hall of Fame it was literally a return to innocence for me.
