Went in to get an oil change but they were busy and seemed to only have one tech to do the job.\n\nThe service writer seemed confused about the correct oil to employ and took an attitude when I questioned why he was using my license plate to figure it out.\n\nThen he decided to ignore me and help another customer who had arrived after me.\n\nSo I decide to vote with my feet (and money).
