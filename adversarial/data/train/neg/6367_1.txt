This place is my favorite spot in town to go to for sushi. Its not the cheapest but if you go at night during the week (Sunday-Thursday) they have a happy hour roll list and that is definitely the way to go. Everyone here is super nice. The manager Kim is absolutely amazing. I also love the servers. You can tell when one of them is new but we have all been there. The food is amazing. Everything is fresh. The fish is to die for and the rolls are fantastic. They make the rolls pretty big so be ready to take a big bite. I usually go with no rice so I don't fill up as fast because once you start eating your not going to want to stop.\n\nHands down when I don't know what I want for dinner I will order to go from here. I always get cravings for their sushi and no other restaurant comes close to satisfying my cravings.\n\n\nO and if you want spectacular service ask for Kayla or Kristen to be your waitress. They are hands down the best and have been there the longest so they know what they are talking about when recommending rolls.\n\n\nMake sure you get there early if your not willing to wait for a table because they fill up pretty fast. If there is a large group they fill up even faster because the space is so small, so not the best for 10+ groups, but they will accommodate. There is no open seating even at the sushi bar, they will seat you. \n\n\n**They will modify every type of roll for your needs, gluten free, vegetarian, or even if you just want the chef special. Make sure you ask for Luis to make your chef special, the way the food comes out looks like art work.
