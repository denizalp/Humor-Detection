I am a patient of Dr. Strohman. He has a remarkable ability to actively listen and understand anything you are trying to express to him, all while quickly typing notes into the laptop during the description of pain, etc..  I've been around the block with plenty of doctors for plenty of reasons. This guy is as solid as they come. He communicates exceptionally well, has extensive knowledge on pretty much all related topics. If you are looking for a Dr. in the area check him out!  \n\nDon't be put off by the mini membership thing they do, I've read people making remarks. I have found appt availability to be pretty much a non issue and communication to be far better than other offices.
