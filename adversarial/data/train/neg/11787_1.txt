The good: the crust is crunchy, light and airy. The sweet peppers were fresh and delicious. The not so good: lack of cheese, sauce taste like generic store-bought, and it took 15 minutes to get three slices of pizza. Also the slices are not very big I could easily eat five of them. Not like what I'm used to with my home town square pizza place. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. Don't believe the hype.
