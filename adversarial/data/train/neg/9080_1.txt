Tried  lunch on a Tuesday when they have cafe style pre-prepared sand which,  salads & healthy protein bowl. All the selections were tasty & unique. Can't  wait to return for dinner as the cafe lunch is a quantum step better than other restaurants made to order lunches.  My first meal here & I'm a huge fan . Friendly welcoming  staff with a relaxed and professional vibe. Field Table is a Madison dining treasure.
