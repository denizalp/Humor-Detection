I checked out this bakery because I was in the area but I must disagree with all the hype.\n\nThe photos looked promising so I entered with high hopes but unfortunately, their bread reminded me of T&T bread but with higher prices. Overall, their bread was too dough-y for my liking and the jams and fillings tasted artificial. The samples swayed me away from buying the ones that came with one (ironic?). I bought the sweet taro loaf (didn't have a sample) and it had clumps of fake taro and cream cheese. It wasn't terrible, but just wasn't my cup of tea. \n\nKnowing that I can get better quality bread and desserts for the prices they are charging, I don't think I will be back. This may be biased because I am usually not the biggest fan of asian-style bakeries!
