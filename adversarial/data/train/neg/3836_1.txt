I am a pro at eating pastizzi! I am half Maltese! Thank goodness a young Latin family took over to continue this historical hideaway in Etobekoke! A timeless Maltese bake Shoppe! The best part is that Easter is next week and I already got my Figolli! I must learn how to master this Easter dessert! I'll be off to visit my 94 years young Maltese Grandmother now to find out how! I hope these awesome and friendly people create a Pastizzi with Queso Duro!now that's Maltese-Latino fusion!
