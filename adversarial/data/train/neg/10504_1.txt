Saw Metal Skool here a few weeks ago, and it was a great show. I'm used to seeing them at Key Club, which is a significantly larger place--so it was cool getting up close and rocking out. Bartenders aren't snooty like many of them are in LA. Drink prices aren't ridiculous either--pretty reasonable for Vegas.
