I was excited to learn of a new Sprouts in the area, as the one I went to before seemed small and crowded. This new one on Elliot was much more comfortable shopping, w\/a great variety of goods. \n\nSomeone had mentioned problematic parking in their rating, which I did experience. The few handicapped spaces were taken so I had to park near basket area. Quite challenging as I had my disabled mom with me in wheelchair.\n\nBut, I am giving the store full stars anyway because I left my purse on the basket lane outside while struggling to get mom back into car, and load wheelchair. I left the purse there ....OUCH!\n\nOnce on road and then realizing my error, I panicked my way back to the store. I rushed inside and Trent, the cashier gave me a kind acknowledgement nod, even before I spoke, to indicate all was ok. Liz the manager had found the purse outside and brought it inside to process. She had a kind happy spirit about her, and accepted a hug. (I need to find a gift for her, but I am more financially desperate than average person as I have had to drastically cut back on work due to care for my mother)\n\nGood people still exist, and I found proof of two of them and they work at Sprouts. Not all stores give a care.
