Sunday I came here with my ex... that's not the bad part... LOL He bought me a chicken shwarma pita and an ice tea and he didn't order any food. I usually love it here... he gave her a $20 she asked if he needed change... He wasnt trying to tip her $9.00 For an $11.00 meal. When his change arrived she had shorted him his change by about $5.00  When I noticed she shorted him she left to get change, but acted it it was an inconvinience...
