Went here twice the first time they tried to convince me my teeth were gonna fall out and that my gums were so infected I needed a $3000 surgery to fix them. Then when I argued they said oh ur right I was looking at the wrong client chart like what??? Then I went back a second time and thought it could have been a mistake so the next time they told me I had 2 cavities which I found off bc I brush and floss regularly and haven't had one since I was a kid so I got a second opinion and they told me I had no cavities at all
