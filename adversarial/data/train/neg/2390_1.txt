This Medical Facility is an Utter Disasterous Joke. Staff as you arrive never smile and make eye contact with you- just all business and flat dull personalities. They're also very incompetent, they once handed me another patient's paperwork as I was discharged- Huge Hippa violation!  Then today it was reported to me by my pharmacist that my D.O.B. was incorrect on their records received from WFP.  About a week ago I arrived for an appointment they had texted me for and the girl @desk told me that she had nothing scheduled for me and couldn't explain why or what appointment I was supposed to be there for?  I walked out and left irritated as she sat there saying nothing looking dazed and confused. I have absolutely no faith or trust in this Medical Facility and am now faced with searching for a primary care dr and new medical clinic to go to. This is unfortunate as I really like my Physician Assistant I've been seeing Laurie Silicato and she's only practicing at WFP.  If your seeking quality healthcare and friendly knowledgeable organized staff- goes elsewhere as you will not find it at Warner Family Practice!  Based upon all their Epic fails, I have to wonder if they mixed up my Bloodwork and Lab results?Sure hope not. Have to rate them 1 star, but in reality I would choose -10 stars!
