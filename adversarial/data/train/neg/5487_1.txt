This is some pretty good ramen.  Simple means no complaints.  None.  At all.\n\nTry the Red Devil Ramen with extra pork, which is a very spicy Tonkotsu.  I added extra pork, which was on account of just getting dumped by my special lady friend (It's complicated).  Anyways, the gyoza appetizer \"really tied the room together.\"\n\nNow go get your soup on!
