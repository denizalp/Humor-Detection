Heading up to a playoff football game and found this gem on the way up! I had the house soup and a sampler platter and was all great. Soup was so good when I return I will get some pig tails to accompany it. Brisket and pulled pork were excellent with the house bbq sauce and the wings with hot bbq sauce had the right heat with a touch of sweet, but the star imo was the ribs! The ribs were so tender and had a great Smokey and sweet flavor! The service was fast and friendly on a packed Saturday night we got in at the bar and were in and out. After placing our order appetizer was there in minutes followed by the main dish almost as soon as we finish our appetizer. A great dining experience!
