I recently moved to this area from Centennial Hills and my initial impression of this Ulta has been very poor. The staff never greets me when I come in to the store about every other week and I always have to seek assistance when an employee is standing in my vicinity chit chatting. This review is based off of at least 4 visits I have made. And I doubt I'll keep going back. The Ulta I use to frequent on N Durango and Deer Springs exceeds on customer service, I think this store needs to freshen up their skills.
