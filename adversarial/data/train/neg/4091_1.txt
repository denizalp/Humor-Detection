Took a road trip from LA to Austin. We visited Little Miss BBQ on the way down, and just had to stop by again on the way back. Everything's amazing but the fatty brisket and pork ribs were especially good. Pecan pie was also good, but I'd prefer if it was either firmer or gooier (though maybe it was just the heat making it softer than normal).\n\nI was chatting with some of the other people in line that go there regularly and I strongly, strongly recommend getting there around 10am or so, about an hour before they open. It's the kinda place where the wait is always about an hour AND where they slowly run out of the best cuts. You either get there an hour before they open, park in the lot, wait in the shade, and get any cuts you want by 11:15; or you get there at 12, park three blocks away, wait in the sun, get to the counter by 1:30, and find out that the brisket and ribs are all gone!\n\nEven if the parking lot is full, pull into driveway first so you can get a ticket from the parking guy if he's working that day (usually when they're super busy). The ticket holds your place in line while you go and find parking which might take another 10 or 15 minutes.
