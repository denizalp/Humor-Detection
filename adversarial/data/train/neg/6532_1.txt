These people are fantastic. In all my years, I have never been to a better and more friendly animal veterinary clinic. The staff there are so helpful and very friendly. Great care facility for pets. Our vet ( Dan), took his time and ensured that the right diagnosis and treatment plan was in place for our puppy. They were very cost friendly and invited all and any input. Dan is probably, one of the best vets, I have ever had the opportunity to meet. Great experience ....all the way around!!
