If you are in the mood for meatballs, Sienna Mercato (Emporio) will come through just fine.  A neat open air layout with refreshing decor located in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nThe majority of the dishes revolve around the wonder that is a meatball!  It is almost like you are building a Lego set as you follow the step by step directions in the menu and then they are properly reinforced by the server:\n1. Select your meatball...(4 or 5 different flavorful blends).  Be sure to be on the lookout for the Daily Meatball, which is what I selected at the recommendation of our sever.  The \"Daily\" on my particular visit was the hot sausage.\n2. Select your Sauce... 8 or so different sauces to choose from.   I found the Parmesan to be quite delightful.\n3. Serving Options...  Sliders, Grinder, Panini or just straight balls and sauce.  I opted for the panini style and it did not disappoint.\n\n\nThe food menu may not be that diverse but SM makes up for it with a fantastic beer list.  A great selection of tap handles with the crafts of Pittsburgh well represented.  I went for Fat Head's Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale and it was darn good!\n\nThis is a simple one and a trend that I have observed at more and more restaurants but SM keeps a bottle filled with fresh water on the table.  This is a nice touch and one that is well appreciated by this diner.\n\nService was on point and not too pricey.  I am throwing my endorsement behind this one.
