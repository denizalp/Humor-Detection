We had reservations at another restaurant but last minute changed to this one...we felt taken care of throughout the evening.. The crab cake appetizer is a must...\nThe food wait was a bit long but worth the wait..we had the lamb and was undecided on the other dinner.. The waiter offered to split dishes...the food was tasteful and I absolutely loved the bread!!!  One of the dishes may have been a little heavy handed on the salt.. But the waiter was gracious and comped it!! Nevertheless it was a good change.... I would recommend this restaurant !!!
