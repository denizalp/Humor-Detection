This was my second experience with an escape room. We did the bomb diffusal and Las Vegas room. We had a Groupon which they let us apply to both rooms as we originally only went in for one room. Clean, complex puzzles, good use of atmosphere and themes. Rooms are on the classic, \"simpler\" side, in both cases the escape was single room only. Mainly numbers, locks, passwords, keycodes. Limited use of devices, technology, and mechatronics. Would go back to try and solve the remaining rooms.
