Not that great. I felt this place was a MAJOR let down. It was 23 dollars for two dry burgers and fries. They got my order wrong too. I'm only giving two stars because the fat fries were okay enough, even they didn't have much flavor. Wishing we went to Subway or McDonalds  instead. But at least we tried it ourselves.
