If you have had to find an endocrinologist in the Valley, you know they are difficult to 1) find, 2) find in a convenient location and 3) get an appointment. After having been going to a doctor over 40 minutes from my house, I found this group. They are great. Dr. Knecht is one of the best I have seen. My only complaint is that sometimes the wait is long but honestly, it is worth it!! Highly recommend.
