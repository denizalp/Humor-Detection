I know that few people resort to Yelp reviews before ordering pizza, let alone from major chains like Dominos, but after repeated shortcuts I cant help but rant a little.\n\nEvery time I order the cheesy bread, instead of being 8 slices of bread ready for dipping, it is uncut and I need to cut it myself. I know this shouldn't be a dealbreaker but seriously, 3 of 3 times uncut? Ridiculous!\nAlso because when you order a large pizza its cut into 8 slices, I once asked for it to be cut into 10 slices instead to help with portioning, but sure enough, still only 8 slices and a completely uncut cheesey bread.\n\nThe pizza is is fine in taste and when you order online at least there are no surprises with the price when it shows up, but sometimes its the little things that can turn one away.
