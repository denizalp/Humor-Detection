Please don't do business here.  These guys are absolute scumbag liars and they will absolutely rip you off.  They say they are owned by a good Christian family who like to help people, but the manager is definitely not a good Christian guy.  He can't even tell a story the same way twice.  Every word out of his mouth is a lie.  Very high pressure tactics, they will send you on your merry way with a car, then three weeks later try to double the payment you agreed to, then try to get you to switch to a much crappier car than you originally agreed to, withhold your own car from you, and basically try to bully you into buying from them.  Worst experience ever.  Do NOT trust them.  They take absolute advantage of poor people and will try to steal your money.
