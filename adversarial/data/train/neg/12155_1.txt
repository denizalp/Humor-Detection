Had Chica for brunch on Christmas Day and really enjoyed it.  There was no wait for a party of three.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and felt light and open.  The service wasn't as great from our waitress.  I felt that she was a bit slow to take our orders and it was hard to find her when we needed anything.  The food I thought was great.  We got the trio appetizer\/shared plate which had the tortilla chips, plantain chips with three different dips.  All dips were flavorful and distinct and the chips were all freshly made.  My husband had the octopus and I thought it was just okay.  Wasn't in the mood for seafood so that may be why I didn't find it as enjoyed, but it is a small plate served with peppers.  For my meal, I got the Cuban Sandwich and thought it was great.  It came with a side of fries as well which had a nice seasoning to it.  The Cuban Sandwich was one of the better ones I've ever tasted.  The bread to meats and cheeses were a fantastic combination, very filling and flavorful.  I would definitely order that again.  I was only able to finish half of it and took the other half home.  Even after nuking it in the microwave, the sandwich still tasted as delicious as the first time.  Would definitely come back to Chica to try out some of their other dishes in the future.
