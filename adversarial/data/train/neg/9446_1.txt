What a great find in a cool neighborhood! We thankfully stumbled upon the Arts District in old Las Vegas...away from casinos and the strip. Wish we had found this area earlier in our trip! Rock'N'oodles is a small, cute restaurant, with a bit of seating for dining inside or outside. All three of us LOVED our dishes and the half portions were plenty. I ordered \"Bang a Gong\" which was Authentic chicken tikka masala, a creamy tomato sauce with garam masala, greek yogurt and cayenne pepper. Served with sautéed spinach and cilantro over orzo pasta. So delicious! We also ordered \"Nights in White Satin\": Linguine pasta with white wine, lemon juice, heavy cream and white truffle oil, with sautéed mushrooms, jumbo shrimp, a kick of red pepper and fresh herbs and one of the salad specials with chicken. It was really difficult to choose just one dish from the menu and the staff was super friendly and helpful as well.\nDefinitely a must do in the Arts District!
