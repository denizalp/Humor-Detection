WARNING!!!!\n\nTook my car in for a leak in perfect driving conditions and at the end had to have my car towed out. They blew my engine and blamed me for it stating I drove it too long with overheating issues. (car never overheated in the years I've owned it!). They offered to help me sell my car parts for cash and when I told them I was still financing, they said they can also help me \"get rid of my loan\" if I wanted! :-O WHAAAAAAAT?!?!? \n\nWorst part, never signed anything when I dropped off my car so I had nothing to show if I wanted to take them to court. Grrrrrrr!!!!!\n\nYou've been warned.
