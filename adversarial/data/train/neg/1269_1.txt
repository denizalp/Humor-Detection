I'd rate zero stars if it let me. There are literally no good reviews of this company and yet the only other option we have is Dish network(in McFarland). I'm about to pay the $20 more a month for Dish, though I already know I'll be dealing with outtages everytime it storms. \nI have a laundry list of all the reasons why this company blows. We've been without internet for over a week beacause they are clueless. 100 different \"departments\" that dont' communicate. They knew they needed a bucket lift to get to our cable pole and yet they still show up and the guy says, \"my ladder won't reach, you'll have to reschedule.\" Are you friggin kidding me. How hard it is. Not only should our account me noted, we told them directly, \"You. Need. A. Bucket. Truck.\" \nI hate you Charter. Internet is floating around in the air and for some reason, we all have to pay for it. You suck.
