I have been going to Gino's for nearly ten years for auto repair work. They've treated me well every single time. As folks have mentioned, they are knowledgeable, honest, hardworking and communicative. Underscoring all of this is the small business, personable feel of the relationships they establish with customers. I highly recommend them.
