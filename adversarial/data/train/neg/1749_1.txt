What a great place to work out!   The coaches and trainers are all professional and have certificates to train and are knowledgeable in all areas of interest, from functional fitness, circuit training, boxing, MMA,  weights to cardio.   They have it all.   Even if you are not a client of a trainer they will go out their way to help out.  In addition to the trainers the participates encourage each other  to get to the next level.  The energy is high and friendly.  I can understand why my trainer Carolyn Vanzlow moved to this fantastic place.  The owner Marcus is so Awesome. A job well done  Marcus!!
