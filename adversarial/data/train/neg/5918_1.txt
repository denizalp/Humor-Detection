6\/11\/16, we celebrate mother's 90th birthday at the brunch buffet, the food was just okay, but service were very very BAD, very very RUDE waitress. First brought us wrong drinks, when we ask to correct, she argue with us said that's what we ordered, then rudely threw a plate of tea bags on the table (not in front of the person who drink hot tea), we ask to speak to manager, she said if we don't like her service, we can change to other table. WOW, what a shocker, a well trained waiter or waitress will never ARGUE with customer.  The manager, Mr. Luc Andres came, explain what happened, he apologize to us, gave us another server to help us, even made candle and piece cake(from buffet of course) with Happy Birthday song to Mother.  Well, it should be a very happy pleasant meal with Mother on her birthday, but we all lost appetite, its an experience we will never forget, and this place will never show up on our list of buffet restaurant.
