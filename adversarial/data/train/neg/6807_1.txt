Great service and company! Quick to respond to any questions regarding service (I asked many). Diego F. was an outstanding chauffeur and host for our \"Thirty and Thirsty\" Crew. I surprised my friend for her birthday with a Escalade Mini Limo! She was throughly surprised and we had 2 bottles of cold champagne on our ride down the strip and to our hotel. The only negative thing I have to say is that unfortunately our flight was delayed 3 hours (Frontier\/awful horrible experience please don't fly with them) and when our airplane landed (wheels touch the ground) our time starts for the 1 hour we have to get to our hotel in the limo. There just so happen to be another airplane in our terminal so we were there sitting for 45 min before even the first person got off the airplane. When we got to Diego at the baggage claim he told us our hour was already up and we didn't even get to see the limo! It's unfortunate because I had planned my money accordingly in Vegas and wasn't ready for this set back, but I didn't want to disappoint my birthday girl so I told him to add another hour so we could at least make it to our hotel. Diego said he would ask if he could do it by the 1\/2 hour but was unable to. He definitely accommodated us as he could and had an Aux cord for us to play DJ which was cool. I just wish there was a better way for this company to accommodate us... maybe with delayed flights the customer could call when actually exiting the airplane? So things like this don't happen to another customer. We did do round trip, our ride back was nice. Our driver \"Rico\" was very nice, however he didn't have our bottle of champagne I had asked for set up. We had to ask about it, he didn't see it on our reservation... after he checked it he then gave us the bottle and glasses. I still highly recommend this company but I wanted to share my experience so future customers will have an even better experience if they so happen to have the few hiccups like we did.
