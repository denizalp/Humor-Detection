Food was so gooood! Love their rissoto! Got the osso buco risotto the first time, a lot of meat and very tasty. Got the sausage rissotto the second time, not much meat but still very tasty. Friends got the cheese gnocchi and it was delicious. \nRestaurant was quite empty the two times we went without reservation. But for some reason the waitress kept rushing us out. They stopped refilling our water after we paid.
