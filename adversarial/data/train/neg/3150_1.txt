Found this place based on reviews. Hadn't been to a salon to get my hair cut since I was 5, I'd always just trimmed it myself. So I was a bit nervous but I'm sooooo happy with my hair!! Juan took great care of me! He cut off about 13 inches and styled it himself. I want sure what I wanted so he just did he thing. I feel so much more happier and confident. Everyone else working was super nice and the atmosphere was great! Thank you!!
