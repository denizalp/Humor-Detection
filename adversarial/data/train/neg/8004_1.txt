Wow!  This place blows the other Vegas party pools away.\nThey have three pools with round beds with umbrellas in the shallow area to reserve.  In and near the pools are islands with poles for girls, or guys I guess, to dance on that also spray a shower down.  There's a hot tub with a water wall.  The pools are surrounded by lounge chairs and beds that are available by reservation.  Along the west side of the Beach club are two stories of cabanas.  They are away from the crowds to get your privacy, but close enough to still be a part of the action.  I saw three bars and two sets of bathrooms to alleviate the normal ridiculous lines you get elsewhere.  They also have some blackjack and craps tables set up in the elevated bar area that's air conditioned but still open.  There was a sort of snack bar area you could walk up to and order salads, sandwiches, wraps, etc and not have to try to flag down a waitress.  The setup was well thought out and addresses the issues the other pools lack in.\nThe service was outstanding!  I was blown away by how friendly and helpful the staff was.  The bartenders had no problem blending up frozen drinks (another bartender at another pool told us this weekend he couldn't do that for us since it was busy even though its on their menu).  When we walked in, every single employee told us welcome, or thank you for coming.  It felt really nice to know that they were appreciative of the obscene amount of money we were all about to spend there.\nWhat is even more awesome, they have Kaskade playing there every Sunday.  If you don't know who Kaskade is, he is an established house music producer and dj.  So expect to hear some dance music when you come here and not hip hop.  The opening dj played more of top 40 remixes.  \nThey really make this an experience for guests and I can't wait to go back!!
