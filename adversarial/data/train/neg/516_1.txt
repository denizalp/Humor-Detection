I hired Saiaf Films for my wedding, which was in December 2016. The wedding was in Elk Grove, California. When I first found Saiaf films,I was very impressed by their work. I reached out to them to get more information on the types of packages they had. I was at first hesitant to hire someone that was out of state but, I am so glad I did. After talking to Saiaf Films they ensured everything will be done properly and to meet our expectations. Two team members were sent out for my wedding Hisham and Ridwaan. They contacted me when they got into town and met me at the venue. They were very professional and friendly. They were easy to work with. They worked with me on timing. Things were running behind schedule as they do on weddings and they stuck along and went with the flow. They were very friendly with the guest, and my bridesmaids. I got compliments from guest and family about their work. By the time the reception day came(the next day) it felt as they were our friends and apart of the wedding. They made jokes and made us laugh. We had such a good time having them with us to capture our day. \nSince the wedding I've been in contact with another team never Frank, he's been answering all my questions and explained everything to me about what dates I'll be getting my pictures and films. Once I get the final pictures and films I'll update my review and let everyone know how the pictures and films came out. \nSo far I would recommend Saiaf Films to anyone who is looking to hire a photographer\/videographer for their wedding.
