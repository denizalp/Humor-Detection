Ordering process confusing, staff less than friendly(exception being the cashier), luke warm, and in my option a little on the pricy side. I had just watched what looked like amazing nachos being constructed for the guy in front of me in line so I expected the almost $9 burrito I was about to order would be stuffed with ingredients but instead I watched as thin layers of components were added. Burrito was not even served to me hot enough for the cheese to melt inside; left me wondering why they bother to wrap it in foil then serve it to you on a styrofoam plate. At the soda machine I was interjected by a fellow diner who told me there's better spots to try on the east side of town.
