Tried out this new and already very popular restaurant last Friday. We went in early-ish  (6 to me is early) and found the place packed. We got the last seats in the house before they went on a wait.\n\nAs others have noted, there are a lot of tall tops, but we sat at one of the few tables behind the wall at the entrance. I will agree that any of us who find we carry weight in our hips\/thighs could find these seats pretty uncomfortable. I was good to go, thankfully, but I can see where if I were up just another size or two it would be painful, and that would be embarrassing. I wonder how long they'll keep those chairs.\n\nOur server was incredibly attentive, professional and helpful. Five stars for service. I didn't see anyone wanting\/waiting for anything while we were there.\n\nThe food was okay. Not fantastic, but it's a bar essentially, so you get decent quality bar food. As it was still Happy Hour we ordered half price appetizers - chips and salsa and hummus. The chips and salsa were just sad. A tiny cup of salsa, and a handful or so of chips on a plate. Not worth the money, even at half price, certainly nothing special. The hummus was delicious and served with pita, carrots and celery.\n\nMy husband ordered the steak tips, and was disappointed by the blandness of the rice. It would be better served with mashed potatoes rather than just a formed mound of white rice with no flavor. (I don't like rice, to me it has no flavor anyway, but my husband fixes and devours a lot of it and even he pronounced it \"incredibly bland\" as he reached for the salt shaker.) \n\nOh, a word about the shakers... Pour the salt in your hands first. They have a ton of holes and you'll get a bucket of salt dumped on your meal if you just shake from it.\n\nI tried the fish sandwich and pretty much just ate it like fish and chips, because it was less food and cheaper than the fish and chips and I didn't have a huge appetite after the appetizers. My meal was solid.\n\nThe biggest problem we have with this restaurant is visiting during the heat of the summer. It was 85+ degrees outside, and with that awesome cool garage door set up opened, it was very hot and stuffy inside. There were no fans anywhere near our tables. I saw one small set of fans over the bar area, but that's it. \n\nHere in Charlotte, in the summer, you can either go for cool air conditioning or sweltering \"ambiance\" you can't have both. They need to keep that door closed and the restaurant air conditioned in the summer.\n\nIt sounds like I hate this place. Really, I don't. The restaurant is new, but it has great potential. Clearly they hired good servers, and they're trying this whole menu for the first time so I'm sure there will be changes.\n\nWe will be back to BSH sometime, but with those garage doors and the heat issues inside the restaurant, we probably won't return until the fall.
