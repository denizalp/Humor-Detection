Very good food.  I had the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef and my wife had the Saigon Stir Fry.  I would recommend mine over hers, but both were good.  Good ambiance, but we took our 2-year old...and the staff was very patient and helpful making sure we kept a happy baby at our table.  They do not have it on the menu, but they fixed a chicken and rice meal for her...she loved it.  I highly recommend if you are looking for good Asian food...hit up Saigon Kitchen.
