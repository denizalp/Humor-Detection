Had dinner here last night and was very pleased! We both ordered pasta dishes and the grilled octopus. The octopus was a little over cooked but absolutely delicious! Both pasta dishes came out steaming hot and cooked to perfection. I had the gluten free pasta which was likely the best I have ever had. \n\nI would give 5 stars except our server had no idea about the wine list and instead of taking the time to ask, he served me a sickly sweet glass of wine when I specifically said that I did not like sweet at all. The servers should be educated on the wine list...it's an Italian restaurant after all. \n\nWould definitely go back again!
