Well my wife and I dealt with Erin Omally. She was very nice and got all of the houses we wanted to look at in a timely manner.\n\nShe was also very knowledgeable in all aspects of buying a home and the steps involved! Overall she was a great Realtor and we would defiantly buy another home with her help!
