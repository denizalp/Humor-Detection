My dealer quoted me $1,800 to replace my front exhaust pipe so I headed for Quick Muffler where they did the work for $140. \nThe staff is super friendly, and the shop is immaculate. The work was done in less time than it took me to drive to my dealership. \nNext time I need an oil change or other repair I am heading here first.
