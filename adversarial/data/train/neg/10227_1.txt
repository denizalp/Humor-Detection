Came here for happy hour in Sunday.\n\nEnvironment: the classy restaurant has a nice dimly lit lounge area where you can enjoy their happy hour from 4-7 every night. They have live performances with talented singers, and even have a table that is directly connected to the piano sometimes used. The restaurant is pretty high class, so most people are dressed in resort attire although I don't think it is mandatory.\n\nService: the Bartenders were really nice and gave some suggestions that really made my cocktail and experience enjoyable. The food also came out quickly.\n\nDrinks: I only have been here for happy hour. I'm sure their main menu is much more expensive but the happy hour is a really good deal with cheaper shareable foods and a wide range of different martinis. My favorite martini is he cucumber which was great with gin and I also really like the blackberry. There are so many options, but most taste good. The tuna tacos were also amazing, it was small but Hsu the perfect bite of fresh tuna, some veggies and a little heat. The sliders were also really delicious, they were warm, the meat was thinly sliced and melts in your mouth with a little mayo sauce inside.\n\nOverall, great experience. Probably a little expensive, but a nice spot to take a date or a friend and try a bunch of different martinis and appetizers.
