one of the best middle eastern restaurants in Phoenix metropolitan area. owned by a kind Iraqi gentleman who is very friendly and welcoming. Food is amazing, you have to try lamb kuzi. Always pay attention to the daily specials as some of them are AMAZING! lentil soup is one of the best. I like their lemonade as well. A good place to invite friends to.
