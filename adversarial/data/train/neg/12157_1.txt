Was looking forward to sushi and miso soup for quite awhile since I moved to Lakewood. There's just no place close around here.  I was disappointed. Sushi was just fair in taste. Fair presentation. Fair miso soup. While ingredients were good it lacked something and seemed vinegar ish. I guess I got spoiled at high end Japanese.  Sad to say I will not return.
