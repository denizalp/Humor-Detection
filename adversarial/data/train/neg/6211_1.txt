I was visiting Madison for a day when I went to Ancora to pick up a latt√©. This was the cafe closest to where I was staying and I walked there when it was raining. Fortunately, the walk was well worth the coffee and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. While I did not spend time, the ambience seemed very homely. I would definitely frequent this place if I were to ever live in Madison.
