Excellent location and lovely garden atmosphere with live jazz entertainment. We enjoyed a relaxing dinner.  Fermiere crepe, with veal and vegetables in an herb sauce, was delicious. The French onion soup was also very good. The menu was large enough that everyone in our party found something they liked. Waiter was friendly and service was excellent. We would definitely come back.
