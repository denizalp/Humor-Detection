Easy to schedule appointment, bought a groupon for what looked like a thorough tune up. The result of the tune up was not as we had hope however the technician was very negative and rude. We recently purchased the home and had a complete home inspection which included the AC unit. AC unit was reported to be functional but needed cleaning and adjusting secondary to the temperature output of the cool air. The technician from Penguin Air reviewed the unit, plugged and unplugged parts, etc. At the end of his visit the unit was left not working and told we would need to purchase an entire whole new unit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWe called someone else for a second opinion who repaired what was broken.... truly believe the work this technician did caused the unit to stop functioning.
