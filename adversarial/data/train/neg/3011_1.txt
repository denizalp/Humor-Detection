My boyfriend and I went for brunch last Sunday. We were thoroughly impressed with how smoothly the service was considering it was the first brunch service since the restaurants opening. The service was great and the food came out in a timely fashion. As expected, the food was delicious. I got the lobster frittata and he got the pork belly eggs Benedict, both were delicious. Overall, it was a great experience.
