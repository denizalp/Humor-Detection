I went here for the first time as a part of a Yelp event for new hires. My friend Amanda just got hired so I was especially excited to be able to share the experience with her. We went during the afternoon, and it had a very laid back vibe, which I really enjoyed. I only had a beer and some tacos (which were AMAZING!) so my overall experience was somewhat limited. But in the short time i spent there I was definitely impressed, and will be back very soon.
