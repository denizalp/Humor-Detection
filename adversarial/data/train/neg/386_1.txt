I had been following Saiaf for years before I got married on 1\/17\/2018. I immediately knew I was going to hire them. He called me after I sent an inquiry and we agreed on everything, he sent me my contract, and I paid for the service.The day of my wedding two team members arrived exactly when I had asked (Saiaf and one other person who may have been training because he kept giving him directions). \n\n-Their bronze package was more affordable than a lot of other options \n-VERY friendly, engaged, and felt like they were part of our wedding not just strangers shooting a wedding\n-Took any shots we requested and were very patient \n-I received my photos to choose my 500 exactly 2 months after my wedding (3\/6\/18). However, I feel like I got everything off the sd card. There's accident shots, blurry pictures, several pics of the videographer setting up, repeats. This makes it harder for me to choose my photos because it's cluttered. I assumed those 2 months they would have narrowed it down to the best pictures and I choose from that.\n-There are certain shots missing that I wish I had (there's none of my buffet or band, none of all my accessories together or a nice shot of my customized cake knives) so you do need to be very specific if there's something you want. \n-The pictures are nice, I haven't seen my videos yet. \n\nCould one of my friends with a really nice camera have taken these pictures? Yup. The majority of the pictures have something I would expect a professional photographer to avoid i.e. back of peoples heads, half a person's face, off center (or if they didn't, delete them from the album you send me!!). But it does take a burden away when you know you have someone dedicated to just photo and video. \n\nOverall, not disappointed but also had higher expectations from Facebook and Vimeo.
