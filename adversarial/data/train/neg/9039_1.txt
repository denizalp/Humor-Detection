I received the best prenatal massage from Selina. She took her time and paid attention to my concerned areas including the best head rub, she is only available Sunday and Monday's I believe but so worth it. I recommend this location to anyone for the front office staff are just as great as the therapist. Very friendly and organized, I wish I had kept my membership to continue at this location instead of cancelling due to the park west's location.
