We had some laminate work done in November 2016. Jose and crew were the installers and we couldn't be happier with the work. From the office staff down to the last worker, our experience was positive throughout. We also had some stairs that were a little tricky to work with. That's really where their expertise shines through. Complete confidence and satisfaction with Affordable Flooring.
