I have been a big crawfish fan for a really long time.  And I have been going to the boiling crab for over 10 years.  First originally starting in orange county then.. Then they opened a few more in LA .  Well after a few years they have been really terrible always running out of crawfish only offering us frozen crawfish ... charging us for every little stupid thing.\n\nThen I was vacationing in Vegas and really needed my Cajun crawfish craving fix... So i yelped  and saw this urban crawfish place.  So we decided to try it.  Let me just say I will never go back to the boiling crab ever again!!! \nThis place is the bomb!!!Hands-down the best crawfish place I have ever tasted!!!! The sauce is perfection... So flavorful and had the perfect amount of heat ..Their service was awesome too.   \n\nEvery time I come down to Las Vegas I will definitely stop by this urban crawfish place!!! . \nThank urban crawfish you've gained another costomer!!
