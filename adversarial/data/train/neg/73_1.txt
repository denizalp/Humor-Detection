Dr. Kyle Waltz, has been a salvation-healing in my life.\nFor many years I have been suffering from very strong migraines and headaches regularly.\nI went to several specialists, including neurologists, until I came to think that it was my vision.\nThe first consultation Dr. Kyle told me something I will never forget: people leave the chiropractor as a last resort, and should be the first.\nHe performed x-rays. He studied my case, he gave me a lot of advice. He did a personalized follow-up that nobody ever did. Adjustments. \nAfter some sessions, my headaches and migraines disappeared. All the staff is very friendly. I have no words to thank him so much. I recommend him totally. He is an excellent professional.\nNow I go from time to time for maintenance and this week I will go for the therapeutic massages. \nThose who suffer stress, headaches, have pain in shoulders, etc ... do not miss visiting. It is not one of those doctors who make you go every day, and the most important thing is that when I went, I did not have insurance, their prices are very affordable. I live in Ballantyne, but I travel there, (having so many chiropractors closer) because it's totally worth it.
