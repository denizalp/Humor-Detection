If you like hot dogs you MUST go to Happy Dog.  I suggest you go hungry. The dogs are the best and the toppings are over the top (pun intended).  Seriously, you must try it.  They only do hot dogs and they do them extremely well.  Great service, yummy food, casual atmosphere and later in the evening all types of live music.  This is a go to spot for me, once you try it, it will be for you too.
