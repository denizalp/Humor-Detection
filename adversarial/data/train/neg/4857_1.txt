This place was recommended to me by a coworker and boy it has not disappointed. They've got something for everyone here. The flavors are spot on! It's now a place I need to visit every time I'm here in Vegas. The lines are long but they move fast. Trust me...The line is worth the wait!! I recommend their Slut item. By far the best Item on the menu. Ask for extra baguette and add a side of bacon if you need a meat item.
