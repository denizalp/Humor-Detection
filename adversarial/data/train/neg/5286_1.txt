* Only used delivery service on Uber Eats\n\nI was skeptical because I had not been here for YEARS. Recently looked at their menu again and a lot was added. There's a tone of options on the menu for everyone.\n\nWhat was ordered:\n- Chicken Parmesan\n- Triple Fruit Smoothie (Pineapple, banana & orange)\n- Strawberry Banana Smoothie\n- Strawberry, banana, pineapple smoothie\n- The Cracked Manhattan Steak\n- Turkey Burger\n- Crispy Calmari\n\nAll in all everything was pretty good, including portion size. Calamari is really delicious. I'm sick of them now because I overdid it. Wouldn't get the turkey burger again it kind of made me want to gag. All smoothies were great except for the triple fruit smoothie..not bad at all just didn't enjoy it that much.\nSteak was pretty on point too.
