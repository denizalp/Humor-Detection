When we came here to get some cough syrup for my daughter's cough, we were unaware that Banner had taken over this particular urgent care facility.  If we had known it was now a Banner urgent care, we would have gone somewhere else due to previous service issues with their front desk staff at other locations. The woman at the front desk on this occasion was incredibly short and rude to my husband. This was not our first time at this facility so we handed over our insurance cards, expected to pay our copay and get on with our visit. Apparently Banner health does not accept our copay and the woman was very rude when informing my husband to 'read the sign' about payment information. The only good thing we encountered on our visit is that they still have the same physician Peter T. He is great.
