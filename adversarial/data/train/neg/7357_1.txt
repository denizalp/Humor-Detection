We traveled a group of female athletes to Tempe for a week of practice to escape the snow and prep for spring season.  \n\nI called and set up a reservation for a group of 34 in advance on NYE.  The manager and staff were all very accommodating, friendly and were prepared when we arrived.  The menu has TONS of options- healthy with good protein and carb options.\n\nWe received our food in a timely manner and I was very pleased that our bill was reasonable for 34 people!\n\nLoved it and plan to return next year with the same group.
