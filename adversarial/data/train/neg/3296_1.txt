----------------------------\nUpdate: we made it to Texas in great shape! Everything was the same as we had it in Vegas except for a 1\" scratch on the side of a table from all the moving around--the roads were pretty bumpy and we had to brake hard a couple times--we were so impressed that this was the only piece that had even a small scratch on it! Thanks again!\n----------------------------\nThis was the absolute best moving experience I've ever had! These guys were inexpensive, fast, VERY careful, and were so kind.\nI had a 26' foot truck that they professionally packed in no time--they were done WAY before I thought they would be and were very positive, upbeat people. \nAlso, I wrote a 4 companies and this one was the cheapest, which kind of worried me but now I can tell you that they are so good!\nI definitely recommend them!
