Horrible horrible service. Asked a few questions and got kurt unhelpful answers. Shouted because I asked for more tomatoes on my salad. Told everything costs extra. They mix up the salad in advance so you don't get to customize without paying more. When I even questioned this the first words out of the employees mouth were \"call the manager.\"\n\nFood is just ok. meager portions and not customizable. And a big B from the health department on the wall. \n\n\n look at my other reviews I am not some brittle person but this is over the top. Waiting for a call from the manager. If they make it right I will update.
