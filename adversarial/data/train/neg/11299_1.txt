Another great cirque show.\n\nProduction was great.  Sound quality was very good.  A cool lighting effect with lots of lights on \"strings\" hanging down.\n\nAcrobatics, dance, music all very well done!  Sometimes there is so much going on its hard to take it all in. No need to buy the most expensive seats, mid level seats seemed just fine to me.
