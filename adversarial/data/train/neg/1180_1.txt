Hotel's pool bottom has a small section with see through glass to lobby, which is pretty cool. Rooms are just average. I was expecting something more at this price point.\n\nReception desk is a little disappointing. We asked for a late check out to take care of something in the area, but reception asked us to come back in the morning to request for it, and the answer was no.
