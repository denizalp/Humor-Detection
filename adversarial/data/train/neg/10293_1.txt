Been going to Frank And Finas for close to 20 years, 30 years if you include Alberto's where Frank got his start. Everything is fresh and on point. My go to dishes are Mole' Enchiladas, Cochanita Pibil (Marinated pork;  a popular Yucat√°n dish), Chile Verde and of course classic Chicken tacos. The salsa is amazing and don't leave without trying a tamarindo Margarita. Only negative is they stopped serving the coconut ice cream (bring it back please) F&F the best on the westside!
