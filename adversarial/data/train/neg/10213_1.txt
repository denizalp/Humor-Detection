I'm usually not a fan of hibachi in general, but I see why Nakama is a favorite for most. Authentic tasting asian hibachi cuisine and atmosphere make this place a sure bet. Conveniently located on the corner of Carson and 18th, Nakama is a popular destination for those looking for sushi and the famous hibachi-grilled meals. \n\nI opted out of the hibachi specials, but my date ordered the sesame chicken and was quite pleased. Don't be alarmed by the higher than usual prices, the portions can feed 2-3 easily. The sushi was prepared well, although it came out after our meals were already served. \n\nIn the past, I've had less than desirable experiences, but this go around, I had no complaint. Great food and good service.
