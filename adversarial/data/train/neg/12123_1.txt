Growing pains!? Great space with lots of screens to watch the game. $5 tall boys of bud during Jays' games, but the beer wasn't very cold. The draft wasn't much better. The food was expensive for what we got. The nachos with beef were $20! They were tasty, but the portion was small...\nWe asked the table beside us what they thought of their food, and they said the same. \"Pricey for what we got.\" Service was good...\nWith a bit of tweaking this place could be great. The fact that it's off the beaten path makes it a \"find\". Better value for money can be found nearby...
