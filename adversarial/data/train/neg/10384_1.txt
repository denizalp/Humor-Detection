My (now husband) and I got my engagement ring and his wedding band here. I had something very specific in mind (a band with diamonds, no center stone) but I had a hard time describing it very well. Eric was incredibly helpful, and so nice and patient! We went to about 12 different places, and I can honestly say we had the best, most personal service here. I am happy to support the business of someone who is so kind and patient!! Would definitely recommend to anyone shopping for jewelry!
