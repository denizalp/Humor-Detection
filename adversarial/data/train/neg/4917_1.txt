A decent hotel that's reasonably priced. \n\nWe came into Vegas on a Sunday night and didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. We chose this La Quinta as it was not too far from the action, a nice looking hotel and fairly priced. \n\nThe hotel itself was in excellent condition and the staff members were all very friendly. The room was clean and inviting. \n\nA couple of minor griefs. We tried to call multiple times before arriving, but no one picked up. When we got there, they told us the hot tub had \"stopped working\" that morning. Honestly, the main reason why we came here is that they advertised as having a pool and hot tub. Oh well. \n\nSince it was still a pleasant stay, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and 4-stars.
