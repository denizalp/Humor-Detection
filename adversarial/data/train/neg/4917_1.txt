I really enjoyed my plate. ... since NOTHING was left on it when I was done.. :) I had a fish taco and cheese enchilada... So delish! I've been to a few spots and had sopa and weren't impressed however the sopa here was good... not too salty. BTW.. I could eat the roasted jalape√±o and onions that they serve with chips every day!\nI also had a frozen Don Julio margarita that was amazing! I will definitely come here again.
