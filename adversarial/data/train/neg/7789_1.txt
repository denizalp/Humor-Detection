My 84 year old dad recently started going to this clinic. The doctor decided that my dad needed to go to PT instead of getting steroid shots, which was the treatment my dad's previous pain dr in San Diego was doing. PT makes no sense for my dad, as his pain is from spinal stenosis causing his spinal cord to be pinched between two vertebrae and needing hip replacement surgery. My dad didn't understand what the doctor explained to him as to the reasoning for this. I have called the doctor three times and emailed three times over the last three weeks. No response from the doctor, and I know for a fact my dad put me on the HIPAA form. Meanwhile, my dad is calling me literally crying because the physical therapy hurts him so bad. He is in so much pain, both from his natural pain and the extra pain from PT, that he can't even walk and can barely move at all. My poor dad is suffering tremendously. Its not like my dad was looking for pain meds; he wanted steroid shots. I can think of no reason why the doctor wouldn't allow the steroid shots to begin with, and no reason why he would refuse to contact me back to explain this decision to me.\n\nThere are other issues, too. I filled out all the paperwork for my dad and emailed it over to them, along with a letter explaining my dad's medical issues. The receptionist never bothered to give it to the dr. In fact, to this day, I still have no idea whether or not the doctor has seen that letter. They are seriously uncoordinated. Their phone system sucks. I just tried calling again a few minutes ago and the system hung up on me. Don't even bother with this place.
