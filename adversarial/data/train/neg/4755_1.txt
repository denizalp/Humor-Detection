I had my eyeglasses ordered here last year. Unfortunately, the lenses were too thick and not the super-thin lenses I ordered. I brought it back to have them replace the lens, which they did.\n\nI went home and went to my former optometrist. She measured the lens and said that for both eyes (L and R), the grade was the same! (My left eye needs a higher grade than the right.) If I had not seen another optometrist, I would not have known this. So aside from putting in the wrong lens the first time, they also used the incorrect grade!\n\nPlease be careful with the glasses you order from this shop. I would recommend getting your glasses made elsewhere.
