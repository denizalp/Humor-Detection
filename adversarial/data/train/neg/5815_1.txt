Soooo, 3 months ago, I decided to take the plunge and get the IPHONE 6 PLUS. I never kept the phone in my back pocket always in its \"PROTECTIVE\" case and in my front pocket. i leaned against something and the screen cracked. So I took it in to the helpful and understanding people of APPLE. The girl that \"HELPED\" said that there was a slight curvature in the phone and the screen therefore cannot be repaired. I gotta get a new phone at the DISCOUNTED price of 329 dollars. She asked, where do you keep your phone? I said in my front pocket, where else should I keep it? Theres a design flaw people. The phone is 3 months old and theres a 'bend\" and the only way to correct it is for ME to drop 329 for your flawed product. So much for customer service at APPLE.
