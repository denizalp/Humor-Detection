I personally think this little place is great .. I love the old school hole in the wall Mexican joints ! If your looking for fine dinning or expecting fine dinning then move along .. but if you want good dive authentic Mexican food , the kind where everything is touching and melts together then this IS your place to stop and try ! And did I mention the margaritas are only $3.50 ?! Kinda syrupy sweet , but aren't all house margaritas anywhere you go ?
