I just moved to the neighborhood and had been told of this little restaurant which serves good Mexican food (Mexico City style) at a reasonable price. We stopped by tonight on Taco Tuesday, where tacos were discounted.  We were met by the bartender who was funny and friendly. The menu looked interesting so we tried a variety of things: a couple of street tacos (the chorizo one was excellent), a couple of tamales (the mushroom and cheese was divine, especially with a little of their homemade salsa on it), the green enchiladas really (wonderfully prepared with fresh tortillas and a most delectable tomatillo green sauce with sour cream and white cheese), mole (pretty good). Oh, almost forgot the delightful appetizer, choriqueso - flavorful chorizo sausage with melted cheese and freshly made chips. The margaritas were tasty, too, and the beer on tap very reasonable.  Actually, the entire meal was inexpensive for all the food we received.  It is a little gem of a place we'll be sure to visit again. If you want a different type of Mexican food adventure, give this place a try.
