We stopped here as the place received great reviews on Yelp.  If you're not from Charlotte, this place is a little hard to find as nothing is really labeled on the street.  It was really nice looking from inside the market.  I knew the price of the pizza was going to be more than your standard pizza, but was willing to pay it based upon the great reviews they received.  \n\nUpon receiving the pizzas, I noticed that we did not get what we ordered (we received 2 plain cheese pizzas instead of specialty pizzas).  When I went back to inquire on this, they stated I was charged for a plain pizza and not a specialty pizza, and they messed up my order on accident (yet on the phone they repeated my order after I stated what I wanted, so I'm not sure how they could have messed it up).  They said they would make us new ones if I had 10 minutes to spare, but after already waiting to get the pizza I ordered, I did not have time to wait for them to correct their mistake. They should have refunded me my money for their mess up (that would have been better customer service).  Now the pizza, for being plain cheese, was not great.  The crust was very thin and almost rubber like. Now my kids eat just about any kind of pizza, and they would not eat this!  \n\nI would say pass on this place as it is just not worth the cost of the pizza with bland taste and bad customer service skills.
