Saw this show twice now but 6 years apart from each time. The acts have been up'ed their game and the performance is much more entertaining now. They keep their material \"fresh\"!  not a bad seat in the house given how they set up the tables!!! This place does scream of bachelorettes- there must have been 30 of them there when we went so if you are trying to get on stage, know that you need to set yourself apart somehow- dress your best and if u are going with a bachelorette and want her to get on stage, shout, point and put a veil or something on her to stand out in the crowd.
