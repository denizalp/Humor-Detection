Such a great experience. Perfect place for large groups and especially if you're celebrating anything..... literally anything. Relax, let loose and enjoy some Strong drinks, good music and most importantly the entertainment. You won't be disappointed. TACO is worth the trip alone (you'll know what I mean after your own first hand adventure) and our server TT was awesome too. I will be coming here every Vegas trip.
