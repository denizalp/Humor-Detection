Cheap price and horrible customer service. Casino staff and management  unfriendly and not helpful when asked for directions or about services. Did not post a disclaimer regarding no full face paint or masks until two days before Halloween. If I had known about it, I would have gone to a different hotel. The ONLY REASON I did not give them ONE STAR is because they have a GREAT CLEANING STAFF.
