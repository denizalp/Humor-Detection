Well, I came here for happy hour but this business is deceptive not to give you the happy hour menu but instead give you the regular menu. I ordered what I thought was happy hour wines but got charged regular prices. Service which was good in the beginning became abysmal as our waitress was nowhere to be found. I had to request someone to go get her THREE times. This is unacceptable! But the wine was good and so was the food.
