I love this place.\nWhenever I have to get any South Indian dish, this is the place to be. Tried bunch of Indian places but woodlands is hands down is my favorite of all.\nThe staff and the owner lady I see most of the time is very nice and welcoming.\nI will highly recommend to try any kind of Dosa and you will not be disappointed.\nI will be back very soon, especially after having a really bad experience at Peacock, South Charlotte.
