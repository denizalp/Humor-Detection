We went there not knowing they treat you rude on purpose, and we couldn't figure out why the bartender was being such a prick. Now I wish we'd known, so we could have played along. \n\nThe reason I only give it two stars is not because of the service...it's the drinks. We basically paid 30 dollars for two cups of juice. I'm not sure if shitty drinks are part of the dickish service theme, but they could at least not charge you out the butt for a teaspoon of alcohol.
