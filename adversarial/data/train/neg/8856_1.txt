As someone who cannot eat fish, I always expect just okay noodles when going out for sushi with my boyfriend. Ru Sans has a HUGE menu - it is mostly sushi which I don't enjoy, but I was still impressed that they were even able to offer so many things. I don't remember exactly what it was called, but I had spicy udon noodles with vegetables - they were indeed very spicy! I love spicy food, and these almost seemed too spicy, but yet I could not stop eating them. So delicious! The fried rice has an almost smokey flavor to it (my boyfriend says its from authentic use of a wok), and both entrees left us with a bill under $30 for dinner. Not bad! The entire staff was very friendly; the guys rolling sushi on the line said hello and goodbye to us, and thanked us for coming in....all six of them at once - it was overwhelming when we came in, but when we left we gathered that it is custom to their culture, which in the end I found to be a bit endearing. Overall, a very friendly, fun place to grab a quick lunch or dinner!
