Ate here recently and wasn't disappointed! \nFood and service were both great. \n\nI highly recommend the beet salad. It's fresh and delicious. If you visit during the fall I recommend the butternut squash soup which is perfect! I think it's a seasonal soup so be sure to try it if you go in the fall or winter time. \nThe sea bass is my favorite dish I have tried there! I would go back just for that dish!\n\nFlat breads are also good! They are like a pizza and would make a great meal if paired with a salad.\n\nDelicious food and friendly staff. I highly recommend this restaurant! :)
