Well it's a coffee shop in a mall, so one needs to start with that.  Despite that, i think a few lines of review are important b\/c there are lots of other choices at Bayview Village.  \n\nTheir espresso based coffees aren't that great.  The selection of food\/pastries are limited and the prices although not on the high end, aren't value.  Arshawn and I had an Americano and cranberry juice (you can figure who had what) and it came to $4.50 which is not bad - but again, the coffee was a bit bland.  I may try this place again in the distant future but not for their coffee.
