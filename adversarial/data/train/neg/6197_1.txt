Had a beer tasting flight and our bartender was super knowledgeable and patient as he explained each one. We stuck around and also had a latte and espresso and they were SOLID. I love the atmosphere here but I think the high ceilings create an echo, so when there's only 6 people chatting away, it really gets loud. Other than that, I love that this place is staffed with people with knowledge, passion, and really welcome guests with a warm and cozy experience.
