Came here on Wednesday for lunch with co-workers. Based on the reviews below, I was expecting the service to be mediocre. Thankfully, our server was very attentive and knew the menu very well. The only bad thing I have to say is that they messed up my boss's order... they fixed it right away but I don't think they apologized at all.\n\nI got the power salad half size and added chicken for extra protein. The salad was delicious as all the ingredients mixed very well together. Salad dressing was also great. The portion wasn't the biggest as I got hungry 2 hours after lunch, which is normally the case when I have salad for lunch. I enjoy making fancy salad at home so I know how expensive the cost can be - I see the reason behind high price.
