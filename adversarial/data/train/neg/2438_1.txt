People, have a sense of humor! This place is great. Delicious food that was definitely unhealthy but hey, what's a vacation without going all out. The drinks were massive and quenching. Our waitress was a trip! Even though her goal was to be mean she was still attentive and a sweetheart. A great time definitely was had. Of course I'll return!
