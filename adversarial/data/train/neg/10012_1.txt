Very dive bar esque. You'll see that once you walk through the thick black curtains at the door. My partner and I love dive bars, so +1!\n\nI came here on a few occasions, trying the cider. There seem to be a lot that I didn't like, to be honest. But that's just me. Perhaps my taste buds aren't familiar with ciders other than the ones in cans, sold at LCBO. \n\nI recently had the hot mulled cider with -wink- a shot of whiskey in it. It was really amazing and delicious!Especially with the whip cream and cinnamon on top. Yum! It reminds me of Harry Potter for some reason . Perfect on a chilly day. \n\nLet's talk food! Every time my partner and I were here, we were blown away by the food. \n\nThe cod cakes are to die for. I would eat this over a burger, any day. It's flaky in a good way. The tartar sauce and pickled stuff (?) Really compliments the cod. Oh lord. Am I salivating while writing this review? Maybe. \n\nThe winner of the meal was the smashed potato. Presented as a side, it's unbelievable how its called that. It's super filling. Although I could eat 2 of them and be full. The potato is cheesey and fluffy on the inside. But crispy and delectable on the outside. 10\/10 would order again !\n\nChanna masala was delicious and complemented the rice. I wasn't a big fan of the naan, but my partner was. \n\nThe salad was okay, in my opinion. I like a more tart vinaigrette. I digress, the leafy greens were fresh, the shallots added a nice flavour profile, and it was good overall.
