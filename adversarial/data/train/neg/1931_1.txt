Ive had the pleasure of one nail tech at ruby nails for the past year. I have found a lil piece of heaven! Everyone in the shop are always coutetious and give me the service i request and more. The art work they have displayed is way more then the norm. I wish i would have found them yrs ago.i bring my friends and fam and they luv it too. I am one satisfied customer EVERYTIME i visit!
