Not impressed at all.  When I worked in the area about 8 years ago, I enjoyed this Cousin's location and went there 1-2 times a week on average, for many years.  But I then moved away for anotehr job.  Well, I'm back baby, and I decided to give them a visit (once again, I work right down the street from this location).\n\nI ordered a Turkey sub with double meat ($2.00 extra for the extra portion of Turkey). And I like cheese on my subs (they don't include it unless you pay to add it). So I added it.  That made the sub alone (no drink or chips) come to almost $8.00, but it's worth it to me IF it was a good sub.  It was so skimpy!  I barely saw the turkey, so I confirmed if it was double meat.  The woman at the front (not the friendlies bunch of ladies behind the counter, btw) said yes.  I was shocked, as I can't image what the regular non-double portion would be? She didn't offer me a different sandwich, a refund, or anything.  I felt like a fool who was duped, and quickly left with my dinky sub.\n\nThere are way to many other places to go, especially for a sandwich or sub, who give you more for your money and show theri appreciation for their customers.  What's sad is that this Cousin's is so close to work, I would have easily gone there at least 1-2 times a week, as I did way back when, but I vow to never go back.  I refuse to be taken advantage of again.  \n\nWhat's sad is that because they are so skimpy on the meats (and the air conditionaing- it wasn't very cool inside) they will lose customers like me and in the end do less business and earn less profits for theri efforts.  They need to see the bigger picture and do things the right way.\n\nGoodbye Cousin's subs on Washington and 48th.  I won't miss you...
