For fast food this place is pretty decent. This was my first In N Out experience. That being said I doubt I'll come back. I'm not much of a fast food eater. I appreciate they use better ingredients than others. I just didn't taste the difference. I prefer thicker fries and my food was pretty cold. I'd go back if my options were limited otherwise I'll keep walking. Not sure what all the hype is about?
