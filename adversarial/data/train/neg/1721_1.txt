This place is amazing! Great People, Great Selection. Ken is awesome, always friendly and loves to meet & greet with anyone who walks in the door. \n\nAlso they bag & board ALL of their books for free and have reading copies of all new releases for previewing. I have visited a lot of comic shops but this one feels like home!
