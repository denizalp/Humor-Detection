This place always serves fresh and delicious sushi, and is my go to place for when I'm over in Ahwatukee. They have a great menu and options, and also have many kid friendly dishes. The one somewhat reoccurring item is the eh service. Waitstaff service is typically so-so at best. I find that I typically have to request water, several times to get a glass. Refills on any drink typically require prompting.
