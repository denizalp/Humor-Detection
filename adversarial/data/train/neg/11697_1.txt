The remarkable rise of the infamous sushi burrito is all the craze and has officially joined the ranks of culinary chimeras -- seducing us all with this mexican japanese fusion mixture of sushi meets burrito. Considering we used to have to travel all the way to California to a location or stand an hour in line at the local Foodie Fest to get our fix of this -- Las Vegas locals keep this place busy! \n\nFOR HER:\n- TRIPLE S (soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, red onion, jalapeno, cucumber, tempura crunch, sweet chipotle mayo & unagi sauce). No jalapenos for me though! \nFOR HIM: \n- TWIN DRAGON (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, surimi crab, lettuce, cucumber, guacamole, crispy wonton strips, sweet chipotle mayo, unagi sauce). No cucumbers for him.\n\nEverything was 100% satisfactory. Ingredients are fresh, flavor is on point, and no complaints whatsoever. The taro chips are coated in a sweet layer of furikake that pairs so well with it too! There was a bar with condiments but honestly, none was needed. Not only do they offer sushi burritos, but also salads, rice bowls and nachos -- with protein choices raw & cooked, and a full topping bar of 15 fresh vegetable items. The possibilities are endless!
