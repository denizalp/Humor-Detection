My favorite sandwich spot in Vegas. Now this place has changed its name and taken this sandwich off menu. So now it's a secret menu. Item. Winston copper with psycho sauce! 9\/10.\nLe gargantu 9\/10. Just a different flavor profile. But a solid great sandwich with alot of meat. This ain't your subway. You will eat half and probably be full but wont wanna stop.
