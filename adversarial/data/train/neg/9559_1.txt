Highly recommended for the pies...you can buy them by the slice or entire pies.\n\nI had breakfast and there are tons of options on the menu...almost anything you would want.  I especially enjoyed the numerous egg white options.  Its not ultra fancy...standard American breakfast. \n\nServer was friendly and manager stopped by the table to make sure all was great.
