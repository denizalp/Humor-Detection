I took my 8 month old furbaby, Yuki. She needed a check up and we had a health scare, so it was time to get her looked at by a professional. \n\nThe building is a little akward to pull into, especially when traffic is bad, but it has a long narrow parking lot that can fit a lot more cars than you may initially expect. \n\nOnce inside, the waiting area is small. When I arrived, there were only 2 other people waiting, and only one had a pet with them. The wait overall was less than 30 minutes. The veterinary assistants were very nice, pleasant to interact with, and when I returned they remember my dog and said lots of sweet things about her. They said they'd never seen her breed before and ended up googling. :} \n\nThe vet we saw was kind, though brief. I can understand,  considering how busy they must be at this location. He took the time to discuss the pros\/cons of feeding her various foods, as well as giving her a decent overall inspection. The same doctor called with the results from the tests we opted for, which was actually very nice. The continuity is surprisingly reassuring when you're feeling unsure about the future for your beloved pet. \n\nWith the medication I bought for her, and the overall cost of visits and tests we spent less than $100. The medication I received for her should last through 3 months, so I'm quite happy. When I have more money available I look forward to taking her back for a more thorough inspection. The assistants & the vet I interacted with were sweet and seem to care a lot about the pets.
