I hadn't been to Sherway in about a year due to all the construction but last Friday my friend and I decided we'd go and check things out.\n\nWe had lunch at Villa Madina and, as always, the food does not disappoint.  I had my usual beef shawarma wrap ($5.99) - lots of lean flavourful meat, fresh and generous with the condiments and wrapped nice and tight.  My friend had the falafel wrap and said it was awesome.\n\nThe man that served us wasn't too friendly though and he only gave us two really small and thin napkins each.  Like, come on, we're eating shawarmas and falafels - so messy.  Things like that put me off but I guess that's what to be expected from the food court.  I'll write a \"tip\" to BYON (bring your own napkins).\n\nFood = five stars.  Customer service = 2.5 stars.  I'm still giving it four stars though because the food is really good and priced well.
