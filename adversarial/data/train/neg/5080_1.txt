After living in Las Vegas for almost 10 years, I'm amazed that I never even knew this place existed!  Amena Bakery & Deli is right off of Decatur, between Sahara and Charleston.  I drove up to the familiar Trader Joe's parking lot, and to my surprise, this restaurant really does exist.\n\nMy 8 year old daughter came into the restaurant with me a little after 5:40 today.  First off, this place is ridiculously clean.  Secondly, I was greeted by the friendliest lady behind the cash register.  \n\nI've looked at the menu online, and was really interested in two things, Falafel and Baklawa.  The pastries were simple enough, and I was even offered a HUGE sample.  I mean, these Baklawa pastries were fingers the size of giants 1.5\" x 6\", and she gave me half!  The other Baklawa pastry was about a 4\" square cut in half.  As other Yelpers mentioned, the Baklawa wasn't too sweet.  It was crisp, and just enough sweetness, and you can taste the nuts.  In fact, it was perfect!  We bought 2 fingers and 2 triangles.  Now onto the food.  Super reasonably priced.  I bought the combo special wanting to try the Falafel, and might as well try the other food too.\n\nSince that was 4 pieces of Baklawa and a combo platter, we took our food to go and smelled it all the way home.  15 minutes later, we were in heaven!  My combo plate came with: Falafel, Chicken Shawarma, Beef Shawarma, Hummis, Salad, and the best tasting PITA bread!  Falafel's were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Scrumptious!  The pita bread was so fresh, I can't even imagine buying store bought anymore!  The chicken and beef shawarma..  omg..  :D  \n\nI will be back!  and Back!  and BACK!\n\nTo the owner and the lady at the register: Keep up the good work!  Everything was fantastic.  Service was spectacular!
