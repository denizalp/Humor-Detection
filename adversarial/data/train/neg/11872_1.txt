This is our first visit to this egg works....we live closer to the anthem location but we happened to be in the area...lucked out on a groupon too!  \n\nVeronica served us and she was awesome! We didn't have to flip the happy\/sad egg ever because she continually checked on our table.  Our food was delivered quickly with no error and it was nice to see her swiftly moving about tending to all of her tables.  Her personality was bubbly and energetic which is nice in the morning and she was always smiling! \n\nIf ever in the area ask for Veronica's section!
