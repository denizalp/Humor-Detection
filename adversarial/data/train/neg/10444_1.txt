Easily a 5 star for what it is... no nonsense comfort food with an amazing twist on fresh ingredients. The passion Ricardo shows was evident and came through in both the service and the food.  With the picky palette my daughter carries, it was encouraging to see her finish her plate. Found a new favourite local restaurant.
