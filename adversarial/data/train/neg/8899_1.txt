Oh snap, this place is bombtastic. \n\nI came here once, years ago, in a land far far away and really liked it. Then...I totally forgot about it. I don't know why, because I remember it being great, but I forgot. \n\nSo, like 3-4 years goes by, my baby mama is out of town and I'm taking our little feller to an indoor playground (because it's 1,000 degrees outside). I'm about to drive by this place and I'm like, \"yo, I remember that joint, it was bombtastic, I should get a blended iced beverage to help me cool down on this very warm day.\" Best decision ever.\n\nI went with the Mocha Monkey. The name isn't just awesome, the taste is too. Banana, chocolate, chocolate chips, and mocha blended into a smooth, creamy consistency that I can only describe as a milkshake, but better. I drank this in about 5 minutes. The indoor playground is across the street. I literally had one swig left by the time I pulled up.\n\nSo what did I do the next day? Yep. Got another.\n\nSide note...chatted it up with the dude who took my order. We talked about the Golden Knights and how cool it was that they made the Stanley Cup. Friendly fella who made natural conversation, didn't feel forced or like he was pushing for a tip. Appreciated that. \n\nI'll be back and I won't forget you Madhouse Coffee.
