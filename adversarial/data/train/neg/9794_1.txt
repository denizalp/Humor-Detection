Oh Poutine. Not only is this located in a great part of Toronto, but it is a true poutine with crispy golden fries, a light gravy, salty curds, and added toppings of your choice. The BBQ pork with bacon was a perfect pairing. The restaurant (if you can call a small kitchen and a counter place orders a restaurant) was clean and the cook was very friendly. There's 3 bar stools inside to sit making this primarily a grab and go style. Even though poutini is traditionally a late night drunken food, House of Poutine is made with such a great quality that it can be fully enjoyed with no libations necessary.
