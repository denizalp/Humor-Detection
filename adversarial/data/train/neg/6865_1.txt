I've only been into one other head shop but I was thoroughly impressed with Bud's! The customer service was fantastic, the guy behind the counter (I wish I remembered his name!) pulled out some pipes for us to look at without asking because he could tell we were a little unsure where to start. Without even trying he sold us a pipe that was more than we were looking to spend but I was wowed by the craftsmanship and how much he knew about how it was made.\nAlso I think it's super cool that they have live glass blowing on First Friday and most of their products are local.
