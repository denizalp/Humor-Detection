The owner mistreats and demeans his employees. He is cruel and heartless. All he cares about is how much he is going to make at the end of the day. I can't judge the quality of this place, but if you have a conscious and care about the way people are treated, don't patronise his establishment. Shame on you Frank Huang you need to learn some human kindness.
