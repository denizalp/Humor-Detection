Amazing meal. Me and my fianc√© came here for dinner and were seated in the garden\/patio at a picnic table. We ended up talking to the couple next to us and sharing a few bites of items which was interesting. It's hard not to when sitting so close to someone. \n\nWe started with the classic foie gras which was delicious, the homemade bread was the best ever.\n\nWe had some of our neighbors brussel sprouts and lamb.\n\nThen came our beef for two, which was probably the best beef dish I've ever had. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. \n\nOur waiter was great, I'm not sure of his name he was very nice and helpful since neither of us can read or speak French we were completely dependent on him. He also helped us choose a French bottle of wine which was one of the best we've ever had.\n\nMy complaint would be that the beef for two is WAY, WAY too much food for two people. We were obviously visitors to Montreal and I felt so bad about wasting the food. Please either do a smaller portion or warn patrons.. The beef is enough for four! \n\nAlso if you are sitting on the patio\/garden bring your shades!
