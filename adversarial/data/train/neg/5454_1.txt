I'm a novice gun owner, I signed up for a conceal carry permit class and it has been fantastic.  J.R. Is the instructor, it is very informative on many aspects of gun safety, law, operation, etc.  The environment is comfortable and the material presented in an interesting manner.  All walks of society in the class, it is suited for all levels of knowledge\/experience in a non-threatening\/judgemental environment.  Highly recommend to anyone considering a class or anyone who owns a gun who wants to learn more.
