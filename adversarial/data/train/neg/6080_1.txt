I need to come here more often! This place is awesome!\n\nThe owner is super friendly and remembers you by name. The food is reasonably priced and very tasty. We always get the garlic knots, which are little clouds of deliciousness served with marinara sauce for dipping.\n\nOn our most recent visit, I got the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and my husband got the Philly cheesesteak. Both dishes were delicious, and really hit the spot when I was craving Italian food. We finished the meal with the zeppolis for dessert. They were fluffy and sweet. Perfect!
