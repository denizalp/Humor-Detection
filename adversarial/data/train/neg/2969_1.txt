I recently stayed at the Hyatt and was looking for a place to enjoy breakfast. After stumbling upon \"OverEasy\", I thought why not? I was immediately intrigued by their Breakfast Poutine and fresh squeezed orange juice. \n\nThe OJ was delicious, but a smaller portion than I expected for the price. The Breakfast Poutine was impressive, but the eggs were over-poached. The location has a diner like ambience, but the tables were far too close for my liking.
