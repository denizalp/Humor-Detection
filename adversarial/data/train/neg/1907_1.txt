Back with another carefully crafted review.....This time I tried out the Silverton and here's the final outcome.....\n\nCHECK IN: Painless & professional, they made the process easy.\n\nROOM: I booked a \"Luxury\" room and boy did it fit that mold. The bed was one of the most epic i've ever slept in, there were an abundance of pillows, the bed was elevated and the bedding was very nice. The rest of the room was pretty impressive as well as it was very spacious, had ample bright lighting and had artificial plant decor. The bathroom was on the normal to smaller side, but the way it was decorated made up for that.\n\nPOOL: Pool\/Hot Tub was open until 10pm, I appreciated the opportunity to soak in the hot tub at a later hour.\n\nBUFFET: This buffet has always been quality- they didn't disappoint on this occasion either.\n\nThe Casino was pretty lively as well, even had a guy with a microphone hosting a trivia competition in the Shady Grove Lounge.\n\nIt's a great place to be and be  away from the strip, i'd definitely recommend it.
