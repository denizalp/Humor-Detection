We eat at Churches a few times a month. The chicken strips are wonderful! The fries are hot and crispy. The staff is friendly even though they are always busy. There's no long wait for food, but they will tell you if something's being made for your order. I use the app for coupons and rewards.\nIts a very good experience for us every time. We'll be back to this Churches.
