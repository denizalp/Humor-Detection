Not only is this one of the best restaurants in Charlotte but the service here is also incredible, it will be busy here so plan ahead and go during off hours if you're in a hurry but they work efficiently and turn tables fast so even if the line looks long, you'll get in more quickly than you expect.\n\nThe menu is incredibly extensive-like 7 pages long. It could be overwhelming for those not used to Vietnamese food but luckily,  everything is good! My favorites are the lemongrass tofu and garlic tofu dishes but they also have plenty of good non vegetarian dishes if you prefer meat. My fianc√©e got a stuffed pineapple dish with shrimp and vegetables last time we went and he really enjoyed it (and it was so pretty too!). Anything with pork is also good here. I'm not supposed to eat pork due to allergies and pork's not usually my thing anyway but I make an exception for Lang Van's summer rolls with pork. I can deal with some itchiness and discomfort in exchange for the deliciousness :)\n\nA trip here isn't complete without having one of the fruit smoothies. In addition to the usual  fruits, they also offer more exotic choices such as soursop and durian. \n\nA meal here is capped off with a small plate of complimentary desserts-usually peanut butter cookies, tamarind candies, and fortune cookies. During my last trip here, they even gave the customers a thanksgiving treat in the form of an entire jar of the peanut butter cookies! They really know how to make customers feel special and appreciated!
