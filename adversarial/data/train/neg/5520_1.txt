This place is no secret anymore. The Pinball Hall of Fame is amazing! I have recently moved to Vegas, but before I moved here I made sure to make a trip to the pinball hall of fame nearly every time. They have pinball machines from every decade starting in the 40s. All the machines I came across worked really well. \n\nThere is nothing negative I can say about this place. It's a lot of fun and it's very cheap. The best part about this place is that the owner is dedicated to giving to charity and I believe the Pinball HOF is a non profit institution. \n\nDo yourself a favor and get away from all the Vegas craziness for an hour or two and go to the Pinball Hall of Fame
