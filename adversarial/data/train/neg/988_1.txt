Wonderful experience! The food, service, vibe - couldn't have asked for better. Highly recommend the fried chicken. Ask for the Wasabi honey and the special hot sauce. First went to the izakaya Blue Ribbon in New York and searched high and low for a fried chicken as good. Never found it until we came here. The batter they use is delicious and unparalleled. I don't want to oversell it, but I will always make a special trip here for the fried chicken anytime I'm in town. Also had a wonderful bottle of wine, recommended our server, which was very reasonably priced. They have a great variety of very gourmet choices so something for everyone. I was there on vacation but it seemed like a great place for a nice work dinner.
