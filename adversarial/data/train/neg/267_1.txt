This place is so good! I love coming here for a late breakfast (great walk of shame parade constantly streaming in Friday through Sunday). Last time a kid from ASU had one arm tattooed to say God's and the other said Gift. Those sort of patrons and people watching makes this an automatic 5 star review. \n\nMy go-to is the farmers benedict. The potatoes are amazing, and I love that there are endless bottles of hot sauce on deck. The service is quick and even when it's packed to the brim you will find a spot to sit.
