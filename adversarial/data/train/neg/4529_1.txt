This is the worst place to get a rental car! A condescending sarcastic jerk named Ken works here and he doesn't know what \"customer service\" means. We arrive and sat in line for at least thirty minutes without any acknowledgement while he small talked with everyone in line. I finally asked if there was anyone else working and he said it's an international airport and he has seen people wait for hours. All the while next door at enterprise they had four people working and greeting people as they walked in. Next time I will make sure that I pay a few more dollars are get better service. I will also make sure that I make this as public as possible and no one I know including all military personnel that my husband knows will never use this company. When we finally made it up to the counter he was laughing and mocking us the entire time. Shame on you advantage. Next time I would hire someone who know that the customer is always right. And as for the manger on duty Casey he did not care whatsoever either. He walked right by us as we asked if he could help us and he laughed and said no and left the store. At this time there were at least ten people behind us getting just as irritated. And ken you might not want to ask people personal questions about themselves that don't pertain to renting a damn car either. Completely unprofessional.
