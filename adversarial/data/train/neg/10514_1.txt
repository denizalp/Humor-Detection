I lovee this store! I can literally be in here for an hour looking at all their endless wine selections. All the times I have been here, the employees usually ask if I need help. I never got the chance to taste anything, because its never offered. I have a loyalty membership with them and have gotten some good coupons. Overall, great place & must visit!
