Have eaten several times there. Spotty service. Tight seating. Kids menu Macaroni and Cheese was a ripoff. My 3-year old daughter finished a serving and we asked for more but had to pay for another meal.  Ridiculous. $6 for each kids meal. Have had some decent meals there. The salmon dish is pretty reliable and tasty. Have had a few different variations but they are all pretty close. Good location for them with few competitors. Nice, laid back spot for a cocktail at the bar.
