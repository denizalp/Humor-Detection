This is a very local taco joint, almost everyone in there is spanish. We decided to try it out because my bf is craving some real mexican food, and it has good review on yelp. We order 4 tacos (tripa, lengua, chorizo, and carnitas) and comb tortas.  Also 2 hachatas while we are waiting.\n\nThe staff is not the friendliest or most efficient, and you better know spanish if you want some food from here. After waited at least 20 minutes for our order we finally got it. \n\nOk, the tacos looks really, but they taste very dry all of them. There's barely any taste to them, and the tripa tasted burn. My bf's tortas is pretty decent. I don't know if it's a one time mistake or what, but I am not impressed by the tacos at all.
