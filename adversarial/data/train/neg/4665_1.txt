Came in 15 minutes till the close to return an item and I was told they've already counted all there drawers and they can't do my return. Even though all they give is merchandise credit on returns. That makes very little sense. I generally stay clear of this goodwill in particular, most of there stuff is junk. Terrible customer service.
