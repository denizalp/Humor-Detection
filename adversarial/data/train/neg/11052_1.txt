It reminded me of watching kids on the playground. Just a lot going on everywhere. I didn't know where to settle my eyes or mind. I wish there would've been a story to follow. But instead... I fell asleep and woke up just where I left off. However, I'm a firm believer that if you're a big Beatles fan then you will love the show just for the music alone.
