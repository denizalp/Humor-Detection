Happy Dog serves hot dogs, and veggie dogs, french fries, and tater tots. That's it. But they do it so well! You create your own dog by selecting from a long list of toppings. They all make a variety of sauces for the dogs and tots\/ fries in house. Trust me, it's hard to just pick a few!\n\nHappy Dog is certainly on my Top 10 vegan-friendly place to try in Cleveland!\nhttp:\/\/veganhostess.com\/vegan-cleveland-restaurants-coffee-shops-more\/
