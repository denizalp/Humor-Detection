Great noodle house. I ordered the vermicelli noodles with beef and veggies (V2 on the menu) My hubby got the M2 - whatever that is (noodles with chicken). The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean and the service was well, honestly slow (busy Saturday night). Weird drawings in the bathroom  (bucktoothed Asian ladies). Affordable and yummy, will go back but probably close my eyes in the bathroom. See for yourself!
