I would probably give it four stars but I feel bad with all the bad reviews people of been giving it so far.  I've been here three times now since they opened a month ago and the service is always been great for us. I have found that I really really really love the Tres Huevos breakfast. It is fantastic and I can't stop ordering it. Be sure to stop by and check it out during the week when it's less busy. Also, there is a free slice of pie on Wednesday between 10-10 when you order anything. Super clean, Super new location in the Lowes parking lot on NE corner of Happy Valley & Lake Pleasant.
