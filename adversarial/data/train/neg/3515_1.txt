By far the worst hookah lounge i have ever been to. First the security guard was a dick, after i paid $15 for my hookah that took them 30 min to bring me, the hookah was made horribly (the hose wasent even touching the water), the music was so loude that i could feel the bass inside my body (witch isnt bad if it was good music, the music was trashy, needs alot more variety), and the service was so bad, they checked on us once in the whole hour and a half we were there.
