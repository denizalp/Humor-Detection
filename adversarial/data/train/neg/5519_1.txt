Every time we come to vegas, we never fail to stop by this joint. It's awesome for efficient service and is open till the wee hours of the night :) \n\nThis time we had the... \n1. tuna tartare - which was raw tuna mixed with spicy mayo, a little bit of teriyaki sauce (as far as my tastebuds could tell) and topped with avocado. Almost like a sushi without the rice! It was delicious! The crispy golden wanton chips were the perfect companion for this dish. Too bad we only had 4 chips!!! Unlike at Pacific Catch where they give you more than you can count! \n\n2. Crab cakes - The waiter was very accommodating. Even though crab cakes was not on the menu for the evening he put in a special request for us. They were delicious! \n\n\n3. Lastly, dessert - chocolate beignets -  my favorite!!! Except this time, they didn't have chocolate, instead they had regular beignets stuff with light citrus tasting custard. It was even better than the chocolate beignets! Chocolate beignets with chocolate dip can get a little excessive and I could never eat more than 3. However, regular beignet felt much lighter in comparison and I could easily waffle down 4 with  a nice not-too-sweet caramel toffee dip.
