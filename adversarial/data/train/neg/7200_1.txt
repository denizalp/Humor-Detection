Not too shaby. Iam not a buffet person but this buffet passes my test lol. Has a variety of foods including shrimp cocktail and king crab legs that are already sliced in half. Everything else is eatable, not saying it's the best but not can't say it's the worse. My favorite was the shrimp cocktail. Staff is friendly and attentive.
