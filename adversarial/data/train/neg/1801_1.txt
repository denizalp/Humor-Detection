For the price and quality of food this is a hidden gem in Vegas.  I have only been here during Brunch and I was satisfied.  Servers are hit or miss here but the food definitely makes up for it.  This is my go to spot when downtown and buffet hungry...  Next up is Seafood night!!  Whos down to go???
