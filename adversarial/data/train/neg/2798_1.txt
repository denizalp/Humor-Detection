I highly recommend the pandan flavour with the Nutella in a fish cone. At first I came on grand opening day and if you came this day then it was a miss because their ice cream machine was a bit broken and the ice cream tasted like it had some freezer burn but when I came back a week later because all my friends were telling me otherwise and how creamy and flavourful the pandan ice cream was I went back to give it a second try and I was not dissapointed! The best pandan ice cream you will ever have!!!
