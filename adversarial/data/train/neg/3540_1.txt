I LOVE NINJA! I've eaten quite a bit of sushi. Ra is good and so is Kabuki, but that's if your looking for hip contemporary dining with club music playing in the background- which is FINE and all, but sometimes you just want a nice chill spot for a cozy gathering. Ninja is where it's at. A comfortable and chill hole in the wall, this place offers seats at the bar, at your own table, or you can do the Tepinyaki chop chop for a decent price. Great rolls and great service. It's family owned for ALOT of years and we are on a first named basis with most of the staff. Down all this great food with a Kirin sake bomber for the genuine experience.
