I have been to his location multiple times and I have always had great service.  The person that stands out the most is Annie.  She has helped me twice now and has always provided excellent customer service.  She always has a smile on her face, and is willing to go the extra mile to make my experience at her store a good one. I was looking for a particular pair of shoes for my wife and they were not in stock at the time of my visit, so Annie found what I needed online and had them shipped to my house....very quickly I may add.  I went into the store on a Tuesday afternoon about 3pm and she had the shoes delivered to my house by 1pm the very next day.  Awesome service!\nThank you Annie!\nTim
