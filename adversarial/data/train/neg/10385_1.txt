Looks can be deceiving.   Initially the area and modest dining atmosphere might distract the pampered individual, but for the one who seeks comfort from a good home cooked meal they will neither leave discouraged nor disappointed.  The food was comforting, delicious and of large portion. The people were warm and kind.  The customers hung out and talked with each other.   And who can resist a banana split pie?   I really enjoyed my visit here and recommend it as a perfect place to simply take a moment to eat well, connect with company and meet good people.  When you get the check you almost feel guilty because it is so affordable.  For the first time I felt guilty for leaving a 20% tip, thinking it was not enough.  With what they charge you will too.
