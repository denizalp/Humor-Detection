If you like raw onions, this is the place.  But for me, it gets a big nope.   The service was decent enough and the new location in the old Ibiza space is pretty spacious, but the food really dragged the place down.  \n\nWe started with the jalapeños rellenos.  The were served more like poppers - a half jalapeño open-faced, filled with cheese and topped with bacon bits.  Somehow with those ingredients, they were bland and not in any way spicy.   And not really what I would have pictured for a dish named rellenos.  \n\nOn to the guacamole.  We don't like the fuss of tableside, so we just ordered the 8 oz side and some chips.  The chips were a bit stale.  The guac had a ton of uneven chunks of white onion in it.  Big, small, and in between.   So many that I couldn't even work around it.  I can't remember the last time I didn't finish a guacamole.  \n\nNext was the tacos.  I got three.  They all had ample meat filling, but little else.  If there was sour cream, I couldn't find it on any of them.  The barbacoa was good, albeit a little boring.   The chorizo and potatoes was inedible- sopping wet with grease soaked through a double tortilla.  The steak and onions was very chewy and came with more raw, not cooked, onion.   All three were then topped with pico de gallo, which again was primarily raw white onion.   \n\nOverall, I enjoyed none of it.  And that's a shame because I really love authentic Mexican.
