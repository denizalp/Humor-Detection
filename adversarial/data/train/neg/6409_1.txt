Since this place is 2 blocks from our place, we've tried Hot Taco numerous times and we WANT to like it, especially since I love tacos.  The staff has always been excellent- friendly and attentive- however the food has been EXTREMELY salty on several occasions.  Think salt lick meets a sea salt grinder, then sprinkle some salt on top.  The issue is consistency- the food has never been consistent, other than consistently salty.  Same with the drinks.  First time there, drinks were excellent- each time thereafter, not so much.  Bummer.
