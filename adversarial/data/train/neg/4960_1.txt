Just got done getting a massage here so i ask BEFORE  for a full body massage for $38 they say YES then all they did was put a blanket on top of whole body front and back and put pressure all over then had to put clothes back on to go outside in a different room to have a foot massage then that was it ......its sad that theyre not honest about what they mean by full body massage and on top of that they were charging extra$10 for an oil and hot stone :.. SO FELT LIKE A GOT SCREWED FOR my $38 eventhough i ask UPFRONT SO JUST BEWARE
