Cute little place. There's 3 on the strip...  The Mirage Hotel, Planet Hollywood's shopping forum and their NEW Flagship store AND restaurant at The Paris Hotel. The place overall is cute BUT the prices are outrageous. $20+ for a lollipop?  I know they're couture lollipops but geez...  It's not like the stick has DIAMONDS in it. BUT people give in to it. Me, I prefer the clothes. Tees and Hoodies if I can find what I like. Although, I did get a cute commuter mug that was reasonable. So, all in all, it wasn't that bad.  But I think if the lollipops were a little more reasonable, I'd probably get one
