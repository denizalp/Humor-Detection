One word to describe this place:\nDisappointing\n\nBeen told by fellow korean friends that this chain is \"not bad\" as its similar to the ramen shops in korea\nI been to those shops in korea, i also been to the ones in japan, so this Kenzo shop, at least this one, not sure about the others, is an absolute disgrace to whatever \"japanese\" style its serving\n\nLets start with what was ordered\nKarashi ramen $8.95\nTsukemen $10.95\n\nLets start with the karashi\nHuge portion, always a plus for any big eaters such as myself\nFirst taste is the spicy broth...mmmm...barely any flavour...its like they dumped spicy sauce in hot water and mixed it\nSo now im not looking forward to the rest of the bowl, you know if the broth is bad in a bowl of ramen, saving the rest may be near impossible\nThe roasted pork slices were all right, bean sprouts flooded my bowl, noodles not good, woodear mushrooms okay, bamboo shoots looked and tasted like it came straight out of the bottle from the chinese supermarket and the fish cake...not sure which frozen one they bought but it tasted funny\n\nSo okay...pretty bad bowl of ramen...looked at my gf's tsukemen, looked okay, must be better than mine\nThis is how she described her tsukemen\nNoodles tasted like dish soap\nThe dipping broth had like no flavour, such a lack of salt\nThe roasted pork slices tasted like...dry flavour meat\nAnd fish cake had a weird taste like mine did\n\nOverall\nDisappointing\nNever again\n\nOnly plus was the server, he was really nice and unfortunately we cant blame him for the food :(
