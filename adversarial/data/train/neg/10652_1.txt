One expensive buffet, it was ok, get ready to stand in line for 30 mins or more! The line wrapped pretty far up to the cashier. I enjoyed the sashimi and salmon poke, I liked the prime rib, well the first one, the second one was hard and not so good. The deserts were tasty. \n\nThis is not the best buffet but it's pretty ok, not worth the price though. $40 a person? crazy. It would of been a nice $25 buffet.
