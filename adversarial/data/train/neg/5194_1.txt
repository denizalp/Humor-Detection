I remember when those silver little disks came out and I held tightly onto my beautiful vinyl record collection thinking that I would never go over to the dark side that was the CD with it's tiny art and expensive machine that required it. I felt the same way about my typewriter and my sixty-eight mustang but alas, time changes everything. I remember waking up with my mom and dad standing over me and thinking someone had died. Actually a piece of my heart died because someone had broken into my car and stole my CD case with over 300 of my most beloved CDs many of them bought in Europe on the black market of \"bootleg\" concerts (why, why, why did I leave that case in the car?) I felt the sharp sting of karma even though I didn't have any Sting in my collection, but maybe the Pixies entire European adventures in the late eighties. If I step into a Best Buy I feel overwhelmed and forget what I am looking for, and usually the twenty plus years I have on the person I finally track down renders our music speak completely incompatible. I love good music and by good I mean whatever sounds good to me... and Dario seems to have my taste down even if it is not his own. I can't whistle a tune, or even whistle for that matter. But I can explain to Dario, he plays his idea of what I want, and 99% of the time I love it and play it until I drive everyone in the house crazy and then I go back and start all over again. People complain about price... I'm guessing if you love fast food and Walmart this place may not be to your interest (I'm not judging.) I just think customer service is a lost art and that it has value (no not value menu, value as in I will pay extra.) I like that they sell tickets to  music acts I want to see (Bowerbirds and St. Vincent here I come.) So I love this store.
