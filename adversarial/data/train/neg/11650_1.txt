First of all we have been going to Red Lobster for over 35 yrs, and it is getting increasingly more expensive by the day.  The prices are off the roof.  The preparation and quality of the items are not what they used to be.  Example the shrimp scampi, is not really scampi at all, it is flavorless has no breading and no hint of garlic at all.  The flounder on the Sailors Platter was also flavorless - it tasted as if they boiled it in water and put alittle paprika on it to look like it was baked...\n\nIf your going to serve these items as you do then you need to get a cook\/chef that knows how to prepare them !!!
