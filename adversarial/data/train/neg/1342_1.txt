SUCKS!  Save time and go somewhere else..  We came here with a group of seven people for a birthday.  It was after 7 when we arrive and the lights were not on so we thought the place had closed, but after seeing some cars in the parking lot we went in.  The \"host\" if you want to call him that was starting his first day, he had no idea what he was doing and said after 10 minutes of mulling around that he would have to spit up our party,  WHAT??  the place wasn't even busy, so we decided to sit at an open 8 top in the bar just inside the door.  He told us to \"let someone know we were there if we wanted to eat\".  Double WHAT???  isn't that a host job, to let servers know there are people there..  geez..  So after waiting another 5-7 minutes our server came over, she had little to no knowledge about what beers they offered,  after taking our drink order she brought back a few waters that we had ordered.  After another grueling 15 more minutes she still had not come back with our drinks, even though we could see them sitting in the service well she never came back.. ten minutes more.... we left.  we had been inside the building for more than 30 minutes with no drinks much less an order..  will NEVER come back.  No one even cared that we left really, the girl at the front asked us who are server was but no one said boo-shit about our dissatisfaction or the crappy service..  Somebody better get a grip...  No MOD to be found, is this place run by idiots??
