I wanted to specifically THANK - Paige at 75th Ave Wildflower Bread Co. Today, I witnessed Paige handle a disgruntled customer. Paige showed great empathy & concern all while the customer (lady) continued to berate, belittle & devalue Paige. Amazing to watch Paige stay poised & professional (as did the whole Wildflower team)! This is why I love this place - Food is Great - but the People are Amazing... they are Family!
