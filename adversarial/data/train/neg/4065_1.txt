This place was terrible. Service and food came out pretty quickly but did not taste good.Everything tasted like they half assedit The pho was bland they use instead powder for   soup other dishes came out messy.bland and below average Typical shady business. Needless to say We will not be coming back The restroom was nasty it has a funky smell
