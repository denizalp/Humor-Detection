This was our first time here and it was pretty cool! We had the spicy watermelon and the mangonada  and my kids had the Cookie Monster every drink was delicious! \n We also tried the orange chicken great but a bit spicy for kids if they don't like spicy food.\nThe wings are on point I have to say my favorite food from the menu so far! \nPs: be ready to wait bcuz the line does get insane on the good side they are looking to hire more ppl!
