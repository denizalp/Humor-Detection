We tried this place tonight and were very happy. The BBQ was great. I got a small and my husband got a large (BBQ pork sandwich). The large was HUGE. We both thought the small was the perfect size. Meat was very smoky and delicious, sauce was great, slaw was good but not the best. Hush puppies were great but a little sweeter than I prefer. Baked beans were \"eh\" and we didn't like the mushy onion rings. But the BBQ itself was great and that was what we went for, so no complaints.. But the sides left something to be desired (except the hush puppies). Maybe next time will try a baked potato or fries instead. Service was great. Cash only! Prices were great. We got all the food above (2 sandwiches and 3 sides) for $13!
