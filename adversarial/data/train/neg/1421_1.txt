Quickly delivered for an extra delivery fee. Pizzas are hot and tasty but there is way too much dough and there is no need for a 2 inch crust. Over priced and so many restrictions on using coupons that you wonder why any are produced? Second pizza half price but first one over priced. Reduce the amount of your dough balls apply your topping to the edge leaving only 1\/4 inch for the crust and you will have a wining product. They charge you a fee for paying debit which happens to be ilegal and did I mention reduce your prices?
