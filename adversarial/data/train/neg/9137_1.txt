Brent took GREAT care of me after the customer service number disconnected me on the wrong date!  One call to him and I was reconnected less than 24 hours later.\n\nIf you have any centurylink issues or any office\/home that you need wifi, cable, etc go here to their Arcadia location and see Brent.  He's the man.
