Glad to have this place in my neighborhood. The woman who delivered my food, I assume one of the owners, was super friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nI hesitated in ordering from them based on the two other reviews... But, I really shouldn't listen to people who just work in the area and complain about service speed. \n\nAnywho...like a lot of places, some dishes are hit or miss. \n\nHighlights: Red Velvet Cake (moist, flavorful, decadent), the fried okra, the brisket, the potato salad (which you can tell is homemade), the corn bread.\n\nLowlights: Now...I am not sure what I was thinking ordering brisket tacos (I just honestly wanted more brisket) because those were rough. The flavors were bizarre. But that's my bad since tacos and bbq sauce should never intermingle.\n\nI heard about their amazing candied yams, so I am stoked to try those out too.\n\nIf you live in the area, call up and ask what they do best. I am happy there's another restaurant in S. PHX that actually delivers!
