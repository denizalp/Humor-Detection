I've rented 2 different apartments from Kefalos over the last 3.5 years. The first was owned by my former place of employment and managed by Kefalos. While the apartment was convenient for work, the rules laid out by the owner (not Kefalos) were much too strict for my taste. I wasn't really able to put my own personal touch on the place, and it never really felt like home. \n\nThe place I live in now is completely different. Nick (the son) owns the house, and its so much more flexible. First of all, it is pet friendly (he even encouraged me to think about a dog to go along with the cat I was planning to adopt). Second, THEY ARE LETTING ME PAINT!!! When I first looked at the place, I was totally in love with the colors and personal touch that someone added to the place. There was some patch work that needed done to the walls (its an old house in Pittsburgh...these places shift), the carpets needed cleaning, and the fridge needed some work. All of it was taken care of before I moved in. The only thing that wasn't done was the repainting over the patchwork. Turns out they didn't have the matching color, so I asked if I could change the color and do it myself. \n\n A few negatives: there's no online option to pay rent (maybe this isn't as common in Pittsburgh as it was in Massachusetts), and for repairs to actually happen, you have to keep buggin' the office staff. Christine, who works in the office, is super sweet and very personable. She's one of those people who has a knack for remembering your name, what was going on the last time you talked to her, and any other random information that comes up during short exchanges. If you have a problem, she's your girl! \n\nI would definitely recommend these guys to anyone looking for a place, as long as you like quirky, character-filled apartments that you want to make your own.
