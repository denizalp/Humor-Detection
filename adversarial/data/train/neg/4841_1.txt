I came here last Friday because Friday morning my alignment was off. My commute to and from work is very far. I contacted AAA around 0745. At 0806 I had a response from the owner and was able to schedule an appointment for late that afternoon right before they closed. It was for 1630, but I got there at 1600 and was seen promptly. Chriss was very informative of the issues with my car and I was taken care of in about an hour and fifteen minutes. I now know if I ever have any issues with my alignment I can always come here and can trust that what needs to be taken care of, will.
