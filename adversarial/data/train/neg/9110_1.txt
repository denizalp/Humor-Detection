My first trip to Taco y Taco was 2 days ago at the Pecos location. I decided to try out their new location today. So you know it's good.\n\nHad an al pastor and shrimp burrito because I wanted to get crazy. The meat is so tender and juicy, the burrito fillings all hit the right spots and they melt the cheese on the tortilla before making the burrito. It's great. \n\nIf you don't know any better you'd be confused by the ordering system, as there are different stations for different items. I'm sure they'll figure out a better way to do this, but there's not just not one big line, there's a crowd of ravenous humans grouped up trying to figure out which meat or taco station they're supposed to be at so they can fill their fat faces. \n\nThe salsa bar, which houses 7 or 8 different sauces\/salsas, is great. I'm a sauce kind of guy. I like to try many different salsas on my meal, so thank you for saucing me up. The salsa bar also houses cucumbers, pickled carrot\/jalapeños, but my favorite part is the fact they have their grilled onions and jalapeños refilled here instead of ordering behind the counter.\n\nLast but not least I also had elote which is the mexican street style corn on the cob, mayo, cotija cheese and chili pepper. I don't think I would come here and not order that. Although the other location when I went had the white corn(which I prefer), this location had yellow corn, but good nonetheless.\n\nThis location also has a bar. \nAesthetically, this location could use some work, as I'm not sure what they're going for. By no means does it look bad, just needs work and nothing that can't easily be fixed. Ultimately, I don't go to places because they look cool, it's all about the food and Taco y Taco delivers. \n\nMay take a nap.
