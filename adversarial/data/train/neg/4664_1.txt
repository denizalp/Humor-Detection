Oh man, how we love Rincon de Buenos Aires! \n\nWhen you walk in the door of this very unassuming little restaurant\/deli\/mercado, you'd never expect that this restaurant is home to some of the best asado outside of South America...and it is. I haven't had morcilla or molleja this legit since I spent a summer in Uruguay, and it's a good bet that I won't find its equal anywhere else.\n\nRene and Mariano always take great care of us; they make sure that bread and chimichurri are never in short supply, and that drinks are always full. \n\nThe Noquis (gnocchi) are heavenly, especially with the rosado sauce. Tasty, baked empanadas. A half of one lomito completo sandwich will bust my gut - filet mignon sandwich with cheese, lettuce, tomato, ham, and a fried egg. \n\nAnd then, if you drink yerba mate, they have a great selection of brands that you can buy by the kilo. We're talking Canarias and Cruz de Malta, for 6 dollars. No $8 ten oz bags of fru-fru whole-foods mate here! \n\nTo sum up - this is our favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas.  Eating dinner here was my brother's only request when he came to visit from Austin, TX. Tell your friends!
