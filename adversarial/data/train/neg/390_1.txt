Second visit and couldn't be more impressed.  I ordered the shrimp and grits this time around.  Dad had the pot roast.  Mom had the fish and chips.  My partner had the chicken plate.  Friendly people and very fast service.  We had our food in front of us within 15-20 mins of being seated.  Dad said his pot roast was soft and tender.  My shrimp and grits was savory.  Mom's fish was crispy, but the fries were a bit on the salty side.  My partner's chicken plate did not disappoint.  Love this place and would absolutely, strongly recommend.
