This place was recommended by an old coworker of mine in Albuquerque. We love trying new places and this place is a total gem!! I will start off only saying we ordered a couple kids breakfasts for our kids and there seemed to be some confusion on how it comes. Also, my kids have never really been into box juices and that's what comes with breakfast. This is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. On to the important part, the food!!\n\nI ordered the biscuits and gravy. Which I must say was Devine! The biscuit was tender and fluffy, the gravy, not at all heavy or filled with pan drippings, no guilt! it also had a nice amount of sausage in it. It came with a sausage patty and not the standard round nasty things that come in a box, rather one that was formed by hand and cooked on site! To finish off my plate, it came with beautiful pan fried potatoes that are tossed with fried kale, just a perfect plate of love in my book. \n\nMy hubby got the breakfast sandwich, I was so in love with my food, I didn't really pay attention to what was on it, I'm pretty sure a biscuit loaded with eggs, bacon and cheese? Either way he ate every bite and enjoyed it. His also came with the same pan fried potatoes, they are so good!\n\nMy kids had a (kids menu?) breakfast, so one pancake each, a side of fruit and a box juice. We thought the breakfast came with eggs and what not, so we had to order a side of it. Like I said earlier, a tad confusing. We initially ordered waffles, but I guess the iron was not on. Either way, the server made good with us and was very nice, so it really wasn't an issue. My kids love pancakes too. \n\nOn the way out we decided to grab a 4 pack of cupcakes. I must say, I'm glad we did! We got a carrot cake cupcake, red velvet cupcake, a lemon curd cupcake and blueberry muffin. These were probably some of the best cupcakes I've had. Moist, dense, light and not overly sweet. Just Devine! \n\nI love finding good places to eat. We will definitely be back!!
