It was a 3.5-star experience for me, but I can see how this place is loved by many.\n\nAll the reviews I read about Dee's are true: the cheap drinks ($1.25 for a pint of PBR on tap), the laidbackness, and the eclectic crowd (locals, hipsters, nerds, etc).  It definitely stood out compared to the plethora of bars we saw on Carson St.\n\nBecause perhaps we started our Saturday night there, it was hardly packed.  After one drink, we felt ready to go elsewhere.  Well, if I am back in the Pittsburgh area, then I would give this place another shot.
