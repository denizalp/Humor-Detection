TJ's is like stepping back in time to the golden age of Las Vegas. Staffed by a league of gruff older gentlemen, the service is impeccable and very attentive, if a little like a good fellas' hang out! On the recommendation of my server I tried an enormous rib eye, accompanied by sides of potatoes au gratin, herbed mushroom medley and grilled asparagus with lemon aoli. The steak was perfectly mid-rare, with the fat all crispy & delicious around the edge. The sides are still styled the way they probably were when they opened, with the mushrooms a little chewy and less herbed than I would like, and the asparagus a little charred on a spear or two (but otherwise crisp and really good). The potatoes didn't look particularly spectacular but tasted pretty good all the same.\nTo finish off this gargantuan meal, I chose a creme brûlée and the TJs' coffee. The creme brûlée sugar crust was toasted to golden perfection and the coffee laced with generous amounts of brandy, Kahlua and whipped cream. I would have liked to have my dessert and coffee brought after I had finished the glass of Penfold's Shiraz\/Cab, and again, waiting until I had finished my dessert before the bill was brought so I could feel like sipping my coffee and digesting my meal was welcome. \nAll-in-all, a nice experience in old-school dining!
