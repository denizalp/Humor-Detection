We were at first overwhelmed by the size of the menu. However, our confidence was regained quickly by the commentary chips and salsa.  The chips tasted freshly made and dusted with a savory seasoning. Our entires were equally unique, well constructed and balanced in flavor. The was staff friendly and the chef even came out to the dining area checking on the guests and thanking us for stopping by.  I would recommend this place and plan to return for more.
