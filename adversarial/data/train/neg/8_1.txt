I can only review breakfast which I had two days the other options at the MGM actually cost more.   It was just ok,  the choices were few and non discript. I really liked the egg station  and  the wait staff were fast and friendly both days.  Coffee and Juice were included which was nice.  I guess I remember the good old days of Vegas when the Buffets were inexpensive and loaded with great food.
