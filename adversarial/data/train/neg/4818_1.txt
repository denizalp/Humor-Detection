We came here because it was included in the City Pass. The layout is a bit confusing and so is the map. There's a lot of space, but it's not used very efficiently. We were here for about an hour and half after the kids got bored. I thought it would be more like the Discovery Cube in Santa Ana, California, but it was not interesting enough. We had been at the Royal Ontario Museum during the first part of the day which the kids loved. They weren't too impressed with the Ontario Science Centre. They definitely need to update their exhibits.
