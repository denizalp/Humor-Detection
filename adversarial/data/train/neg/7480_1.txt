This place is always closed when I come to hard rock I think it's because they only open for dinner but this time I stayed here so my bf and I decided to make a reservation through open table and got right in and got what I requested a booth. I was very pleased to see they had some healthy options. The service was good they only had 2 people working the whole floor so I understood why they were a little slow at first but they were very nice about it and kept us informed about our order. So we ordered to start some edamame, seabass lettuce cups and chicken skewers. The seabass lettuce cups were my absolute favorite of it all like the best ever!!! They are a must get! The chicken skewers were meh I expect for skewers to be grilled but they were deep fried I wasn't a huge fan of that. Now for my main meal we got veggie fried rice and vegan king pow chicken and they were both delicious. I was surprised by this place hidden Asian gem.
