Whenever I go to allo mon coco, it is always packed with full of people. Great location, love the place. It's spacious. Staff are nice and courteous. Everytime people ask me where should we go for brunch, this place immediately comes to my mind :P but really, they serve big portions every time i go there and i always enjoy my time over there!
