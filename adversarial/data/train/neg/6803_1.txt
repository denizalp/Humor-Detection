Please spend your money somewhere else, service and quality is not up to par. I enjoy all the options on the menu, however, they always run out of sides and never have enough staff working. I've had horrible service\/quality the last 4 times I went in. Staff never apologizes for the inconvenience. I've even reached out to there customer service, a GM manager emailed me once asking me for further information but never emailed me back after that. I'm don't with this restaurant.
