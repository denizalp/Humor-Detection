I have never been to Canada and this place was a commercial bar with bar food. I got some honey hot wings that had a good sauce but I think the wings were small and not meaty, could have been because it was the special. I would come again if someone else recommended it but there are a few options on this road. Not bad food by any means, I would come again.
