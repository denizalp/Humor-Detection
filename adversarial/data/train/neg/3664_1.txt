I went in here with two others. We were looking for a drink to pass an hour or so. It was close to the hotel we were at so we headed in. In comparison to the great decor and ambiance you can find at bars in some of the newer and nicer hotels this place seemed like a dump. It is worn out and needs an update. \n\nI ordered a \"perfect margarita\" and it was a decent drink. However, it was around $11. I understand drinks are more in Vegas but I think next time I'll go somewhere more fun and not so cheesy.
