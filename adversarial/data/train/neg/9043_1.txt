My family and I always go to Roy's for special occasions and it never disappoints. \n\nOutdoor seating is wonderful. They have candles and tiki torches everywhere. It's so beautiful, especially on a nice Arizona night. \n\nI've had many different items on the menu, but my favorites are: \n\n-Lobster Potstickers \n-Panko Spicy Tuna Roll \n-Maine Lobster Bisque \n-Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish \n-Chocolate Souffle Cake \n\nI will continue to dine here as much as possible. They offer complimentary valet service and everyone from the waitresses to the manager to the busers are polite and friendly. \n\nI can't say enough about Roy's. I love it and the JW Marriott hotel.
