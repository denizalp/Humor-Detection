Made To Last is 100% the best shop I've been to. Their work speaks for themselves but the atmosphere at the shop was fantastic. I've been to a lot of shops where the artist and employees are snobby but this place felt like a barber shop. No egos, felt like a family. Ive gotten work done by Graham and Cris and will definitely come back soon.
