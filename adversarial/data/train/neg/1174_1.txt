One star for outdoor seating (we had a dog with us) and a nice waitress.\n\nWine was so-so but overpriced.  Food menu looked good but the calamari was nothing special and the veggie spring rolls were downright terrible.  I agree with everyone else, don't go here.  There are other good tapas joints in this city, and well worth the fact that they are all overpriced for this market.
