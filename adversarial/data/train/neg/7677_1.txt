Yum! Was in town and met up with a friend at this cute, colorful restaurant. The interior reminded me of a funky diner. We sat outside which was nice even in the early evening Sept weather. We each had a cucumber margarita, split a corn queso, and got a couple tacos. The margarita was nice and refreshing. I liked my tacos but I got two and only remember that I liked the shrimp. So the other one must have been \"just ok.\"  But the Star was definitely the corn queso. I usually stay away from queso since it isn't the healthiest, but this was so good and wasn't heavy feeling. Plus it had corn in it...so that makes it healthy...right? \n\nGreat place to come for a drink and apps, meet up with friends, or bring a date.
