Odd and amazing combination of things. Stopped into get my car wash and there is wine, beer on draft, desserts, pastries, coffee, bbq, great patio and the cutest gift shop...and gas station of course. I was in no rush waiting for my car. Getting my car washed is a treat now! And none of it is mediocre \"gas station\" quality. The food or the gift shop is definitely worth dropping in by itself! Thank you to the genius person for thinking outside the box. Brilliant concept!
