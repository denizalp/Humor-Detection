I ordered the homemade dry noodles with pork and it was delicious! \nThe portion size is generous and I packed half of it to go. The vegetables and noodles were fairly standard, but tasted delicious with the pork sauce and broth. \n\nThe jellyfish side dish was a delicious appetizer. The portion size was small but the flavour and texture complemented the noodles well. \n\nI took off 1-star because the wait staff were a bit clumsy. They served the meals very quickly so the soups would often spill over the side of the bowls and onto the table, creating a mess. In addition, my friend had some soup sprayed on her.
