Came here on a Friday night with the wife and was greeted by a server who didn't have  lot of enthusiasm at first but later found the energy.  The food was great. We ordered the stuffed jalape√±os, bs tomatillo ck enchilada 3 sauce fajita and the Dos XX fish tacos.  We ordered the 3 sauce fajita ck burrito for my son and told the waiter to please please please do not include any cheese for this meal we were ordering it to go. Well when we got it who would have guessed ,it had cheese on it.  I was a bit annoyed because we had been there for sometime and wanted to go home so we had to wait again for another meal to be remade.  When it did come the manager Sean Puhl apologized but didn't offer to take anything off the bill for our inconvenience.  It may be sometime before we go back here with so many options to dine in the area. To Sean Puhl and management make it right to your customers, never assume we have to eat here.
