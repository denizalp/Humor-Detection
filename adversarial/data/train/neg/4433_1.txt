We enjoyed our lunch here. With a coupon, the wife and I stopped by while running errands. I had the 10oz burger with nothing fancy, well, except bacon. It was fantastic. The missus had the Red Rock Cobb Salad.\n \nWe arrived to a semi packed place (mid-afternoon on a weekend). Although almost full, we got a booth near the front door. The decor is 'sports bar' with booths and bar tables with high chairs. The servers go for short shorts and tshirts. The place was hoppin'. Our server was friendly and quick - even with the crowd. She kept tabs on us throughout our meal and we never lacked for service.\n\nWe ordered our food and it came out in the normal time frame. The burger was cooked as I had asked and was one tasty burger. The missus enjoyed her salad and even got to take some home for a snack later.\n\nThis is a place worth the drive out (if you don't live in Summerlin) or stopping by (if you do). Prices are a tick high, but not wallet busting - maybe a buck or two higher. John Cutter is on our list of places we can go to if we're on that side of the valley.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d1723514-r340064481-John_Cutter-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html#
