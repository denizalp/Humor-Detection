Great night of jazz in Montreal. We got there early for the second show and got front row seats. We got a bottle of wine and enjoyed music from the Ally Cats. I appreciate the club politely asks guests to be quiet during the set, that way the music doesn't have to compete with any table conversations. We ordered an appetizer and it was satisfactory but nothing special. Definitely recommend for a fun night of drinks and music, I would just eat somewhere else.
