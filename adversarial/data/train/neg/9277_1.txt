As Holiday Inn's go this place is a little above average. On the plus side the bathrooms are nice with granite countertops and modern faucets. Also this place is located a couple of blocks from the metro on Bloor street near all the high end shops. Finally on the plus side this place is reasonable compared to most of the other hotels on Bloor. On the negative side the rooms are a little bit run of the mill and some of the rooms need updating. Last time I stayed here I got a room with a flat screen. Second time around I was not as lucky! The room service is served courtesy of the Firkin bar which is located on the ground level. If you like British food then you will be in paradise. I would not recommend for those with a more sophisticated pallet!
