Yorkville location: This is my favourite place to go! I live closer to this location than the location up north. For allergies & Food sensitivities this is your go to place. \nThe desserts look so appetizing! The lemon meringue tart is the best! Its too bad they don't have it everyday.  The apple crumble tart is just ok. The eclair was good. Prices seem in line with other dessert places. \n\nBought a cake for a birthday. It was not too sweet which is a good thing. It was soft & moist. The only problem is that I really didn't have much to choose from...the store only had 3 cakes made for that morning of which 2 were 4\" cakes!  The price for the cakes are a bit on the high side. $48 for a 6\" cake. \n\nHad a soup & salad for lunch & both were good. \n\nThe decor is definitely my style. The plates, napkins & cutlery all signify elegance.
