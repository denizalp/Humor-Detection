I booked a move for a two bedroom apartment that required the movers to do some packing.  They did show up on time, and they only broke one item (of course, the newest item we had - an oscillating floor fan) - none of the other items were damaged.  So for that I give them one star. \nThey spoke precious little English, and never seemed to understand that they needed to pack.  So I packed all day.  As far as moving, they were TREMENDOUSLY S-L-O-W, and three of them took from 9am until after 4pm to pack the van.  In the end we even had to leave one bedroom worth of furniture because we were running out of time. \nWhen wondering where they were I would go down to the street and find my stuff left at the third floor elevator; at the first floor elevator; and at various points in between while all three of them were monkeying around in the moving van on the street.  So much for security for mom's stuff.  They also left the building door wide open which is a security risk for the other tenants and I got an earful from the property management.  \nIn the end they charged me $1600 for this move for what was essentially an in-town move of a one-bedroom apartment. \nIf you are ever thinking of using Riteway movers, Run the other way!
