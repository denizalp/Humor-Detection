So I have tried a lot on the menu and have NOT loved w everything however the 5 stars is much deserved because of the following:\n\n- every single juice they make is excellent (I've had them all)\n- it's a gorgeous and bright restaurant, ambiance gets a fiver \n- the falafel are to die for \n-the ALMOND MILK is so good\n- best salads ever, they have incredible salad dressing \n- the cheesecake and most of the desserts are good. (I didn't care for the cookies)\n\n\nWhat didn't I like ? The muesli and the brimstone burger. The burrito just tastes like a salad wrapped in leaves- id rather eat an actual salad honestly. It's definitely an excellent spot though!
