When I called for an initial appointment, they told me they had a cancellation. I felt so lucky and assumed that being booked except for the cancellation meant they were a hip, busy salon (which is what I would expect for an upscale Henderson location). However, when I arrive, the salon was absolutely dead. There was no cancellation-- they were just not busy. At all. One stylist looked bored out of her mind and was sitting at her station cruising her cell phone. Very unprofessional. \n\nThey also failed to ask\/warn me that they were putting me with a stylist who had just graduated beauty school five months earlier. She is not ready to be cutting hair without at least having a more experienced stylist look over her work. \n\nBut I should back up. Her shampoo was horrible. She only got the surface of my hair and did not even touch\/scrub my scalp. She also put shampoo on the hair by my temples and didn't rinse it out. She also only wet the top layers of my hair and the bottom layers of my hair were barely, BARELY damp to prepare for the cut.  \n\nThe cut resulted in the most choppy, unblended layers I have ever had. When she got done with the cut she said, \"I can cut more layers if you want me to\"...Ummm, no thanks! \n\nThe charge was 40 dollars...too much for a junior stylist. \n\nShe would probably do okay with a basic cut, but does not have the skill level yet for more intricate hairstyles. It was all just very underwhelming and felt like what I would get at Fantastic Sams, Supercuts, etc.
