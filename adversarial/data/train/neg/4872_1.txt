I really like this place. Have been here several times. Great place, clean and has a big dance floor, plenty of tables. We Love coming when John Eric Band plays.  My suggestion is to work on the bar staff and make sure drinks are served as expected and not altered. We'll keep coming and keep bringing new people, hoping it keeps improving!
