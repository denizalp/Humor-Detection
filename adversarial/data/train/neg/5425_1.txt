Oil was changed, they got the job done.  Price too high, might as well have gone to dealer,  but I just wanted it done quickly.  Cordial customer service is non existent.  I sat in waiting room for 10 minutes before the guy opened the door and said \"Ford\" .  He took the basic info for the computer, didn't try to up sell but my feeling was that it was basically he just didn't care.  While waiting for the car to finish another 3 people came in and all were confused why no one immediately came out to greet and get their info. After about 15 minutes the guy returned, \"Ford\" he now walked to the payment window and told me the price again.   In all he probably spoke less then 20 words to me.  The efficiency should be in the oil change not the customer service.  This guy just doesn't like his job and is sullen.  2 stars since there are no leaks after a couple days, they reset the oil indicator and washed windows.  Won't go back, won't recommend.
