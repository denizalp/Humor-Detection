This place is just too big.  Kinda like a walmart of electronics.  I've been to the one in San Diego and now here in Vegas and there's really no difference.  For some reason I always end up here when I need something like a wireless router.  There's about 200 different varieties but none that you want.  The inventory is just scattered about with no rhyme or reason to the organization.  Get ahold of one of the teenage salespeople for help and they can't really explain anything.  They just tell you the most expensive one is the one you need.  They do sell some Apple products but no one seems to know anything about them.  There's a snack\/coffee area in the middle of the store so that's cool.  Fry's isn't terrible, but I prefer Best Buy, Circuit City or the Apple Store for my electronic needs.
