This is an amazing restaurant. I am the type of person that does not go out of the box when trying to new friends. I stay with my traditional foods. However, as soon as is tasted the 'Flaming Feta,' it made me realize that there probably is a lot more foods out there that I would enjoy. I have tried their Flaming Feta to their Pepperoni Calzones. They have there ingredients to a \"T.\" I would definitely suggest dining here for lunch or dinner. I promise, the staff does not let you down!
