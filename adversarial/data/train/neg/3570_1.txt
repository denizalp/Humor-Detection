I have not been to a Red Robin since 2010 so I don't know if it's a decline in food quality or the fact that I was in high school and had no taste at the point but we visited the other day and it was meh. The server was decent and we noticed that three tables in 5 minutes were getting something comped from their bill. We weren't sure if this was the server or the restaurant but we should have paid more attention. My chicken sandwich was average, but not worth the 10.00 and my boyfriend was the least satisfied. He asked for the bottomless root beer float but instead of rootbeer he'd like coke. The server brought the rootbeer float AND a glass of coke, even after explaining, again what he wanted, no fix. Then his burger came out and he took two bites and wanted to leave. Thank god we can pay by card at our seat or we would have waited ten minutes to flag someone down. Next time I know to save the 40.00 and go elsewhere.\n\nOh and he asked for fresh jalape√±os on his burger as that was an option and got deep fried instead. He said it was all mush and that also killed the burger.
