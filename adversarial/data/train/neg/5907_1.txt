Wow... Cox please get it together!!!  A lot of people have said it better than me but I ordered the service just yesterday and I'm super pissed.  Their sales team told me a bunch of lies..  I had my box installed on a sun. and had no way while the technitions were there to change my \"work order\".  It was absolutely wrong ... When they left I had 12 channels and the lowest grade internet for $64\/ month.  ( I get that I hadent ordered the essential package). Which includes any real channels but in the range of $100\/month or more.   My only request was the ID channel... Which I was over and over prommised. When I called to complain the very next day I spent literally 2 hrs on the phone even using the callback system because the wait times were so long only to hear that they will not honor the package I signed up for.  I'm an internet streamer I pay my $7.99 for Netflix and I have Amazon prime as well.  They finally ended up after 2hrs of lies giving me a 3 month \"promo\" price of my original promissed order price which I will promptly cancel in 3 months.  I sincerely hope cox realises they are not in \"the digital age'. and they cannot monopolize the market with those prices.   Please reasearch other options because there are many... Including real wireless options my opinion they are seriously behind in this market and lie to people to get customers.  Sincerely and regretfully a 3- month customer. P.s I have no knowledge of your technitions on a personal level but its pretty bad when they are recommending other companies durring the install... Only wish I would have listened.
