Amazing! The best word to describe the experience, food\/cappuccinos and staff. We were in town for the weekend from Toronto and looking for a quick breakfast before heading back home. The staff was incredibly welcoming and helpful with selecting options to eat. \n\nWe would recommend their signature croissant sandwich with homemade ingredients and a side of fresh fruit salad. We paired it with easily THE BEST CAPPUCCINO we've ever had. Perfect creama consistency and the foam was thick and flavorful. No sugar needed! \n\nHighly, highly recommend checking this place out for a quick bite. You won't be disappointed. PS- we even grabbed another Cappuccino on the way out to the airport. Who needs Starbucks??
