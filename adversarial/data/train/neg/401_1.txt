Loved it! It seems a little pricey but it takes nearly 3 hours to complete the course and that makes it worth it. I'm 51 and in OK shape and I did just fine. That said, I  skipped the 2 \"extreme\" crossings and chose the less challenging alternatives. My 55 y\/o husband  has a dad bod and he aced the course.  My visiting twentyish sons LOVED it.  The orientation was great, I felt completely safe at all times and the staff was very encouraging. We will be back!
