This was the first time I'd tried breakfast at Showmars.  Not sure how many of them are serving breakfast.  It might just be this location because of where they are located.\n\nI definitely agree that Showmars may have been better when they are smaller - what are they up to now, some 30 locations?  I'm happy for them and all, but they just lose something when they are no longer trying as hard.\n\nThe staff is friendly enough, but it's not that much different from your typical breakfast service at any diner.
