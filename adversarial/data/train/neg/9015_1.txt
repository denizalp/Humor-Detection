Absolutely love everything about this place. The establishment, the staff, the doctor, everything. I went for adult braces after being referred by my dentist, Dr. Blazer and was not disappointed in the least. Elisa (sp) was my tech throughout the whole thing and she is phenomenal! Meredith handled financing and she is absolutely amazing. Angie was always a smiling friendly face to see, as well. They are a wonderful team. I will recommend and refer them to everyone, adults and kids. I'm incredibly happy with my results, too. Thank you for being so awesome, guys!
