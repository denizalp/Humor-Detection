The restaurant seems to have lost its mojo! I have been a regular ever since the time when it was on Dundas. Very slow service. The Jan brothers used to take a personal interest, but now they are nowhere to be seen, leaving it to up to the kitchen staff to manage. The individual recipes for their Frontier Gosht, Karahi is now a base which is used for every entree. Though the restaurant may have standardized it's recipes, and increased their clientele, but at a cost. From 2010 to now, it's a seismic shift. Sad
