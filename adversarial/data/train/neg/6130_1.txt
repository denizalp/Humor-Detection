i dislike overpriced, basic foods & Rockaberry is exactly that. Pies are okay, the only one i recommend is the apple cheese crumb. The pies are usually too heavy and impossible to finish a whole slice and the crumbs are lacking some sort of ice cream and lightness, thus the apple cheese crumb has come to the rescue. everything else on the menu, mehhh.
