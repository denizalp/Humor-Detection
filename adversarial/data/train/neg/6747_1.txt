Overall, we're pleased with the experience w\/ Olson Iron Works when they installed our front door\/porch security gate. However, they did miss the deadline or 2 weeks, which was originally quoted to me. So I'm knocking them down for that and only giving them 4-stars. \n\nThey were the lowest bidder that said they could get the installation handled by the deadline. The craftsmanship was excellent. The design is what I wanted and fit well w\/ the entire architecture of the property. The workers were nice and I felt they were also very professional. There was only one experience where I felt they could've called me back sooner on a certain matter, but they're pretty busy so I let it slide that one time. \n\nI would recommend them. However, I would stress more if you have a certain deadline you want the installation. \n\nThanks for your help Olson Iron Works.
