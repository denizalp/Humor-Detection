I'm a laid back guy...really. \n\nWhen I make an appointment for 3:30 the day before, and you don't have me on the books when I show up, we can figure out a solution. It's not the end of the world. \n\nThey called me 5:10 to say they had finished with the car, which was OK. In some ways it worked to my benefit, as I was stuck at a store a few minutes away. \n\nThe gentleman at the counter answered my questions and was informative. \n\nMy complaint is that when I went to pick up the car, it was filthy. The outside of the car had grease all over the handle, as did the the inside handle, inner door, the steering wheel, the gear shift and the center console (which I had just reupholstered last week.) \n\nMaybe it's just me, but I'd take an extra moment and put on gloves before moving a customer's car. \n\nThe center console had so much grease on it, I had to spit shine it with a tissue first before leaving the lot. I cleaned the rest up when I got home. This is amateurish stuff here, use gloves!
