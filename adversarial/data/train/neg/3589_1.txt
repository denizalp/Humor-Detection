My friend had this place bookmarked for a while and we finally decided to try it. \nThere was three of us on a Wednesday night at 8PM. The restaurant has a lot of tables and seating.... and it was EMPTY. Except for two grandpas sitting a few tables down from us. \n\nLooking over the menu, everything was overpriced. We decided on sharing two items, the kimchi pancake and kimchi pasta. \nThe waiter was nice and helpful. He gave us the alcohol promotion going on and opinions when we asked for what was popular at this restaurant that didn't include pork. [My friend does not eat pork, it makes her sick].\n\nThe kimchi pancake came out first. It was good\/average. The concern I had with the pancake was, in some bites there was something chewy. I assumed it was seafood bits and didn't bother to ask. But it did confuse me a little since normally kimchi pancakes don't have seafood unless you order seafood pancake.... \n\nThe kimchi pasta came out and my friends were eating it. I took a bite and immediately only tasted bacon [not kimchi]. I looked over at my friend who was trying to pretend it was fine. I immediately called over the waiter to inquire if the pasta has pork. The waiter looked horrified and quickly took back the plate and told us he will bring out a new kimchi pasta without pork. We weren't angry or frustrated at all.\nYet, to show his sincerity, the waiter offered a free soft drink for the issue. It was a small issue, but I was thankful for customer service he offered.\n\nTLDR; The food serviced here is overpriced. For the price, the meal quality is not equivalent. Service was great.
