I stayed at the Quad this past weekend since I had a an event at the Flamingo and it was cheaper to stay at the Quad than there.  I had room 810 in tower 2 and it was perfectly serviceable.  The room was clean as were the sheets.  I had a coffee maker in the room and the room was made up by housekeeping everyday while I was out.   Really for the price I paid for it that was all I was expecting.  I did hear a couple of people in the elevator complaining about horribleness in their rooms but I did not experience it.  \n\nI had a Diamond card for my event so I used the VIP check in and it was quick and easy.   I checked out early in the morning so there was no line at the regular check out.  I did try to use their TV check out but it wasn't working at that time.
