I took my girlfriend here to get her nose pierced, and it took Steve 4 times of piercing it to get it done!! He literally clamped it and put the needle in 4 separate times, and then messed with the jewelry in between. It turned out the post wasn't long enough. Why couldn't he tell on the first go through?!! Her face is extremely swollen and bruised, and she felt like she was being tortured. Worst experience EVER!! We will NEVER return to this place!!!!
