A cute tiny restaurant located on Kingston road in Scarborough. Once you enter the restaurant you are faced with the take out order counter, and on the right there are about 5 tables of 4 seater if you fancy for a sit down meal. There is one washroom that is relatively clean.   The service is standard, but the food is quite good. You know you are eating real Thai food when you can taste the tamarind in the pad Thai.  As for the price it is standard, e.g a plain pad Thai is $9.95, but to add chicken or beef it cost additional  $2 and $3 for shrimp.
