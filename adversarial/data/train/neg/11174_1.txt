Over several days, Armand and I traded text messages regarding replacing my 24 year old Genie garage door openers.  When I finally got serious about his system recommendations, I called to discuss further. He gave me very reasonable quotes over the phone and I accepted.  To my surprise, he said he would be able to do the installs later that afternoon. He and an associate arrived at 4:30pm and had two Liftmasters in place by 7pm.  This included replacing all the rollers, a spring, center bearing, cables, and installing an external keypad.  There was also some engineering involved to devise a special mounting bracket for one of the openers that was mounted to a \"not quite standard\" header. Armand worked quickly and does not tolerate a messy work area.  Trash and old components were disposed of as they were generated...no big pile of junk anywhere.  Both openers work great; the remotes are programmed as is the external keypad.  The only disappointment is the fact that I own older cars (10 years plus) that do not have the rolling code HomeLink technology, making it impossible to program the HomeLink transmitters in the cars. This will necessitate the purchase of a \"compatibility bridge\/repeater\".... or more remotes.  Of course, this is not Armand's fault, but future customers should be aware of this possibility.  Armand did a great job at a great price and I look forward to seeing him next year for annual maintenance.
