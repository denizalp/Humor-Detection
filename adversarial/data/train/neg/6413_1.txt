Simply I just like the food and service better here than in the Food Court in the Grand Canal Shoppes. The portions are bigger, their Sweet Pork barbacoa is on point and with the GCS employee discount $10 bucks for everything. If it wasn't for my friend I probably be paying more money at the Chipotle for half the quantity of food I am getting here.
