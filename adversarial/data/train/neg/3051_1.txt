Mayra makes me look good!  When I first met her, she asked me what I was looking for and she made it easy for me to trust her.  She gives the BEST haircuts in addition to great color!!! .  \n\nSalon was well kept and very inviting.   Other employees were very nice as well.  While, the prices aren't cheap, I would say she is worth every buck!!!
