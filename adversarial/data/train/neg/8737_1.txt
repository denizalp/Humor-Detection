People stop whining about waiting. Geeze. This restaurant is in a busy spot in a busy town. Fun to sit outside where you can watch the tourists and showpieces (Spartacus in a speedo, and a nun with her chest hanging out making a few bucks taking pics w tourists). \nOur server was not great but we liked the food. My son liked the mac n cheese burger, and my burger was very good too. Almost every table was taking pics of their food - there are some interesting concoctions. \nHigher price than I want to pay, but I am on the strip where prices are high. Don't like it? Whine about it or go elsewhere I say. \nIt was over 100 degrees and they had the mist sprayers going above the patio. When u first sit down it seems a bit much, but in a few minutes it felt good.
