The Hospitality parlors are a fantastic venue at the Venetian Hotel.  My husband and I had our wedding reception there at it was fantastic!  The price was so reasonable and will definitely keep this place in mind for any future gatherings!!! The space can hold 50 people and has a dance floor and bar set up which included a bartender.  Also, the Venetian bartender made the most amazing Lemon Drop Martinis!  Almost 4 years later the guests are still talking about those drinks!!!
