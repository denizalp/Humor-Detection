Obivously here in Phoenix, we can't get top grade sushi, so this place is okay. (I usually do not order sushi but other dishes)  The quality of the food is bearable but the service you get, not so. It seems from other reviews this place does this quite often to its customers but my girlfriends I went for a brief lunch on Friday and asked to have our bill split.  When the old Japanese waitress heard that, she got really irritated and said \"we'll add tip to your bill\".  WHAT?? for splitting a check you have to add on the gratuity?  Since there were four of us, we thought, okay whatever.  When it was time for us to order, some of us were bit hesitant trying to decide and the waitress got all frustrated and showed it on her face like she didn't want to be there. OMG, it wasn't like the place was crowded with customers, she had only two other tables and she was working with another waitress.  And after we ordered, she NEVER CAME BACK to our table!!!!  When the food came that was the only time she came back to give us our food, and never came back to check on our drinks or to see if we needed anything.  Fortunately the other young waitress came and tried to tend to our table which was nice of her.  Finally the bill came and she wrote everything down on one sheet and total was like around $59.xx for four of us, and she added 11.80 for tip.  So I asked her if it was cutomary for them to add 20% gratuity.  Then she rolls her eyes and goes \"it's 18%, not 20%\"  What?  I may not be a math genius but that is about 20% not 18% that she claimed.  My girlfriends and I did not want to make a big deal out of 2% difference so we left it at that.  But to be honest, I did not want to leave any tip for her.  I couldn't believe they tagged on gratuitiy simply because we asked to have our bill split.  This was the second visit we wished we had our lunch somewhere else.  I guess we're not coming back here anymore.
