Wedgewood KNOWS how to do events!  If you are planning a wedding, stop.  Your search is over.  Go check out Wedgewood at Stallion Mountain!\n\nThe all inclusive wedding package was very affordable and the experience we received was impeccable.  There was not a single detail left undone and everyone was WOWED! Everyone at Wedgewood exceeded our expectations our vision was executed flawlessly.  The garden area for the ceremony was beautiful as well as the events space.  Wedgewood works with outstanding vendors too...DJ Murphy was nothing short of amazing, flowers were stunning, the officiant was personable and funny, and they work with Freed's bakery for the cake....hello....awesome!\n\nThe food was outstanding!  We were particularly impressed with the extra special touch when the banquet staff prepared the bride and groom's dinner plates for them and carried them to their table.  WOW....we know how many things could go wrong with a dinner plate and a wedding dress from the buffet back to the dinner table.  This is the kind of attention to detail the staff executes in everything they do\n\nJacqueline was an absolute joy to work with.  We had some unique requests and she has the ultimate CAN DO attitude and executed them flawlessly.  It was a perfect day from start to finish.
