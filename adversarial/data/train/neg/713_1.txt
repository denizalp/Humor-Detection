You cannot go wrong with Arizona Shutters and Blinds. I have used them twice now and each time for a unique circumstance. In both instances they were top notch every step of the way! I cannot rave highly enough about this company. First of all, as a manufacturer you cut out the middle man and only pay for the quality and service you get from the one company. Their plantation shutters are beautifully manufactured and will last decades. Mark, the sale rep was a pleasure to deal with and beyond knowledgable. The installer Martin did a fantastic job, was fast and did an excellent clean up job. They even sent out the shop foreman Ivan to assess a shutter that we needed to have resized due to a remodel in the kitchen.  They have taken great care of us and I recommend anyone looking for window coverings to contact them!
