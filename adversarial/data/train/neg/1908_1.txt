This place is filthy. On the counter where I picked up my food, there was a big honey looking spill. No on bothered to clean it as my food was pushed across the counter. Where I went get my straw and napkins, there was a dirty rag and cleaning bottle. The health department would love that.The reason a gave two stars is that the staff was very nice and the Rice Bowl was good. I just hope I don't get food poisoning.
