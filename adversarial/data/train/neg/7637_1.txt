Went on a Friday night. Arrived an hour early (luckily). Ticket line was not too bad, 6 or 7 people in front of us, we made it through in 5 minutes or so. - 4 stars\n\nThen came the snack bar... or 'Hell' as I like to call it.\n\nWe were #5 in line. Took 20 minutes to be served. After being served, it took a further 25 minutes to get our order (2 pretzels, 1 soda, 1 Icee, 1 popcorn). The server disappeared for 20 of the 30 minutes. The manager attempted to help, but only succeeded in confusing herself on the register and double ringing the popcorn & Icee before the server re-appeared. -2 stars\n\nFound decent seats in the theater, comfortable, with removable armrests and recline... great for my bad back.  4 stars\n\nThen took a quick \"bio-break\" before the show started. The men's room floors were awful! puddles of urine all over, 2 empty soap dispensers, 1 empty towel dispenser, and I don't think the automatic air freshener was working (if they had one).  -2 stars\n\nAveraging things out, 3 stars... quick at the ticket window, comfortable seats, awesome Cinnabon Pretzel (only good think about the snack bar).
