If you are looking for authentic and delicious Indian\/Pakistani food in Vegas, Kabob and more is the best choice. We ordered the chicken karahi, Chana Daal and Chicken boti kabab and it was delicious. We reached there around 1:30 am just before their closing time but the hospitality and food was top class. Would definitely  recommend this place. We came multiple times during our Vegas trip and everything we tried was delicious.
