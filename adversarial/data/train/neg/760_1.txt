If you are looking for a cheap buffet and\/or want an introduction to classic American home cooking, then the Garden Court Buffet at the Main Street Station is for you.  The buffet is only $9 for dinner ($8 if you join their player's club) and offers a whole array of American classics, from fried chicken to roast beef and manicotti, to pork shoulder and make-your-own-tacos.  There are also pasta salads, mashed and baked potatoes, green beans, steamed carrots, etc.  The only thing really missing are ribs.  The casino seems attract Filipino\/Hawaiians, so there were a few Chinese\/Filipino\/Hawaiian offerings as well.\n\nWe weren't too hungry so we didn't taste that many dishes, but the manapua (Hawaiian steamed pork buns) were the best I've tasted.  The pork had the perfect combination of acid and sweetness and they kept very well in the steam table.  I wholeheartedly recommend this.  The other winner are the mashed potatoes.  They are perfectly seasoned and taste just of what they are.  The kalua pork was also pretty good, but as the main flavor in this dish is liquid smoke, it's hard to get it wrong.\n\nOther dishes weren't as great.  My daughters enjoyed the \"make your own tacos\" station and I liked the tortilla chips, but the guacamole needed more avocado.  The fried chicken was crispy, but it tasted like the microwavable kind.  The lumpia and chow mein both needed more seasoning.  My husband liked the pasta salad (or was it potato salad?), but it wasn't cold enough.\n\nThe biggest loser of the day was the mac & cheese  I didn't taste it, but my daughter could barely stomach one bite - and this is not a picky child.  The other loser was the melon, which was unripe and not sweet.\n\nDesserts were the best part.  Their banana cream pie was particularly tasty, but their key lime pie wasn't bad - though too sour.  The cheesecake was great, if a bit sweet.  Everyone's favorite, of course, was the soft-serve station.  There are many other choices, however: from pies to pastries to puddings.\n\nService was great, our waiter refilled our glasses often.\n\nIn all, it was a very pleasant experience.
