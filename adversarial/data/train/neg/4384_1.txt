Great food, good service. This is the only place I've been going to for Vietnamese food since it opened. It seems like other pho places all go downhill after a while but this one has kept their quality like it was day one. \n\nMy favorite dish is the vermicelli with grilled pork and Vietnamese sausages (#B4 on the menu) and the deep fried chicken wings (takes 10 mins to make so we always order it first right when we sit down. Their summer rolls are also pretty good. I have tried quite a few dishes off the menu and I've yet to be disappointed. \n\nI believe a second location is opening soon so I'm quite looking forward to trying it out there as well.
