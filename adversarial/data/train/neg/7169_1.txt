Incredible experience here - they use plastic to line the tubs for your pedicure. I love this as its very sanitary. \nMy nail technician Michael was amazing. I received a gel manicure from him and he was friendly and very meticulous. There was no paint on my cuticles (which causes your nail polish to chip) and he made sure they were exactly how I wanted them. He also didn't speak another language around me which made me feel more comfortable being around him. \n\nI highly recommend Vys from the one experience I've had here thus far.
