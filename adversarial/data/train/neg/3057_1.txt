I'm not a New Year's Resolution kind of a girl, but last winter was really tough for me due to the frigid cold of a new city. Having learned my lesson, I purchased a Barre 3 Groupon and signed up for the January challenge.\n\nThis was the BEST $ I have ever spent! Not only did I get a great deal, I got the ultimate bang for my buck. For 5 weeks I attended 4 Barre 3 classes\/wk. Each time I was led by a fabulous instructor, got an awesome workout, and listened to a fun playlist. I preregistered for each class on their easy-to-use site, and this really helped guaranteed my attendance because I committed in advance.\n\nI haven't felt this strong in a long time! My entire body is more toned, and my balance even improved. I highly recommend checking out Barre 3 Toronto!
