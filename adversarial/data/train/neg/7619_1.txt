I ordered a naked cake for my son's 1st Birthday Party (1\/28) and everyone loved it!!! My husband and I were a little apprehensive about spending more than the usual amount of $40 on a cake, but we had heard such great things about Baker-Wee through our friend Stella at work, and decided to place an order. As soon as we got the cake we could not have been happier and even more when we had a slice! Thank you so much for your deliciousness! We will continue ordering cakes from you guys. I will make sure to grab some business cards from you guys, since almost everyone wanted to know where we ordered the cake from.
