This was definitely a last-minute choice...mainly because my hotel is across the way and I was too lazy to drive to a good buffet. I guess for the price you can't complain. But I'm going to anyway. Lame food, lame service...just lame. First and last time here! As far as buffets go, I'll do better planning next time.
