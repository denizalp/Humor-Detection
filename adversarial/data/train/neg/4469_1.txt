Fernando's is a newer food truck that is usually parked on Fifth Street.\n\nOn a Friday night when I was walking back home from a friend's place, I decided to give it a try. \n\nThe truck doesn't appear to have much of a menu. There was a sign that listed only three menu options, tacos for $2, burritos for $7 and I believe quesadillas also for $7. I asked what comes on the burrito and what the meat options were. After being told \"chicken, steak or pork\" I opted for 2 tacos instead, just to give it a try before committing to a $7, probably huge burrito. Fernando's could greatly improve their advertising\/menu if there were more detailed explanations of what they had. The truck says they have nachos, but nachos were not one of the three items listed on the menu! They need a full menu, with descriptions!\n\nI got my food quick and dashed home to try it. The tacos were as expected a little on the small side. They came with corn tortillas and had meat, cheese, onion, tomato and lettuce on it, plus maybe a little cilantro or something similar.\n\nThe tacos were not bad, although I could not differentiate between the pork and the steak right away. Once I did though, the pork was of considerable better quality and flavor than the steak. The \"steak\" seemed to be more of a ground beef, and because of this I was a little disappointed in the steak taco. Both tacos were on the greasy side.\n\nThey also included two little cups of salsa with my tacos. One was a smoky chipotle and the other was a very lime-green colored verde salsa. The verde was delicious, the chipotle was just alright, both were fairly spicy.\n\nEither way, I only spent $4 and aside from the steak being a little lackluster, the tacos were not bad and satisfied that midnight food craving.
