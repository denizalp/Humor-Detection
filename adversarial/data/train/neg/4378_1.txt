Took my family to their first Waffle House and they loved it!! From the customer service to the food, everything was great. Alan was our server and he was on point and friendly. Meeca (I believe that was her name) was hilarious and friendly. I didn't get the cooks name but he rocked out on the griddle and was super nice!! I been to several Waffle Houses in different states and hands down this was my best experience. Waffles were golden and fluffy, eggs cooked perfectly and my covered grits were a special high light..California dont know about grits like these lol
