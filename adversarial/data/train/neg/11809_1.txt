I have never been do impressed with a contractor like Sunguard. Walter and team exceeded all expectations.  Our rental property was in bad shape. The paint was faded and the stucco had numerous cracks. Sunguard gave us a competitive quote, explained everything they needed to do and completed the work in a timely manner. The house looks brand new. The detail to the eaves and doors was incredible. Thank you.
