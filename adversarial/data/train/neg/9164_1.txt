The Pinball hall of fame is a great place to stop in Vegas. I love pinball, so I'm baised, but this place presents everything well.  Games are all 50 or 75 cents, and they have an incredible selection.  Think of your favorite pinball game; it's likely at the pinball hall of fame.  The games come from all different eras and difficulties over the last 100 years or so.  \n\nThere are games besides pinball, some really unique and old school stuff (try out the home run derby from the 1940s).  \n\nThey have a change machine, but no ATM on site. Even a moderate pinball fan will enjoy an hour or two here, and compared to the casinos, it's quite a bargain.
