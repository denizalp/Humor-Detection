This place is a mill...Dr. Tram was hours late to my husband's procedure in the hospital because he'd done over 40 that day (according to him). He looked at his phone while explaining how difficult it was going to be to not hit the heart while doing this procedure. He took a phone call for 3 minutes in the same room with me while he was explaining post-op to me while I was crying! Worst bedside manner ever! WAY TOO BUSY!
