This place....ehhhh....the lighting WRECKS MY WHOLE EXISTENCE. But I never leave without purchasing something householdish (is that a word?) I gotta give it to them, they have some nice steals you can randomly purchase. However, they rarely ever have anything specific. The line is always long so make sure your purchase is worth while and equally that you will not want to return it because you will have to stand in that long line again. On average I will go back on a random free day if I happen to go to TJ Max next door again (where I found nothing by the way)
