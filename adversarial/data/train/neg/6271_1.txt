Rating is for customer service.  It took us 30 minutes to find someone help us.  I even went to the customer service desk for help and the person there told me they would get someone \"right away\".  Sure.  Other than that, this place has almost everything you would need.  I would say I like this place better than Best Buy, but that would be a lie.  All the things you need, but no one to help guide you through it?  Not for me.
