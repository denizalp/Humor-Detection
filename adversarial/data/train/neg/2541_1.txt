The BEST Olive Garden I have ever visited... hands down. What made my experience here so amazing was the quality of service from every single member of the staff, from manager to busperson. The waiter assigned to our table was great, but I was impressed with the fact that any time they were in the area, other waitstaff came to check on us regularly. Everyone provided phenomenal service including suggesting menu items, ensuring our drinks were always full, etc.. I have been to Olive Garden Restaurants across the country and have never had a service experience this phenomenal. It was so good that I left about a 50% tip! I highly recommend this location and will be returning!
