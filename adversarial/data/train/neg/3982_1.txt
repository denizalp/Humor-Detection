If you want your skin to look amazing, Joan is the best.  I go to different spas all over the place, always trying to get a deal, but I always end up coming back to see Joan.  She knows what she is doing and my skin looks the best after her treatments.  She has a really small spa, it is a one woman show, but I care the most about the service and products she uses on your face.  The prices are average to a little pricey but it is well worth it.  It is your face after all.
