First time I've been disappointed in Rise and Shine.  I usually go with the steak and eggs, with the pot of bread.   Today I went with the corned beef hash and eggs.  It's not even corned beef.  It was bacon hash and not a single piece of corned beef.  It was ok but definitely not what I expected.    Eggs ordered over medium.  Came out over hard. And the toast?   It was ok, but I will never understand sending toast out with hard butter on the side.   We asked for them to soften it, however the toast wasn't hot enough to melt it.  Seriously?   I will stick with Mary's Hash House for my hash.  And no, not the over rated Hash House a Go Go.
