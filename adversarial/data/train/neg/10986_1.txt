Stopped in for a drink around 9PM on our way home from dinner. The bouncer stopped us at the door and scanned our drivers licenses explaining to us this was a private club and we needed a membership to enter. He handed us free membership cards explaining next time to show it as we entered. The bar looked very nice, we had one drink and left. We were put off by an establishment taking our information, wonder who they will sell it to.
