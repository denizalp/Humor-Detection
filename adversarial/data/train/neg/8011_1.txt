Super fun space to eat in - the windows bring in the bright Phoenix sunshine. Great color schemes and plenty of seating inside (plus seating on the patio, although 7th street can get quite noisy).\n\nI tried the Vegan Veggie Scramble with a side of toast (rye!) and fruit. The scramble was okay - not a lot of seasoning or spice to pep it up. The toast was yummy, and I appreciated the vegan spread served with it. My husband with the Vegan Soyrizo Burrito with the sweet potato hash. The hash was disappointing - more mash than hash, if you will. Crisping it up would be ideal. The burrito was also ok - nothing that wowed the tastebuds.\n\nI always appreciate when restaurants - especially those that serve breakfast - have dedicated vegan items. I hope Scramble continues to keep those and add a few tweaks to really elevate these meals to a new level.
