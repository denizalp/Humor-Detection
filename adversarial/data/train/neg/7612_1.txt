I would like to start out by saying that this was my first time visiting Duckworth.  My experience with this restaurant was amazing.  The food was amazing and the server was on top of his job. The atmosphere was comfortable. I have to say that I have found a wonderful place to go hang out to eat and enjoy nice people.
