I've had them come out twice now and both times felt like I was provided the highest level of professional treatment and HVAC assessment available. Most recently, I was informed that a damper wasn't properly calibrated and air wasn't flowing correctly. Would have never known it had the tech not taken the time to notice and adjust it, then explain it to me. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone.\n\nThis is the kind of company and treatment you always hope you'll get but often don't Rudy Cools is doing it the right way and will lay claim to loyal customers along the way!
