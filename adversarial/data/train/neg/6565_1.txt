Started with the French onion soup. Asked for no bread in the soup... Yes it came with no bread.. Awesome! They melted the cheese on the dish, nice and crisply, while chewy on the inside. Great attention to detail .\n\nThem ordered the aged bone in ribeye. Pricy but worth it. Certain out exactly like I ordered it. Really difficult to find anything wrong here. \n\nCan't forget the staff. Veery polite.
