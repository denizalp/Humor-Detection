If i could give 10 stars i would! Last minute i called custom cakes for a birthday cake i needed in two days. I asked if they could make a LA Fitted Hat. The cake turned out absolutely amazing!! It looked identical to the hat. They put so much detail into in including the stitching and the logo. Not only did the cake look incredible the taste was fantastic!! White cake with oreo filling. It could not have been better!!!  Thank you so much!!!
