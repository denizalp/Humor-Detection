We like the doctor. He is caring and answers all our questions regarding our kids health. In the other hand, his secretary is rude.Every time we call to ask for an appointment she makes us wait in line for a long time and when we finally can talk to her, she does not let us finish talking, always interrupting us when we speak or when we are trying to explain something. not friendly at all. She does not know how to treat people in a polite way. She is the only reason I don't give Dr. Wise 5 stars rating.
