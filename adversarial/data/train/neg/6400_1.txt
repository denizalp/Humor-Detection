This restaurant just changed its name to Thai Thai and raised it prices. I was a loyal take-out and sit-in customer. Not anymore. Recently, I had a beer,soup and entree\nand the bill was $32 without the tip. Do they think they are on the Strip? The food quality is good, but not at these prices! I'll be looking for a better priced Thai place.\nI wish them well!
