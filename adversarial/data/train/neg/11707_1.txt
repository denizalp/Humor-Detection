Wonderful service and the sense of security for the price! I went in to get my car checked up on and found that the front right cv boot needed replacing as well as the front left bearing due to some grinding noise I was hearing. It was apparently fixed but not a day later my car was un-drivable due to my right bearing needing replacement and my abs sensor failing. Firestone had my car towed and fixed at their expense because they missed these things in their initial check-up and gave me no trouble at all. They will definitely be my usual mechanics. John gave me exceptional service! Definitely recommend it!
