I've been studying Ocho Kantos Kali under Guro Cuenca for another two years now... And Guro teaches only whats effective none of the fluffy stuff.  His version is straight to the point nothing fancy; just go in stop the threat and go home.  If you want the fancy fluffy stuff I know of a kung fu studio that tries to teach it, but doesn't even come close to what Guro can teach.  The sparring sessions here was an I opener for me especially when we spar with knives.  I've learned very early just because you have a knife doesn't make you a \"knife fighter\".  Your here to survive a knife encounter.
