I drive all the way across town to see this Dr! Everyone on the staff is friendly and kind, and they don't nickel and dime you like some vets. They give you reasonable treatment options and their prices are affordable (all vet care is expensive, but they at least leave you feeling like you didn't get taken to the cleaners) Today I took my dog in to find out she had a bladder infection. She was a mess, so she also had her glands expressed and because I had mentioned to the Dr I was pregnant with very bad morning sickness he even cleaned her up for me afterwards so I didn't have to go home and deal with it. I can't express how thoughtful that was of him and his assistant! This is just the type of reason why I will continue to drive 45 minutes out of my way to see someone who doesn't rip you off, AND cares about his clients (both human and animal). Love this place!
