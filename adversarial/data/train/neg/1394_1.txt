This would be a 3 but for the prices they charge it just doesn't deserve a better rating. Started with the homemade chips and onion dip. This turned out to be the highlight of the meal as the steaks we got were definitely less than 7oz and the burger, ordered medium rare, was nearly medium well. \n\nThe lobster chowder was bizarrely bland and sweet. Very off flavor that improved to just edible with a lot of pepper. Our waiter was attentive, but told us a replacement Cabernet for the Merlot we ordered \"tastes the same.\"  It did not. And also that BÃ©arnaise (which they have) is the same as Hollandaise (which they don't). While these things may be similar it is insulting to be told you can't tell the difference. \n\nThe atmosphere and food quality just does not support prices competitive with top end steak houses. Not recommended.
