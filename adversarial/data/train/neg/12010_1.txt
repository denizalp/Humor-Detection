Finally went to check out what I've decided is Charlotte's unique pizza.  It was awesome.  For under $11, I got a pizza customized with two different sauces, unlimited toppings--each half-and-half, a $#1t-ton of cheese, and falafel and fig.  Seriously amazing.  Two adults were both totally, totally full.  Too full to even think about ice cream (which as butterfinger and chocolate sounded like a great idea BEFORE we sat down to eat but several hours later we still are stuffed).\n\nThe shape makes it really nice to customize as a half-and-half or to split with someone else.  And I love the thin crust and tons of cheese.  This is absolutely going to be my go-to pizza when I'm in the area (i.e., at home and not at work).\n\nLost a star because the server was incredibly difficult to hear and understand.  But aside from not knowing exactly what everything was or how it all worked, after one round I'm comfortable enough to say I've got the hang of it.  Still wish I knew better what was in all of the sauces and what, exactly, each of the different meats were, but I'll just try them all eventually I guess.
