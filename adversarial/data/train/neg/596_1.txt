This was a neat place to eat!  I loved the gas station, car wash, boutique shop, and restaurant all combined!  They had a lot of BBQ sauces to try.  I had pulled pork BBQ tacos.  My daughter had a pulled pork sandwich.  The food was great, but the portions weren't very big.  The soda station was fun for the kids.
