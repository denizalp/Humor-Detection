I came to Over Easy this past weekend for brunch around noon. The place was packed with a few groups waiting outside for a table as well. We were seated pretty quickly, only had to wait 2 minutes. \n\nOverall, I was surprised when I walked inside because the restaurant was so cramped with tiny booths all over. The waiters had great coordination in making sure they didn't bump into one another as they were walking up and down the tiny aisles. Service was also very fast and efficient, I can imagine they turn over very quickly at this place. \n\nI ordered a Tuscan omelette (sundried tomatoes, asiago cheese, sauteed mushrooms) with home fries and rye toast. It came piping hot to the table and was delicious! The cheese was ooey gooey and there were large pieces of mushrooms, a very packed omelette with tons of flavour. Needed a touch of seasoning though but that's not a big deal, I prefer when the food is under salted to over salted. The homefries were the tiniest diced potatoes, crispy all the way round and sauteed with onions, the gave a HUGE portion of home fries with the omelette. Toast arrived in a cute little basket although the jam selection was mediocre (there was only strawberry). \n\nPrices were decent as well, we spent around $30 for two people including tax and tip. \n\nI would highly recommend this place, a cosy spot with a large selection of breakfast and lunch dishes, something for everyone!
