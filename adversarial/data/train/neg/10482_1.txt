So happy we found this place!  It's on the north end of the strip just south of the Riviera.  Cool decor with mirrors and neon.  The portion were GIGANTIC.  Totally enough to share one dish with two people.  I had the Mediterranean Omelet it's absolutely loaded with seafood ($13.50).  Service was very quick and friendly.  Bloody Mary was kind of bland and uninteresting but the food totally makes up for it.   I will definitely be back.  Thanks for the great meal!
