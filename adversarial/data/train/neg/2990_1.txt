Going to start off saying first! The staff and the owner are all awesome. Everyone is friendly and very helpful. I've been here twice and my favorite thing is the Philly Gyro. I'm not a fan of the traditional gyro sauces. So the philly and fajita style allows me to enjoy the meat with the extra flavor.
