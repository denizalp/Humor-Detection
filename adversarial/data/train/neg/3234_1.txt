I'd give this place a 5 but the customer service was ehh. I came during the lunch rush and you could tell the staff was a bit overwhelmed. \nThe salads are so good! I'm really thinking they are laced with crack because they are so addicting. I only wish the large salad was a large salad. The large salad in my option is small. And when you ask for extra chicken which you have to pay extra for you get an extra 3 pieces  \nThe place is very clean and has lots of seating.\nPlus you get a chocolate covered strawberry, which is my favorite part of the meal.
