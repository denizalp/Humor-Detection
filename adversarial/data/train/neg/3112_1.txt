My boyfriend and I decided to come here for our valentines dinner. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the waitress. We drove a little over an hour to eat there so as soon as we got there my boyfriend needed to use the bathroom. As he was walking to the restroom I was being seated. She asked for my drink order right away and didn't give me a chance to look at drink menu. She seemed a little annoyed as I took time to look. I ordered a young coconut and water but didn't get the young coconut until the end of my meal when they tried to charge me for it but didn't even give it to me. When he came back we started to order our food. We order the yellow pancake with lettuce and fish sauce. The pancakes were a great size, but they only gave us 3 pieces of lettuce. When we requested for more lettuce the waitress informed us that it would an extra charge of $2, which is ridiculous to me. We decided to get it cause it would not be right to eat the pancake without the lettuce. We also ordered the small hot pot for us to share. They portion was the perfect size for the both of us. The broth we got was the tom yum broth and it was delicious! After our meal we got our ticket, another downfall was that, everything was written in Vietnamese so I'm not even sure what I was charged for. The food is great but everything else I wasn't impressed with. It's a little pricey as well. Not sure if I will return.
