We are coming from jax Florida and visiting Carolina because of the hurricane We were very hungry and decided to stop at this BK. Let me tell me it was the absolute worst where should I start? the fries were cardboard fries and half full (ordered a medium) even heating it up it was awful and very very hard. The burgers first off it smelled bad it smelled like ass straight ass like it was rotten. The beef was like rubber like it's been sitting all night. I'm upset and not satisfied at all it was a waste really no one ate that crap and it smell sooooo bad. What is going on I was scared to even touch it who knows what they did to it. This is just a disgrace they disrespected me by giving me that crap  and that's what it smell like crap
