Went here for a private event and was blown away by the decor. I seriously think the decor is every woman's dream! Crystal chandeliers, mirrors, lavender, gorgeous granite and tons of pillows... it's very girl. The decor alone warrants a 5. However, this is a nail salon so you actually have to judge the quality of the work.\n\nI received the \"R and R\" pedicure service which consists of (as the website states):\n\nR and R $22-$35\n\nSometimes don't you just want to benefit from a service without all the nipping? Use our salon to relax after a long day of wearing heels, running errands, or just a little r and r. Soak in a calming bath of rose petals infused with rosewood and geranium; take a paraffin dip followed by a warm towel wrap. Finish with a stimulating massage. (This service does not include polish.)\n\n$22 \/ Soak and a 10 minute massage\n$30 \/ Soak and a 15 minute massage\n$35 \/ Soak and a 20 minute massage \n\n\nAs it states in the description, this service does NOT include any polish or foot scrubbing of any kind. I was shown to my seat and the water was nice and hot! I must say that the amount of rose petals in the soak were bare minimum, but it still felt nice. After soaking for some time I was given the 20 massage. The massage was nice, very light... almost too light for me. If there was anything that could've been improved it would be this. After, my feet were dipped in two baggies that contained the paraffin wax. It felt AMAZING!!! This was definitely the best part.\n\nDue to us being a private party, gratuity was included in our treatments. I received the service with 20 min massage and paid $42 total.\n\nWhile the salon is nice, I did find their prices to be on the high side. I don't get pedicures too often, but I think you're definitely paying for atmosphere more than the actual service. Their service is by no means shabby, but for the price you could easily go anywhere else and get the same or better. I give their atmosphere a 5 but the service a 3 - - it's pretty standard. The atmosphere will bump up the service to a 4 lol... \n\nI wouldn't make it a habit of coming here, but I think it's nice for a group outing as atmosphere is everything.\n\nOn another note, their boutique clothes are WAY overpriced. I doubt anyone actually pays for them, but they're nice to look at while you're there. Also, they have a great magazine selection.
