This place is really rediculous!  My husband and I have gone there 3 times now and each time the service was horrible, waitstaff very snooty,  the food midiocre, the wait long time-\nThe interior is nice, the greeting and seat placement was great- and that is where it ends!  On our second time in, I also got sick after having their crab and avocado omelette- was nauseous for 2 hours!  Servers are very short!  WILL NOT REPEAT!  Village Inn is a better choice sadly enough!
