I ate lunch here the other day because I have been looking for any place that makes a pork tenderloin sandwich. The sandwich was absolutely fantastic but you better be hungry because it is BIG. When I got to the restaurant I actually found out that this restaurant was owned by the same guy that had a restaurant in Bartonville, Illinois. I had eaten a tenderloin sandwich at that place years ago and it was great there as well. If you are from the Midwest and want a great tenderloin this is the only place I have found that has them. This is like every Midwest bar and grill I have ever been in and has great food and a friendly environment with great people. I highly recommend this place.
