If you don't go here and get the molted chocolate lava cake, you haven't lived. You haven't seen the light. This is my favorite dessert in the world. I literally solely go to this restaurant for this cake. The food is food-chainy (new adjective) but this little chocolate dessert is worth telling the world about. Served warm and gooey, with vanilla ice cream and topped with caramel and hard shell!!!! I want to shout it off the roof tops how delicious this treat is. Live your life, eat the cake.
