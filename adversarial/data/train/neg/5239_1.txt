First time eating at this place and OMG the service is impeccable!!! Treated really well as we walked in. I can't believe all the attention we got. It's was great.  Much thanks to Michael and Amy. Everyone was friendly and very helpful. OUTSTANDING SERVICE!! \nStarted off ordering almost everything from the happy hour menu - it was all so good, even ordered more items 3x - that good. Ordered the pork belly ramen and spicy miso ramen.   Kids fried rice. I  liked all we ordered so filling. Finished off with the grilled collar salmon. So full. Highly recommended.
