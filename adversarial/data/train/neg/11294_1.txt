So, overall I liked this museum.  I haven't been here since childhood and for children it's fine, great even, if I was a child I would have given this 4 stars for sure.  There are not a huge amount of interactive items and the ones that there are, like the earthquake are fairly dated. There are wide areas for strollers and an area where you can check jackets, etc. so you don't have to lug them around.  For flat out education, this is very educational.  The displays in the great rooms are very detailed, accurate and very nice. But again, a slightly dated concept.  The dinosaur exibits are very good and there are GREAT fossils, alot found locally in the great lakes areas.  There is an excellent gem stone\/ jewel room with stones found all over the world.  The part I don't remember from when I was a kid and I find questionalble is the outdoor \"animal park\" where there are about 20 or so animal exhibits.  I went in the winter and all the animals seemed like they should have been indoors or better housed. Everything did look clean and well tended for what it was.  I feel that they should leave that type of thing for a zoo to do properly, it's really an aspect that detracted from the overall experience for me.  On a rainy day, this is definitely better than a movie and for $10.  I would have priced this around $8-9 but overall I think it was a good value.
