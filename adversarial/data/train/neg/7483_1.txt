I got into a car accident, and the person who was in the accident with me has Progressive Insurance. Thank goodness I have Allstate (their customer service is AMAZING, i noticed that after this experience). Having to deal with Progressive was nothing short of a nightmare.\nPolice were called to the accident scene, they determined 50\/50 liability for the accident (half my fault and half the other person's fault). They inspected the vehicles themselves and the position they were in. Allstate, my insurance company, determined 50\/50 liability based on the evidence I provided them.\nProgressive, on the other hand, determined it was 100% my fault. No questions, no options, they wouldn't budge on the decision. Somehow out of thin air this was completely my fault.\nNOT ONLY did they falsely blame me for the accident (so that way, they don't have to pay for any of my damages) BUT Xavier (his direct line: (813)371-4022) was EXTREMELY rude on the phone. When I asked to have my vehicle inspected by Progressive, his EXACT response was \"Well, we aren't going to cover it anyway, so we're not going to inspect it.\" Talk about SCUMBAG customer service. Even when I explained to him how the accident went down, he said \"What you're saying doesn't make any sense.\" Maybe I started speaking a foreign language while I was on the phone with him, who knows. I will never deal with Progressive or Xavier and his unapologetic, uptight schoolgirl demeanor. If you're going to be employed by a company, at least attempt to act like an adult and provide solutions to people. Provide customer service... You can guarantee everyone I know will hear about this. Progressive seems to have a crappy reputation anyway, so I doubt they will care to change much. The way it looks, they already have this problem enough. I guess that's what happens when you employ a bunch of greedy, useless lowlifes to work for a scumbag corporation. You get treated like dirt!
