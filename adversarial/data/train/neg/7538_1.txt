Really nice place!  Huge selection of drinks.  The barista was very nice and there was a nice steady stream of customers.  \nMy 2 complaints, small though they are would be that the carpet needs to be replced as it is really dirty and fraying on the edges and also my iced latte needed more ice as it was not really cold.  Other than that, the flavour was nice.  \nWill become a regular.
