Location \nOn Enterprise Blvd - right with Brichmount interseciton.\nBuilding easy to spot - there's underground parking available (very limited and designed poorly). Outdoor parking is also available - but it fills up very quickly, especially Tuesday night movies, highly suggest carpooling where possible.\n\nThe building has a few art installations and paintings, which adds a nice feeling to it. Also very clean, even the washrooms - and I often see a staff around making sure it's clean.\n\nLots of choices to eat - from Thai Express, South St Burger, Chinese Bakery, Milestone and Good Catch Boils. There's also Chattime and Go For Tea to quench your thirst. 24\/7 Goodlife fitness with Golf Town for any equipment\/sporting purchase. Scotiabank\/RBC also in the building for banking purpose.\n\nOverall pretty convenient place, all packed in one. Just can get pretty busy with parking and a lot of traffic light waiting.
