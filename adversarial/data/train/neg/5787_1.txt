I did a lot of online shopping and had decided on a pre-owned Corolla that I found at Right Toyota for a great price. Gerry Espinoza in the internet department had initially reached out to me about the car. But when I arrived to test drive, Gerry had already left for the day. So Isaac Bunitsky stepped up and went out of his way to assist me with the exact car I was looking to purchase, no BS. The paperwork took an unusual amount of time because of my situation, and Isaac was keeping me updated via text just about every day. When I came to pick up my car and Isaac was not in, Gerry and Jason Murdoch were so quick to help complete the process and get me out the door, all while keeping it fun. Even Nancy at the front desk makes you feel right at home. I really appreciate the teamwork here and intend on working with the Right Toyota team for future purchases.
