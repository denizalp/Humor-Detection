My UltraStar Cinemas experience started on-line with purchasing 2 tickets for a movie in one of the Star Class auditoriums.  Even though I purchased the tickets on-line, I was not able to select specific seats in the Star Class auditorium.  I was instead instructed to arrive at least 30 minutes early to select seats.  It would be nice to be able to select specific seats on-line like you can at iPIC theaters.\n\nWe arrived 40 minutes prior to the movie so we could select good seats.  Unfortunately, others arrived earlier than we did so we were not able to select seats in the center of the auditorium.  My suggestion would be to arrive at least 45 minutes prior to the movie to ensure you get good seats since you can't reserve specific seats beforehand.\n\nWe found the reclining seats comfortable (somewhat stiff though) and there was plenty of space to move around.  Most of the time you didn't even notice the wait staff during the movie serving food and drinks in the Star Class auditorium.  We also thought the food and drinks were pretty decent.\n\nOverall, we had a good experience.  It would be great if you could reserve specific seats since there is an upcharge for movies in the Star Class auditorium.
