I got my eyebrows waxed today and although I said my main problem was above the brow & temple area she waxed below the brow too...which resulted in a burn under my right eyebrow on my eyelid skin where I know there wasnt even hair. It has been almost 6 hours and it still hurts & is swelling up. Im crossing my fingers that it doesnt leave a scar. As a makeup artist I would hate to be insecure about taking my photos and showcasing my work when I have a scar across my eye. I tried putting vaseline on it as she told me to but i could not touch it because of the pain. Tried to get a refund and she was extremely rude and pretty much laughed in my face. I reported her to the state board and in the future ill make sure i'm not burned before tipping $5.
