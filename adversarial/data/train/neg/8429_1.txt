They suckered me by just smelling the pizza as I walked by! But what really got me was their wine special...was really wanting a very good glass of wine on this last night of our adventure. \n\nNever did get their pizza, although I seen it pass by a few times...Ordered their lemon Veal, and it was simply amazing. could cut through it with your fork. The waitstaff here was spot on, and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant was beautiful...felt like you were in a little eatery in Italy. The prices are right...you get a good size portion - didn't order any appetizer...although they did bring out this very fresh, warm bread...which hit the spot! Was so hungry! \n\nthe wine was brought out in a little glass canister, and was enough for two glasses.\n\nReally enjoyed my dinning experience here, and I ate alone. Just sat back, relaxed and people watched.
