Thanks to my partner for bringing us here to celebrate my birthday a few weeks ago. We had a great time here. The service here was top notch - he was friendly and professional. For appetizer we shared shrimp bisque ($9) - delicious and well made. For main, I ordered the seafood risotto ($26) - well flavoured. One comment would be that the salmon was a little dry though. My partner ordered this daily fresh fish dish (forgot the name and price) - it was great though. My favourite was the Dark Lindt Chocolate Mousse Cake ($8.95). \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our experience here. :)
