Unfortunately our experience was the complete opposite of the other reviewers here.\n\nWe used this law firm for our condo purchase. While our lawyer was personable and attentive in person, we really got the impression that the day to day work was done by a law clerk who did not seem to know what she was doing. Our transaction was a fiasco from beginning to end. There were lengthy delays answering emails, long delays providing closing figures, incorrect and insufficient information provided to us on several occasions and unprofessional behaviour by admin staff. For instance, after calling several times and asking for information that was needed for closing, I called a third time and told the secretary that I was frustrated that no one had returned my call since it was time sensitive. One of the clerks finally responded to me by email and the subject line of the email was unbelievably \"[My name] is \"frustrated\" (LOL)\". Yes it actually included the LOL! How incredibly unprofessional. I spoke to our lawyer about this but I didn't feel that he had taken it seriously at all.  Another time, they responded to me with confidential financial information and cc another person that I don't even know! The person had the same first name as my husband. When I pointed this out, there was no apology.  It was obvious that neither our lawyer nor law clerk had properly read out mortgage document because they both misquoted information contained in it. Their error very nearly ended up costing us almost $2000 and we had to spend considerable time and effort to correct their error. Their handling of our transaction caused us considerable stress and aggravation at both our interim and final closing. \n\nWe would absolutely NEVER consider using this firm again! Terrible experience!!
