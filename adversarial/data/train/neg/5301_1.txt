not sure why all the negative reviews besides he unavoidable waiting in line(s) which is why i only gave 4 stars!! i am not a patient person when it comes to waiting in line: especially because the customer reps could expedite by not being so chitty chatty. HOWEVER, i got a live wire rep when i approached the counter: haidar was AMAZING!!!  not only were we able to joke around a bit (bantering is fun!) but i asked him if he had a kia soul!!! i love he kia souls!! AND HE FOUND ONE (not in the color i wanted, but who is gonna bitch about that!!) we laughed and joked around whilst the paperwork was being swished around, initialed and wrapped up!! kudos to haidar!! would consider renting from payless again if the prices are right and i could see haidar again!!! from the previous posts on this site: other customer reps should take a clue from haidar's handling of customers!!!
