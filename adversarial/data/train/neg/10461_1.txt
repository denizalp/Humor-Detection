I have visited this location a lot! Enough times to earn myself a free mini (if you visit The Pie Hole you will understand), and probably a few pounds.\nFirst I haven't taken anything home I wouldn't pay for and take home again. The Pie Hole has a great daily variety of slices and mini's. Personal favorites are Peanut butter\/Chocolate, Apple Crumb and Chocolate Cream.. with that said- Lemon Meringue, Key Lime, Banana Cream and Strawberry Rhubarb are all gunning for 4th:).. \nThe crust is great on all pies! \nI over heard another customer saying the savory pies are the bomb as well, can't wait to venture down that path. \nIf you haven't visited The Pie Hole you should. Cute spot, good service and great pies!
