First timer. When I booked my appointment online I was told the times 2-5. For a haircut, bath, nails, teeth brushed etc with Jessica. When I got there they decided not to cut his hair but to continue with the rest and expect four hours. Ok fine. I'll expect a call. 6:15 rolls around and I call them to check up (I have things I need to be doing too). They said \"oh yea he's been done but we couldn't do his nails because he was so scared.\" Ok. Why did no one call me when he was done or because they couldn't do a procedure? So I go to pick him up, Jessica is no where to be seen. I was given a pamphlet saying \"a veterinarian would be better for him.\" I look at what was done, teeth nor nails were done. I ask the girl why no one called me and she said they work with multiple dogs at a time. So you're telling me basically you don't care about my dog. So why are you still charging me $50 for starters when nothing was done? Second on the paper it says he was done at 3:40. So you're telling me you stuck my scared dog in a kennel for almost three hours without contacting me???!! I feel like he was profiled, and mistreated. I understand it is their job, but this is my child. They seem to be way understaffed and could care less about anyone's pets just a paycheck. \n\nAnd to be groomers....they should learn how to groom themselves not come in with matted hair seeming to be unwashed for weeks. Will NEVER go back.
