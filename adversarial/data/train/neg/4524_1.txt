I've found a new favorite in the valley!  The two girls that were working the day I went in were both so sweet and seemed like they actually enjoy their job (a rare find these days).  My friend had the flan latte, which was amazing, and a pumpkin filled empanada, which my one year old loved.  Their menu claims that they have the best chai in town, I was skeptical, but tried the sucia chai anyway.  SO GOOD.  10\/10 would recommend.  Will be back.
