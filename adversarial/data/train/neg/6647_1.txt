The worst service from these attendants ever.  I guess if you don't have an education you need to work somewhere.  I would think that Aeropostale screens their people to at least hire people with an ounce of customer service skills.  Worst part is that the manager condones the behavior.  Worst attitudes, may as well be in a war zone then at least it would make a little sense.
