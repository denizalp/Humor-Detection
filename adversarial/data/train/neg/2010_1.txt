My fiancé and I went into the store this past Sunday around 4 in the afternoon and the girl with the copper hair treated us like crap! She was being very rude and was of no help. We were looking to buy heels for my fiancé for our wedding but she made it seem like we didn't even belong in the store. We will definitely not be spending any money at this location whenever we are in Vegas. Please hire associates that have better customer service skills
