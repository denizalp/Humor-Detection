Saw Barbra Streisand on Saturday.  Sat in Main Concourse in a Terrace Table...$325 per seat.  The noise made by the staff in the food and beverage areas behind us was unbelievable....total amateurs with no visible sign of supervision.  They were banging pots, pans,lids etc throughout the entire second half of the show.  Only a thin black mesh curtain separated us.  This type of poor training and supervision is standard for the Levy group.\n\nYou would think being the newest and biggest in Las Vegas they would have stepped up a little.  Unfortunate....not looking forward to going back any time soon.
