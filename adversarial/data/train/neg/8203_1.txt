Great service and friendly staff.  Pizza wasn't anything to die for. Have had other oven baked pizzas with the same quality and taste (i.e. via cibo) Their appetizer with the Creme fresh was very yummy I could have licked the plate, I think it was fried potato gnocchi. Only reason I would go back is to have that.
