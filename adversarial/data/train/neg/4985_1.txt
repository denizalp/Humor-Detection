I recently had my hair done here as a newbie to Toronto. It was hard to find a salon but I went off reviews and I am glad that I did. Daniel cut my hair and he was fantastic! He's an experienced stylist who knows what he's doing. I am very happy with my cut! He's also very down to earth and easy to chat to. A very enjoyable experience and I will definitely be back to see him. Amanda did my colour and I am very happy with it! I left it up to her with what she waned to do and she did an awesome job. She is also very down to Earth and fun to chat with. Overall the energy in the salon is awesome and I will definitely be returning! So happy I've found a new salon that I love!
