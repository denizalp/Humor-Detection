Went to the bar for some pizza, wings, and beer. Here are the results (overall experience with 5 being highest):\n\nAtmosphere: 5 \nBeer Selection: 5 (100 options on tap, try Avery)\nCleanliness: 5\nService: 5\nTeriyaki Wings: 5 (awesome)\nParmesan Balls: 5 (tasted earlier in the night)\nChicken Tenders: 4 (tasted earlier in the night)\nPizza: 3.5 (not really NY-style pizza, but good\/not amazing)\n\nThat rounds up to a 5. The people here are very nice\/friendly, and the food is really good. As usual, you just need to know what to order. The beer selection is great, and they have some really excellent deals on the beer. Overall, recommended.
