Absolutely fantastic soft shell crab sandwich.  They were in season so I got a nice big one, tasty batter and great overall flavor.  Also tried a lobster roll, good, pretty standard.  The prices in my opinion were reasonable (I am use to American prices).  Service was friendly, place was really small but def worth a visit for lunch.
