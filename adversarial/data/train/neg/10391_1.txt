This place has pretty good food, iv never had a bad time here. Good portions, good taste. It is a tad pricey tho, if i might add. I come here all the time so I guess iv gotten used to the pricing. They open late almost every night, they close at 1 for most nights I think. Staff is friendly, but most of them don't speak alot of English, but there's one who speaks good English tho. I just don't like the washrooms or the hallway to the washroom, looks sketchy. There's fish tanks with crab and other seafood...alive tho. And it right along where people sit down, and sometimes the one of the staff comes along and takes a fish out of the tank with a fishnet, that's the only thing I don't like...why couldn't they put this anywhere else? I don't know\nBUT overall good place, I'll still be coming here alot.
