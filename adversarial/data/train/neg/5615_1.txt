On their website they describe this restaurant and its cuisine as \"A modern take on Southern comfort.\" I could not agree more and believe that this place is so true in what they are trying to accomplish. We visited the Yardbird on a Saturday afternoon with reservations for four people and were seated immediately. The decor is quite rustic, but the whole ambience of the restaurant at the same time is quite classy. \n\nServers were very professional and food was brought out in a timely manner. We ordered the Chicken \"n\" Watermelon \"n\" Waffles along with a side of bacon hash (yukon gold yams, onions, house smoked pork belly). \n\nChicken \"n\" Watermelon \"n\" Waffles= honey hot sauce, chilled spice watermelon, vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup.\n\nThis was more than enough food to share between the two of us. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the bacon hash and chicken, while I was more into the chicken, waffles and watermelon! Let's start with the chicken, my goodness it was the juiciest and most tender fried chicken I have ever eaten! The waffles paired very well with the chicken and bourbon maple syrup. I enjoyed every single bite. The watermelon was chilled and spice, to me it was very herb-like and fresh. I enjoyed the watermelon and found it to be somewhat of a palette cleanser and a good way to end our meal, whereas my friends and husband did not like it so much. If you're a fan of seasoning your fruit then I think you'll enjoy the watermelon as much as me, it was so refreshing! \n\nI wish they had a location near me so that I could visit this place for Sunday brunch!! The next time we're in Vegas, I am definitely going to revisit!
