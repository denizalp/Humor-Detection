The lack of 'service' at this bank is appalling.  First, they got rid of the drive thru teller.  Now, they try to force you to use the ATMs inside and only have one teller without a designated 'business line.'  If I am coming INSIDE the bank it is because I want\/need service from a human.  They have also cut back on notaries.  A forty minute wait for a notary is ridiculous!
