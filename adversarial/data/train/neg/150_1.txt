OMG!! Best Mexican food and service I've had in along time. Reminded me of being at a family party where everyone checked to see if your OK. Fresh beans, I typically grade my Mexican food off of the beans. That's first and foremost the best around. Fresh guacamole made to order. The burritos were amazing. Now it is called Flaming Fajitas, so of course I had to try them. I was not disappointed one bit, great taste and they do a little trick and boom, they're on fire!!! So if your ever in Vegas you've got to hit this spot.
