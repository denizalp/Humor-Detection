Incredible the taste of the pastrami on their New York sky high sand which was a real pleasure. Make sure not to miss this gem in New York New York. I should have gotten something else, but this was amazing. \n\n The place is filled with different artwork around the menu inside.  There is no free WiFi or bathrooms inside. The interior is very small and has three booth seats\/tables inside. But, there are many hard table tops and chairs outside. The outside is noisy due to the casino and people socializing, but it gives you a lively feeling once you look around. \n\n The prices are moderate with about 10-20$ range of a variety of different sandwiches. I personally like the New York sky high, the Italian stallion and one with a beef brisket. (Forgot the name) \n\n Overall, my experience here is and always will be amazing. There is also a black and white cookie that my family craves and we get it every time. I personally think it is not bad.
