I have mixed feelings about this place. I was really impressed by the food. I thought it was going to taste just eh but l thought I liked it, better than expected to say the least. They have a better food selection than they do dessert. My husband and l went for brunch, l thought the pancakes, sausage, bacon and eggs were good. They also had these potato thingies that were really yummy.  With that being said my husband was not so impressed with the food because he found a hair in one of the dishes he got. He could no longer eat after that. My husband thought the food was just ok, not too happy with the quality of the food (regardless of the hair incident) The service was ok, nothing great but nothing to complain about either. I don't know of l would go back but l am glad l tried it.
