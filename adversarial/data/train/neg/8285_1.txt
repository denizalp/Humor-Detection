This place has it all, from art, to Cleveland merchandise, great food, and great music. My wife and I frequent here often. Anytime we get downtown in fact it's our first stop for drink and a bite. The staff is so helpful and courteous it's well worth a stop in to have a drink...or two. I like bringing my customers here to entertain, its upscale enough to feel business like but music enough to be cool.
