I just had the best facial I've ever experienced, by far. Just a heads up, this is a private suite located inside of \"sola salons.\" Shadif is super informative, thorough and sweet. Big points for being a holistic Esthetician too! Keeps the body happy. She knows exactly how to customize to your personal skin concerns and can set you up with a game plan for your best results. My skin feels amazing, I'm super relaxed (especially after the amazing massage) and I can't wait for my next treatment in two weeks!
