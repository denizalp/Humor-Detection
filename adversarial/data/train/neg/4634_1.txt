The chicken strips here are amazing!  They are moist and tender and always consistently good!  They are small, but filling.  The fries are great too.  I had the chicken and waffles for the first time this week and I'll be back for those too.  The desserts in the mason jars are a bit pricey for a fast food restaurant dessert, but don't let that keep you from ordering one!  They are delicious and very share-worthy!  This is definitely my favorite chicken restaurant in the area!
