This place was good, but the portions were small. I expected more food! We ordered a couple bento boxes and a healthy bowl. The bulgogi bowl was really good and tasted fresh, but I would have liked more rice and meat (lots of veggies in the bowl). Definitely not enough meat in the bento! We still left hungry even after ordering a sushi roll (soft shell crab roll was good). Workers were really nice! And the milk tea was on point. Overall good place for lunch or a quick dinner, but don't expect nothing fancy.
