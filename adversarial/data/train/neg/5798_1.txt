This gem of a restaurant is my idea of a perfect night out.  The waitstaff is attentive without being cloying, and personable without being nosy.  The ambience is pleasant, with a buzz of conversation and no screens in sight.  The food is exquisite.  My scallops were cooked perfectly, the foie gras special has been exquisite every time I've tried it, and the weekday specials are a deal...this Tuesday is was bouillabaisse with a crisp glass of white for $30.  Bon Appetit!
