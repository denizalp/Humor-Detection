Worth the trip to Lakewood. Great food, great variety for vegan, vegetarians and all other eaters. Super local feel. I grew up  in Lakewood and now live in Chicago - I have yet to miss a chance to visit whenever I am in town. It's more than a coffee shop. \n\nMy only gripe is that the seating is often monopolized by a very intense, devoted group of domino players. I love that Root embraces the culture, but there is a fine line between being accommodating and letting guests take over.
