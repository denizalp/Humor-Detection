Came here with my 3 yr old on a groupon. Didn't know what to expect but for a discounted $3 coupon I got $15 worth so def worth it.  The fried rice was excellent along with my other dish i ordered.  The Thai tea was very good as well. The dessert we ordered was fried banana and ice cream.  Excellent all around. Don't let the shady strip mall scare you away.  Good and not so pricey.  Will come back soon!
