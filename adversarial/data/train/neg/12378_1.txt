This place is wonderful! My husband and I decided to try this out for our Wednesday night date night and went for happy hour....service was fast, food was delicious! We sat on the patio and it was such a beautiful day. I got the Steak Fajitas which were the absolute best I have ever had. The steak melts in your mouth and is so tender and the peppers and onions were cooked perfect! My husband got the Steak Chimichanga and it was so flavorful and the best we have ever tasted. The margaritas on happy hour are a great deal and we got the Sopapillas for dessert. They were so delicious and made you feel so happy! I would give this place 6 out of 5 stars if I could. Love love love and will definitely be back!
