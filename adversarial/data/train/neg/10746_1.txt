Bottom line. Store manager JAMES called this morning in a feeble \"attempt\" to address an issue from yesterday at this MIDAS automotive in  Scottsdale AZ. He would not let me speak. He was rude implied that I was stupid for complaining to corporate. He told me to go to another shop after I told him to shut his mouth and listen if he wanted to resolve the issue. I would advise until JAMES is gone, do not take your vehicle to this MIDAS store. JAMES can't handle the pressure. There is a PEP BOYS next door. Go there instead.
