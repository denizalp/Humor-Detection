\"A grumpy and terse waitress \" as from what I read in another review is really close to this woman and her wait staff skills. \n\nThird time experiencing the local spot - definitely the last time. \n\nFirst time was solo and they were very busy. Decent burger. \nSecond time the server was glaring instead of waiting my table with company. Definitely in a foul mood and visibly shown. \nThird visit, today, incorrect orders. Sarcasm when addressed. \n\nI'm no fan and won't need to go back here.
