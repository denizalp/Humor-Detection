My name is Darin and I am the owner of K & J Windows.  Approximately 5 years ago JSE Automotive moved into the location behind where I had my showroom and warehouse. Jason, the owner, worked on my personal vehicle for the first time 5 years ago and I was very pleased. Ever since then and for the last 5 years JSE Automotive has exclusively done the work on my Honda Element (Use to work on my Honda Ridgeline, and Toyota Tacoma when I had them), my daughters Honda Element, my son's Jeep CJ7 and my company Ford Van and trailer.  Yesterday he changed out the starter on my vehicle. He also does the work on the vehicles of my employees and I have referred many contractors and friends to him whom he has done work for. I believe one of the biggest challenges is finding a mechanic that is honest, fair and does good work, JSE Automotive is all of the above. I have never in five years had a problem with any of the work that Jason or Mike have done to my vehicles, and I know that any work that I do have done will be done right the first time, it always has been. As a business owner I understand the importance of being an expert and professional in ones field and so does Jason, his shop and tools are clean, Jason and Mike are always a pleasure to deal with, and they are very good at what they do.  I highly recommend them and I am very confident you will not be disappointed.
