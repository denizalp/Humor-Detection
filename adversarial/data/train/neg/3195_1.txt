Lucky Puppy Stay and Play is lovingly run by Jeannee and Alicia whom our dogs have come to know as their favorite dog-sitting aunts!  Reliable, dependable, professional, and completely trustworthy are only a few of their wonderful qualities we can't do without when it comes to taking care of our furry family members!  They are very thorough and obtain all the care details specific to your pet, and they also understand behaviors and training.  They send us  updates while we are away that reassure us that our pups Conan and Mia are are having a blast and not missing us a bit.  Our dogs are relaxed because they get to stay home and be loved and cared for.  \n\nNot only do Jeannee and Alicia shower our dogs with love and time as if they were their own, they also took care of our puppy when she got sick and cleaned the house where a few accidents occurred as a result.  We came home to a a health update, a clean home, and even new toys for our babies -they are the sweetest!  We have had several different dog-sitters and I recommend Lucky Puppy Stay and Play above the rest, thank you Jeannee and Alicia!!!
