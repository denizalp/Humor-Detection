I went here with a few friends for dinner and drinks after a hike. Our server was Angel, he was absolutely amazing. We had a great bottle of wine and the ambiance was nice. I'm currently on a keto diet and Angel was very helpful in suggesting items for me. I live in Henderson, but I'll definitely be back if I find myself on this side of town.
