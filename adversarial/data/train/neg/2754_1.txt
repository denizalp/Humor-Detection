I highly recommend Rattlesnakes Solutions \/ Snake Fences LLC without reservation. Nick installed the snake barrier\/fence. He was very courteous and professional. He worked in the heat of the summer and never complained. The owners, Eric and Bryan, are very knowledgeable about snakes and sincerely concerned for people's safety. Eric listened to my concerns for aesthetics, budget and effectiveness of the fence. As a result, he had a unique solution that satisfied our needs. I had been bitten by a rattler, so Eric felt extra compassionate for my situation and wanted to prevent a bite from happening again. The main reason for the fence is to keep out snakes, but it also should fit with the look of the yard, and the requirement was satisfied. Following installation of the fence, we discovered a rattlesnake that apparently had been fenced in, and someone arrived very promptly to remove the snake. Eric made sure we were completely satisfied before he accepted payment. The entire group was great! All were friendly, very personable, helpful, thoughtful, and most important, highly skilled in their profession. What a great service!
