Food is delicious. Service is terrible. \n\nI have eaten here many times and liked it all of the times. Recently I went back and loved the food!  The salsa is fantastic. The steak fajitas are great! Their enchiladas are good too. The service is horrible! \n\nAfter asking for a refill of our drinks it took over 7 minutes for them to come back to refill our drinks. After asking for our check it took another 10 minutes to see it!!  I love the food but the service is frustrating!
