Great place. We were looking for a place to have brunch and catch World Cup. Love the decor, super place for watching sports and enjoying brunch. We chose his place based on other Yelp reviews and menu. \n\nI wish I could give a bette rating but....we ordered the Urban Bloody Marys and although tasty, the advertised fried jalape√±os did not come and when asked our server informed us they did not have them. This is not enough to penalize by two stars but then came the food. Everyone ordered something different...my food came about 10 minutes after everyone else's. At our table was the Piggy Piggy...tasty but the toasted bread was a little burnt. I ordered the Crispy Chicken and Corn Pancake. Although my chicken was wonderfully crispy and spicy, the pancake was cold. . \n\nService was wonderful from the hostess station to our waitress. I would definitely say give this restaurant a try.
