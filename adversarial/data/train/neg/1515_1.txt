Tonight was the third time I have gone there and have to say third time was the charm...Love this place.  Great service, food, timely service and nice atmosphere a big win!!!  All though it is a little small and you may need to wait...but if that is the case and you are flexible they do to go orders and take reservations.  Happy hour offers some great deals for you.
