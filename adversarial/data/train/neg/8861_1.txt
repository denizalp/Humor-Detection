Upon searching, researching and pricing out several wedding photographers, I came across 2020 Vision Photos. I was impressed with the good eye in Lou's photo portfolio. Initial email contact with Lou was very quick, friendly and professional. I met with him and he asked questions on preferences and so forth. He was warm and seemed to really have a passion for photography, and showed natural talent. Thank goodness he was available on somewhat a short notice and was very reasonably priced, too. He made a special trip to our chosen venue to scope it out beforehand since it would be his first time there.\nEverything went smoothly on our wedding day. Lou was on time and ready for action! He did great with us on directing, and finding good aesthetic flow and lighting. We did have one snafu, as he was taking photos of our rings on a lily pad over a coy fountain, my wedding band fell in! Lou did not hesitate to jump in and sift through the rocks, muck and fish to find it (and thank goodness it was recovered!). Our wedding day was everything we had hoped for, majestic, relaxed and unforgettable - and Lou of 2020 Vision Photos captured it flawlessly!!
