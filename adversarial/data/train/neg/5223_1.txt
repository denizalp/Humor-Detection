I'm new to Las Vegas and stumbled upon this gem after seeing it on here and reading other reviews. After trying it out, I must say that the other reviews don't even do it justice! I'm beyond pleased with Victoria's work, her expertise and care. She took her time, gave me her undivided attention, was very knowledgable and helped me accomplish a look with my eyebrows that no one else ever has. The location is beautiful and quiet, a very relaxing setting, and everyone was very professional and welcoming. I felt as if we were all friends that had known each other for years. Try Pink Cherry, and I promise you won't be disappointed. The entire experience was amazing, and I will continue to be a loyal patron!
