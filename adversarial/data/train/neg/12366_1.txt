(+)\n-really big\n-very popular hot spot\n-nice setup and decor inside\n-tables in the water, pretty rad\n\n(-)\n-pool gets very crowded\n-if youre not at a table, hard to find somewhere to put your shit down\n-gotta leave your stuff unattended if you want to go in the pool\n-mostly house music\n\nMy friends and I came here around 1-2 pm on a saturday. We got on someones guestlist so it was free as long as we got there before 2. \n\nIt was soo crowded inside, took awhile just to find a spot to put our stuff down. I recommend if youre gonna go here (or tao beach\/wetrepublic) try to bring as little as possible with you. its more convenient and safer for your belongings.\n\nProb wouldnt have had that good of a time if we didn't get invited to a table. the guys werent very cute but you dont have to ask me twice to sit at your table and drink your drinks, I am happy to oblige.\n\nwater felt great because it was soooo hot. music couldve been better, less house and more hip hop please.\n\nit was fun to sit in the water and people watch too cause drunk middle aged white people are funny. the crowd is a little less guido\/fake tan\/fake tits than the crowd I saw at wet republic.\n\nif you want to be seen, this is definitely the place to be
