So much fun! Playing pinball, using the claw machine, getting strips of photos from the photo booth. We were there for over an hour, probably two hours, and spent less than $35. An added benefit was none of the migraine inducing, ear splitting electronic noise of a modern arcade. It was all bells and dings from the nostalgic pinball machines!
