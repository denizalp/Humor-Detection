Now I got to start this review by saying that my first impression of this place was not a good one. I decided to try this place out after reading all the awesome reviews I saw here on Yelp. I came a few minutes early for my appointment and was quickly seated with a woman (didn't catch the name). \n\nNow a little side note, my nails prior to coming into the salon were JACKED due to a pretty lousy full set I had gotten done while I was in So Cal. So I sit down with the lady and the first thing she does was laugh at me. Now if you read my \"Allure nail\" review, you know that I don't take criticism very well, so I was pretty pissed that this woman started laughing at me, but I got over it. As she was getting started, another woman came into the salon, stating that she had an appt with the woman I had just sat down with, so I was asked to wait for another tech to come tend to me. I was upset that this woman could not keep track of her appointments and that I had to wait. Thankfully though, the second tech (Catherine) was way cool and very attentive. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting with her.\n\nThe salon itself, I was very impressed with. It was clean and it was pleasing to the eyes. I will come back a second time, but I will definitely request a specific person next time.
