I love visiting this location. Lisa always greets me with a smile and quickly gets me back to see the chiropractor; usually Dr. Peter who is equally as awesome. The entire staff is fun, friendly, and professional. You can tell from the moment you walk in that everyone in the office enjoys their job and wants you to feel welcome. Go see this team-- you won't regret it!!!
