Great bargain on a fine hotel. Nicely appointed rooms with large LG flat screen TVs and heaps of pillows on the beds and fluffy comforter.\n\nWhen I was here, they offered a foursquare check in promotion of free VIP lounge access getting you food and drinks in the evenings and a nice breakfast buffet with scrambled eggs and muffins with Canadian bacon. Yum!
