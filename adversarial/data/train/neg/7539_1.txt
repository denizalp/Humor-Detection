I was very surprised that Landry's Seafood gets negative reviews because my wife and I have always had a great experience at this restaurant.  We visit about once a month and have found it to be consistently clean with friendly, attentive staff and great food.  I've never had a bad experience here and I always leave feeling full, satisfied and that I had a great meal!  Thus the 5 star rating.  \n\nMy wife and I usually eat at the bar area just because we like things more casual and we like the more social staff that they obviously staff there.  The drinks are great and happy hour is second to none!  We make a special trip often just to take advantage of it.  We also like that it has a rewards card where we can rack up points and use them all over the Valley.\n\nIf you haven't ever been to this restaurant, I sincerely recommend it and know it is worth a visit.  It may not be your cup of tea, but for someone who lives in Sin City where some of the greatest restaurants in the world are, it is a solid restaurant.  It isn't super high end or anything, but it does what it was meant to do - provides great seafood at a fair price with great service.  I really don't know what more you would want.
