One of my favourite Hakka restaurants. The boy and the young couple are really sweet. The old man at the counter is usually cranky. \n\nOnly 4 stars because they only give you 4 fortune cookies for food enough for 6+ and you have to pay for the extras. They never used to do that before. \n\nTheir food is good. Try their coconut ice cream!!
