The service at this location was excellent! I had an emergence on my way to Las Vegas in that my windshield cracked unexpectedly, I called ahead for help  to make sure they had a replacement and immediately got a positive response. Upon arrival for my appointment at this location, the technician took care of me. He inspected my vehicle, told me what the process would be and estimated 1 to 1-1\/2 hours wait. I viewed the installation and he was very careful with my vehicle to make sure no damage would occur. I truly recommend Safelite Auto Glass and this location for anyone in need of auto glass repair.
