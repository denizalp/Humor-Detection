A huge thanks to Amber for finally getting my hair back to a healthy state. Several months ago I went to another salon for a cut and color. She ruined my hair! It started breaking off and thinning so bad, I lived with that for 7 months. Amber's consultation was amazing and she knew exactly what to do in order to get it fuller and healthier.  It won't take long now for me to get my length back to where I want it.
