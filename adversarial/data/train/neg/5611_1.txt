Hidden gem of summerlin!! Who knew there was a authentic Chinese dim sum place. Well the prices are reasonable and they make their own dim sums. Only thing I wish they had the ladies walk around in carts. But because it's away from\nThe strip I can see why they don't. The lunch specials are $7 some even on a Sunday. I highly recommend this place. Don't go to Panda Express for Chinese food. Come\nHere!!
