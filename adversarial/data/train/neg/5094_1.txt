We went for wife's birthday and really enjoyed it. The food was very well prepared and really tasty. Too many restaurants have bland food or pedestrian taste. Mussels in tomato sauce very good as was the kale Ceasar salad with hint of lemon. The house special meatloaf is basted for 5 days to give very deep taste and sauce. On bed of mashed potatoes but with wonderful flavor. Not cheap but good value for price.  One negative is the front room is very noisy...  Very. Ask for table in back room.
