A restaurant has to go above and beyond in this competitive market with so many talented, chef- driven dining places available.  We eat out often and were eager to experience Fat Ox, as we love their sister place, The Mission.  I must say, it has been a quick expansion for this restaurant team; servers are not trained as well as before, chefs don't always get it right as they once did, even at our beloved Mission.  Having said all that, my salmon dish was good, nothing special. My husband's pork offering was a large serving, but not memorable. Our guest liked his scallops, and his wife said her salmon was good. The broccoli rabbe was too salty to eat, the waiter had few social skills, and did not apologize for the broccoli or another wrong order. The gelato was excellent.  The old Quilted Bear has been enlarged and modernized, so the space is open and appealing.  After discussing our food experience as we drove home, we agreed it wasn't a place to which we'd return. There are just too many really superb places to dine. We will try a new one, or happily return to our old favorites.
