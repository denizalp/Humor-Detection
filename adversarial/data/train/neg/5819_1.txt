This is such a blessing to have in fountain hills! It is clean, well organized and has just about everything I need and a lot of stuff I dont even need that I end up buying anyways!!!  My only complaint are some of the SUPER old people they have checking you out. Yes I understand that the economy got EFFED and retired people have to keep working but it annoys me when I have to spend and hour getting checked out. Can we put these old people in the aisle helping people find things and stocking shelves? I mean I DO love my senior citizens I just dont like having to be stuck in line with a screaming kid for an hour while one item is put in one bag at a time. Otherwise this is a great store and I hope everyone in town will keep supporting it or we will all be screwed with nowhere to shop....
