We've used this marina for the last several years, both the marina side and also the rental side. Great location not far from the interstate, plenty of parking and solid unloading area. The marina is very well maintained with lockers, grill area's, and a well-stocked store for ice\/drinks\/etc. \nPersonnel have always been friendly and knowledgable and we've never had any issues renting boats or meeting friends for a day out on the lake. \nNote that they are located at the very bottom of Lake Norman so you will be on the water a while before you hit the main channel and the various inlets further north.
