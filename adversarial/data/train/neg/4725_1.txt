Been here a couple of times over the last month. The first time, I ordered the mixed kabob platter with chicken kabob, kofta kabob, and shish kabob. The portion sizes were huge, and the meal even came with lentil soup. The food itself was ok, as far as Mediterranean food goes. The meats were on the dry side, and the rice tasted a bit stale. The lentil soup was creamy and delicious though. \n\nI ordered the chicken shwarma wrap the second time. Chicken was dry, and the wrap included pickle slices as well (which I didn't expect). I was hoping for lettuce\/tomato in the wrap...oh well\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is kinda small, so it might not fit a large table of people, but if you are dining with a few people, the space should be sufficient.
