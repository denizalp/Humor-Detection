Whether you are a novice ( like I am) or a pro (like some of my friends) Steve and his staff know how to use their expertise to assist everyone so that they feel comfortable. When they work with you- you feel as though there is no question too trivial. From mountain and street bikes- to cruisers ( complete with accessories) to bike clothing or special seats- they have helped us with such a friendly atmosphere that it's easy to see why this is a place to hang out and feel as though the rest of the world is put on hold. If you need\/want something and it is not in the store- they will order it for you promptly. I've seen them order bikes for people in other states (with a discount) loan bikes to visitors and help regulars with the same dedication.. How fortunate we are to have this neighborhood gem!
