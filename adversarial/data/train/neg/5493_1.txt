I took my kids to Stu Millers Pumpkin Patch yesterday & they had tons of fun!! My daughter is 6 & my son is 2 & they both loved going on the inflatables.. Staff was super nice & offered to take my son up the slide which would've been nice if he wasn't afraid of nearly everyone.. The only thing I wish they had was a wristband so my kids could constantly go on each inflatable without running out of tickets so fast.. Definitely nicer at night when it's lit up
