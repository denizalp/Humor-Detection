Every month in 2012, i received a food coupon from Caesar's to use at any of their restaurants.  Most of the time i used it at the buffet.  Recently i used it at Ramsay's BurGR( at planet hollywood .)  I found out i can use it at Ramsay's Pub ( in Caesar's ) so i plan to do that should they continue to send me coupons.\n\nseveral times i used it in the Food Court.  The highlights:\n\nBar B Q ( and sorry, not sure if they have a specific name for this place ) - people, this place produces some decent BBQ at a reasonable price - a meal will cost you about $15 - that's dang close to what you'll pay at an off-strip BBQ place ( 3 meat\/ two side ) .  The ribs and brisket were dang good.  The sides ok.  The pulled pork was average.\n\nSeafood - the lobster roll was decent - priced a few dollars high but not outrageous.  \n\nI never tried the pizza place - the prices they charge their are frickin ridiculous !
