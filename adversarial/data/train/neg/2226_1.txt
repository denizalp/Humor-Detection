Ordered steak uxmal and I'm glad I had enough steak at least to make 1 taco out of it which I didn't even eat because it was so chewy for an expensive plate. This place has gone down bad everyday that goes by. Service is ok but the quality of their food and portions are horrible, terrible and unsatisfied. If you really want authentic mexican food, you are better going to taco bell. Unfornately we will not be coming back to this place
