Not impressed!  Went here for happy hour and it was empty (usually a bad sign)!  Our waitress\/bartender was snooty and not very helpful.  I hate that because for us part of the experience of sitting at the bar is chatting with the bartender, but unfortunately that didn't happen here.  The happy hour appetizers were tiny and we calculated that each small bite we took cost about $3 which is probably normal for Vegas, but we had found other wonderful happy hours that were a much better deal and a lot more fun.  I really wanted to like this place because the menu looked interesting and it had great reviews, but will not be returning.
