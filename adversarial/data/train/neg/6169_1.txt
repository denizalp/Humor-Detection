New owners? We ordered from this place about once a month. We reallllllly liked the italian beef sandwich (The Chief) and their thin crust pizza was great, but this time around....not so much.\nOne of the biggest draws was that they double their coupons on Fridays-NO LONGER ACCEPTED. Albeit, they've lowered their prices but also lowered the quality of food. Being from Chi-town, I cannot believe they sold out by selling their name and reputation to people who lack customer service (honoring coupons) and cut corners in food preparation.\nSo long, Rosatis! It was great while it lasted I'll be across the street at Barros!
