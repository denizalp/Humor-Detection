I have been to this Wendy's twice in the past month and both times were extremely disappointing. The first time I went through the drive through and ordered a chicken Caesar salad with grilled chicken and ranch dressing. Not only was the girl at the drive through window extremely rude, you could clearly tell she wasn't happy and she looked like she wanted to kill herself. So already irritated with the poor customer service I finally got my salad and headed home. I guess it was my fault for not checking it before I left the drive through. I got home to find Caesar dressing and crispy chicken and only a half size salad when I ordered and paid for a full size! I called and the manager. She was very nice and remade my order for lunch the following day correctly with no charge. Yesterday my sisters and I decided to swing by Wendy's for dinner. We each ordered a spicy chicken sandwich combo as it comes and add pickles and cheese and no ice in the drinks. Pretty easy, all of us had the same order. One of the sandwiches was plain one sandwich and everything plus ketchup, and the third was actually made correctly but with only 2 pickles! All three drinks had a lot of ice. And the fries were so old I wouldn't even feed them to the dog! Again the Custer service was horrible. The young boy at the register this time had no idea how to work the computer it took over twenty minutes just for the three of us to place out order! It is unfortunate but I will definitely not be returning to this Wendy's and I think its safe to say that neither of my sisters will return either!
