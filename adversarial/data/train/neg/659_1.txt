Love this place.  \n\nI love their lunch special.  I always get L4 with all salmon sashimi and sushi and 2 jap chae's instead of the rice.  Amazing deal for $8.99! It of course comes with a miso soup and salad.  I love how they permit these subs which makes me want to come here even more. \n\nDinner is a bit more expensive but well worth it.  I love how you always get the standard miso soup and salad but also a plate of jap chae and potatoes.  Recently had the chicken katsu donburi - delish! Pork bone soup - standard, a bit oily.  Sushi and sashimi - good.  \n\nDefinitely one of my go to places for decent Japanese food.
