How can you not love the home of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Pitt Panthers?\n\nI've been to the stadium many times and always enjoy myself. In addition to great games, the stadium has great food. In addition to staples like beer, nachos, and peanuts, there is a Burgatory right under the score board. \n\nWith the stadium near the river, make sure to dress warm in the cold. You'll want to layer up. Also, the stadium only allows for a small clear plastic bag. But they do allow blankets.
