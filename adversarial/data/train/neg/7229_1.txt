To provide context: We visited Don Miguel's at 9:40pm on a Friday. They close at 10:00pm, but the hostess seated us without letting us know this fact. However, the hostess continued to seat patrons up to 10pm, while our waitress told us that she needed to get our order in before 10pm. We appreciated the honesty of our waitress. \nThe decor is tacky, but for a Mexican place inside a casino, I would expect nothing less. \nWe started with margaritas, both strawberry, and both tasted like sugar, and we were not sure if there was any alcohol in the drinks. The salsa and bean dip served with the chips were the best part of the dinner. I ordered cheese enchiladas, my wife had the veggie burrito. The enchiladas were okay, very cheesy with a nice sauce. The rice was very bland, and the beans were decent. My wife's burrito was just roasted veggies in a tortilla with sauce, however, it was a different sauce than the green sauce on top of the burrito. She was not impressed by the burrito. \nThe portion sizes were large, and this is one of the few times we have Mexican and do not take home leftovers. \n\nIf you are looking to eat Mexican inside a casino, check out Guadalajara in Sunset Station and Boulder Station, or Willy & Jose's in Sams Town.
