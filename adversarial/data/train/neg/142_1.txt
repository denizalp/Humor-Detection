First visit. I'm always looking for something new on this end of town and today I wasn't disappointed. I pulled in a little late for lunch, about 1:30, and was a little concerned because it seemed pretty quiet. I went in, was warmly welcomed, and placed my order. I tried the sliced brisket, pulled pork, coleslaw, and beans. The platter also had a little corn muffin. The brisket was spot on. - moist, smokey, flavorful. The pulled pork had great flavor and texture. I doctored up the pork with a sample of the spicy and sweet sauces. Both nicely complemented the pork although I preferred the spicy sauce. The slaw was creamy mayo based savory, not sweet. \n\nProbably my only misgiving about the meal were the beans. The beans were a bit flat. Need  some salt an\/or vinegar. I dumped some of the spicy BBQ sauce on them and they  were perfect.\n\nI thought about knocking the rating down to 4 stars because of the beans but that seems pretty weak-assed to know down a bbq place because of the sides. So 5 stars it is.\n\nI was disappointed that they were out of cobbler. I believe cobbler is the perfect finish to bbq meals so I will be back to get the full experience.
