love this place!! as a group of 8 girls, we werent too worried about getting in. nonetheless, i put us on the guest list. we waltzed right up front, talked to buoncer for about 2.2 and then we were in. not to mention it was free champagne all nite for the ladies, a fashion show, and steven tyler was there. sweet!! the drinks were strong (only bummer is they were expensive, typical vegas). \n\nthe dance floor was roomy and the dj was great. we also met up with a bachelor party that was more than willing to share the vip booth and bottles of vodka. i really like the layout of this club too since you can stand above and check out the crowd. \n\nthe other bummer was that our guy friends couldnt get in for the life of them. i made the mistake of going upstairs to try to get them in, but that didnt work. the cab ride from mandalay was cheap, so dont let that deter you from hitting up body english!! i would def go back!!
