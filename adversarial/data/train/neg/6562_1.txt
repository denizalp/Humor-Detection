First time here.  Every other time there was a long line of customers, so I took that as a good sign.  The food was\nexcellent; I had the Chicken Mole dish and everything was presented beautifully and the tastes were exciting to my taste buds.  The mole was tangy and had a pleasant aftertaste.  The was exceptional--everyone was very kind and attentive.  And, I got to meet Frank and Fina, who were dining here as well.  They both took the time to come to my table, thank me and and my guest and ask us how we enjoyed our dining experience.  !Muy amabile!
