moved from AZ to NC their largest container CAN NOT hold enough space for a 2 bedroom apartment, informed them on the 1st and 2nd phone calls prior to pick up my items needed to go to my house then to the storage unit around the corner. it wasnt until the when they were about to drop off my items i was informed of an extra $200 charge to the storage unit. i could have saved more money with PODS then getting a rental truck.\nNever again! I'm just glad its over and pissed i use my money for their services.. do not use them for a long distance move!
