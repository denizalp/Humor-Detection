Hello friends, \n\nI've come here a few times and each time I've find myself thinking I should have grabbed a snack while I waited. The 1st time I figured it was just busy and not the norm. Uuuuuuuunfortunately I've since gone back a few other times and \"The survey Sayssssss\" they.... are..... very.... very...Sssslllooowwwww!!! (Insert sad, hungry face here).\n\nTTFN
