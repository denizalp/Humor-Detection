I wish I had gotten the name of our waiter, because he was beyond accommodating! My friends and I headed to Juan's after a couple hours driving and hiking at Red Rock Canyon. We were looking for some delicious food & drinks. Juan's DEFINITELY satisfied. \n\nWe made it just in time to order off their lunch menu (ends at 3pm). And then just in time to order from their happy hour drinks (starts at 3pm).\n\nThe meal starts off with complimentary chips & two types of salsa, a bean dip, and grilled onions & peppers. It was all SO good--especially the grilled onions and peppers. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered steak fajitas & a chicken burrito (comes suiza [topped with red or green sauce & cheese]) and added lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. It was all so delicious! \n\nAs other reviews state, the margs are definitely strong. \n\nTo top off our meal, our waiter also let us use the Yelp deal! Four of us dined for about $46--which was a steal! Of course we tipped well because the service was phenomenal.
