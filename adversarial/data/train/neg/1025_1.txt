Went here for a concert, and thought it was a fine venue What's great about the place is that it's intimate and you're quite close to the stage, therefore you can enjoy the show that much more than your standard concert. It's more exciting to see a band here than at any other venue because of that. There are also two bars in the venue with a good selection of drinks. The bathrooms are the only downside because there are in the basement. Otherwise would come back to see a concert here.
