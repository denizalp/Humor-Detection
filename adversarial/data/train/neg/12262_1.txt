As a Pilates instructor myself, I am always on the search for a good studio with awesome instructors to lead me through a good workout. Sometimes after teaching you don't want to workout at work and you want someone else to teach you. Now, I am sure I am not supposed to say this because I work at another studio in this city but seriously, this studio is AWESOME! Even better, it's the only studio close to my home. It's easy to get to, the staff is friendly, the instructor (Elise) I had so far was amazing (she kicked my ass!), and the studio is beautiful. It's not often that I will shower in a public shower but Sweat Body Lounge's feels like a spa! \n\nAnyway, I am glad that this studio opened and I am excited to try out more classes!
