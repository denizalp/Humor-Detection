This place rocks. I've been to enough hardware DIY stores where I feel like I know more than the person trying to help me. And I don't know that much about hardware.\n\nReally refreshing to go somewhere where people clearly know their business inside out and seem truly glad to help. Don't see any reason I'd go anywhere else for parts or advice.
