Very disappointed in their work. I brought in 4 knives that I use for work and that day I got to work to see how sharp they were I could barley even cut with them. One of my knives I couldn't even cut a lemon with. My other knives that I use to cut stake I felt like I had to saw through the meat. I feel like I could have did a better job with a sharpening stone and my eyes closed. I'll make sure to never come here again and inform all my co-workers not to bring their knives here to get sharpened
