My body has found TRUE BLISS at True Rest Float Spa.  Battling cancer takes such a toll on your body, that I was just looking to totally relax... Give my\"aches a break\".  Not only did I achieve THAT (first time in over 2 years I was thoroughly relaxed) but was really, really energized.  Even after my first float.  The \"family\" at the Chandler True REST, were incredibly kind and accommodating.
