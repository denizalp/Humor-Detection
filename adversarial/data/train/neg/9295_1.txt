I really like Barriques as a business overall, but this isn't one of my favorite locations.  Being downtown, it's usually fairly busy, which makes it noisier than the other locations.  This wouldn't always be bad things, but the service slows down, the espresso pulls and tea turn out bitter due to distraction, and their frustration becomes palpable.\n\nTheir wifi is free, but flaky, and while the have weekly wine\/liquor tastings at all of their locations, these make the place even busier than usual, and more chaotic, as the tastings seem primarily self-led, though there's a staffer there to answer questions...if they happen to know the answers (some know a lot about the items in the tastings, others have only basic knowledge.)\n\nThe seating can also get a bit interesting -- the layout is a bit awkward, and there aren't many tables larger than a 2-top. The few that there are are constantly filled by solo students with their stuff strewn about who couldn't be arsed to consider that their laptop and textbook could fit perfectly well on a 2-top if they sat their backpack on the floor, so if you're looking to get a drink with more than one other person, plan on getting it to go.\n\n...or visiting one of their other locations instead.
