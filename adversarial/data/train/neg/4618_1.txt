This place is great. My 6 and 3yeard olds loved their birthdays. It was highly organized, clean and the food was good. They offer the ramp for younger bowlers. The party organizer got all the guest their shoes always refilled drink. we never had to ask. The pizza came in a timey fashion. The facility was remolded in the July 2013 with new carpet, paint and bowls. Everything was very clean even the restrooms. I would highly recommend this place for bowling. Most parents commented on the fact they would of never thought about a bowling party  but this completely changed there minds. I like most of them remember the smoke filled dingy bowling allies of the past. This could be further  from the truth at Brunswick Zone Glendale.
