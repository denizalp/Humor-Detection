Went here for happy hour based on a friends recommendation, service was a little out to lunch as we waited a few minutes when it wasn't very busy.  The food however was good, 4\/5 overall. Arancini were good and crispy, the lasagna was very standard nothing special however. The dessert sampler was pretty good also donuts were excellent. The service was not that great - at the end of the meal the server ended up running my card on the wrong check, then did not take off a free drink i had from my yelp check in- despite the server telling me he did exactly that. Overall - eh it was alright- 3.5\/5
