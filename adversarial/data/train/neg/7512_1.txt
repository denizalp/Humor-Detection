I am a Cirque du Soleil enthusiast and have seen most of their shows. This one was unbelievable, one of their best!!! Yes it plays Beatles music and the dancing\/acts are put in context with their songs, but it is so much more than a Beatles show. The lighting, sound, aerial acts, stage movements, clever use of draping, cool minimalist sets - everything is exquisite and very well executed! It was so good that we wanted to catch the second show of the night right after we watched the first one :D Go see it!
