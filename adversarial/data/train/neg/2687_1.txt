The salad was wonderful, but do not, I repeat do not, order the low cal coconut water cocktail, especially do not order a double. The drink was allegedly a double but contained no alcohol... wasn't trying to get drunk or anything ... I'm a lightweight, if I have one glass of wine I feel it. So I thought maybe the drink was alcohol free but for $22 absolutely not worth it. You have been warned. I know it's Vegas, but I still feel ripped off.  ***** Update: thank you for your kind response, I will absolutely take you up on your offer! Like a lot of people, I hate to complain about a unique drink, maybe others like it like this- who knows, maybe it's low cal because the alcohol is very light, not like a regular drink. Anyway- thanks and Hope to see you soon. I'll be back.
