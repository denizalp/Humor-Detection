Matthews Neighborhood farmers market is the place to go to get all your fresh and local fruits and veggies.  I love the location of this farmers market because they have a good amount of parking and there is a coffee shop and other little cool shops in walking distance.  I also like that each vendor is very friendly and they tend to remember each of their buyers, which is a nice little personal touch.  As with any farmer markets, the earlier you get there.... the more goods are available.  one time, I got there at 10am and almost all the vendors were sold out.  Matthews farmers market isn't the biggest farmer market in the area but it's still a nice farmers market to get all of your essentials.
