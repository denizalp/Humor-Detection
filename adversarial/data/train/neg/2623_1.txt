A guy named Jim or something like tat works at this location and gives me the worst customer service each time I'm in there , always on his phone and acts like a jerk every time I ask a simple question . Been in there over 4 times or so and always the same jerk like attitude. Won't be doing anymore shopping at this location , that's for sure .
