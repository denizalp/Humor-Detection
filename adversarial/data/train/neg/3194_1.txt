I love Winchell's. Just some good ol' fashioned food in a friendly, neighborly atmosphere.\n\nI first started eating here because my then, girlfriend (now, wife) worked here when we met. I've never really been impressed with the food that you can get at neighborhood bars around here. It always just seemed like something to keep you busy between drinking and losing all my money on a video poker machine...not anything I would go out of my way for...and certainly not the star of the show.\n\nBut Winchell's is different. They have food with flavor. Classic delights like calf's liver and onions with bacon, fish & chips, and salisbury steak are done with an unusual finesse and a skilled hand. But I usually go for a late night snack and those dinners are only available from 5pm-11pm.\n\nWhere Winchell's really shines is their sandwiches and burgers....one particular burger comes to mind: The San Francisco - served on a grilled parmesan-sourdough loaf and loaded with homemade thousand island dressing and swiss (wipe the drool from your mouth...you don't wanna ruin your keyboard). As a matter of fact, you can request that bread on pretty much any sandwich.\n\nThe Cuvee salad is another favorite: a delicate balance of mixed spring greens, candied walnuts, smoked gouda cheese, apples, grapes and chicken all tossed with a stringent, yet sweet champagne vinaigrette. By the way, all the dressings are housemade. Did I mention that they make their own potato chips too? And that they're delicious!\n\nI've tried most things on the menu here and I have not yet been disappointed. The servers, bartenders and bussers are all friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is warm and cozy. This is a diamond amongst the lumps of coal we have scattered throughout the valley.
