Great location and many excellent stores to choose from.  I really like the outdoor\/open layout. Even on very crowded days, it doesn't feel as confining as similar indoor locations.  They keep the grounds and facilities clean and (despite a few issues in the past) I feel very safe shopping there. They are dog friendly, too!\n\nI am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the parking lot seems small and awkward to me and they don't have a Ralph Lauren store!
