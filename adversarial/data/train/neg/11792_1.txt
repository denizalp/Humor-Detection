My friends and I had really been Looking forward to having dinner and drinks at this place. We went on a Friday night so we knew that being a restaurant on the strip, the wait would be long but the hour long wait should have been the first red flag. In any case, we stuck it out since we really wanted to try out the drinks (which I ended up not getting because they were taking too long so I drank the red bull and vodka my friend brought with her on the walk to and from the TI, her hotel). After ordering drinks, our party waited at least 30 minutes for drinks. This includes non alcoholic drinks. For real?!?  Disappointment after disappointment. Menu was subpar. As my husband states, \"for a guy that travels around the country trying different food, the menu sure lacks variety and creativity.\"  Then, the food we ordered took another 45 minutes to arrive. Finally, when asking for water from the same server, 3 times, and not getting it, my friend got up and got it herself. When a waitress came over to the station where the water was held, instead of telling my friend that she would take us water, as she should have done, she directed my friend to the water with ice and told her to go ahead and take it to our table. How unprofessional!!!!  If she saw a colleague of hers wasn't working to her potential when it comes to customer service, she should have done it herself to help the restaurant redeem itself. \n\nWhen out friend spoke to the manager, his excuse was that that they were short staffed. Again, a Friday night on the strip, you should have more than enough staff, knowing how busy it can get. We were given a discount on the check, although it does not make up for the Slow service and lack of professionalism. Will not be visiting again.
