I seriously cannot say enough good things about this place. The moment I walked in I was greeted with the warmest welcome. The place is beautiful inside, and very clean! I didn't have to wait at all and was taken back by Sophia who gave me a tour of the place and briefly explained the process of everything before leading me to the chair. As we walked through, each staff member we came in contact with smiled and welcomed me in. Cecilia took my X-rays and was very quick and efficient, which was awesome because usually X-rays are very uncomfortable. Next Tara came in to examine my teeth and clean them. She was seriously the most amazing person I have ever had work on my teeth. She was extremely thorough with her examination, explaining every detail as she went. Next she cleaned my teeth and I have seriously never had a better teeth cleaning before. She was very meticulous and cleaned in between each crevice while ensuring that I was comfortable the entire time. I had bonding left on my teeth from a pervious dentist and she cleaned all of it off along with the build up. Not to mention she was extremely friendly and easy to talk to. After I was seen by the Dr. who was very nice and examined my teeth then explained the work that needed to be done. It was obvious he was very knowledgeable which made me feel confident about him completing the work on my teeth. Overall I had an outstanding experience and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a dentist! They are up on all of the latest technology, extremely knowledgeable, and always have your best interest in mind. The only thing I regret is not coming to this place sooner!!
