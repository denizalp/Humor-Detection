Returned after getting a comp meal from management. I enjoyed the visit, the waitress was funny and warm. My table ordered the Mac and cheese and Pop tart (apple). Both were good even though I'm not a fan of apple turnover (initially it was suppose to be cherry). The trial by fire omelette is actually spicy. I don't always believe restaurant when they say it is spicy but this one was on point. My partner ordered the chicken and corn bread pancake. It was also good. Finished the meal with the s'mores dessert. Do not order if you are only a table of two. You will need at least 8 people. It was good but very very rich.
