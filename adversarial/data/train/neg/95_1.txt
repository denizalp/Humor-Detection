Best brunch place in Roncy... Potato latkes are worth the visit alone... Bacon infused Caesar not for the faint of heart.\n\nBeen there a couple of times now.  Nice to see place that a venue can make a theme out of hangover remedies.  The Cowboy Benny is a favourite, poached eggs atop pulled pork on a southern style biscuit.  Get out the paddles...\n\nService is always friendly.\n\nLooking forward to having dinner there at some point, as they appear to have plenty of interesting menu items, and a variety of theme nights (trivia etc.).\n\nAnother great option in the crowded Parkdale\/Roncy neighbourhood.
