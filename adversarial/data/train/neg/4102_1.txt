I cannot give this place enough praise.\nI live near Park Place Pub, and had only been in there once, and there was no kitchen. I wasn't going to go back.\nThen Applewood Smoke Burger Co. came, and I'll never get another burger. Better than any other burger I've tried in Pittsburgh, and that's including Burgatory and Stack'd. \nThe burger is always cooked perfectly as ordered, and always assembled beautifully. Their chicken sandwich is amazing, and so are their appetizers.\nSeriously, if you find yourself in Highland Park, skip hopping over the bridge to Burgatory, skip their neighbor Park Brugge, and go here. You will not regret it.
