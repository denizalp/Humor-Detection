QOh gosh, I want to like this place. It's close to my house, the menu is so appetizing, the ambiance seems so welcoming.....BUT... I can not get good service here! We are not demanding, we are not entitled, we work in the industry. But the disorganization and understaffing is unacceptable. If I'm paying $4 for 2 croissanwiches at BK, be as rude to me as you want. But if I'm paying $33 for 3 scallops and a ridiculous markup on Rombauer or Shafer, a modicum of service would be nice. Can never even tell which staff member is actually \"my server.\" Get it together.
