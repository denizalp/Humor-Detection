The atmosphere is pretty cool. We at in the barn and it is rustic and very quaint. The initial greeting and seating was very quick and friendly. Our waitress came with water and menus right away. She came back to take our orders when we were ready. Then things slowed down to an uncomfortable pace. Our appetizers of onion rings and cheese curds came out before the drinks arrived or water refilled. Although both were tasty(I would recommend either) they would have been even better with the drinks which we were told were still coming because the bar tender had to make them.(we had 2 beers and a margarita)The drinks came just as we were finishing the apps and unfortunately quite a while before the meals came. The cheese sandwich and the mushroom burger were very good. The cod special had a good flavor, but it was drowning in so much grease that the fish was hard to find. We were asked if we wanted desert soon after we had finished, but the bill was presented after a long wait and my card wasn't picked up for another ten minutes after that.
