i went here for the recent Taste of the World jaunt.  \n\nI've never eaten lamb before, but it was a huge piece on the bone, that the minute I put my fork on it, fell away from the bone beautifully!  \n\nI devoured it quickly and now I can't wait to go back to try some other kebab things!  The sauces were delicious!  I loved the Baba Ganoush (sp) as well!
