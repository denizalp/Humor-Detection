I really enjoy this restaurant. The food is imaginative and delicious while the decor leaves the impression you're visiting a posh, bohemian restaurant of another time. \n\nI'm always surprised that it isn't that busy but the prices aren't exactly cheap either. The service can be spotty and slow but it's a great atmosphere for conversation so I don't mind so much.
