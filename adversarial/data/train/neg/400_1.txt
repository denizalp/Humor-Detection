OMG this place is SO good. It wasn't very full for the Sunday after St. Patty's but that's fine. We had great service and everything arrived fast. The hubs ordered ceviche which was good. However they served stale chips. An off duty waiter reminded the server on duty that the chips were from the night before. Oops. They fixed it fast no problem. The fried chicken sandwich was sooooo good and huge !  \n\nWe had a restaurant.com coupon which was great too. \n\nWe will definitely travel from the other side of the valley to come back !
