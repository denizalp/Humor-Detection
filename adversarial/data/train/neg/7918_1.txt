I'll start off by saying wow is this place expensive, yes, I get it uptake of a place like this is VERY expensive too. Which is why I've only come on discounted days because it's just not big enough or time consuming to pay almost 20 dollars. \n\nRegardless the place is very nicely taken care of I just really wish it was bigger. The shark tank is my favorite and the tunnel underneath it is even cooler. The staff are very friendly and informative!!
