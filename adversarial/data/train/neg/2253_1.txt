Food\/pizza is over cooked... Obscenely thin crust... No where even close to \"NY Pizza\", You WILL leave hungrier than when you got there! SUPER stingy w the pepperoni!\n\nUnfortunately I have to give them at least 1 star... Wish I could give them at MOST 1\/16 of a star!!\n\nDidn't help much that it was cold\/Luke warm.
