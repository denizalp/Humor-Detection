I am sad to be giving this place a less than favorable review as I have been an OHSO regular since they opened in Arcadia; and knowing this is a sister restaraunt, I was excited to see what they had to offer! \nLet me start with the positives: the location is great and the inside looks fab. We went during the day on Sunday and I imagine it looks even better at night with all the pretty light fixtures. Our bartender was friendly and our order came out fairly quick. I got the chicken sandwich with a side of the potato wedges which was tasty!\nNow for the not-so-positives....my boyfriend ordered the ravioli. For $19, we were expecting to be blown away. Unfortunately, it came out drizzled in olive oil and felt undone - I think some type of sauce\/seasoning would have helped. The ravioli pieces themselves were half cold. The couple pieces we had that were warm tasted pretty good. We did let the bartender know about this and we're surprised to see he didn't either try to bring us a freshly cooked plate or comp that entree. \nWhile we were there, it appeared to be during a shift change. It was odd that the manager was sitting just a couple seats over from us counting money with some of the waitstaff. I would have expected this to occur in a back office or something. Just felt a little unprofessional for a nice restaraunt. \nMy hope is that this place is still working out the early kinks as I think it could be a good addition to the neighborhood.
