Hands down the best sushi spot in Vegas! Such a nice crew and the food is amazing! The 911 special is SO GOOD!! Everything tastes so fresh and flavorful! The atmosphere is very welcoming and Juliana really makes you feel at home. Kay is such and amazing waitress and Sean is THE BEST sushi chef in Vegas. Love them!
