Had a few hours after a conference so decided to stop by this place on the way back to the airport.  Did not disappoint. \n\nLarge menu featured many different sandwiches and pizzas.  One of the more unique items was the smoked chicken wings.  Menu described it as smoked whole chicken wings grilled then sauced, and lightly pink because of the smoking.  Tempted, but then I was more tempted by their \"Parma Karma\", which was a sausage sampler of Kielbasa, Brats, and Bangers grilled with grilled onions and perogis.  Pretty dang good although I admit I am not an expert in these types of foods.  \n\nLarge beer list on type, and many types of other brews including an impressive selection of west coast IPAs such as Bear Republic Racer 5 and Green Flash.  I had their Headhunter IPA and Pack a Wallop SPA, both were excellent.  The SPA (an american pale ale) was hoppy enough (more than regular american pale ales like a firestone pale ale or sierra nevada) with excellent malt tones.  Bitter aftertaste reminds you of the hops.  66 IBUs if you're into that sort of thing.  The IPA featured some pretty piney hops, with some sweet undertones.  The best feature of their IPA and SPA is probably their drinkability.  I can go all day drinking these without feeling bloated.  Very light bodied and flavorful.  \n\nI also had a guest IPA by Buckeye called the 76 IPA, I guess because it's 76 IBUs.  I didn't enjoy this one as much because the hops was too bare without any other sort of flavoring.  Not much sweetness or malt at all.  \n\nApparantly this place only started brewing about 7 months ago.  I think this one will go far.  Compares favorably with Victory IPAs, in the same region.
