I went to Evoke located at Eglinton for the second time this past friday. I was using a voucher and Daniel was the the person I was introduced to. He was very kind and caring; asked me for my permission before making any changes and every once in a while ensured that I was comfortable. After he was done, he blow-dried my hair very nicely... I was going to a wedding and my hair looked perfect for it! \nOverall, it's one of the best salons I've been too; it is busy but the employees are very nice.
