I forgot to finish this...and it's been awhile\n\nMy wife tried this place first and didn't care for it, but that was a year or two ago. I've gone by this place so often that I thought I'd give it a try. \nThe server was polite and knowledgeable. She made sure our drinks were topped off. We started with the Shrimp & Avocado Tempura Roll, Firecracker Chicken with Broccoli, Beijing Duck Noodles and Banana Caramel Spring Roll. \n\nI remember my noodles were a little wet so make sure when you eat them that the juice stays on the noodles and not your shirt.\n\nThe dessert was really good.
