I know that others may disagree...but I was not impressed with the pizza at all.  A lot of the reviews are about the deal that they got...$5 for a pizza....and they would be correct.  That IS a great deal....but if you don't enjoy what you are eating....how good of a deal is it?  The crust was like cardboard (dry and tough) and there was not enough sauce on the pizza for our liking.  \nPersonally, I would prefer to pay a little more for a great pizza....but that is just me.
