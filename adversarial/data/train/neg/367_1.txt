Cute cute cute! We hit up this place last Friday for happy hour and were pleasantly surprised. It's got a chic vibe about it with it's dark wood interior, great music, drink specials and a yummy menu. We got there around 5pm and The Living Room was all a buzz with 30 somethings and the occasional 40 something. We both took advantage of the happy hour drink specials and ordered from the menu. After starring at the menu for what seemed like an eternity, I decided on the bruschetta . I had to choose 4 types from a long list but there were so many options it made it tough for me to decide. I really enjoyed the fig, prosciutto & goat cheese...my absolute favorite.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and not once did we have to go looking for him...huge plus! Overall a great experience for the two of us. It's conveniently located in the east valley with easy access from the lower 202. It's great to see some trendy places popping up in the east valley. :)\n\nWe'll certainly return and may even try relocating our regular happy hour crowd to The Living Room. Happy eats! Cheers
