I went for my anniversary dinner. I really wanted beef ribs and it's close so I thought lets go.\nThe food was horrible. Stay away. I got the beef ribs and they where served burned like charcoal and mash potato's where ice cold. Literally like potato salad. I will never go back there. Do yourself a favor and don't go.\nThe manager said she would give me a discount, but didn't. The bill was full price. \nI was disheartened and just paid the tab and left.  \nThey didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. \nThe fact the place was mostly empty on a Friday night should have been my fist clue.\nIf you want beef ribs Bobby Q's is the place to go.
