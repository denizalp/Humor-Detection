Best kept secret for some fresh made Sushi. Today I tried the Spicy Salmon Roll which was very good. My other favorites are the Yammy Yammy Roll, the Spicy Wonderful Roll and my favorite, The Jalapeño (Spicy crab, cream cheese, cucumber topped with Jalapeño and a Spicy Mayo.\n\nFor the price you can't beat it.
