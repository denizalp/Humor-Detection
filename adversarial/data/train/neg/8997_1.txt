Chain restaurants are generally not my favorite.  Although,  after a night out with my family at this Tempe location...pleasantly surprised!  The interior decor has been modernized.  Dark wood and art work add to the atmosphere.  Host friendly, server efficient and the food very good!  We ordered the porterhouse,  sirloin and small ribeye. All medium,  and cooked to tender,  juicy perfection.  Again,  pleasantly surprised,  and I think you will be too!
