My wife & i ate breakfast here and we really loved it. We had the absolute best croissants we have ever had. Their chai tea was also, without question, the absolute best I have ever had.\n\nThe space itself is very charming & the staff extremely friendly. You really owe it to yourself to stop in and eat here.
