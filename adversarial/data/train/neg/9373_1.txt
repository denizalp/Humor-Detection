This park is one of the nicer park I have seen in the North West area of Las Vegas. They have plenty of parking. There are numerous picnic areas, sandy volleyball courts, soccer fields, water play areas, and Jogging\/Walking path with interpretive signage describing the historical significance of the area. There is an Amphitheatre with grass seating for more than 3,000 Concession stands. They play movie and concerts here. \n\nWell-maintained, clean and quiet, when I went there last weekend. Lots of open space. Great area to BBQ, chill, get together or picnic. They also have cute little water machines for the kiddos. The library is nearby.\n\nLots of things to do with your family, with your dog, or on your own. I would love to come here to play beach volleyball.
