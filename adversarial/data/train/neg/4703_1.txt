Very surprised to see the negative reviews.  It is a smaller place so they don't always have the exact thing you need but:\n\nI have always found the owner to be very pleasant and courteous to all his customers.  You can find true South African rooibos for a fraction of what you'll pay at those designer-ish tea places.  They have Ouma rusks (memories of childhood), tinned chakalaka (my favourite dish from when I was a kid) as well as biscuits, jams, dried meats and Mrs. Balls' chutney (apricot chutney, mango chutney to name a few).  The boerewors (farmers' sausage) is nice - available for sale, courtesy of Florence Meats in Oakville, Ontario.
