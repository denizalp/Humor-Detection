I was told by a friend that this place had a lot of great craft beers on tap, but when I got there the selection was beyond anything I could have imagined. Immediately I'm handed this clipboard with about over a dozen pages of which I spent 5 mins flipping through before getting to the food items on the last two pages.\n\nIf you're in a hurry to go anywhere I would not suggest Barhop as this is a place that you want to stick around and try every single beer. The wait staff was extremely knowledgable, our waitress helped recommend and narrow our drink choices from the large list based on our taste preferences. I went with a Belgian IPA and would have stayed for more if I did not have another event to attend.\n\nI guess its about time we get to the food portion of this restaurant. Not one of your average pub fare kind of places, the menu contained classics like burgers and fish and chips, but also included snails, oysters and other items of unusual flair. I had the Fish and Chips which came with coleslaw and tempura fried green beans. It was a great amount of food for the price.\n\nThe menu can be a bit overwhelming, especially if you're not a large connoisseur of different types of beer. As I mentioned before, if you're in a hurry, this might not be the best place to go, but I would still try to squeeze in a visit anytime I am in the Toronto area. One last comment, my friend got the burger and the patty was cooked medium rare, which to me is fine, but everyone has different taste preferences and my friend (who is not a fan of undercooked meat) was never asked, it was only assumed.\n\nOverall, definitely an new go to place for me in Toronto. I'll have to make it my life goal to try every last beer on that menu.
