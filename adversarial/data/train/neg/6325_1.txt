This is the 4th Patron Mexican Grill to open in the area. It is the largest of the restaurants and the most beautiful. The service is impeccable at all the Patron restaurants, and is no different here. We had the chori pollo, cheese enchiladas, shrimp and rice (the kids), queso and chorizo. Everything was cooked perfectly. There is not one thing that I can find wrong with this restaurant. The decor is just beautiful. I also had a frozen raspberry margarita that came in a ceramic pottery glass. The margarita was absolutely delicious. Everything screams Mexico!\n\nYou have to give it a try!
