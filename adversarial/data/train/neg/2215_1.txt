We stayed one night, room rate $159.00 for a king room, second floor. While the bed was comfortable, the room clean and spacious,  breakfast was good,  certain details  necessary to create a  more positive overall experience are lacking.\n\nWhen we returned from dinner, the toilet was loudly ' singing' intermittently  and this continued all night long.  We also realized that the pop up stopper in the bathroom sink didn't raise, so as we washed our hands the sink filled up with water.  It was late, we were tired so we lifted the pop up stopper out to drain the sink.  Hadn't  planned on using our plumbing skills.\n\nAdditionally, when we came in, I asked for a bottle of water and was told I could purchase water or have unfiltered tap water from the kitchen sink. Really? ?  I've paid a lot less and been given multiple bottles of water at similar establishments. The breakfast area didn't have a filtered water dispenser in the morning either. I was told that the uncovered pitcher of water in the breakfast area was unfiltered from the kitchen tap.  Aren't uncovered water pitchers left on a counter prohibited in the food industry ?\n\nPerhaps, it would be wise to consider purchasing a water dispenser for the lobby with a filter.  We noticed 4 coffee dispensers in the main lobby at all times, how about water? Also, a thorough bathroom eval between guests is highly suggested.
