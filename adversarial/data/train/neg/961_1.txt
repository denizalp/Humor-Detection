I have been giving blood for MANY years and found this location not only to be the most friendliest but most efficient as well!  You are always greeted with a smile and a genuine thank you for the donation and possibly, for the regulars, even some quick comedic banter! The reason I chose to withhold a star has nothing to do with this facility or the personnel representing it but because of UBS'S decision to cut back on all the good snacks and all the juices.  They offer strictly water now and there are no snacks left that I care for at all...they want you to keep coming back but they choose to cut THAT part out of the budget??!!!  I will continue to go unless I find some place else that is just as friendly and offer better goodies!
