I have never been treated so poorly as a customer as I have under this new management!! A ten-year customer, I loved the old management who took good care of garments and customers. Under the new management (starting in 2013?), there were issues and they were not especially friendly, but it is convenient and I wanted to support a local business. Today I was dropping off clothes and had forgotten I had some to be picked up. They yelled at me for not remembering; I apologized and asked why they hadn't called as the previous management did when I forgot something. The crazy man who is there all the time then starts yelling more and tells me to leave. I am fearful for my safety as I grab my clothes and run out of the store. Unbelievably this man chases me into the parking lot yelling obscenities until another man in the parking lot tells him to back off and I threaten to call the police. I should have done so, but I was so shaken by the experience and fearful for my safety, I wanted to get away as quickly as possible. DO NOT GO TO THIS CLEANERS!! What an insane experience for a decade old customer! Be careful--I do not think that man is stable!!
