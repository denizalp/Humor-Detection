The taste is fine. Being a New Yorker my standards are fairly high. I gave a 2 Star rating because charging $15 for such a small pie is a bit much. Plus, I requested \"no plastic\" yet they included 2 small plastic containers filled with a strange oil or sauce that doesn't have much flavor. Lastly, I couldn't order delivery over the phone. I was told I had to download the app which charged a delivery fee on top of tip. The delivery took 45 minutes.
