Saw all of the reviews and thought great let's try it.\n\nPizza was good a little too greasy but overall the crust and flavor were good.\n\nWings were an entirely different story. They were about the size of my pinky and these little pigeon wings were short in flavor as well.\n\nFingers were also on the small side and very chewy. Too many tendons. They were crisp on the outside at least.\n\nOverall for $50 for one large pizza, wings and fingers I was disappointed and didn't feel that I got a good value for my money.\n\nGuess it is back to looking for another pizza place near me.\n\nSorry about you trying to make excuses but we did not order kids fingers and I buy party wings and they don't come out that small. We ordered a 16inch pizza with one topping a half bucket of wings and a half bucket of fingers. Don't turn your short comings back on us.
