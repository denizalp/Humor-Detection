My husband and I started going here this past year and thank goodness! The staff is amazing. The doctor is wonderful! My husband has vision issues that we were unaware of until we came here. Every other eye doctor just brushed him off saying that his vision was as good as it would ever be, but I kept pressing for him to go somewhere else and find an answer! Then we found Eye Couture! Dr Cichon is amazing. She has spent MONTHS researching and ordering trial contacts for my husband and finally we found something that works! I almost cried when he told me he can finally see and never realized how bad his vision was until it got fixed! We went to dinner the other night and it was the first time in 7 years he didn't squint to read the menu. This place has literally CHANGED my husbands life! I cannot thank them or their staff enough for their hard work and dedication to my husband. It is truly a blessing we found them and I would recommend ANYONE to go! We feel like family now!
