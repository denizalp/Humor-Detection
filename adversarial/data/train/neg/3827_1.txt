All I can say is run away!!! What a terribly run company. Loyal renters for many years, during the time we needed multiple repairs done on the house. No AC for a week in the summer, pipes bursting and leaking through the roof, severe pests, appliances all breaking and their \"handyman\" (who is absolutely useless) couldn't fix a single thing. Finally get out of the house and we are charged for the appliances and issues there were already present when we started renting. \n\nI would NEVER recommend this real estate office to anyone. I will definitely be sending in a complaint with the board. \n\nSTAY AWAY
