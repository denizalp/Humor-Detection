#1 Thing you need to know, THE LINE IS WORTH IT! Some lines in Vegas are NOT worth it, this line is worth it. Rookie mistake though, don't get in line without a coffee from somewhere else to hold you over. \n\n#2 I live in NYC - where I like to think the bodega breakfast sandwich reigns supreme, but this spot blew us away! Absolutely divine bread, and the ingredients in between (we tried 3 different sandwiches) were all fresh and high quality! Praying for Eggslut NYC! PLEASE!
