I've walked\/driven by this place literally hundreds of time (it's on my way to work) but only recently went in for breakfast with my wife.  The atmosphere is very casual.  Most of the patrons appeared to be families with kids.  The food portion sizes are average.  The service is relatively fast, at the time there were only 2 women who were serving tables and they were very quick.  Don't expect a lot of chit-chat from the staff--they're here to work. After placing our order they came to our table in less then 10 minutes with breakfast--just not ours.  We waited another couple minutes and my breakfast came out, my wife's came out 5 minutes later.  We enjoyed our meal, it was nothing to write home about, but the price was very good--$15 total, including 20% tip and taxes.
