Very pleased with the whole experience. We stopped by to make an appointment for an oil change and the owners introduced themselves and  greeted my wife and I. I am a firm believer that a handshake speaks a thousand words.  These guys were very thorough in the inspection of my truck pointed out that I don't have many more months left on my battery. Blessed to have them so close to our new house.
