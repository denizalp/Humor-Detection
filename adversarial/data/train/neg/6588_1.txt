Subpar in many ways. In the mood for brunch, we decided to give this place a try. The menu looked promising but we left disappointed. The restaurant itself is an odd-shaped, loud room with an atmosphere that's just...sad. Like a half-hearted attempt at creating something along the lines of the South of France. I'm normally not the person that really cares about this stuff, but it was hard not to notice.\n\nI ordered the Spanish omelette. It came with potatoes and I subbed the english muffin for fruit. Honestly, everything tasted like it was frozen and heated in the microwave ( it also arrived really quickly...). It was drenched in salsa and sour cream, which should probably compliment the eggs not cover the bad taste.\n\nThe potatoes were soft and mushy and lacked taste. A little seasoning may have been in order??\n\nOur waitress was distant and every other staff member seemed to look miserable too. We questioned the cleanliness of our silverware, also. \n\nMaybe it was just an off day but it's hard to do breakfast food wrong. Le Peep managed it. I wouldn't recommend.
