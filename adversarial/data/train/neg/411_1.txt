Most people who go to a collision center because they got into some kind of collision! Whether it was with a tree, another car, or a pole it happens right? \n\nYou know what else happens? Rude people stealing your car and using it like it had no meaning to anyone in the world. My car was stolen a few weeks ago. Right when I got back from vacation! I was going down the stairs of my apartment and did one of those, \"wait a minute, did I park at the other row?\", kind of like what we all do at the mall or store. However, I knew where I parked it and it was not there. The closer I got I could finally see the glass on the ground, which indicated that someone took my car. \n\nThat is an experience I NEVER wish to experience again. When the police did fine my car it was just not pretty on the inside. Luckily my rims and tires were still there and no real damage to the outside was done, but the inside looked like a group of teenagers had a party in my car. Oh and took the music with them! \n\nGeico is my insurance company and New Look has a Geico base within their facility. One of the adjusters took my car there to have it evaluated and so forth. It was actually a pretty easy process. Ren (I think that was his name), was the man who was assigned to my case at New Look. Him and his team did a really great job with turning my back into what my car use to look like. It will never be the same to me, because I have a different stereo and the images of what it did look like, but they did a good job restoring her. \n\nThe customer service was great. They really just treated me well and their facility is nice. It is in the back of a bunch of other office buildings, kind of in the nook of it all, but it is a great place. \n\nI am hoping to never return to them, but life happens so if that is the case I would probably bring my car back to them if it is not totaled. That would be sad. \n\nThank you New Look, you really did give her a new look! :)
