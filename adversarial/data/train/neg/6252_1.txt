Most unprofessional company I have ever used. They tried to charge us rent past our lease date and then tried to evict us after we had submitted our 30 day notice to move. The house we rented from them smelled like cat pee when we first looked at it. When we came back to look after mentioning it, they just put in an air freshener. It took them 9 months to get the carpet replaced and the cat pee smell was still in a linen cabinet. They refused to replace it, even though it was making my kids sick. We had to lock and seal it, and never go in. Even the maintenance men knew how bad this management company was. There was supposed to be grass in the front and back yard and when they FINALLY got around to installing grass in the front yard (6 months later), they ran out near the end, installed a different type of grass, which had mold, and ended up killing off the rest of the grass. They refused to fix it. They also refused to put grass in the backyard because \"I had a dog\" (a 3 week-old lab puppy). Yeah, this dog was going to ruin the yard with her 3 week-old feet. Don't ever use this company as they will try and cheat you time and again. They even tried to get that eviction on my record, even though they charged me an arm and a leg for a security and cleaning deposit. That place was filthy when we moved in, so they darn sure didn't use the money from the previous tenant to clean it up. This place is a scam.
