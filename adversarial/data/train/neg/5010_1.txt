The new club at Drais has shifted the emipcenter of fun on the Las Vegas Strip for sure. The roof top view of the strip from this club is second to none. The music and lighting of this club is state of the art. Not only is this one of the best looking clubs in Las Vegas but the bottle girls are friendly and beautiful. \n\nI went opening weekend (memorial day weekend) and the environment was energetic. I also went the following weekend to see if it was a fluke and to my surprise I had more fun the second time around. This goes to show that this club offers something special and different than 99% of the clubs in Vegas. This is a must see and must do when youre in Vegas. Drais out did itself!!!
