I have seen better, much better! I was getting hyped by the reviews and of course topless women. Having seen shows like this before, Moulan Rouge in Paris I had hopes for the show. It started off good but then one of their skits which had Samson and Delilah was just torture. The show was an hour and fifteen minutes and I really wished I spent it somewhere else. Let's say I'm not going to want to see this show ever again.
