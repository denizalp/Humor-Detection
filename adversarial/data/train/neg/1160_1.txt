Worst rental agency at McCarran. No sense of urgency and I've stood here listening to the clerk go on and on with a two customers about his cold and the places to visit. The employees need to have a productivity metric that they are measured by.  You can do this when there isn't a line zigzagging out into the lobby.  Where's the manager??!!
