First time at China Kitchen for takeout. We ordered a General Tso's combination, a Beef & Broccoli combination and an order of Crab Rangoon. The combinations came with one egg roll each. Putting it against all of the Chinese takeout food we've had in the past, it was good! The order was placed and was ready for pickup within 10 minutes. Everything was piping hot when we got home. The chicken and beef were spot on and the Crab Rangoon had plenty of filling. Less than $20 and there was plenty of food. For a quick Chinese fix, this place was a great choice!
