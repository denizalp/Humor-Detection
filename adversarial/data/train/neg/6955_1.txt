Great yoga studio in a beautiful space.  Big, clean, hard wood floors, mirrored walls.  Bathroom with showers and lockers (also clean).  Instructors are helpful, friendly (they remember your name), not pushy and pay individualized attention to you in a way that is not over-bearing.  They should have a solid 4-star rating for sure. I've done Bikram in several different cities from Brooklyn to San Francisco and in between and this is a great studio.  My one recommendation would be to offer classes that vary (in terms of level\/poses\/length).  But if you want a solid hour and a half class of Bikram-I would highly recommend this spot.
