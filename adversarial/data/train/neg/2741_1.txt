This place is a good way to make some extra cash.  They seem to compensate better than the other competitors.  As with most donation centers, it is a long process.  My only complaint is the center isn't cleaned well away from the donation tables.  It could definitely use a good scrub everyday.  \n\nOverall, if you are healthy and have a large chunk of time in your day to donate.  It is a good\/smooth plasma donation center.
