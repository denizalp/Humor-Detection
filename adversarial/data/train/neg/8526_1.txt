We stopped in at Vintage NV while perusing Container Park and were met with the cutest selection of vintage clothes, shoes, and jewelry. \n\nLike most other shops in Container Park, the shop is small but they boast a lot of lovely items to admire, try on, and possibly buy. Sis found the cutest playing cards shirt that was very Vegas without being uber tacky. Needless to say, I was a little jealous of her score. \n\nBe sure to check in on Yelp for 15% off, to boot! Sis appreciated that the lovely sales clerk counted my check in to her purchase. Service was excellent, and I know I will visit here again soon!
