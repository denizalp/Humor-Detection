Had breakfast here on a Saturday   Loved the whole-wheat pancakes. Very light and fluffy and a spicy taste - reminiscent of  gingerbread. Delicious.  Also, the grits were great. And the eggs were tasty too. I was not real fond of the turkey sausage. Will probably not get that again. But overall a great breakfast. Will come back.
