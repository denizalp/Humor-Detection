I had been meaning to come here for some time so I am glad I got to stop by! \n\nI got the Berry Superbowl. I thought it was kind of expensive for the amount of stuff you got in there for this specific bowl, so I kind of wished I got a different bowl, but it still tasted pretty good. My aunt got the Pom-Cha-Cha, which was also good. Overall, it seems like all the menu options are well thought out with a nice variety, but everything seems kind of expensive, especially because I don't believe the fruit is organic. I could totally be wrong about that but I was surprised by the price if the produce they use is not even organic which would make the prices more understandable. \n\nThe staff was kind of cold to us, but the shop itself is super cute. I love the layout and seating area! \n\nI don't think I could go to this place regularly because it is expensive, but if I was in the area and craving something healthy, I would stop by.
