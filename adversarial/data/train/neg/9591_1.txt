We were lucky enough to catch Christopher right when he opened up the shop on a weekday.  We were able to talk to him while he finished setting up -he is the chef, the busboy, the owner, the operator, he does it all- is a GREAT guy, and after tasting his food, he is also a culinary artist.\nThe food was as beautiful to look as it was to eat and a good value for what you get.
