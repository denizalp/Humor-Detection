I've taken my care there for oil changes and service, and of course, gave them my cell number so that they could reach me and let me know that it was complete. I don't share my cell number with businesses often because I do not want to have sales phone calls - let alone from a company where I have not explicitly opted INTO marketing from them. \n\nApparently, they are in the business of sharing those personal phone numbers of people in their database with not only their sales team - which has resulted in unwanted, cold sales calls from their salespeople trying to make their numbers - but repeated phone calls from a warranty company (that somehow happens to know the details of my vehicle and my cell number) trying to sell me some extended warranty. The company they sold my information to is \"Vehicle Company Processing\" and it is based out of Compton, CA - and if you google the company you'll see that it is clearly a scam.\n\nI'll never buy a car from them now. I won't get my car serviced there again. Just because they don't value the privacy of my own information. Totally unethical, and really, really poor marketing practices.
