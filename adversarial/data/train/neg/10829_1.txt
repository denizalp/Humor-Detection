I'm shocked to see 5 star reviews for this shop because I had the complete opposite experience today.  This is not a road bike kind of shop - cruisers, fixies, etc but I only needed \"Butt Butter\" aka Chamois butter so I thought I'd stop in.  When I didnt find it right away I approached the counter to ask.  One employee sitting 1 foot from me and never acknowledged me.  The mechanic told another employee who was leaning on the counter on his cell phone to help me.  That kid looked at me and went right back to his phone.  The mechanic then repeated to have someone help me.  And again, it went unnoticed.  The guy in front of me then asked if I needed something and said he didn't know what I was talking about.  The mechanic pointed me where I needed to go.  I got the product and re-approached the counter.  The circus began for the 2nd time.  The mechanic telling the lazy kid against the back counter to help me.  Nothing happens.  Mechanic repeats himself.  Nothing.  Finally again, the guy sitting RIGHT in front me asked if I was ready.  Had I not needed the butt butter for a 90 mile ride tomorrow, I would have walked out 2 seconds after I walked in.  I don't care who you are.  If you run a business, and someone walks in to spend money, you act like you care.  Glad others have had a good experience with repairs but their customer service is seriously lacking - will be worth the drive to go someplace else, I promise you.
