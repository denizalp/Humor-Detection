I'm glad I found this place! This is my new favorite \"go to\" spot. Upon moving to Las Vegas, I've been on the hunt for some good tasting macaroons, and I ended up finding this place on Yelp. Their macaroons are yummy! I usually get the vanilla hello kitty ones. And the prices are cheaper than most places I've been to. Although I haven't tried any of their other items in the store (I skip everything just to grab macaroons), it looks pretty tasty. A lot of people are always there, so I'm pretty sure it tastes good. Great location, good service, and very clean!
