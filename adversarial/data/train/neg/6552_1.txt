Came to this restaurant on a Saturday around lunch time because my fianc√© was getting a tattoo next door. The restaurant was very clean & friendly. I was greeted & helped as soon as I walked in the door. I ordered a slice of pizza & antipasto salad. The lady taking my order offered me their 2 slice of pizza special that came with a drink. My food was ready fast & it was delicious! Would recommend for a nice little lunch. Or even dinner!
