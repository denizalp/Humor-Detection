Allure Nail Bar is truly my favourite salon!\n\nWhen you arrive into the nail salon, the workers will make you feel very comfortable. They have PLENTY of colours to choose from, and they are constantly updating! \nService is excellent for the price, Allure is definitely about quality, and not about speed. \nAll workers are outgoing and friendly, they make you feel like you are friends from the get go! The music they play is excellent too!\nAppointments for summer are very busy, so make sure to book in advanced! As well, they are really great accommodating with schedule. They opened early for me one time to squeeze me into an already full and busy day!\nA loyalty program is in effect. Sterilization looks excellent.
