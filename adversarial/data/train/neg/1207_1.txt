In general an ok restaurant, i think its overrated as of all chain restaurant with different management. I had good services and really bad ones. Usually its consistent to the location. I like the salads good selection and complex dishes with more than average portions. Sea food pasta is so good generous portion and big size shrimps. Even though its not in my favourite list we end up going there from time to time fir a meal or a gathering with friends. To be clear its not a low end or bad restaurant and meal are fresh and tasty , its just that i am not a big fan of chain restaurant.
