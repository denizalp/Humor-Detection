We rented a home over a year ago and have had so many problems with it. We have had termites, a roof collapse, and broken air conditioner just to name a few. There have been some very nice people we dealt with but there has also been extremely rude people in management when they actually call you back! I will never rent with them again and strongly recommend others don't either.
