Always a must-visit every time I visit Northeast Ohio.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Melt, and the Melt in Independence is my favorite location. \n\nThe sandwiches are amazing. They're delicious and huge. They have seasonal specials every month. My personal favorite Melt is the grilled PB & banana.\n\nThe seasoned fries that come with your sandwich are super yummy.\n\nMelt has a huge beer selection with a monthly draft special. \n\nWait times can be a bit rough, but you can always grab a seat at the bar if you are 21+.\n\nPrices are very, very fair.
