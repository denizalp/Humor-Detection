Below is my first review of Joya. After my unfortunate experience, the spa manager called me personally and made it right. I came back with my friend for her birthday and had a lovely time. My provider was Joel and he was friendly and gave a great massage. Everyone was kind and accommodating. We even got free gelato for her birthday! This is what good service is. I would absolutely recommend Joya. Make sure to block out a whole day so you can hang out in the spa only pool and enjoy the sauna, hot tub and amazing \"whisper lounge\". Great day! Gorgeous place! \n\n\n\nboyfriend got me a gift certificate for a spa day here because he knows that I love this resort. I have stayed here and have eaten here many times. This was however my first time at the Joya spa. The front desk attendant was helpful  and gave me a wonderful tour. This is a large and well appointed spa. There is a special pool just for spa and salon users. There is a beautiful hot tub, dry sauna (although it was closed when I went), steam room, locker room with showers as well as a relaxing whisper room. Everything was great until my esthetician arrived. She pronounced my name incorrectly (I have an unusual name so this is common for me), however when I corrected her she seemed annoyed and ignored me. She barely responded to her when I asked some questions and made polite conversation. It was as if I was bothering her. She did not tell me when something was going to be especially hot or cold and this was jarring to me because my eyes had pads on them. She did not tell me about anything she was doing. Apparently an arm massage was included but she did the bare minimum. I don't know if I would go back. Big let down for a nice spa in a nice resort.
