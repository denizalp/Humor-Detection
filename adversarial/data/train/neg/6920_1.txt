Super friendly and efficient customer service! Good job Heather. \nWe got the $15 for 30 dollars deal and enjoyed the ANTIPASTI PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND MUSSELS and the SALSICCIA pizza. It was delicious!!! We are definitely spreading the word out and coming back for sure! We can't believe we can just walk there from our condo!
