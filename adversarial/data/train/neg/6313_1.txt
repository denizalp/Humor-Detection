This was by far the best buffet we experienced in Vegas & we tried several. Highly, highly recommend. Best price for the value. I think we paid around $50 for 2 adults. Great food & more variety than any other buffet. Just to name a few: eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, pancakes, oatmeal, cereals, muffins, toast, omelette station, fruit, all beverage options, chorizo, rice etc. They refresh frequently so food is not old & dry. Gets busy in late morning but before 10am pretty quiet. We had an excellent beverage server, Spanish gentleman w\/long hair. Sorry i didnt take any photos.
