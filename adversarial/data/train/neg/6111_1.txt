This was a GREAT experience.  Timing of dishes was perfect.  We had the Albino stout, The Count, Hefeweissen blend, the Irish Red and Spice Spice Baby.  All were good but Albino Stout was the favorite.  All dishes were tasty!  We had: Tempura Cauliflower, chorizo flatbread, beef sliders, corn dogs, lamp ribs, shrimp and grits(yum!),  and pork chop (sauce was yummy!).  For dessert we had the Maple Pot de Creme which was Delish! We also ordered the brownie with ice cream and peanut butter caramel, which was the only the item we with which we were slightly disappointed because it was dry and apparently flavored with one of the beer stouts.  All in all, we will definitely be back.  Very great experience!
