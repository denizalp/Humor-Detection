Spot on.  Nice room, great service but still laid back dinning.  Love the quality and presentation.  Prices are reasonable and the staff and owners aim to please, and succeed!! I found a facebook Bodega 13 site with more photos of the room and food.\n\nGreat room, service food and a varied and creative menu.  I eat meat and my wife only seafood and vegetarian and she has no issue getting a good meal.\n\n\n\nWe have come for Sunday breakfast, lunches and dinners and it has been a great experience each time.\n\n\nBTW outdoor patio maybe dog friendly.
