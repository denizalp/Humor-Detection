Love this place. Sushi is always great. I am a roll fan. Have tried many of theirs and love each one. Enjoy the 80's music and the saki bombers too. They offer a full menu so there is something for everyone here. Clean, fast, casual dining. Been going here for a few years... not planning to stop any time soon.
