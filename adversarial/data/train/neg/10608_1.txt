Tonight we were here for a wedding rehearsal dinner. The place is impressive the moment we walk in. It's decorated like a New York City upscale club. The dj already had great music, the photobooth the bride hired was ready and operating. The roof is retractable which they opened making for a spectacular transition from afternoon to evening.\n\nThe buffet was ready on time with a large selection of entrees. I had the short RI s, Romain  alade, potatoes, and grilled vegetables. Tiramisou was the desert. The food was served hot and was delicous.\n\nOne very impressive component was the staff to guest ratio. There was an abundance of bartenders,servers, security, and management for our small group.\nJohn Magor was the manager on duty and I got the opportunity to chat with him. Since this is a \"private\" party style place they host some of the hottest celebrities and DJS for exclusive events. He was able to drop some really big names, impressive.\n\nAnyone looking for an exceptional spot for any size party, event, dinner, or special occasion will want to check this place out.
