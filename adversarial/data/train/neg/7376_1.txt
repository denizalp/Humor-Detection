I have lived at Griffis Summerlin South (Formerly Wellington Meadows) for six years.  This property has gone through four different (most of them lackluster) management companies since I moved here in 2010, but this current management is the BEST of all!  Grace, Tasha and Candyce are AWESOME, and always do the best job they can for the residents.  They are always super friendly to me, and very professional.  Jose, Hector and Mario (along with the rest of the maintenance and grounds crew) are also very professional and friendly as well, and all of my maintenance requests have been fulfilled in a timely and effective manner.  The complex is very well maintained, the location is second to none, I like my neighbors, and it's nice, clean and quiet.  I'll be renewing my lease next year.
