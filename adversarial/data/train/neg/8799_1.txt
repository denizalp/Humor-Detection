I come to lazy dog quite often with my German Shepherd pup. I absolutely love their food and their ambience with the fire pit. As i came in here the fire pit wasn't working after numerous tries so I was a bit bummed but the manager apologized. My boyfriend and I waited a bit of time for our food and when we came it was a complete disappoint. Everything was cold, and the dog's food was incorrect. Like I said I come here often so I knew something was off. I found the manager Kristen and explained to her something didn't seem right this time around. She explained to me the situation and promptly came out to see what was going on. She was absolutely phenomenal with her service recovery and this is why I'm writing this yelp and why I'll continue to come back. She fixed the mistakes quickly and was very apologetic. She is a great manager and the reason I will continue to come back after the situation we had tonight. Thank you Kristen for your fantastic service recovery and service excellence.
