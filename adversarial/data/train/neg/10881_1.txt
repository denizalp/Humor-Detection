My wife and I celebrated our 3rd anniversary at this fantastic place years ago.   We decided to come back for a great valentines dinner.  When we asked the server about the dishes we remembered so fondly, he said we have had several chefs since then and they change things to their tastes so we don't have those any more.  We should have just left.  I had the salmon and coconut rice.   The fish was nicely cooked and charred but had no flavor and the rice was underdone.  My wife had the beet salad but we found no beets, no feta, and she said it didn't taste good.  I guess the current chef is a fan of my 8th grade cafeteria cook and loves bland microwaved food out of a bulk box.   The highlight of our meal was the cute feral black cat that kept visiting our table on the patio.   Even he wouldn't eat the salmon.....what does that tell you?   The server rocked and the patio was really nice.   They comped our meal but the mgr didn't even bother to come out to speak to us or anyone the entire time we were there.  I think the numerous chefs may not be the issue as much as the mgmt.  such a shame that this place has devolved into what it is now.   Do not waste your time as this is not even a shadow of what it once was.   So disappointing.
