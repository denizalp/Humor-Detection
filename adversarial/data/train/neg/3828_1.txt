This was certainly a challenging course! It was really fun just make sure to bring a water bottle or drink in excess before going up (Especially when its hot out). There are three different courses, beginner, intermediate and advanced. If you are afraid of heights this is not for you! Even I have a slightly fear and found it tough at some points (you have to look down to get your footing). The slowest and most painful part is when you are practicing to go up and even in the beginner course things are slow. We could have made it through the course much faster if it weren't for the slow people in front of us! It was still a great time I highly recommend it!\n\nTip: Make sure to be at the front of the line when you are practicing, otherwise you will be waiting so long to do the obstacles.
