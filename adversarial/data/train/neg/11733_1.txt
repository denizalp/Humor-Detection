The stuffed onion kulcha is to die for....\n\nGood Indian food - the gravy\/curry dishes and breads are good. The thali has large portions for a single person, but quality suffers. I would avoid the thali. \n\nService is terrible, but that's the case with most Indian restaurants I find. There's this one short waiter who is polite and cheerful, you're lucky if he's serving you.\n\nThe ambiance is good, the far end has a statue of an Indian deity with waterfall effects which is artistically done and is the focal point of the room, and the music is soothing Indian instrumental.
