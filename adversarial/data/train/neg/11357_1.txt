I finally came here myself as all the other times I've eaten the cheesecakes, someone else got them for me, and because I walked by randomly and there was no one in the line up. I guess the hype is over lol!!!!\nThe space is cute, nothing crazy but it's nice. The bakers and cashier are very nice and polite, though if I may say so, seem quite serious.\nI like their cheesecake. It's Japanese style so it's fluffy and light-tasting unlike its American counterpart. The madeleine however, not so great. A bit stiff and dry and kinda leaves a greasy film on the tongue. \nI would come back for the cheesecake and maybe try the cheesetarts next time.
