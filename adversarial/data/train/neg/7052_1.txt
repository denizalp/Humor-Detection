I was born and raised in Chicago, so I know real Chicago food. That said, I was excited to try a bit of this and that at Dazzo's. I ate a dog, a pizza puff a tamale and a cheese burger to try to get a taste of home. Soon after sampling almost everything Dazzo's had to offer, I immediately regretted \nIt. \n\nThe tamale was microwaved and would have been better steamed. The burger tasted like $1 burger from Burger King with liquid Velveeta cheese. The \"Chicago\" dog was below average, and looked and tasted nothing like a true Chicago dog. The pizza puff was okay but a bit greasy inside. No public restroom is crazy since I drove quite a distance to find true Chicago eats!  Cash only and add $2.75 for the ATM fee Thank God Portillo's is in AZ 10x better! Maybe I should've tried the beef!
