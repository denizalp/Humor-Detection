Now this is one of those fast food places that go out of the way to make you feel at home.  Miguel the manager sure take pride in making sure his customer are taken care of.   I have never had a bad meal here. The chicken is all ways hot, and crunchy.   A location like this goes to show u that a fast food place can be good.   Keep up the good work.
