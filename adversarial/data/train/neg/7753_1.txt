Went to eat on a tuesday afternoon and it wasnt too busy. We walked in because the outdoor dining area was right on the strip and looked like a great place to have lunch, and then we asked to sit inside, go figure. Our hostess Amariah was very friendly and suggested a few items that we tried. We were not dissapointed. The shrimp and grits was first and it was a wonderful dish. It was a tasting plate big enough for two people. For entrees we had the colorado hot brown and the street taco plate. Both were large, although pricey dishes. They were excellent and everything was cooked perfectly. I was planning on ordering one of the many different milkshakes but was too full after my meal, i guess i have a reason to go back now. Great lunch. Would be 5 stars if it wasnt so pricey.
