These guys are awesome! I haven't cleaned my carpets in 2 years, having 3 dogs they were filthy. They came in and explained the whole process, short time there after carpets smelled fresh and looked new again. Carpets dried in few hours, loved service so much I asked them to come out a week later to clean my grout. I've used several grout cleaning companies before and couldn't bring my grout color back. This company on other hand is by far best company out there!!! Will use Allstate Carpet & Tile Care from now on.
