Is it Mexican ? White washed Mexican? Or fusion? Authentic staff very white menu. I will say that my server was, well, aloof and distant.. the only saving grace was the deep fried avocado. It was delicious but the tortilla soup that accompanies it was water downed and bland.\n\n3 stars for the Deep Fried Avocado but I'll probably won't be back.
