Well I tried this place on a whim.     The chicken spring rolls were quite good,   the dipping sauce I would have liked to be a little stronger in flavor, but still, I enjoyed them.   I then had the glass noodle basil chicken dish,   very, very tasty, a little heat too.  I love this dish!!! I really did like this. \n\nThe hot and sour soup is good too.   The red curry is very good too. We had the fried fish and mango dish, it was tastier and better than I first thought too.   I am not a vietnamese food expert, I tend to eat more thai,   but I enjoyed this and I want to try some more food on their menu soon :). I would definitely recommend this place! \n\nOverall I really like this little place. The restaurant doesn't look great but the food is very tasty...
