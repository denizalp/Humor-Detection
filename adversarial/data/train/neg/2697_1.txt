I tried their chicken pineapple curry via delivery. The entree was everything I expected it to be. Rich, slightly spicy with just the right amount of sweet & spice. Rice was fresh, warm and just sticky enough to eat easily with chopsticks. This is one of my all time Thai dishes so I was quite pleased. I was not however impressed by the cucumber salad\/relish. It was mostly brine and way too sweet. No deal at $2 per side as there was only maybe 2 bites of cucumber per side. I'll definitely continuing patronizing this restaurant but won't order the cucumber again
