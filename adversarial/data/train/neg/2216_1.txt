This place is about more than the food for most people that go there and love it. An for a certain hipstery set Zenith is like moths to a flame.\n\nFor the rest of us though Zenith is an antique shop with mediocre food and ok service,\n\nIt's held up to be something more than it is for those of us just looking for a decent meal.
