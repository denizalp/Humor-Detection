Came here for lunch and got the #1 combo which is a gyro pita wrap with fries and a drink. Also got the appetizer portion of babaganouj. \n\nThe pita was very good and the gyro meat was very flavorful. It was very simple and came with onions, tomato and tzaziki sauce. \n\nThe babaganouj was good but nothing out of the ordinary.
