We had a lot of fun doing this and would definitely go again. We enjoyed doing something new, the people were really nice and it was a good value ($25 per person)\n\nThe rooms were a little generic, but the Attic was pretty cool. (Filled with Cleveland Sports memorabilia). I was under the impression Escape rooms were about solving puzzles, riddles and logic but this one was a little simpler than that. \nNot saying it was a breeze or anything.... we got out with only a minute to spare and we had to ask for a few clues ;-)\n\nStill, I recommend it if you're looking for something different to do!
