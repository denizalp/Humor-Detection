I like the bento boxes here, you can mix and match as you desire and for ~$10 for lunch you can't really go wrong. I usually get the teriyaki salmon and tempura, and you get a side of rice, salad and soup with it as well.\n\nIf you're looking for unique sushi - the crunchy salmon roll is the way to go. Salmon topped with sriracha mayo and corn flakes!\n\nMaybe not as \"authentic\", but it's quick and easy and sometimes that's all you need when you're hungry!
