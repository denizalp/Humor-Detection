Everything from the kimmi dolls to the pork belly ramen, this place is great! Kid friendly environment with adult atmosphere. Price great with expensive taste! Can't wait to go for happy hour. Salt scrub for hands in bathroom a nice free luxury. We didn't take pictures of food because we didn't want to stop eating to take them.
