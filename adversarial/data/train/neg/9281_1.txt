This is indeed once of the classic Phoenix Mexican restaurants. I've been here dozens of times, and love bringing out-of-towners. The menu is vast! \n\nWe like the veggie section of the menu. They do not use lard, so I usually get a vegan bean burrito (no cheese). The tortilla is excellent! My husband likes the spinach enchilada. The chips are fresh and warm, and the salsas are above average. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is perfect on a scorcher of a Phoenix afternoon. It's almost cave-like, especially if you are in a booth. The service has always been prompt and friendly.  \n\nWhile I appreciate the veggie section of the menu, maybe next time they print it they could mark what items are vegan, or could be made vegan? Other than that, this place is great!
