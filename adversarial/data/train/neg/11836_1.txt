Zeto degrees was a nice little cafe when we walked in. It was pretty clean in there from what i can tell, and it was decorated pretty and simple. They have a nice variety of different kinds of drinks and they were very tastee. The food however was lacking. Pretty mediocre, the popcorn chicken was kind of soggy and chewy and the sauce tasted generic. We waited almost 30 min for two small orders of popcorn chicken and 1 french frie to come out,  and when it did it was all cold. Not impressed.
