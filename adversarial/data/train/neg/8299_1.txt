The carpet leading to my bedroom has seen better days thanks to my 2 kittens who scratch from sheer spite.  Rick came in the promised appointment window and got right to work.  Five minutes later he was all done and it looks brand new!! I couldn't ask for a more affordable and efficient fix! Love this company!!! Great job, guys :)
