3.5 - I've been here about 5 times now. The location is great, and the reno to the space is amazing. Love the big back room. The service is really good too. The food is FINE, but I find the meals very inconsistent. One day you'll get a great full plate, the next day the chicken sausage is dry and thin or the home fries feel like they've been re-cooked a few times. Se\nI'd say the lunch is better than the breakfast in taste and value.
