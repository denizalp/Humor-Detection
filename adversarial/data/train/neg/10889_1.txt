We were looking for a cozy place for a reasonable yet delicious meal. This bistro definitely satisfies in every way. Attentive staff and creative food. For starters we had a very tender mini calamari on savoury couscous. We enjoyed the crispy duck confit special and the beef cheek poutine for dinner and ended with a donut and caramel. Duck and donut - how can you go wrong ?! We will definitely come back.
