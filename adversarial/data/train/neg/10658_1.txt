I am almost 8 months pregnant and getting married in three weeks. The women working in here were absolutely AMAZING!!! With my bump and short timing Laurie was able to find the perfect dress for me. My mom and I couldn't have been more pleased with our whole experience here. From the time we walked in the door until we left. Thank you guys so much for making our day shopping successful and being so wonderful!!!
