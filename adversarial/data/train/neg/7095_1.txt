Pokelab was okay. I am not Hawaiian but I enjoyed my fair share of poke while visiting the islands. I got white rice, fresh salmon and spicy tuna on mine and assorted toppings. The rice wasn't fresh; the spicy tuna was not spicy. I asked for spicy mayo and it wasn't spicy; not even mildly. The service was quick, but it's hard to hear when the music speaker is close to the ordering area. Glad I tried it but I won't be coming back.
