I tried cancelling my membership over the phone after 1 year and it never happened! I called back to today and they are making me DRIVE to the location that I signed up at which is on the other side of Vegas! I have a location 10 minutes from me here in Summerlin and I can't sign the papers there? Really? This is inconvenient especially after all the money I have spent and am obviously still spending! Not good business at all. Don't get locked in this contract, you will NOT be able to get out of it!
