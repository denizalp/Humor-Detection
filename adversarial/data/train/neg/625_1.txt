I saw the mixed reviews but since I was staying at the Luxor, decided to give this place a try. It's a bad idea - don't do it.\n\nFirst, we ordered an 8oz Filet medium and the sucker came out rare - not only that, but it wasn't even one 8oz piece, it was two smaller pieces set together closely to make it look like one. When I told the waiter, he offered no apologies but took it back to the kitchen on my dirty bread plate (which I am certain is a health code violation). Several minutes later, he dropped it back off onto the table and despite the outside looking black, the inside was still rare. Sent it back a second time, once again, no apology or assurance that this kind of thing never happens at a steakhouse that charges $44 for a single filet. When it came back to the table a third time, it was jerky - burnt to a crisp on the outside and well done on the inside.  Perhaps we need to send Chef a link to how to cook a steak! The meat itself was nothing special, it could have very well been picked up from Kroger.  We also got the scallop dish, which was perfection and the reason for the second star.\n\nAnother disappointing thing is my friend had inadvertently tipped over her wine glass and it fell into her quinoa and another waiter saw it happen and quickly came to clean up the spill and take the dish away. What is crazy is that nobody even offered to replace the half glass of wine she spilled. We are about to drop $150 for a meal that was poorly prepared and you can't even offer us that courtesy? \n\nManagement should be replaced, there is no excuse to have a staff that inept. I suspect this is why most of the tables sat unoccupied on a busy Saturday night. \n\nMost of the positive reviews on Yelp are from years ago. This place is currently in the toilet. If you are in the mood for good steak, I'd suggest trying The Barrymore. It's far better and a bit less expensive.
