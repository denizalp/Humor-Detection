Too bad I didn't read the reviews on yelp before I booked this car.  The $21\/day price advertised when I booked the car grew to $36\/day when I confirmed the rental then ended up costing $72\/day when my wife picked it up.\n\nPayless shoes = good \nPayless Car Rental = bad\n\nStay away from this place -  I will never use them again.
