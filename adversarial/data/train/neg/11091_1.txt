Love  this place for no hassle quick latte runs. Never along wait and a Great selection of specialty coffee and lattes, a huge step up from starbucks. If you have time to hangout they have a cozy indoor space which you can stay and sip your latte in peace. They also have board games for the more adventurous. If you are staying for a while, they have breakfast in the form or to order and pre thought out sandwichs, egg options and danishes and croissants. \n\nThis place is never overly crowded which is nice, sometimes in the morning it is, but then it calms down. Also if pressed for time the drive thru is always an available option which is unique for specialty coffee shops.\n\nMy favorite drink here is a pumkin spice white mocha, I get it hot with non fat milk and it is always delicious.  Some places make their to go drinks different from drinks to stay. Not the case here thank goodness.  \n\nOverall this  is one of my favorite local coffee shops, I frequently go here and would recommend this place to anyone in the area. Great find.
