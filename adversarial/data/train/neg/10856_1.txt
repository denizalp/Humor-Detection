My friend and I have been coming in once a week for lunch and sitting with Daniel at the bar. He really knows how to make you feel welcome and like a main priority in your visit! Such a warm smile and always ready for a beer or wing sauce suggestion! Felicia has also made our experiences great every visit we've had. Great food, legendary service, and awesome times! You've earned yourselves two new regulars due to these two individuals!
