Now this is a place to buy a bike! From the start we were greeted by such friendly staff members. Throughout the process we always felt that Shawn had our best interest at hand. He was honest and got us the best deal we felt for our purchase\nI am extremely pleased and my experience with GO AZ of Peoria was excellent, from start to finish. Shawn was personable, very knowledgeable, and professional, and worked to make this experience very comfortable and productive. I give him my highest recommendations.
