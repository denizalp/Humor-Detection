We were a party of 6 celebrating my wife birthday . We have never been in this  resturant before . The resturant atmosphere  was  awesome . We got seated at the patio .The foods were exelent,good quality  ,well presented and good  portion.The reasons behind giving this restaurant a three starts are \n1- the pesone who I talked to make the reservation at 9:15 didn't mentioned that the kitchen closing at 10 ,so we got rushed and we didn't have enough time to enjoy having  our salad .\n2- The waitrest that she was taking care of us was not friendly and doest have any kind of customer service skills . I understand she might be tired but I don't think one smile would be hard to be expressed .\n3-   After we finished the dinner,we asked her to bring a cake in order celebrate my wife birthday .She said there is 2 $ fees will be charged per person .  It kind of wired , our check is 200$ and they still asking us to pay\" fees \". There no value of the 2$  in these days and if I paid it will not  affect to my budget BUT it's all about principles and customer satisfaction.
