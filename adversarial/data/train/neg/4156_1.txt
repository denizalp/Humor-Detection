This is one of those places that's hit or miss depending on when you're there.  Unfortunately there's no way to predict when it will be a hit.  The first time we were there was on a sweltering Friday evening.  The food was great, the service was good and the AC was cold.  What more could you ask for.  \nThe second visit was on a Thursday night and it was about as busy as you would expect for mid-week.  The food was still good, but the service left much to be desired.  It seemed like taking our order was low on our waitresses list of priorities.  And delivering what we ordered was even less important.  We never did get the salads we ordered and the machiotto we ordered with dessert was actually delivered after we had finished.  All I can say is the waitress is absolutely clueless.  Nice hat though.  \nOne amusing aside.  The owner was schmoozing with another table saying he had politicos coming in all the time.  The mayor, the Governor, etc.  I'm thinking 'Yeah, sure pal.\"  And in walks the Attorney General.  So I gotta give him that one.  \nThe prices are reasonable, and as long as you're not a snob the food is good, but be willing to roll the dice on the service.
