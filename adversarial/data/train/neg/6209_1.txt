KK did a good job on my lashes and was very friendly. My complaint is that I bought a goupon for a full set of mink lashes and she said the groupon only covers synthetic mink (which is just synthetic lashes) and went on to downplay the desirability of mink lashes. I bought the groupon for this salon spcifically because it was for the mink. That said, I am happy with my lashes for now (I just got them today). She offered fills for $69 for the synthetic lashes, but said she'd go down to $60 if I get them done every 2-3 weeks. I probably would have gone to her for fills if I had gotten the lashes I bought the groupon for. But I will try somewhere else and hopefully they can gradually replace them with mink.
