We've been going here since i was kid in the early 80's.  a few months ago, i ordered some mong beef for lunch and it was terrible.  i then read an article a few days ago that DPalace received an A+ on their inspection.  So, for nostalgic purposes, i took the fam there for dinner last night.  IT WAS AMAZING.  They definitely redeemed themselves from the last visit.  Dragon Palace is back in my rotation.  the only thing that i wasnt satisfied with is that they changed the recipe of their BoBo Shrimp.  the old recipe was waaay better.  Nonetheless, this a great chinese restaurant and glad to have it in our neighborhood.
