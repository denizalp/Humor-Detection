Came up with my daughter for a college visit at the University of Akron and was told we couldn't leave without getting a Galley Boy from Swensons....IT WAS DELICIOUS, service was PHENOMENAL!! The servers seriously couldn't of been any better! Great experience and amazing food! Would recommend to everyone visiting Akron!!!
