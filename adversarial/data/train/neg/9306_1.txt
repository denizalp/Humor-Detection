First off there service is fast and friendly, if your dining in there always someone walking around the dining area checking on customers they are able to grab you any extra dipping sauces, extra napkins, or even a drink refill if there not to busy. There service is impressive especially because there a fast food joint.\n\nAs far as there food I can only speak on what I've had there so far and I've been to PDQ four times in two weeks and I'm hooked on there grilled chicken strips. The grilled strips are seasoned so well I hardly dip them in the dressing. The French fries are good but I prefer the apple slices and not because the apples are amazing it's because there toffee dipping sauce that comes with the apples is straight up addicting.  \n\nIf I have any suggestions for PDQ it would be toward the lack of consistency with there sweet tea\/ lemonade. The sweet tea is hardly sweet at times and the lemonade can be a bit too sour for the kids. \n\nEither than that I'm a huge fan of PDQ it's a much better alternative to many fast food joints for busy families like my own. In reference to some other chicken finger spots here in vegas I'd say PDQ takes it.
