This was one of those hipster trendy places that make pho cool. Or shall I say hot? ;) ok bad joke. But I ordered \"The American\", super good- it's basically beef pho. It was $10 though, which is fine but I'm used to paying cheaper than 6 dollars for pho. Also, I feel like pho is known for how cheap it is and how big portions you get. \n\nThe food was really tasty.  There is a little self serve pho bar, where you get your sides like sauce, limes, bamboo, greens, etc. I like how the restaurant has their own variety of sauces to add to your pho. I did also notice that the soup didn't come with that much noodles. There was a lot of beef though! Which is a plus. The proportions didn't really even out. \n\n4 stars for the food and friendly customer service. Minus one star because of the price. \nI think all genuine pho lovers can agree with me though, pho is usually cheap!
