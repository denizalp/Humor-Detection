This is a cute little coffee shop in Montreal. When we were visiting Montreal, my sister and I woke up early for a walk to Parc La Fontaine. We've heard of this coffee shop, and we passed by it on our way to the Parc. On our way back, we ordered coffee and an open-faced bagel sandwich. It was so delicious!\n\nIt's an interesting place: very modern, with an minimalist-industrial design. Yet they serve Turkish coffee in the traditional method. Their sandwiches are also a fusion of Mediterranean\/European\/Asian flavors, while incorporating North American food items like bagels! :)\n\nI wish I were in Montreal so I could go again!
