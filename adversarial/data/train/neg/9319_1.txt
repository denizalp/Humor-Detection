Not sure why it took me so long to write a review for this little cafe since I've been coming here for years and am always extremely satisfied. \n\nYou can't go wrong with anything you order here so give it a whirl. They have sweet and savory crepes as well as pastries. Everything dish, pastry, or coffee is carefully composed and you can tell that the people working here really care about what they put out. I'll keep the review short and simply say that that if you haven't stopped in yet, you're missing out!
