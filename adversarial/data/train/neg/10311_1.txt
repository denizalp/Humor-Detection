We scheduled a flight 4 months in advance and not at a very good airfare but were told it would not go down but could go up.  It went down and Allegiant air could care less about what we were told.  The time schedule was during a popular event the PBR in Las Vegas so I am sure that is why price were high.  I am not sure how they happened to go down after we scheduled.  This company does not go out of their way one bit to help a person.  I never did get to talk to a person about the situation the cared to admit \nwe were lied to.  The number of negative reviews seems to show what most people think of this situation and airline.
