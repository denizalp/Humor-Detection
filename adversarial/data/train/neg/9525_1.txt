Visiting from out of town and this place was great! The idea of meatballs was a bit of a turn off, but the food was so fresh and delicious- definitely exceeded my expectations!! The Brussel sprouts were amazing with the chicken balls and the creamy parm sauce! Highly recommend if you are in town! Service was great and atmosphere is casual and trendy!
