One of my go-to Korean restaurants because the food here is cheaper than some other Korean places I've been to. They offer yummy pork bone soup, pork katsu, and deep fried pork dumplings! I think this place is good value for the price, and the portions of the food are filling! I felt stuffed as soon as I ate the 8th dumpling (they gave me 12pcs with a small salad). The Side dishes they offer are not bad either, I liked the tofu and potatoes they give. The atmosphere is nice and usually never quiet, since this place always has people out and about, and there is always kpop music playing in the background. Their service is OK, not the best. Sometimes I find the servers tend to forget about checking up on me. \nOther than that, I really do like coming to Pyong Won House, especially since it's right on Yonge and Finch and closely settled near the TTC station (so it's a short walk to grab a bite to eat).
