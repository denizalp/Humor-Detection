First time here! Working in the city and was looking for a good place to eat \nLooked around wasn't our first choice but the other place was closed down \nSo we turned around and came here \n\nPresentation was good! Got a seat super fast ! As soon as we sat down we a waitress was their in a second! Our drinks came fast we got wine and ceasears \nThe ceasears were good but too much ice in the glass \n\nFor an entree we got crab cakes \nAnd they were super good and hot!  Got them with in 10 mins of ordering! \n\nFor dinner I got linguini Louisiana witch was super good again it can super fast and was steaming hot had to let it cool down a bit \nOnly down fall was my shrimp tails were still  on if I didn't notice I would have been eating them!\n\nAll and all I say this place is a good pick \nI would eat their again and recommend it to friends and family  \n\nSuper fast super friendly  and good dinner
