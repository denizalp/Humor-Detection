Loved this place!  Super trendy inside and out.  The patio has a lot going on with swings for benches and a huge ass beach chair.  They provide misters so it's actually still bearable to be outside in the summertime. \n\nThe food was perfection!  I went with The Porch burger which didn't disappoint and the sweet potato fries.  They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  My date got the grilled cheese with prime rib and honestly I kind of wished that I did as well.  Not only did it look amazing it tasted like a slice of heaven! \n\nFour stars because the staff wasn't very personable.  But that's definitely not going to stop me from coming back!
