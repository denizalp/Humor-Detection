All I can say is WOW their Pancakes are delicious there Omelets are AMAZING and their prices are reasonable. First thing I always get is their Strawberry Orange Juice it is delicious and it is a must if you haven't had it, get it. This place is always busy especially on weekends but it is worth the wait they have a great outside patio where you can take in some rays and eat your breakfast too.\n\nTheir Crepes are great and so are their pancakes if you haven't had them before bring some buddies and an appetite to make sure you taste a little bit of everything. My favorite part is that they offer great choices on the menu as far as omelets but if you want to do your own thing they let you do that too.\n\nPerfect breakfast spot for the whole family moderately priced.
