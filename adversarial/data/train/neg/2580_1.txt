This place is AWESOME!!  We drive from Surprise and I can honestly say it is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley.  The nachos with the pulled pork were amazing.  A must here is the bean dip! Spicy and yummy, it does not disappoint.  Michelle was our server tonight and with as busy as it was, our glasses were never empty and she is so nice.  Best carne asada i have ever had, it was so tender and delicious.  My kids loved it.  Well worth the drive with or without the Groupon deal.  Excellent!  I would give more than 5 stars if i could!  We will definitely be back!!
