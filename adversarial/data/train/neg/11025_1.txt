The server was very friendly and attentive. I ordered miso soup, nigiri (salmon and albacore), Japanese lasagne and the Vegas roll. My favorite was the lasagne. \n\nThe issue I had was that they brought everything out separately. Miso soup was brought out followed by the lasagne. The Vegas roll wasn't brought out until I finished the lasagne, followed by the nigiri. I prefer that they come out around the same time so I try them all and switch it up.\n\nI thought there was more rice than I would have liked. \n\nEverything was fresh. \n\nThe AYCE was $19.99 for lunch.
