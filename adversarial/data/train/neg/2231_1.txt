I took my pets to Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital today. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming (from the front desk receptionist, to the vet tech, to the doctor). As soon as I completed our paperwork, a vet technician brought us into a room and began a routine check up with our dogs.  She asked lots of questions and was very thorough as she took notes about our concerns and questions. The doctor entered our room with in 5 minutes.  Dr. Kanarish spent a solid 20+ minutes with us as he conducted our dogs' check ups. He was very knowledgeable and incredibly informative (without being jargony or condescending). He was gentle and thorough while working with our dogs. The price for his work was also very reasonable and comparable to other offices. We left feeling grateful to have found such a wonderful vet and confident that our dogs are in good hands.
