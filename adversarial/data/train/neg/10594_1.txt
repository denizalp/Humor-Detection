My visit today just confirmed why we don't frequent this restaurant. Food was decent(not worth a $35 check) but service was horrible. There were maybe 8 tables including people sitting at the bar so obviously not busy. Which was okay until our server brought out our food and never returned. We needed drink refills and extra napkins but couldn't ask our server. I ended up asking another server who was busy cleaning tables and sweeping floors.our server brought the check, came back a minute later to collect but it wasn't ready yet. She never returned. We ended up leaving cash. Normally we like to leave at least 20% for a tip and typically give more, especially when service deserves it. Very disappointing.
