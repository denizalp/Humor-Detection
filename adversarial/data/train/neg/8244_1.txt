I had lunch at Yardbird. They were pretty packed, so I only was able to sit at the bar. Service here was typical: nothing memorable or exceptional, but attentive and friendly. I had the chicken sandwich, which made for a great meal as it was flavorful, juicy, and perfectly crispy. Overall, a good place to eat at.
