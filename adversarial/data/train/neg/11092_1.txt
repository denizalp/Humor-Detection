Was visitng U of I for a weekend, and my friend who'd just gotten back from Barcelona was obsessed with this type of ham called \"Iberico\". I'd never heard of it, but he insisted it was the greatest thing on earth. After a quick google search for stores in the area that had said greatest ham in the world, Cheese and Crackers popped up and we went in to check it out. \n\nI wasn't expecting much when we walked in, kind of just wanted a quick sandwich for lunch, but in the end, we all ended up having a great experience! \n\nThe staff was friendly and extremely helpful. We barely knew anything about what we were looking for, but they immediately helped figure it out for us. Turns out the ham we were looking for runs upwards of $150 \/lb, but the guys behind the counter offered to make a custom sandwich for us! \n\nWe ended up with a few more free samples of some other premium fancy meats, found some cool glass-bottled sodas, and ended up with a great meal. \n\nI've already suggested the place to my friends at U of I, and I'll be sure to visit again next time I'm back!
