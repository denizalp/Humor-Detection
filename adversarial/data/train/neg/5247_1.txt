Way better than Queen Margerita! This is my addiction when I'm craving the best quality pizza available. The key is simple recipe but super fresh, high-quality ingredients: I like them all, but  the basic marinara and margherita are my favourite for the vibrant flavours. Pizza is the main attraction but the apps are really good, the rocket salad is one of the better ones out there, and the calamari was not heavy\/oily even when I ordered it to go. Oh, and the deserts are also yummy with a bit of twist from the regular italian desserts you'd expect.
