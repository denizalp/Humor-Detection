Stopped by for a quick hair style in August during one of the record breaking heat days in SF (who wanted to do their own hair). The hair dresser was very personable and hair knowledgeable. We had great discussions about San Diego and hanging out at the beach.\n\nThe location is very clean and nicely decorated. The owners were professional, friendly and funny. The cost for a long hair style was affordable.
