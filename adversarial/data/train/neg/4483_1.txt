You should by no means go out of your way to visit the Treasure Island Buffet, however IF you are already here and don't feel like going to another resort or you got one of the 2 for 1 coupons they give hotel guests, then it's not all that bad.\n\nThe buffet does have it's highlights: the lobster ravioli from the pasta station is very good, the pizza is decadently cheesy and tasty, and the cupcakes are downright delicious, especially the red velvet cupcakes.  PRO TIP: grab an extra cupcake at the end of your visit and pretend like you are eating it on your way out, then save it for later.\n\nHonestly, there isn't anything terrible about the buffet, but I can understand how those paying full price feel like they can do better as the selection does feel limited compared to other buffets.  Our server was outstanding, even if all he did was get us drinks.
