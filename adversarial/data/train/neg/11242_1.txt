My wonderful husband took me to Roy's for our 15th wedding anniversary!  We had the most amazing time... the service was wonderful and we were treated so special!  \n\nWe opened our menus to see a beautiful personalized \"Happy Anniversary\" page inside.  They also put a pretty ring of Hawaiian flowers around our candle so everyone who came to bring us anything knew it was a special occasion.  \n\nThe food was outstanding.  We had the a great sushi roll for appetizer and the butterfish and mahi mahi dishes were both delish!  \n\nThey brought us out a cheesecake type dessert with Happy 15th Anniversary written in chocolate but we also had to order the famous chocolate souffle!  It really is worth it... one of the best desserts we have ever had!  \n\nThey also took our picture and printed it out right then for us, with a nice paper frame.  I felt like they went above and beyond to make our evening special!  I would definitely recommend Roy's for an anniversary celebration!
