I am so happy I found this place on Yelp! I lost a piece of my jewellery in my sleep (LOL) and woke up in a panic needing to find a place in the area to replace it! I walked in right at noon when they opened and was greeted by two people with energy and smiles! I was super pleased with how clean the place was and how busy it was! That's always a good sign!!! Ilana the piercer came to help me pick new jewellery and she was SUPER HELPFUL AND SO COOL! She knew exactly what she was talking about and made sure she cleaned her hands and used new gloves every time she touched me. I am so impressed with this place. If I ever need a new hole in my head, ear, body I am coming here!!!!!
