I have to agree with all the other reviewers regarding Syntech Environmental and especially JT! We spoke a couple of times prior to setting up an appointment. I discussed my concerns and needs and he suggested a plan and a test that I was in agreement with. He could have suggested another test, but explained to me that he felt it would not be necessary. JT is knowledgeable, professional and enjoyable. Everything was completed on time and even the test results came back ahead of my expectations. Regardless, I had great news regarding spore counts and with JT's help I have so much less to be concerned about regarding my remodeled condo. Thanks!
