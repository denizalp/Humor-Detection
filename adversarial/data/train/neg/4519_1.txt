I went the first week the restaurant opened, which was about 8 or 9 years ago...and did not go back until this week.  I saw it on Groupon, so thought it was a good  opportunity to try it again.\n\nFirst of all it is a beautiful room, and not very busy.\n\nIn fairness the food was 5 star, it was these odd occurrences that took it down to a three for me, and a 0 for the friend who went with me.\n\nI ordered a roasted beet salad, when it arrived it was beautiful, but I grabbed the plate and it was filthy underneath.  I am always hesitant to send something back, but I just could not eat.  I know it is easy to have dirty plates in a restaurant, so I very gently explained to the server, I saw him take it to the manager.  A different server delivered a new one about half  of the size on a smaller plate.  Then the manager hurried by and said under his breath said \"enjoy your salad\".  Well I have seen enough exposes that that really creeped me out.  So although it was delicious I was uncomfortable eating it.\n\nAlthough the restaurant was very quite, the manager never said a word to us.  No apology, no reduction in price, no acknowledgement that something had gone wrong.  My friend did not eat her dinner and I asked if she did not like it, she said the whole thing left her with such a bad feeling she could not dine comfortably, and would never go back, hence her 0 star rating.\n\nI think I would have had a much better feeling about the whole experience if the manager would have at least come and apologized.
