Terrible overall experience maybe an understatement. Here we go... My wife and I ordered at the counter and a somewhat unlikeable character took our order. He seemed bothered we had even shown up. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and regular drip coffee, my wife ordered a spinach pastry and a cookie. We paid. Received only a cookie and a table #. No coffee. Sat down at a table. Salt and pepper shakers were empty. No silverware and no one brought any over. After 5 minutes, I had to ask for my coffee. It's was brought over with no sugar, cream or spoon. Coffee was definitely water downed w hot water. Not a fresh brew. Worst coffee I've ever had. After about 10-15 minutes I received my amateur hour sandwich. The menu stated it as fresh baked bread. What I received was a panini sandwich w a microwaved egg inside. The bread was white bread with no butter heated up in a panini maker. It was a top 5 worst meal of my whole life. The topper was my wife received her spinach pasty last after about 20 minutes. When we asked for it, he said they were \"freshly making\" it. When it came out, it was clearly a microwaved pastry that was still cold in the middle. We couldn't leave this place fast enough. \nDo us all a favor and either hire a competent restaurant manager or shut this down until you figure it out. Embarrassing to have a breakfast place like this in Tukee. Never again...
