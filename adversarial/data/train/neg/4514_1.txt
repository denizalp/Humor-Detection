This is definitely vegan comfort food. It's greasy and heavy, but that's what is awesome about it. If you are craving those foods that you miss, this is the place to go. I always have to get the big wac because it completely reminds me of a big mac. It satisfies that fast food craving. This place has even pleased non-vegetarian\/vegan, picky eaters.
