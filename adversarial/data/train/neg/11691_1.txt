Have a spacious private parking lot, located close to Highway 401, spacious dining area, quick service, and most importantly, great food!\n\nI have been here twice, both for dessert and coffee, but I heard good things about their savory items. Love their cannolis, available in two sizes (large and small, with a dollar difference). Their cream puffs are okay but nothing too special about it. They also sell one-day-old pastries in a bag for a cheaper price. \n\nOverall, a solid bakery. It has been there for a while and always busy (good signs). I would recommend this place to anyone near this area for decent desserts and also Italian hot meals for a quick bite!
