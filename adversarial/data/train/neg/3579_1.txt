This place was incredible! It was definitely a highlight of my trip to Toronto this time around and I'm recommending all my friends to visit. The menu items are ALL delicious and the chef\/ owner is super friendly and helpful. I loved how creative these foods were - mix of Indian\/ Jamaican flavour with fresh ingredients. Can't wait to come back next time! Note: it's more of a take out place than sit in and they close before 230pm!
