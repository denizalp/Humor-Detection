Drinks are good on Sunday. But if you come Sunday , you will meet this rude bartender. They won't give me his name. So apparently he doesn't care about the customers. I shouldn't have tipped him. I usually only come for Dom, he's cool. I asked the new waitress , SARAH, for his name, and she didn't even know who he is. She's a hot mess.
