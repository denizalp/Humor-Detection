I ordered delivery from justeat.ca- the Chicken and the beef burritos with chopsuey. It blew my mind! The hot was spicy but so well balanced. They use scotch bonnets I think, but it's blended so well into the meat and not pockets of mouth fire. Totally recommend eating here. That being said, the delivery time was pretty long.
