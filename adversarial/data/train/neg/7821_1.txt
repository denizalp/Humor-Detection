Went to look for a mattress set and ended up at Ashley HomeStore on Decatur LV. \nSales person K.C helped us tryout a few. Decided on a Tempur Cloud Luxe Breeze. We told him we would be back in a few hours to do more research and ended up finding one for $500 less. We went back as promised to give them a chance to match the price we found, tax and delivery included. I didn't think they could do it, but they did! They not only matched it, but even came out lesser after taxes and delivery. So as a consumer We definitely was very happy and appreciative to have saved around $600 plus I got a gift card\nThank you so much Ashley HomeStore; KC, store manager for your patience and working with us.
