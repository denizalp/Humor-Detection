This is such a sweet place (yes, pun intended)!  It is so pretty and warm inside, it just really draws you in. There are tons of selections, from the mundane to the exotic, all very reasonably priced. I only got one thing- the custard bun- but it was really yummy. Picture a huge Hawaiian Sweet Roll stuffed with delicious custard filling.  And for only $1.50, I was quite happy.\n\nNext time that I'm in Chinatown, I'll be back to try more!
