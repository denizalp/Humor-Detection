I went here for for birthday. Like many have said the atmosphere\/decor is lovely. It reminds me a lot of Andrion in DT Summerlin. Service was excellent.\n\nMy 3 star score is for the awful lobster pasta dish. It was not worth $42 dollars. It sounds much better than it tastes. The pasta wasn't cooked completely and the sauce served was tasty but minimal. It was also cold when it was served to me... not sure if it's supposed to be cold but the menu didn't specify that. I just expected to have the most amazing dish for that price. They should honestly take it off the menu because I wouldn't even want it if it was $20. \n\nThe octopus appetizer was delicious. If I could do it again I would just order that twice. \n\nAll in all I would only go here if you wanted to eat at a cute place. I wouldn't go back for the food.
