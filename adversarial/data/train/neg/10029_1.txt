This studio is okay. I came here on a class pass for their reformers class. \n\nI was greeted right away by a friendly receptionist. I signed a waiver and was ready to go. I happened to peek at their membership pricing before the class. I found it to be extremely EXPENSIVE compared to  other studios in the area. I can have a Megaformers membership (see Sweat Squared or The Pilates Studio LV) for cheaper than their regular reformers class membership. Needless to say, I had high expectations going into this class.  \n\nWell, the class did not impress me. I have been to many regular reformer classes and their class was nothing new. I did not find it challenging. Maybe it was the instructor? I'm not sure. I will not be returning.
