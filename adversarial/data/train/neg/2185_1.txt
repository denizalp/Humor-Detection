My husband and I love coming here for breakfast! We always know the service is going to be awesome and the food is just amazing! There are very big portions, and every bite is a treat! I had the egg white omelette with steak, and omg so much flavor!! My husband got the Banana Foster waffles, and was such a yummy sugar treat! Our server was, Maria! She was awesome and very attentive! Our coffees and waters were never too low! \n\nHighly recommend Rise & Shine!
