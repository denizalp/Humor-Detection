Ive been a patient for over 15 years.  For the last 8 months ive had to take care of my sister with cancer and so many things have been going wrong that i wasnt able to see Dr. Vasireddy in a timely manner.  I made an appointment for today.  When i woke up this morning our apt. complex was at our door saying i had to move to another apartment cause of storm damage.  And then my phone service was also down.  I texted my family to call Dr. Vasireddy office and explain i couldnt make it in today.  And that i also was out of blood pressure meds.  My family member said they were real upset that i would dare ask for a refill for b\/p meds and not coming in for appointment.  Weve had nothing but damaging storms where i live.  I have no control over this.  Ive been a loyal patient for 15 years.   It really hurts my feelings.  For fifteen years ive always kept my appointments.  Of course there have been times when circumstances have made me call to reschedule.  My sister has cancer.  No one to help her.  I dont know,  why did they get upset.  They make me feel belittled.  and that im a bad person.  Thats really sad after 15 years with Dr. Vasireddy.
