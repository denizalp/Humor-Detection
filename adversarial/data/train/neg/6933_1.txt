I had never had Swensons before we moved to Akron, and now I know what I was missing. Everything on their menu is good, but the potato teezers are my absolute favorite. Their BLT's are wicked cheap and surprisingly good! The guys are always quick and friendly, and the sadist in me enjoys watching them run around the parking lot.
