In the past, I viewed the various exhibits, such as robotics and the submarine. During my most recent visit, I saw only a laser show in the planetarium for $8 per person. The dome screen was large. I enjoyed the comfortable seats and the lasers and music. I have visited science centers in larger cities, and this one is the best so far.
