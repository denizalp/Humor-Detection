Really great stores in the mall.  I bit on the picey side but a good upscale selection of store.  The parking lot is makes it really easy to get in and out but does require a bit of a hike to get in the stores themselves.  we went on Christmas eve 2017 and the place was hoping.  Some good quick food stops here as well.  A required stop if you are into shopping while in scottsdale area
