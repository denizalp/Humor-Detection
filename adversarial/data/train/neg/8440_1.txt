Really need to say Hawaiian Korean BBQ as people in Vegas think of something entirely different when you say \"Korean BBQ\" here. That being said, this place is more like a fast food for Korean food and that's awesome. If you've been to Hawaii, these places are abundant. Thrilled someone finally decided to open one here in Vegas!  Wife and I both had the Samdae special #21. Kalbj, meat jun, chicken and dumplings with 4 veggie sides and 2 scoops of rice. So much food and so fantastic. They might need to speed up the service a little bit but I'm not going to complain about everything being cooked to order. If it gets busy, expect a wait as we were the only ones here and it took a good 15 minutes to get our food. Again, not a complaint. But if they're going for the Hawaii Korean bbq experience, they need that speed too!  Dinner was awesome!!  Food was delicious. Cucumber kimchi, cabbage kimchi and bean sprouts were all great!  Mac salad was a little bland but really that's about the only negative I have to say about the food. Service was fine. Nothing spectacular but you don't expect that in a place like this. Seriously delicious. Will all the way be back.
