I was surprised by the very high ratings, this does not meet my expectations of a 4.5 star place. It was fine, the owners are nice, the space is just okay. It's in the old Thai Me Up space. My tacos were over-filled and my husband's enchiladas had that disappointing nuked quality...steamed to death and not a consistent temperature throughout. It's cheap and fine for a quick place, but if you are looking for a nice night out with 4.5 star quality food look elsewhere!
