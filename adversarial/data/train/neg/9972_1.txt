My recent stay here was more than I could ask for!!\n\nAfter most of my friends bailed on me at the last second on my birthday, Valarie, who was at the front desk was more than helpful and went above and beyond her job. After explaining to her my situation, she was more than happy to adjust my stay. That was just the start.\n\n After using their amazing whirlpool\/ jacuzzi tub to just relax, I went out to meet up with other friends. When I returned to the room, waiting on the counter was a bottle of champagne sitting on ice with 2 glasses, a hand written note from Valarie and a piece of chocolate cake with fruit (in the fridge). I was so surprised and happy. She wished me a happy birthday and thanked me for staying with them on such a special day. That made my weekend! \n\nAll of the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful with everything.  The room was spotless and very comfortable, accommodating and had a great view. The pool was at a perfect temperature and not busy at all. I cant wait to come back!!
