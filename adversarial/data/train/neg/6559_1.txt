I can't write about anything else but the grooming.  After reading the good reviews on here, I took my dog there about two weeks ago, and was not very pleased with the groomer, Diana.  When we first got there, she ran to the back to scream at the dogs that were back there to quiet down.  I have a Portuegese Water Dog, and she said grooming would be $65.00 because he was matted.  When I went to pick him up and inquired after regular grooming and if the price would be lower, because he would no longer be matted, she initially said no but then said we could work something out if I brought him in regular.  When I took my dog home, he ran to his water bowl, because he hadn't had any water in over four hours - which makes me question if she had even taken him out to use the bathroom.  She also told me that she had accidently cut one of his nails too short in case I noticed blood.  I understand accidents happen, but I didn't get the feeling that she actually cared about my dog.  I wll not be taking my dog back there for grooming.
