Pizza was good, but felt over priced for what you received.  The service was lackluster.  It was not busy yet our waiter did not find time to check on us throughout the meal.  We had to wait a long time for the bill.\n\nThen it was frustrating because we couldn't just hand him a credit card and pay when we finally received the check.  Instead we went to the front register and stood.  Again, the restaurant was not crowded, but it took our waiter 5 minutes to come to the register. \n\nI would rather go to Blaze pizza and receive a similar product for less than half the price.  Will not return.
