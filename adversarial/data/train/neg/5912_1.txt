I came in for a one week pass since we just moved into town. Not having a lease or id yet, I had to pay for a week tho try it out. Huge mistake! Free weights are unorganized and way out dated. The cable system needs some serious love..oh and where the hell are all the attachments? Place was packed. How the he'll are you supposed to workout with people on top is each other? No stair steppers. And how about trainers that look like they are on gear. Come on, if your promoting a healthy lifestyle, have trainers that are actually healthy. Not on juice. Think I'll go to a smaller gym, that cares.
