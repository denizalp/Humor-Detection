We went here for my birthday last night (and my twin brother's birthday). I had done a lot of research and thought this was our best bet for a Mexican place on the strip.... maybe... but there has got to be something better. \n\nWe started off with free chips and salsa (decent, green one was my favorite). Then, our server  asks if we'd like guacamole for the table ($10). We agreed thinking that it would be a big bowl of guacamole. Boy were we wrong. The guac arrived on a small plate and wasn't even enough to eat with chips and our meals. \n\nAs for drinks, don't get the pitcher of margaritas. You're better off drinking before or after you come here because WHAT A RIP OFF!!!! We got a pitcher ($50) and it was very small and filled more than half way with ice!!! There was only enough for one round of margaritas for the four of us, plus 2 more glasses we had to split... sorry but in a $50 pitcher we should be able to refill our glasses once with no problems. \n\nThen came the food... I ordered the market vegetable quesadillas because I'm vegetarian and that was pretty much the only option besides the mushroom dish. I also asked for a side of black beans and rice, but I was told there was only black bean puree... um.. how do you get the puree if you don't have the beans? The quesadillas were gross and super soggy. The cheese was this thick white stuff (cojita? I think). Anyways, gross. I make better quesadillas myself. The rice tasted stale and the beans were weird  since I wanted real beans and not mush. \nThey did bring us free birthday desserts, which was nice. Overall, this place is HORRIBLE.
