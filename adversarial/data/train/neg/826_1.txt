Went to dinner with my girlfriend. Had a reservation and was sat immediately. Very cool looking place. Waiter seemed uninterested in the beginning which was a little off putting. My girlfriend got the chop salad as a appetizer, which she thoroughly enjoyed. She got the NY strip and I got the filet mignon. The char on the filet was perfect, the spinach bed it was presented on was just as tasty, the potato was... tiny. I also got the polish ____, which was refreshing. The waiter eventually warmed up. Overall a good dinner, but nothing amazing.
