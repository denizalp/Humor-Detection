The employees were nice but had an extremely hard time scheduling delivery of 2 items. We went in knowing exactly what we wanted, and it took an hour and a half for them to get everything set up correctly. Training is definitely lacking! Then 3 days later we got an email from BB that they can't deliver the TV when they said they would and changed the delivery date to when we can't be home.  I spent another hour getting the run-around on the phone from corporate before I went to RC Willey and got a TV with delivery done in 20 min on the date I wanted.   Very disappointed in our Best Buy experience..........
