These guys are awesome! We bought\/had built our house a little over a year ago. We had an eight foot gate put in but didn't think about the fact the builder would cut that opening by about 4\". We need to put our utility trailer behind the gate but of course it won't fit. This is on top of the fact that the gate was very poorly built and the slats were coming loose all the time. So we called Sunset Gates who came immediately to give us a quote. The gate looks awesome and is very solidly built. They worked with us to make sure the opening would allow the trailer to be put behind the gate. The only problem was how long it took to build the gate. They are so good and have so many new customers that it takes 4 weeks to get it built. But the VERY next business day they were out here and had the gate installed quickly. Highly recommend them.
