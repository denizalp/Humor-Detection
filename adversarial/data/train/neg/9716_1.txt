Found out about this gem through a friend. I've only tried 2 of their wraps and soups so far. The soup\/wrap combo is a good deal and good portions....I can barely finish the wrap.\n\n- curry lamp wrap (4*): I know this seems to be everyone else's favourite. It was good but a bit too spicy for me.\n\n- steak wrap (5*): soooo good. I highly recommend it!! \n\n- mushroom soup (4*); different than your usual cream of mushroom. This is not creamy and has some spices that add a kick to it. \n\n-corn chowder (5*): excellent\n\nI wish I lived closer because I would be coming here on a weekly basis especially during the winter time!
