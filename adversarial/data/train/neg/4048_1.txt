Fast food sushi -- I introduced this place to my sister and brother-in-law and they love it....interesting atmosphere with the revolving belt (great if your attention deficient), decent to good sushi, and downright cheap - I think they lowered their prices since Sarah G. reviewed (range is $1-2 a plate).  I agree not to expect fine-dining but will give you the sushi-fix at a great price.  Also with the revolving sushi - bar concept you get instant gratification (My advice is to wait until something looks really good before picking up - they have some really good stuff but also alot of mediocre sushi on the line.\nWe also noticed that a lot of Japanese frequent the place - always a good sign.
