Located in old Montreal this quaint little cafe is an excellent option for a quick breakfast pit stop. \n\nYou'll nearly certainly miss the entrance because you'll think it's the entrance to the shop right next door. But don't be fooled (like us and the couple of other people that made the U-turn after they walked right past it), they share that entrance.\n\nThe breakfast menu is limited on the weekend- just a few basics. They offer pastries, fresh fruit, eggs Benedict, a croissant TMC (which is essentially hard boiled egg, lettuce, tomato, mayo, cheese, & bacon) and the classic egg and cheese on choice of bread. \n\nMy egg and cheese was good, the croissant was perfectly flaky. My friend's TMC was delicious and her husband's eggs benedict were the subject of my admiration and envy. I would definitely go for the Benedict next time... They looked perfectly poached!\n\nMy friend ordered the \"medium latte\" which really looked like it could feed a family of 4! It was impressive and beautifully decorated with latte art. \nDespite their simple menu, they didn't skimp at all on quality or presentation. The cozy and inviting feel of the cafe earns them bonus points as well.
