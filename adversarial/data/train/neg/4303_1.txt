Well, I needed to wait 24 hours for this review. Really wanted to love this place. Waited a few months for their opening pains to pass before going. Last night was our first visit. \nFood was good. She had the classic burger and I had the 608 burger. Both were great, and food came out fast.  No issues like others. Only thing is the burgers are too big for the buns.  Larger buns please. Drinks were ok. She got a super generous pour of wine and my beer was ok, but not my first or second choice; as nearly half of the taps were out. So a pretty weak selection on a Saturday night. Prices were super reasonable.  Service, ah service. The place isn't very big for a sports bar, and was crowded, not packed but probably 75% tables filled. Looked like only one wait staff and one bartender on Saturday night with Badger football on tv.  So, tables near us were waiting and waiting. We got her attention and placed beverages and food together not knowing if she would return.  Drinks and food did come quickly but took a bit for us to get served. And those near us still waited. Another server did appear later and the two were able to handle it  well it seemed after the rush. Staff was working hard but understaffed for whatever reason.  I probably would have given a lessor rating last night so glad I waited. We'll try it again most likely in summer and on their patio.
