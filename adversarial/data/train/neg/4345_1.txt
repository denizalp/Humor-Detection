This is the most unprofessional and UNupdated n scummy hotel around.  The customer service is horrible.  General manager James Wright is so unprofessional n out of control.  When we checked in there was a blood stain on the sheet...RIDICULOUS! Asked to change it n didn't until I stood by n watched someone change it.  Asked to talk to manager... he refused to speak to us. I will never stay at this chain again.  Seriously... learn tree hospitality business.  Less than 1 star
