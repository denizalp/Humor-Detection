Hubby and I wanted to eat without spending a fortune. Not that easy to do in Las Vegas these days. Roys has a great HH, they call Aloha Hour. $6 for about 6 different appetizer choices. We tried 4 of them: beef sliders with sweet potato fries - delish!, Mahi mahi taco - so, so (really could have used some additional sauce, meat was pretty tasteless), Lobster potsticker - really really good, great sauce! and the BEST EVER - Tempura crusted Ahi roll. Seriously this thing is sinfully good!!\nWe had the 1988 cocktail and the Mai Tai, both great cocktails. This place was definitely worth the price with great service and a really luxe atmosphere. I can't wait to go back!
