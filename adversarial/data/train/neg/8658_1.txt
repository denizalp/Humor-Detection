I just moved to Las Vegas and started searching for the best pizza...so far the best pizza and wings I have found...the crust was perfect not to thin and not to thick and the sausage gave the pizza a hint of spice which was awesome...the wings were amazingly crisp and it was nice they let you add the sauce yourself which didn't make them soggy especially important when I had it delivered...wasn't able to try the zeppoles because the guy taking my order over the phone was honest and said they don't travel well for delivery...so I'll be sure to stop in for a fresh order\n\nFinally stopped in for the zeppoles and they were AWESOME!
