Absolutely love this place.  The service is top notch- newspaper when you arrive, recommendation of which row is open, a lil reminder note, cold water when you leave, and coupons!  The spot club is awesome so definitely join and leave the card in your car or just type in your receipt info at home after you sign up online.  The drivers, cashiers, are all the friendliest.  Finally, remember there's two now so get on the right bus!
