This place sits about 20 guests at once and has a really easy going vibe compared to the other ramen spots in Vegas. This is more authentic ramen with only a few toppings offered and broths. My partner and I ordered the shoyu ramen with black garlic oil, something highly recommended. They didn't have an option for spicy ramen but they did offer a sauce on the side. I think the bar atmosphere makes for a good date spot. They make fresh noodles right in front of you and braise the meat right there too. However, the ramen was just okay for price. I liked the meat especially, I just don't think I would return often for that reason but it is good for those new to ramen because it doesn't overwhelm you with options. Overall, the 3.5 stars comes from the awesome service and the quick meal. Thanks guys!
