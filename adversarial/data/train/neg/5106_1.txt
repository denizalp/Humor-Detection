One of our clients took us to Center Cut along with about 40 other people. It was a nice location in the flamingo. The aesthetics of the restaurant was off for me personally, not how I would lay out the place or type of seating. I think we had a prefix menu for the group and it was a good few options. The waitstaff for a large group could've been better, getting drink orders and food out at the same time. I didn't get offered a drink order since they missed us. Water was fine anyways. There was no background music in there so it was strange but overall a decent experience.
