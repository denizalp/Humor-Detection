NAN is amazing! I was recently scheduled to have an MRI at a location of my choice because they have my prior studies for comparison.  What a horrific experience that was... they were uncaring or unconcerned with me as the patient.  I walked out without having my exam done and extremely upset.\nWhen I let Sam Kates hear what had happened he and his entire staff got my MRI rescheduled immediately at a different location. They have been in continuous contact with me to make sure everything is ok. \nThis is what EXCELLENT HEALTHCARE is about... Thank you so very much
