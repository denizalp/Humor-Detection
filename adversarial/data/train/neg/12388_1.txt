It has been since june 20th this company picked our furniature up. And you misewel just put your stuff out front and leave it there cause your never gonna see it again. I cant believe they changed their name to xtreme. When i hired them it was executive movers. They are fraudulent. Horrible. I paid them $4,700.00. Got 20 of my 55 items i had shipped. I have a washing machine. No dryer. I have two night stands no king size bed. My schwin bike my dad got me when i was 11 a collectors item to me is gone. We took out extra insurance out for our 65 inch tvs and they are missing. I filed a complaint with bbb in nevada.\nDO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. YOU WILL REGRET IT.
