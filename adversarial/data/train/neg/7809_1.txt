At first glance, the carousel is an interesting structure.  As a Canadian, it's great to see all these iconic references.  There's a little gondola, a geese, a train, etc.  Rides are $2.\n\nThe carousel is encased in giant glass walls which can get stuffy and hot on a sunny day.  It's not a real hangout spot because there's literally nothing around.  It would be much better if there were water fountains\/vending machines around.  Also, the available 'seating' are just plastic chairs and tables.  There's not nearly enough seating for it to be a hangout, and a structure of this size should warrant some permanent park benches.  \n\nBirthday parties are available - on the few weekends we've come by there are always parties going on.  Seems to be fun for kids and quite safe in an enclosed space.
