A very decent place with good food, affordable prices and great customer service. \n\nWe ordered the penne arriabata and the manacotti. The penne was cooked well with a rich spicy sauce, as requested. The manacotti was a bit watery once you dug down into it and perhaps could have been a larger serving, mind you I went in for lunch w\/o a breakfast. \n\nThe customer service was attentive, polite and helpful - exactly how we wanted it. \n\nCertainly would recommend this place.
