I'm soo happy with my visit to The Joint! It is beautifully decorated and feels sort of like a spa. Better yet, it doesn't require appointments. I went in with lower back paint and uneven shoulders. Mandy did an initial inspection and pointed out a few other things she noticed in addition to my initial concerns. She was super friendly and knowledgeable. Did you know that your spine directly affects your central nervous system? When your spine becomes misaligned the vertebrae can pinch nerves. Each one could cause a number of symptoms--headaches, stunted hair growth, to name a few. \n\nDuring the adjustment, Mandy explained everything that was going on because she knew I was a bit nervous. It ended up being very relaxing. I feel well-balanced and less compressed now. My boyfriend is the one who urged me to try this place out after his first visit last week. He was raving about it, and he was right! It's a simple system with friendly employees who really know what they're doing. The prices aren't all that bad, either! Can't wait to go back.
