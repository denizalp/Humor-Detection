I've seen Dr. Amanda on multiple occasions and am never disappointed! She is super friendly and knowledgeable, listening well to what hurts and where. I have a lot of aches and pains from being a full-time graduate student, who spends much of her time stressing and slouching over a desk. Dr. Amanda's adjustments have been so beneficial in decreasing the amount of tension-headaches I experience and I always feel like a weight has been lifted off of my entire body when I leave her office. Highly recommend!
