I just love the Farm!! Such a beautiful place and scrumptious food options!! \n\nI would have to say this is one of the best spots to bring people from out of town to see. This is a great spot for a girls brunch or event! Came here with a group of friends and found ourselves sitting and talking for hours! Just a relaxing goof vibe kind of place. \n\nThe restaurant in the very back is the best for breakfast\/lunch!!  Great open patio!\nIt's self serve on the beverages - teas, coffee, lemonade or water. \n\nI have had the breakfast sandwich and the juevos rancheros and I cannot tell you which one was my favorite because they were both delicious in their own rights. Every menu option looks so good so its difficult to choose. \n\nServe is always friendly and attentive!
