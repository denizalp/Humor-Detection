P I Z Z A\n\nI take everyone that comes to visit Madison to Ginos so they can try their pizza. I'm not talking about the chicago style deep dish they are semi-famous for. I'm talking about the plain ol traditional crust pizza.  It's amazing. \n\nDon't overdo it on the toppings when you order your pizza, the CHEESE is the star of the show. I don't know how they do it but the foundational combination of Gino's sauce and cheese is second to none.  I've considered moving closer to downtown just for this pizza.... it's that good.
