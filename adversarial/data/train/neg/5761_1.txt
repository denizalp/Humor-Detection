We flew for the first time with Virgin America on January 17th this year and really from now on will not fly with anyone else! The planes are newer, the seats are comfortable, everyone has their own little tv in front of them with a choice to watch movies, cable or listen to music (for free!) and the staff is efficient and helpful! It is the same price as other economical airlines, however Virgin American's service is just so much better! Not just to say that they are very organized and on time! We arrived 15 mins early in Vegas and also a couple of minutes earlier in Boston as well. I flew through American Airlines, US Airways, Delta and more besides Jetblue and so far this is the service I want from now on. Really recommend it and really hope Virgin America comes up with more international flights therefore my husband and I can  just stick to them =)
