I'm so happy to have found Brothers Tailors!\n\nI initially came in because I wanted to freshen up a couple of dress slacks that I've had for a few years.  I wanted a cleaner, more trim look to the pants and they did an excellent job bringing them to a \"modern fit\".  Similarly, I have a leather jacket from Italy that I love though it became apparent to me that the sleeves were rather full --- at the time years ago, this was the typical cut.  I was concerned about finding a tailor that knew how to properly work with leather and this shop did an excellent job with slimming the sleeves!\n\nMary and Margarita were both very helpful in adjusting my clothing.  I'm happy to have found a real go-to tailor that has the skills to work on a variety of clothing!
