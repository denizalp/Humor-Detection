I bought a pair of speakers for my truck and then I sold the truck a day later. I no longer needed the speakers, so I brought them backed unopened in perfect condition with a reciept and the guy refused to refund me. He said it was their policy not to do ANY cash refunds. So I asked for store credit, and he said that he couldn't give me store credit but I could exchange the speakers. I then said, ...\"well, I don't need anything right now, maybe when I get my new vehicle\", he said \"Nope, we can't have open credit out there\"...What does that even mean?? So he sent me away with the speakers. I'll never take my business there again. What a joke of a return policy. I could understand if I didn't have a reciept, but 2 days later with a reciept...no refund,..ridiculous. \n\nI will say that I had them install my car stereo and it works good, but I just can't get past there whole attitude on returns. It's bad business.
