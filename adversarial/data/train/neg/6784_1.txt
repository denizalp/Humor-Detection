They \"replaced\" our garage door opener in April last year. This year, we had a new garage door installed. The company that put in the garage door let us know Five Star Garage Doors scammed us and that all parts on our \"brand new 8365-267 Liftmaster\" were not brand new, but original parts that were original to the 1965 opener.
