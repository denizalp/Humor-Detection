I've only been here for breakfast, but its a great family restaurant if you're looking for comfort food.  The ambiance is very classy, and so are their foods.  The prices are very reasonable, and the staff are accommodating.  I usually order their Early Bird, or NOT SO early bird breakfast.  Their pancakes are another yummy early bird thing to order.....nonetheless a family dive you can always go to where everybody knows your name...like CHEERS...
