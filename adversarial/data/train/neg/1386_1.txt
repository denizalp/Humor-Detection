In following with my byob mood, tried this polished and charming venue in Verdun on a Friday night and can honestly say that this resto was a hit! The refined plates were beautifully presented, and the market fresh selection of Quebec foods was delectable and delicious! The service was attentive and the vibe was casual and lively; surely on my go to list for a relaxed evening with friends!
