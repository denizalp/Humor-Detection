I just discovered this little gem hidden away in Avon, OH. You can sit on the bar side or opt for the restaurant side which is quiet and comfortable. Typical bar and grill eats with some extras thrown in. Wings are delicious and they have 3 wing special nights a week! Nice variety of mixed drinks and PLENTY of brews to choose from. Nice prices too. My family will definitely be regular customers!
