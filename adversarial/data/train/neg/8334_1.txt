A definite MUST for the true Ramen lover! \n\nSure we all have our affinities, but Ramen Hashi's Tori Paitan is a unique flavor that's worth trying. It's one of those 'what am I tasting' in a good way moment as soon as the broth hits your pallate. \n\nAlso, way they cut their green onion topping is excellent. Not the typical cross-stitch cut of the stalks, but a more lengthy diagonal cuts add to the richness of the Ramen experience. \n\nLastly, they make their own noodles fresh!! Whaaaaaaaat?! YES!! Need I say more?
