TERRIBLE!! Food was overpriced for what it was. Service was almost nonexistent. They messed up 1 order & took 20 minutes to bring the right one, dirty glasses as shown in the photo, I even had to go to the bar to get my drinks because it was faster than our waitress. To close it all out I am writing my first Yelp review while waiting for my check for over 25 minutes. Never coming back!
