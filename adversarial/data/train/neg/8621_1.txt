If you use Haines and Krieger,you will never see a real attorney,just office folks,they handled my Chapter 13 okay,but they didn't do anything too get my home that I wanted too keep refinanced too a fixed mortgage in  the 2 years I was paying them,all they ever did was have me resubmit my paperwork over and over and over,a complete waste of time.Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.
