After flying into town and finding my sweet pup in dire need of a trim I came to Green Bulldog Dog Wash. The place was calm, clean and amazingly tranquil  Jessica was our poochie stylist and she was great! The only thing that made me give a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating is that I was quoted a much lower price over the phone. The owners husband had said ball park $35 (which I found amazing) so I was a little surprised to hear the $50 price when ready to pay. Not too \"ballpark\" to me unless you're talking home runs but still a nice cut. I was happy with the service just disappointed I didn't get the stellar deal that had been mentioned.
