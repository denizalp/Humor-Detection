I am a camper and backpacker that just needed a place to stay at the end of my trip.  I had my own sleeping bag and pillow so I thought \"no big deal, just some mixed reviews.\" Ohh was I wrong.  \nA very nice girl checked me in and explained how to find my room.  I then looked around.  It was clean.  I knew there would be a lot of road noise, hello, look at a map, you are in the airport district.  \nThe part that I can't not get over is; I could hear my neighbors conversation clearly, the kids across the hallway jumping on the bed and clearly there parents the room kiddy corner with a child who cried through the night. This was not just a little noise.  We could hold conversations though these walls.  I think that is why they leave TVs on in the rooms.  I could also listen to the weather channel echoing though the whole hotel blaring out of the empty rooms. They should turn the TVs off, it does not help their noise problem.
