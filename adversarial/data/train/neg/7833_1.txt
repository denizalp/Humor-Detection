Jen is one of the most friendly server we have ever had. I have been here once before, and we came back because we loved the food. This time, we really loved our service. Everyone was so friendly and fun, and really made this trip for my Texas cousins even better. She even saw us struggling to take a group photo, and offered to take it for us. We will be back!
