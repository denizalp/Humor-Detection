Third time eating here and third time I was satisfied with the meal.  \n \nGood quality meal.  Steak was cooked perfect and the sides were also very good.  \n\nThis a great place to enjoy a meal with friends and family and take a break from the casino.   \n\nI always enjoy the food here and the service is always top notch.   The oysters were very good! \n\nEnjoy!
