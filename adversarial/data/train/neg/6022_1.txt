My puppy Kobe (half French and Boston Terrier) absolutely LOVES Adventure Pet Resort. I know this because he never really wants to leave and by the time he gets in the car, the little boy is passed OUT! \n\nI work 5 days a week during the day so I was looking for essentially a \"daycare\" for my puppy to socialize more with other dogs a few days a week so that he wouldn't be alone at home while I'm at work. Some people may think the idea of a doggy daycare sounds ridiculous- but this is probably one of the best things you could do for your dog. \n\nAdventure Pet Resort is a phenomenon and I hope to see more locations open in the foreseeable future. The facility is very clean and they have a large indoor dog play area (visible to the public) and that is filled with toys. a few ball pits, a grassy area as well as two play huts! For safety reasons, APR requires a temperament test before being allowed in the daycare. This helps to evaluate the overall behavior of your dog so that it protects other dogs from being potentially harmed from aggression. You can even bring your dog's food and designate a time for them to feed them. This also goes with medication that your dog may need!\n\nAll the staff have some sort of dog training background and are very friendly. The owner\/manager Jason is also very kind and helpful. \n\nThe daycare rates are very reasonable. I would highly recommend Adventure Pet Resort to anyone looking for an outstanding and reliable daycare\/boading! Especially if you have a busy lifestyle and would like to make a difference in your dog's life!
