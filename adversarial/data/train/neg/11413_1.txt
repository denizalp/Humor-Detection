From the outside you may think twice but you'd be making a mistake to miss going into Bocho. \nDifferently some of the best sushi I've had, also try the cucumber salad and the seaweed salad both with delicious fresh flavors.\nStep out and don't get caught in a rut of commercial looking restaurants, you'll be surprised.
