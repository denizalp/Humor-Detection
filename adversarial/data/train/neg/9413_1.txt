Service was indifferent. I got chicken tenders, which were anything but tender.\n\n I asked for an extra barbecue sauce. By the time I was delivered the sauce, I was almost done eating. One of the three chicken tenders, one was good but the other two were burnt. \n\nThe beer on tap was good. That's the only redeeming quality of this place , which time I will specifically avoid the next time I am in this airport.
