Enjoyed everything we had except the albondigas (only ok) but my food mate loved 'em & wants to come back for more.  We shared everything & I ended up taking the paella home which my 13 yr old son gobbled down ravenously despite never having had it before.  I thought the seafood paella a bit salty but I am used to very little salt in gen'l & it's ~$14 .  There's also a chicken or vegetarian.  Chris, our waiter, recommended the red sangria $6, which was very tasty.  Cost was ~$60\/2 without feeling even remotely stuffed for ~5 dishes + 1 sangria.
