They have a great burrito, except that during lunch times, the employees don't give a shit about you. They just want to get your order out of the way as fast as possible; whether you get what you want or not is not their concern.\n\nThe lady didn't even ask me what toppings I wanted and just went through with the burrito. It was still good, but I would've liked to have guac\n\nRegardless, 3 stars cuz the burrito is delicious, and filling. \n\nFood -4\nService -2\nVenue -3\nVibe -3
