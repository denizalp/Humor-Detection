On my last visit here I ordered a green juice...specifically the greenie. First off the guy at the counter made me extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome. He really made the experience not worth while at all. However another guy helped me out and got my juice started while the cashier guy was being unfriendly to yet another customer. I usually like this kind of juice because it always makes me energized and I know it is healthy. As soon as I got it I was excited to try it and see if it was better than the other ones I have tried. I was extremely disappointed. This tasted DISGUSTING. It had no appetizing taste at all when even on the menu it said that apples are added to at least sweeten the gosh darn thing. I only drank about a quarter of a small one and the whole time I kept wanting to throw up and I couldn't swallow it. I felt like I had wasted my money and not even had that great of service. I like the one by Scottsdale Quarter better. The workers are always friendly and make my drinks actually appetizing and make me not feel like I wasted my money. They aren't cheap either so this really was a unsatisfactory visit.
