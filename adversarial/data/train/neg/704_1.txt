Just purchased a home that had a Hale pet  door installed!  Talked to rep at the Home Show and scheduled appt for replacement of flaps and cover.  They came to our home the following week and the work was done within an hour!  The guy arrived on time and began working right away!  Great pricing and Great Service!
