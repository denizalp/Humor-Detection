Considering that it's vegas..and I'm not quite sure how far the closest dimsum places are...this was actually not bad.  We were a group of 9 and it was around 1pm.  There wasn't much of a wait, but there was a full house.  There are a few parts to the dining space, a bit cramped at times.  The dimsum was pretty decent and we ordered other dishes such as fried rice (for those that weren't accustomed to some dimsum items), kung pao chicken, beef chow fun....etc.  The dishes weren't too bad, but some were on the salty side.  The most difficult part of dining here would probably be the service.  Sure, the carts came and went as expected.  But near the end of the meal, we just wanted that dang egg tart cart to swing by.  We asked the waiter for it twice..and he said he would let them know. But it just took much longer than it should have.
