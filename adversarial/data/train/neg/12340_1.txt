Where oh where has the old Sweet Tomatoes gone? I see one positive review out of 12 below. That has to tell you something. I'm OK with change so don't get me wrong. But in the restaurant industry, change should be driven by your customer input and by competition. I can't imagine customers asking for this and certainly competition didn't drive this change since the old concept had the place packed all the time!\n\nThe clock is ticking Sweet......er......Field Kitchen?? We went this evening and it was a ghost town. I've never seen this restaurant so slow. The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. If I want ribs, sorry, but I'm going somewhere that specializes in ribs like Dave's, Texas Roadhouse, or Dillons. The chicken reminded us of Boston Market, nothing special. And forget about the Alfredo and noodles. Stick with Cucina or even Olive Garden for that. \n\nIt's a shame, we used to hit Sweet Tomatoes at least once a month and happily paid our $50-$60 for a family of 4. Sadly this was our last trip there. Let's be honest, the food wasn't exactly out of this world before this new concept, except for the cobbler of course, but the experience was. And that's been taken away. It's just another subpar restaurant now and I'm afraid it won't be long before the doors shut unless some of the old concept and food is brought back. \n\nAs for kids? Don't bother bringing them. Especially if they really liked the old concept. It's a real bummer for them. Our kids loved being able to get up and get what they wanted when they wanted it. That was the draw here for them (and of course the original Mac & cheese, focaccia bread, and chocolate lava cake). All of it gone. \n\nThe only update\/change this restaurant needed was maybe some new carpet and tables. Not an entire concept change.\n\nAll I can say is good luck.
