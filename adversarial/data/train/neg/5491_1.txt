Luna's is a great place for a non-vegan to try something new. I've had three different good items and a couple different types of smoothies in the times I've been heat and liked everything I tried. Every time I bring someone new to Luna's, they are shocked by how much thy like it. Literally never heard a bad thing about this place. Also, the smoothies are surprisingly filling!
