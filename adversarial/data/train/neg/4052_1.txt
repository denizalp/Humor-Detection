To say it's among the best in Madison would be an understatement. I can say that after one trip if they're at all consistent.\n\nFriends and family have been recommending this place for longer than I can remember. Although I'm in Madison a lot, I only recently got a chance to check it out. I can definitely say I'll make a better effort to get back because this place has earned its good reputation.\n\nI'm into spicy food, so I ordered the shrimp etoufée, advertised on the menu as \"very, very hot.\" I thought it was just right; the etoufée was hot enough to get the nose running a little bit without being overwhelming. The flavor was intense without feeling like you're being kicked in the mouth.\n\nI can't wait to try the rest of their menu.
