Went for dinner with a group of 10 last night.  Solstice comfortably hosted our group with lots of space for others.  The host and waitress were very welcoming and answered all questions including recommendations.  I had the veal parmigiano,  which was not the best I have had but was pretty good.  I probably will not return to Solstice as it was a fine restaurant but did not provide anything to draw me back.
