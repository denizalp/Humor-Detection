My experience was just like everyone else's; fantastic! I came in around 10am needing for my husband's pants to be hemmed up and I needed it to be done same day. No questions asked she did it. She was so focused on quality and gave me a couple of \"warnings\" about hemming pants without my husband being there for her to measure. I sincerely appreciated this and decided to take the chance anyway. She did an wonderful job and was very reasonable. \n\nShe runs a great shop and if you are needing any type of tailoring or alteration, you need to go see Maria.
