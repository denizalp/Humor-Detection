Let's just say this place is sooo scrumptious! Their Bobo Brazil is my favorite! Mmm savory seared kobe beef in a roll can't get better than that. Definitely recommend their spicy tuna roll as well. I love the uniqueness of their hybrid menu it's different in a good way. Their service is also really good. Well, except for this one cocky waiter. He introduced himself at our table as, \"the best and most wanted waiter in Vegas\".... seriously?
