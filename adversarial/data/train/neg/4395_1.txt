Louis Vuitton is supposed to be the ultimate bag to own. I spent over $2100 on a bag a little over two years ago from the scottsdale fashion square location. Within 6 months the corners were completely cracking but I loved the bag so did not make a fuss.. after carrying the bag for 2 years I took it in to have a new lining put in it. I was quoted almost $400 but I felt the bag was worth investing in.. it took them 7 weeks to tell me they would not repair the lining due to the small cracks  that were on the corners of my well loved, expensive bag. \nExtremely disappointing that they would not stand behind the bag. I guess that Louis is absolutely not what they are cracked up to be. Like a beautiful girl who does not wear deodorant. Pretty but stinky!
