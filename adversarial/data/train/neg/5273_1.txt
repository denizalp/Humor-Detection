My first time here and I enjoyed it.  Went for a late night dinner with some friends and it wasn't crowded at all.  Seated as soon as we walked in and the waitresses were at our table in no time to take orders.  \n\n   I ordered the Hot Pastrami Deli-Style Sandwhich with fries.  First of all the portions they give you for the price is huge!! The sandwhich was 2 layers with mustard and mayo on rye bread that didnt interfere with the taste of the delicious pastrami at all.  The fries were also good, crispy and hot.  \n\n  Employees were very attentive and overall the customer service was great.  Definitely got my money's worth from this place.
