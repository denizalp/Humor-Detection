Solid pizza. They had a 6.99 medium 1 topping pizza deal so tried this place out. Comes with 8 slices. When you think of your average pizza, I think this would match that. I kind of wish they had more pizza sauce on the slices, and I chose meatball as my topping - not going to lie it wasn't seasoned very well. I think you can flavor your crusts and choose a side sauce for free? Nice bonus, I picked garlic butter and pizza sauce. Unfortunately, I couldn't really taste the garlic butter on my crust.\n\nThe restaurant itself is clean and spacious, and the employee that helped me out was pretty nice. I ordered ahead of time and I was about 10 mins late to when the pizza was scheduled to be ready. Add 7 min drive home, and the pizza was already warm by then. I'll give Marco's the benefit of the doubt on that.
