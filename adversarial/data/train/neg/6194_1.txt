Tripping through Boulder City we looked at Yelp and voila' the City Grill popped up first. After being guided into a parking space, we ordered the signature burger...1\/3 pound of Kobe beef, sweet potato fries (yum)... Ate out back on the patio.. They even brought our dog a bowl of water. Nice family place.
