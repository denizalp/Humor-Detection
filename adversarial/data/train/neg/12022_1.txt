Nice to find a spot so close to Pl. Cartier that isn't rammed with tourists, especially if you head downstairs. Nice mix of patrons, great service by a mix of staff at the bar, good selection of beers. Only dinged it a star because we walked past the grill upstairs and the sausages looked very burned...but no biggy, would be nice and cozy in the winter I imagine. Go for a few beers, stayed for a few too many!
