My normal massage place was closed so after debating, I stumbled upon this place.\n\nI got the 90 minute reflexology and Swedish massage. It was a little awkward for the reflexology because most places have you lie down, but I was half sitting so I couldn't really relax. \n\nBut once I transferred to the massage table, I felt like the masseur found every little knot in my back and shoulders. \n\nI like my old place but this place is definitely making me reconsider where I go for massages.
