Best feature: The Vibe\n\nAlright, so I'm a Barista at another coffee shop and I've decided to review every coffee place except my own.  That being said, Steve's espresso is one of my favorite's at the moment.  Actually, it's kinda becoming my standard first date place(I think the Baristas are giving me the \"I know what's up\" look).\n\nTheir lattes are great; smooth and palpable.  At night (where most of my experience lays, ha) they play these sleepy grooves that you just barely notice.  The art on the wall is Arizona twilight meets shiny 8th grader art project - I love it.  \n\nThe Barista that I usually get is pretty cool.  He's really quiet and a great shot puller!  I think his name is Drew.
