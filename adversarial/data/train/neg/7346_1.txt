I'm new to Las Vegas & recently bought a condo with my Fianc√©. We decided to check out RC Willey just to look. Now that's a funny one cause we spent 3 hours & $7,000.00. We found the perfect reclining sofa, end tables, cocktail table, washer & dryer, dishwasher, electric oven, refrigerator all in stainless plus some other goodies. Mike our sales guy was extremely helpful as was John in appliances. We will be back for sure. Love this store & we didn't pay sales tax the day we went. How perfect is that?
