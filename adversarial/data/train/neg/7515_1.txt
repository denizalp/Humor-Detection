This place is slow and not worth the wait. It took close to 40 mins for scrambled eggs, hash browns, and ham with the place being 20 percent full. The scrambled eggs were browned and the hashbrowns bland. It kind of felt like the kids were making mother's day breakfast. Plus- it was very clean and the waitress friendly but i won't be back!
