So, I went for the screening of This Is 40 ( which is a whole other review in itself). The place is located in a lovely plaza but the buck stops there. The seats are leather and cracked...for $7 for a bag of popcorn, I expect better. The sound quality was very low, so it was hard to hear if people laughed or clapped and the visual quality was off as well; I expected it to be crisp and clear. Granted, the seats were comfy, like that old recliner you've had for years but, again, for the inflated prices they can do much better.
