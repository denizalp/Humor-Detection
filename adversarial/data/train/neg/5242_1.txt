Fantastic food, very reasonable prices, slightly spotty service.\n\nI have nothing but good things to say about the food. From the hot and sour soup to the chicken with ginger, it was all delicious. The portions were huge, and the food was of the highest quality.\n\nThis would've easily been five stars except for the service. Despite not being very busy, I was seated at one end of a six-person table that had a couple (apparently on a first date) sitting on the other side. Awkward. \n\nWhen I went to pay my check ($15), the owner refused to accept my debit card, despite a sign that stated \"credit card minimum: $30, debit card minimum: $5\". He insisted that my debit card was a credit card because of the Visa logo and would not be swayed, not even by me pointing out the word \"DEBIT\" printed on the card. When I paid with $20 cash, he would not give me $1 bills so that I could leave a proper tip. \n\nQuirky service happens. The food is too good to not go back. Next time I'll bring small bills.
