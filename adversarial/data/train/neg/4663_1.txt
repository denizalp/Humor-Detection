AWESOME!   Dr. Yach & Dr. Macy ROCK!\nAlicia is my persian cat's (Tuff Girls) Godmother!\nShe is such a great lady...  \n\nDr.Yach & Macy added so much time on our other Cats( Waynes)  life.\nWe took Wayne to All about Cats and they misdiagosed something on his chin that they called acne...it was cancer. By the time they agreed that it was not cancer it had grown so big. Poor Wayne. I am not here to bash All About cats but please do your homework and get a second opinion from other Doctors. RIP WAYNE 1992-2010
