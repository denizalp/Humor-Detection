This place rocks.  I did not know this location was even open.  I always went to the location down town.  This trip was good.  I had a egg white omelet and their delicious bacon.  The omelet was good and fresh.  The toast was nice and thick too.  The spread they brought for the toast was excellent too.  The best part of that meal was the bacon.  It was good and crispy.  Great place to eat.
