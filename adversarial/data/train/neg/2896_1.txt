I've been here a couple of times now.  I'm definitely a fan of sweet crepes, and this place delivers.  The crepes are soft, delicate, and very thin, which I think is more \"authentic\".  They taste great - I've had bruleed sugar, nutella\/bananas, and vanilla custard crepes, and was never disappointed.  The coffee is fantastic.  I love the latte art - always seems to make the drink taste even better.  Speaking of which, the food arrangements are always spectacular, which adds to the gourmet feel of the place.  It's definitely pricier than I would like.  A single bruleed sugar crepe (the cheapest on the menu) and a coffee drink ended up costing about $10.  Try not to get too addicted, but it's definitely great for a special occasion.
