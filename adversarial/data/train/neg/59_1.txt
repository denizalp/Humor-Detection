Among my favorite restaurants in the #CLE, Felice never fails. Last year we dined al fresco, alongside Felice's fresh farm-to-table vegetable and spice garden. I had the Vegan Tacos, which were a flavorful feast. Upon our return this fall, we had the Vegan Tasting Plate with homemade hummus and an assortment of colorful pickled vegetables and pita wedges. For an entree, I selected the Linguini Arrabbiata, which had just the right amount of spice -- savory but not overpowering. Will definitely be back!
