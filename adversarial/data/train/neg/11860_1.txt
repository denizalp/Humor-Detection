Great westside library. Smaller than others in Madison and could have larger children's section with more hands on activities. But friendly staff and usually clean and inviting.\n\nThey have a wonderful children program here. The main lady who does most of the classes is awesome, Clarissa I think is her name. I've taken my son and children that I have nannied for to the storytime and art classes, very fun and interactive.
