A nice surprise as I'm not a diner person. We stopped by on recommendation of a friend after a hockey game. The pumpkin pancakes were delicious, as were the west coast eggs Benedict. Beware, though - the eggs Benedict are not served in typical fashion. It is the size of the plate and served with potatoes. The toppings were placed on top of several slices of (good) Italian bread. \n\nSome reviewers mention the servers. Yes - a bit short, however, expected with as busy as they are. Our waitress was short, but extremely nice, attentive and we had great customer service. I think they just want to turn tables since there are so many people waiting in such a small space. \n\nExpect a wait - put your name on the list & expect a minimum wait of 30 minutes. We took our hockey team and they were very accommodating in separating and seating us at several tables when they were available.
