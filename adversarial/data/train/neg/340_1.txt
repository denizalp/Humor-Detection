The Fuego Tacos location in the Biltmore area is in a great area for me.  I have only been to Fuego once and it was during happy hour.  All the reviews I had read said to make sure you go to Fuego at happy hour to get the good deals so you are able to try a variety of dishes.  And coincidentally enough, that's what happened!\n\nInstead of ordering one dish, I was able to order 4 (smaller portions) and try everything.  I really enjoyed the pulled pork.  This is more of a bar\/restaurant to come to after work for a nice margarita.  I will definitely come back and try some more dishes.
