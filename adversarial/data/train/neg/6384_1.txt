Excellent! I love this place. \n\nI had no idea what to expect when I first walked into Jung's. I was wide-eyed and naive...trying to plant a veggie garden for the first time. The gals at the front pointed my boyfriend and I toward the back where we could find what we were looking for. Afterward, we had so many questions!! The gal at the front happily told us everything we could possibly want to know about growing a vegetable garden. She also gave us some good tips on how to get these growing healthy and strong. I definitely give this place two thumbs up!! :)
