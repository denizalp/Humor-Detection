I went there at Sunday around 2-3 pm, waiting line for 2 was 30 min, but hostess call us in 15 minutes. The place are really small, but cool! A \"table\" where we were sitting was such small...The service was good, nice and friendly!\nFood...pictures looks nice and in reality it looks the same. We tried 2 different, probably, it was kind of soup, I attached pictures, and I am sorry but I didn't like it at all, especially noodles...Maybe it's not my style of food.
