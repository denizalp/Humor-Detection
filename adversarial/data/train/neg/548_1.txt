I just helped my Son and his Girlfriend move from Houston to Camden Sotelo in Tempe. What a beautiful Apartment Community! The fitness center will work just fine when you can't make it to the local LA Fitness. The pool and grill area is beautiful...resort like. The apartments are ridiculously spacious! My Son and his Girlfriend's 2 bedroom apartment is just shy of 1500 square feet! To top that off, they have 2 reserved, underground parking spots. The Leasing Staff and Maintenance Staff were very friendly and accommodating. They really took great care of my kids. Thank you Miranda, Liz, and Justin!
