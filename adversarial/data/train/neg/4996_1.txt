I ate there for the first time today for lunch.  Special was a ten inch with three toppings and a drink for 6.95 which sounded great.  What I got was a ten inch with with too much cheese and one piece of beef, one piece of sausage, and one piece of an onion.  I guess when you add that up it comes to three toppings.  Doubt I'll be going back or recommending.  Too bad.
