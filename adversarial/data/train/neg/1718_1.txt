got the sultana kebab. it tasted amazing and was around 14.25 which would be worth it but my stomach did not agree with it. perhaps it was not cooked or had gone bad not sure. it tasted great going down though. I am going to try the persian place next door next time or go somewhere like knuckle sandwich. the wait is a little long even if there are only 4-5 people ahead of you. I think I have eaten here multiple times and not gotten sick. perhaps it was just a bad batch or it was too hot for the meat.
