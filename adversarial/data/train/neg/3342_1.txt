This is the worst airline I have ever traveled on.  By the time they get you for all the hidden charges I might as well have paid the extra $200 to fly Aloha Airlines to Hawaii.  \n\nThe seats do not recline.  I purchased a reserved seat and the seating chart I was directed to on the Allegiant website was not even the same as the aircraft I was flying on.  So I ended up paying for a seat that I didn't want and was not allowed to change it.\n\nWhen I left Las Vegas I checked my bag with no problem.  I did not purchase a single item in Hawaii and therefore my bag was exactly the same weight as when I left, however this time they hit me for another $50.00 saying my bag was over weight. Really?? There response was to send me away and tell me to starting emptying things out of my checked bag.  And do what with it?  Dump it?\n\nOnce I was on the plane I realized the seat cover on my seat was falling off.  The flight attendants response was, \"I'm sorry we have a full flight, you will have to deal with it.\"\n\nThe snacks are totally over priced ... $3 for a packet of M&Ms, $7.00 for a Heineken.  The online booklet lists special \"Combo packs\" and when you try and purchase them, the flight attendants tell you, \"It's not on our menu so you'll have to pay full price for it.\" Oh yeah ... don't bother taking cash, they don't accept it on the plane.\n\nOnce you get to your destination they can't even tell you where your luggage is.  I was sent from one end of Honolulu Airport to the other and back again before they finally decided which carousel our luggage was on.  It was the last thing I wanted to do after a 5 hour flight.\n\nTo sum this up, don't waste your money.  I ended up paying more for this flight than I would have flying Aloha Airlines or some of the other major carriers.  I will never ever waste my time with this carrier again.
