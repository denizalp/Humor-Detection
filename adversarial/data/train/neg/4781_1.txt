I've always gone to Jeromes, through many stylists, now I have a regular one. I have always thought their work has been the best in Calgary. Others disagree with me, but I've stayed true to Jeromes. It's expensive, and sometimes it's not been up to par, but I still go because my hair looks amazing most of the time and I account it to the highlights, colour and cuts I get in that salon. They seem to keep up with trends, are knowledgeable and its a luxurious treat to go to Jeromes. Love it.
