I've been here twice and didn't dare to post any reviews until I've been here at least twice because sushi places in Toronto always disappoints me on my second visit.\n\nI had a moment of disbelief that Toronto can get this kind of quality of sushi. If you yearn for Sushi Nakazawa in NYC(Jiro's Disciple), this is as close as you can get to that in Toronto.\n\nIt's a bit silly to compare this with Sushi Kaji because the two serves a completely different kind of japanese cuisine. Sushi Kaji serves kaiseki style meal. Yasu, on the other hand, serves just straight up sushi. The chef fold the sushi in front of you and serves it one by one. This is the kind of thing you'd expect from real sushi restaurants in Japan, not the kaiten sushi(conveyor belt sushi) or AYCE chinese sushi.\n\nService is typical of real japanese restaurants, which are run and owned by japanese. The kind of service where your server offers hot towel before meal with both hand and so on.\n\nThe fish here depends on what's on season. On my second visit, at the end of the meal, the waitress let us know that they have a special hokkaido uni and shirako from japan. Always get their special! The hokkaido uni is a completely different beast from the BC uni that were served earlier. BC uni has this bitter after taste to it, while the hokkaido ones are extremely buttery with a yolk-like after taste. Definitely worth it!
