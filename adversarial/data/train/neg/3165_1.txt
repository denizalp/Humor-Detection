Mmmm fresh!!! Sure every restaurant has it's flaws, but this locations pluses out way their flaws.  The main hostess is always great!!! Very friendly and knowledgable just what you want from the person taking care of business and your dinner. \n\nThe menu is reliably delicious, the specials seem deliciously creative. We come about 3 times a month (almost every Wednesday!) they usually chance the specials once a month from what I've noticed.\n\nI won't lie, it's almost always busy, so if you're in a rush come early for dinner or late for lunch! Furthermore dinning here can seem like a fast food restaurant by the speed of the wait staff removing your plates and the amount of people that are in and out of here! (Fast turnover!!!) \n\nBut the heart wants what the heart wants!!!\nReasonably priced and delicious veggies!! Yum!!
