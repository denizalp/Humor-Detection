You can't ever go wrong with this place! I don't care what any of the bad reviews say. It might of just been a bad experience and now chipotle gets a bad review. The food here is fresh, tasty, and plentiful.\n\nI love that they have brown rice, and healthy alternatives. \nEverything here is good so picking one item is difficult. I personally usually get the burrito with pinto beans (black beans are available though), chicken or steak, brown rice, and cheese! \n\nYum!
