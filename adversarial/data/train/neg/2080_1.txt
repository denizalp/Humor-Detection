We always make a point of eating here when we are in Vegas. The food never disappoints! We love ordering small plates instead of dinners. The food here has so much flavor that you just want to try one of everything! A huge shout out to our fabulous server Vanessa! By far one of the best! She recommended so many amazing dishes and we were never disappointed.
