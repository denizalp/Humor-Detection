On Friday evening we made our first stop at Laundry and Filles' food truck. On the menu was a Caesar Salad made with asparagus, Ploye au Saumon, meatloaf sandwich, fresh apple juice and for dessert a peanut butter and jelly whoopie pie. Off course we tried it all. If was all excellent, but my favorite was the Caesar salad. We've all had a Caesar Salad before, but never had I had one that was based on asparagus instead of romaine lettuce. What an interesting and tasty idea!\n\nThe owners are from the maritimes and prepare their menu around traditional, homely themes. For example a ploye, something that I had never come across before, is a popular dish in New Brunswick made with a half cooked (they don't flip it over on the griddle) crepe.
