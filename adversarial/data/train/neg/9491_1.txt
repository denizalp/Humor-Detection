Veronica was our server and even though the place was packed (as it always is cuz who doesn't love Egg Works) she was extremely attentive and friendly. Servers that always have a genuine smile on their face are hard to find, and Egg Works seems to have found the best of them. If you get Veronica's section know you will be in very good hands! \nDelicious breakfast as always.
