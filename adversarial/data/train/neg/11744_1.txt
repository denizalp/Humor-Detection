They get a 3 for nostalgia. I can almost remember coming here when they were across from the Horseshoe, further East on Queen. I say ALMOST because I drank a lot of tequila here in the 90's and the Horseshoe was my go- to after wards.\n\nThe patio is a great place to chill and Thursday is Margarita night. A marg for under 4 bucks-- I'm in! They also play kick ass tunes. Sadly, their bar mix is pretty gross--not even the tequila can help it. It's far too sweet but also had this incredibly sour backbite that actually burns my throat. Sorry, guys... but if I'm drinking a Marg, my throat had better be burning from the booze-- not the mix.\n\nThe food is pretty gross. But everyone knows that when you're drinking, gross can be just what you want. I do admire their business model, though: Keep your clientele loaded and they'll stick around for food and probably not care what they're eating. Then they can blame their scoots on the booze!\n\nNo culinary awards here, but it's a Toronto Institution that I must pay homage to and frequent every once in a while...for old time's sake!
