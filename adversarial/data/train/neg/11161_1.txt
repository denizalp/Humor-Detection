Go for dessert; eat your meal somewhere else!\n\nThe food is overpriced, and the portions are just crazy large.  I always leave feeling stuffed, but guilty because of the huge bill and the huge amount of food that was either thrown away or in a to-go box (which usually ends up...thrown away).  I can almost never get to dessert.  \n\nOne good thing is the appetizer menu - I could make a meal out of most stuff on there and not feel quite as stuffed.  The fried mac and cheese is good, and so are the pot stickers.\n\nWorth going to say that you've been, but save it for when you've been starving yourself.
