Buyer beware! Both my daughter and I went in as first time spay tanners each at a different location. Were talked into spray tan memberships with a 3 month minimum.  I cancelled mine after 2 weeks without a problem. My daughters experience was terrible. She attempted to cancel and was told they were unable to help her. She stopped in, called, and contacted corporate and was only met with incompetent people. She emailed Haley Frazier at corporate explaining what's happened and requesting a reimbursement for 3 months of overcharging at $34.62. Again met with incompetence and refusing to reimburse her and said she would cancel her membership. Unbelievably poor customer service and to take advantage of their younger customers! Shameful!
