Served is an interesting place with a cozy feeling to the place.  We went for breakfast and was nice and different in a good way.  The place is harder to find from the street but nice and clean.\nI did not like my food by my family loved theirs.  I will definitely come back to try something different on the menu for a brunch or lunch time.
