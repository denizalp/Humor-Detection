I love this place. The food and service is above par for me everytime. I have taken so many people to enjoy dinner w\/ me and  have always had positive remarks from my guests. I used to pay a tiny bit less for food at a buffet that would be sitting out all day. Origin india's food is always fresh and has an explosion of flavor. My girlfriends and I always order extra because we love to have to the next day after a night of partying! Will be going back! I recommend this place I have tried Indian restaurants in La, NYC, and All over vegas. I still have this on at the top of my list and my second favorite is Bollywood in LA.
