Not,\nStopped going here after the 3rd owner in less than 2 years raised the prices.  This has been happening about every 7 months with raising prices and I mentioned this to the tattoo faced staff.  \nHe was rude and I left it at that.  \nNext time I go in the tattoo faced staff is rude again and makes a comment about what I said about 4 days prior.  \nI was just coming in for some wine or bow valley beer, lite.  \nHe initiated the past comment I had made and then tells me after obviously provoking a response and I was kind and said  \"its just alot of price hikes and he said \"you should find another store\".\n\nHe obviously is unprofessional so I paid and left.  He made a rude comment and I said \"fuck you\" under my breath.\nAbout a week later I went back and after be Teri g the store the tattoo family ed staff said, \"this is the one\".\nThe female then came down off her ladder and came at me in a rude condescending manner and just berated me for my welfare choice of beer as I was walking toward the till.  \nI was shocked at her assault on me and when i was trying to pay she told me, \" your purchases mean shit to me\".  \nI know I don t spend alot on liquor, yet she thinks because I purchase bow valley beer I am on welfare because it's cheap beer.   She assumed I'm a  \"welfare recipient\" and abused me for buying cheap beer.  Made me so angry that she aseumed, abused me and all because the tattoo faced staff took my comment about the 3rd price hike in less than 2 years.  I was kind and just mentioned it.  \nShe even threatened to beat me up she got so angry with me. \nI had never met this female before and to come at a new customer is just INSANITY!  \nI will say I miss its convenience, yet that freak female needs anger management and the tattoo faced staff needs to \"calm down and take a run at your fist\"\n\nI happen to walk by and the two staff were standing outside smoking.  \n tacky \nDon t mention their prices ever, instead:\nbe insincere and say, \" great prices, nice tatoo\"
