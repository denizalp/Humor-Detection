Usually this buffet is one of the more solid ones in Vegas, but wow was I disappointed this weekend. Not only was it ridiculously expensive, but the selections were very subpar. At 41.11 per person for lunch (because of the Mexican Independence Holiday) there was mostly breakfast foods like eggs and toast. The prime rib and crab legs were sad, as well as the sushi and the other savory foods. My friends and I left after 2 plates each because it was so disappointing. This Buffet seems to have less of a fan base now since not a lot of people dined there on a Saturday.
