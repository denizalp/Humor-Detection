Went there to pass time until our next stop. Harvey's has been a valley staple since I was a little girl.  The new owners are nice and have freshened up the interior.  Had I known how delicious the Wineburgers were before, I would have visited this place much sooner!  They grill then fry their hot wings-delicious.  Patrons include suit and ties from the local business community and flip flops and tshirts from everywhere coming for the Wineburger.   Service is always very attentive. They have pool tables, dart boards, a dining area, and plenty of TVs. The  bathrooms have been upgraded (thanks for the purse hook!!), but it's hot in there. $2 PBRs and the grill is open until 1:30 a.m.!
