I have been going to Dr. Judy for 4-5 years and have lost 85 pounds and feel better than I have felt in 10 years!  I thought all the minor aches and pains I had were just me getting old, however, having taken the supplement and dietary changes recommended by Dr. Judy the aches and pains have disappeared.  Plus my blood glucose is in the lowest range it has ever been in and I am almost off the blood pressure meds.\n\nDr. Judy does a full blood work up.  Spends lots of times getting to know me as an individual and is kind and compassionate. Her office staff are very friendly and kind as well.\n\nShe is such a good doctor that when I moved three hours away, I still make the trip to visit with Dr. Judy.  She is my forever doctor.\n\nI love everyone at Vitality Natural Health Care!
