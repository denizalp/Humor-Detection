Wow... Loved this place.  When I walked in and saw the menu, I didn't know what to get.  I've had some great Thai food in California so I was craving something good.\n\nI really wanted a shrimp entree, but they only had seafood entrees.  I asked our waiter, Nathan, who was very pleasant, and he had a great suggestion.  He was able to customize a dish for me that I loved.  Fried shrimp with yellow curry, Thai vegetables, and jasmine rice.  He called it Crispy SH M.K.  No idea what that means but when I return that's how I'm supposed to order it.  The vegetables consisted of eggplant, Thai pumpkin, and green beans.  It was spicy, but I loved it.\n\nFor an appetizer, we had the satay sampler with shrimp, beef, and chicken. The satay sauce was delicious.  And, of course, a glass of Thai iced tea.\n\nPrices were very reasonable and the portions were large - about $45 for two entrees, drinks, and an appetizer.  Can't wait to go back!!
