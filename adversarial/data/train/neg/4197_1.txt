Stay far away from this office. Had a horrendous experience just trying to make an appointment. I have been calling for days and all you get is a recording to leave a message. The recording also states if you call the MD and it is not an emergency, you will be charged $50. This is my first introduction to this office. I finally got the receptionist and she said I needed a referral. I explained I have a PPO plan that does not require referral. She then gave me a list of demands that I needed to provide to her before I could even make an appointment. When I questioned her, she hung up on me! I find this behavior rude and unprofessional. Please stay far away fro this office and go to an MD that is caring and respectful. Why should making an appointment be this difficult. I was referred by a pediatrician to see this MD. I will f\/u with the pediatric office so they will not refer any pt's to this horrible mess of an office!
