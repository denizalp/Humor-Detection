I've become a regular here now so that every time I come in after work in the mornings, the staff knows my order! Haha. I've always wanted to achieve that familiarity with a restaurant and of course it would be Roberto's  Anyways, for the past few months, I have been getting the carne asada breakfast burrito with sausage meat added to it as well. You can't go wrong with this combo and it's so filling that I always only eat half and save the other half for later. The total comes out to be about $9, which is a pretty good price for a meal that can last me the whole day.
