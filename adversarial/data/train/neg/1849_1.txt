This is very nice location and a great place to share breakfast with friends. Nice patio adjacent a very spacious dining room. \n\nI like both the menu and the food presentations. Lots of little extras make it unique and sets them aside from other more high volume places.\n\nGreat staff and the place is spotless! Located in a very posh area of town. Grab your paper and catch up on outside world or bury your phone and the paper and just enjoy life for a change!\n#vinosquared #vino2ultimate
