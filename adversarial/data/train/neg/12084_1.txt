We went on whim this past Saturday and got the Groupon deal for $15\/person. Don't bother paying full price for this one.\n\nDisclaimer: We've been to a lot of escape rooms in the city and have had our fair share of awesome to awful rooms. This was on the less awesome side.\n\nWe completed the 'Defuse the Bomb' escape room. It advertised the room for 2-6 players. I would only recommend 2-3. You'll have people just standing there doing nothing if you go with a large group as there were only 4 main puzzles.\n\nThe place was unclean. From the door handles to the room props, everything was sticky or had a thick layer of dust.\n\nThe main prop which held the bomb was broken and when we told the worker about it, she brushed it off and said to continue with the game...\n\nThe puzzles weren't too bad. It would have been nice to have a few more thrown in to make it more worthwhile.\n\nThe worker was friendly enough but seemed disinterested about the place.\n\nOverall, if you're looking to try out escape rooms for the first time, I wouldn't recommend this place. If you're more experienced, I would recommend trying this place to have a better appreciation of the other fantastic escape rooms you've tried in TO.
