What a terrible company! I was very excited to have found a Groupon for this service. Following the Groupon instructions, I called the number provided to schedule an appointment; I reached someone and I was told to instead fill an online form. I hung up and went to the website to do so.\n\nDays go by and I never receive a call to confirm an appointment so I try to fill it out again to make sure it was sent. I also tried to call directly to let them know that I had filled out the form and hopefully get confirmation from them; instead, my call was forwarded to a voice mail. I left a message and I never got a call back.\n\nSome weeks after that I fill out the form a third time, and try calling a couple of different times, always being forwarded to their voice messaging system. Not one call was returned.  Reading about other people having trouble not only making appointments but trying to have the company honor them prompted me to contact Groupon directly and have the Groupon refunded before having to deal with them.
