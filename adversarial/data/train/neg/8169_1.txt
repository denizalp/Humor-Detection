I have traveled extensively throughout the United States, and internationally. But I am an incredibly picky eater. Avenue club has an amazing roasted pepper soup that I want buckets of!! (Catch it when you can). Happy hour is a great time to stop by and try 1\/2 off appetizers and Wisconsin beer. Friendly staff has greeted me every time I have stopped by.  I highly recommend you come by! Love the atmosphere!
