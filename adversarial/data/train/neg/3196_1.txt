I had pretty high hopes for this place, and while I must admit the sandwich was pretty darn tasty... The whole experience from the neurotic lady at the counter that doesn't let you finish speaking and continuously interrupts when you ask a question to their odd sizing methodology. Seems they have over-branded common sense. You know like when you want a small size.... you ask for a small anywhere else (except Starbucks). Here you have to ask for a Phil size. When you want a large you have to order a philthy size. Add to the conundrum they use the words philthy and philly on their menu items. Try deciphering this order out....\"ordering 1 Philly cheesesteak phil size, 2 # philthies 1 philthy size and 1 Phil size and 1 fat philly philthy size........ what could possibly go wrong?\nThe lady taking the order was confusing in every aspect. I asked for clarification (we had a large order) and she kept interrupting me so I continually had to stop, restart.... honestly it was the single most frustrating as heck ordeal trying to understand this sizing system they use. She wasn't making matters better either. In truth I was starting to get so annoyed I was just about to ask her to please stop talking and let me finish. In short they're tasty sandwiches that are overpriced and over branded in their own confusion. Don't think I'll be coming back or recommending them.
