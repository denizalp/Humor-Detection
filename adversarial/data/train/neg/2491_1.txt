I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of patrons here are more of the quitters from The Buffet line next door who didn't have the patience to wait 2+ hours to get in.  A 25-30 minute wait outside this cafe is actually a great alternative in comparison.\n\nOverall this is more like 3.5 stars.  The line to get seated was a slow one and could've been handled better.  There were plenty of empty tables, and it almost felt like we were intentionally made to wait outside to create the illusion that the cafe is a really happening place to passersby.  The kind of stuff they do at some not-so-happening SF nightclubs.\n\nThe food itself was quite good.  More like 4.x star quality.  Ambiance was quite pleasant too.  We had the mushroom\/truffle burger, a tri-tip sandwich, chicken tenders, and a crab and lobster club.  All high quality and satisfying.  You can tell how a restaurant cares about their food quality by the quality of their sides.  Even the coleslaw was done well enough that one of us who usually doesn't care for coleslaw actually enjoyed it.\n\nI'd recommend this over The Buffet next door.
