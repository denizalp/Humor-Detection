Located on the 3rd floor of Cosmo with the rest of the good restaurants - we came for lunch. They have the lovely $29pp 3-course - great price for quality fish!\nThe restaurant is cleanly furnished and tastefully decorated, with beautiful sprawling windows of views on the strip. Although we did not sit there, they also have a nice outdoor patio seating area, which is covered so it's not too hot!\nThe prix fixe lunch menu comes with about 5 choices for apps, entree, and 3 desserts. Several of the items include an upcharge. The grilled octopus appetizer is worth the $10 upcharge! Also tried the salmon tartare and the greek dips. Both were ok.\nEveryone at our table ordered the sea bream which came with some overcooked broccoli (the other options looked bland). We were interested in the lobster pasta, but didn't want to spend $15 more. The fish was fresh!\nMost of us ordered the karidopita dessert which is very rich and sweet. The fruit plate is a nice selection as well.  I'd come back for lunch again!
