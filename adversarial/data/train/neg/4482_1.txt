I've been to this location on 3 different occasions. Within a 2 yr time frame. I've not been impressed with the food or service. This is why it's taken me this long to write a review. The food and service was ok on my first visit. Nothing memorable. The 2nd time the service was horrible the waiters argued with our group about a platter that was not order but someone in the group asked about. She took it back but after that the waiters neglected to check on us. On this last visit the service was great. The food was mediocre at best. I ordered fish tacos which I figured you can't go wrong at a Mexican restaurant. WRONG! I received a taco with flavorless frozen fish stick. The fish stick was luke warm and the tortillas were cold which was weird because the tortillas were suppose to be made fresh. The white rice was delicious, very tasty buttery garlic flavor. My son had cheese enchiladas which he liked but there was a plastic container upside down and he did not realize he was suppose to remove to get the rice.  My cousin ordered chilaciles, she loved them, she said they were her favorite. They also had the steak parillada and they like it. The best thing about lunch was desert: flan, fried ice cream and sopapilla. I will not be returning here but enter at your own risk it can go either way.
