I've never been there to eat.....but I do go on occasion to have a beverage.  It's the perfect non-descript place to have a drink with someone if you don't really care to be seen by many people, as this place is hidden below Park Rd. Shopping center. \n\nThe drinks are always made well....and the bartenders are really nice.  \n\nThe inside is lacking as far as decor goes....but that's alright with me really.   They seem to do pretty well there....and from what I can tell...the food looks pretty good.\n\nThis place has always been a staple for me in the last 8 years or so....I'll continue to go back because it has a \"top secret\" appeal being so hidden away.
