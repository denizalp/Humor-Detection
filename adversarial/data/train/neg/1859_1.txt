This review is for Chrystal, master stylist at the Ulta Salon.  I have been going to Chrystal for a few years now.  She does an excellent job from cut to color.  I don't even have to tell her, i trust that whatever cut or color she does will come out excellent.  I always leave a happy and satisfied customer.
