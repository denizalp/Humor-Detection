Tried the American Burger. Nothing special, just your standard, typical burger you'd find in any ole restaurant. Fries were lacking and soggy. Hubby got the crispy chicken sandwich w\/kale salad. If you like blue cheese, get the salad. If not, it overpowers the salad. Hubby's sandwich had a decent spicy flavor to it, but it was nothing special. Also tried ahi tuna tacos to start. The dressing was nice and tart, but I would prefer it on a salad, not to flavor ahi. The ahi itself, being raw was a bit fishy w\/no flavor other than its fishiness.  I like Downtown Summerlin, but Im not interested in coming back to Public School 702.
