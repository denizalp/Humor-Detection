i would've tipped more but the restaurant was not answering & they didn't have change :\/  i feel bad because it took 2 tries for delivery. most ppl have trouble getting into my condos. i have been waiting a long time.... they may be busy but many times trying to call and no answer. they did bring the food & it was nice &hot, not cold. which is nice considering the time its been.
