(I attended the CCW certification class.) Mark Williams is a fantastic instructor. The class had a great atmosphere throughout the entire day, and he was enthusiastic, yet realistic while discussing the topics covered. Mark was welcoming and informative to questions no matter how simple they might seem, and even though I felt I knew most all of what would be covered I still came out with plenty new knowledge that will prove useful. I'd love to return for some of the other courses offered in the future.
