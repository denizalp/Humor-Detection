The excitement about shake shack in charlotte is crazy and please believe all the hype. I always loved going up north or down to Florida and making it my priority to get shake shack, and these location is just as great! First the burgers are amazing. My fav is the shake stack...an already delicious cheeseburger but with a fried stuffed mushroom on top! It is EVERYTHING! Get extra shakesauce, you won't regret it! A close second is the smoke shack, that chopped cherry pepper is the secret weapon! \nI must say, I usually focus on the burgers and the perfect bacon cheese fries. I can't wait to venture off the menu and try the chicken, hot dogs and very tempting shakes!\n\nPlease not, it's still new and long lines are usual. I like to go on a weekday around 4:30 when I get off work. After 5 you'll get a short line. After 7 go ahead and prepare to wait.
