Great pierogies and haluski.  A bit pricey for what you get and their deals for bulk orders are not great compared to other places (for example, Gosia's is better and will give you a deal on a big order).  Pierogies Plus is not the best pierogies in the city--keeping in mind there's a lot of competition here--but they definitely are the best Polish food in the McKees Rocks area.\n\nThe main reason that I deducted a star is because every staff member there has been incredibly rude over the phone or in person.  I got yelled at by a staff person once when I rather meekly pointed out their website prices did not match their in-store prices--not my fault the website was not up-to-date.
