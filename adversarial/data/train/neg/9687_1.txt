Been coming to this place for the past few years now but first time to write a review. I like that there's usually no wait when I come in to have Jaklin do my brows. She's awesome! Great customer service and very personable.  However, just last week I learned she no longer works there. Good news is that I found her in her new location! If you're one of Jaklin's regulars, you can find her at Jazmens Beauty Studio on  Durango and Flamingo in the Albertsons shopping complex.
