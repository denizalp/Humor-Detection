I haven't been back here in years, this was my first time in at least 4 years and it hasn't changed one bit.  Of the few Salsa clubs in Toronto, this is one of the only ones that play live music. Every weekend is a different band - its a nice change from the standard DJ songs which end up being meringue the entire time. \n\nPeople who come here aren't as inclined to dance salsa as other clubs like Babaluu (where everyone knows how to dance, and are there to do some salsa). There were only a few who knew what they were doing, and some in the middle of the floor just getting in the way. \n\nLots of stagettes here tonight, and it's beyond me why you choose a salsa club as a venue for an event when you have no inclination of dancing. Most people were still up in theri seats just watching.\n\nThe music started around 10:45pm after the lesson, but only lasted about an hour when they switched it to some DJ music. It was okay when it was salsa, but just awful when it turned into a mix of soca and reggage. \n\nI really like the live band, but as an experienced dancer would prefer Babaluus even if it's cramped and small. The $15 cover doesn't help the cause either. If you eat there, there's no cover, but food seemed to take a long time to come out. \n\nIf you're looking for just fun times, it seemed like the crowd was enjoying themselves, so this review is very subjective.
