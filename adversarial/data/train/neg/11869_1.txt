Huge cafe with so many options for seating. The waitress mentioned being able to serve over 400. Loved the atmosphere. We sat outside in the shade area and it was really nice. All the sandwiches we ordered were really good. The Bloody Mary that my brother ordered was amazing. He says he's picky about his bloody Mary's too. Only complaint would be that we did wait awhile to get our food but they do serve a lot of people
