I wish I had read reviews before eating here. I just paid $17 with tip for the worst fish tacos ever. I was so desperate for something that wasn't a burger or a sandwich or pizza, so I was excited to see this on the menu. What I got was three tortillas straight out of the bag with the fish from the fish and chips they serve (more greasy batter than anything else) and a weird combo of corn, tomatoes, and chopped mango that tasted kind of off, with an edible chipotle sauce. Nothing else, and no sides. I wouldn't have posted, except that the food was also really expensive! Now my stomach hurts and I'm $17 poorer.
