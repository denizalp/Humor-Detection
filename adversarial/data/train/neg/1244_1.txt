ate there yesterday before flew back home to Dallas. I've seen the reviews so decided give a try. I am sorry but that was the worst lunch buffets I've ever eat...  The pictures they took might seen nice and all that but when i actually get there, it was bad..... it wasn't look as clean the the pictures show, it's always have no foods at the buffet, yes the deserts was nice but i've tried all the food there, it was bad.. I've throw up after i ate the buffets. I would rather pay little bit more to order a plate that is fresh cook  instead eating buffet. I am not sure about the dinner but I know for sure I won't go back there again to eat their lunch buffet.
