Ok so I am not the average age of a skateboarder...Im not even the average gender. BUT i do like to ride to break hangovers and to clear my mind when dumb stuff starts to bother me. I like this place.. \nWeekdays are better if you are not looking to be over run with kids and at nights you can get away with skating pretty late.\nOh dont bring your dog here tho
