Horrible. Do not waste your time or money. We went for the kitsch and didn't expect it to be great but it was awful. Bland, processed foods.... Cafeteria like atmosphere with poor service. The crab is served very cold and wet. Yuck. The meats are dry and overdone. They do not offer a kids price, which is ridiculous.
