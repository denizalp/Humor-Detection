I have to honestly say I'm seriously against guns and their industry but my boyfriend dragged me here. I put four stars because I hope they gave better information regarding the healthy use of guns. That said ... This place is very user friendly, the people that help you are amazing and Jonh D. helped me feel safe while I was a bit nervous on my first gun experience. A bit expensive but totally worth the while.
