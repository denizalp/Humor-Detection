Not good at all. Went there with a larger party and we all ordered something different. You could tell no one enjoyed it. Then the following day we were all sick. \nThe food came out all at different times. Probably about 15 minutes from when the first person got their food, from when the last person got there's. The water tasted old and the food tasted microwaved. Would never go there again. The only thing that was good was the service. They were very nice and attentive.
