This is the place to be for the practical\/serious crowd here.  They always had spring kits from Wilson Combat for 1911s and j frames.  Glock finishing touches parts from Ghost at minimum suggested retail price for both gen 3 and gen 4.    Namely the Ghost magazine release and the Ghost slide release which I will keep drooling until the day comes.  No stripped lowers here.  I didn't see any oem glocklocking blocks, disassembly springs, or ejector housing or firing pins.  They offer a cerakote service which I am told.  Zert nation swag boxes, starter ar15 tools like a magazine block, carbine gas tubes steel set screw gas blocks, standard lower parts kits.  I didn't see any barrels as they could be out back.  Some of your higher end pistols.  The pricing is  little more on the smith and wesson j frames revolvers. There was a few KE arms drop in and a Cmc curved trigger kit here.  Optics I would say mid to high scopes and your popular brand rails.  Whoo yup if you are demanding these guys are helpful, especially the bearded heavier set gentleman as he helped me out to show me the Ghost parts.  The small oem\/zev parts to build your glock upper and lower are here too all in one store.  Spartan Arms.
