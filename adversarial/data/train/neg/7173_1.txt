Our anniversary+my birthday, couldn't have been better. We were recommended to sit at the bar, and that was what started a absolutely great evening. \n  Jose` was our bartender\/YOU NEED TO TRY THIS GURU, and he was hitting homeruns... \nWe had our menu planned out, but his suggestions made for literally some of the greatest dishes my wife and I have eaten in Vegas. From start to finish, this meal was everything a human being would be able to distinguish from, what is Great, what is good, and what is okay... Cleo is Great!!! \nThank you for making a great night for us...See you soon!\nJoe, and Eryn
