To Dr Toledo & all Patients : \non 01\/08\/2016 i met a bad service treatment from office staff ( Crystal ). it was the worst day of my life. Here what happened : i ( Mark P ) took my wife & 1 year old Son coming in for yearly check up with Dr Toledo . We paid cash copay everytime we was here . Then we seated waiting for 1 hour and see other patients all coming to see their docter even they came after . I came to ask the receptionist the reason why we waited too long. She ( Crystal ) told me that i owed $50 .00 (fifty) dollars from last year . I told her i did paid all my copay to office evereytime before i was here and the office lady ( Holly ) told us last year that everything was fine and taking care by UMR insurance. Holly did promised she taking care . But today the receptionist ( Crystal ) treated us with no respects and had no courtesy to let us know why she skipped our turn .We asked her again to talked to Dr Toledo or Holly but Crystal said they both very busy and made us wait and wait ......I was really upset and walked away from this office.\n\nI did have insurance and did paid my copay but this office staffs treated me so bad and unprofessional. This office named : Henderson Wellness at 1552 W Warmspring # 100 , Henderson , NV 89014 .\n\nI also will report this matter the Nevada Business Bureau soon when i can .\nI just want to let Dr Toledo know what i see from the services of your staffs if you re really care.\n\nBest Regard \n\n01\/08\/2016
