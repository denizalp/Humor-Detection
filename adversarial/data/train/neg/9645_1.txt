I used Redline in Dec 2016 to repair a broken window in my Peoria AZ winter home, I was so impressed with Terry the window tech guy, that I got an estimate from them in January to replace 3 old single pane windows and up grade to double pane, aluminum frame.  It took a little over 3 weeks to get the windows manufactured because I only wanted aluminum and not vinyl, they finished up last week and installed all 3 windows.  James the installer did an excellent job and I would definitely use Redline in the future if needed.
