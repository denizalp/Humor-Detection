First timer and the food was very good! I don't normally eat hole in the wall Asian food due to past experiences but I decided to give this place a try with a positive attitude. I don't regret it one bit. I ordered the teriyaki bowl and a small salad. The salad was a great start, and I love the dressing they use. The teriyaki bowl was very fulfilling, I added extra teriyaki sauce. Might have to give more spots like this a try
