Great hotel! We got a suite and the room was very spacious. Everything was clean, the house keeping is very nice and I love how the Venetian has such a great location on the strip. It was also really convenient that they have the canal shoppes downstairs that has a lot of food options and makes it very easy to just go down a couple floors for a coffee or drink.
