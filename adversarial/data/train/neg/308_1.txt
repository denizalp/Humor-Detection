Hands down the best sushi meal I've had outside of Japan! They say you get what you pay for and that couldn't be more true. The restaurant is modern and fancy, but really small so you really get an intimate experience, especially if you sit at one of the bar seats. \n\nI loved the \"sitting at the bar and having the chef hand you each piece of sushi\" atmosphere - I also haven't gotten that experience since I last went to Japan either. You get 18 pieces of sushi - most of them are standard but a few a seasonal specialities. Go with an open mind because if you ask about what the specialty sushi is, you might not wanna eat it anymore ;) \n\nRemember that they only have about 20 seats and 2-3 sittings per night so make sure you reserve in advance. I think this is THE perfect place for a special night, be it a birthday or anniversary, ESPECIALLY for sushi lovers.
