I moved to Vegas about a year ago from California and figured that this place was nice since it was cheaper than my Carlsbad apartment. Now I realize that it's over-priced. You can rent a house for less than a \"Manhattan or Tribeca\" floor plan. It's a gated community but everyone and their mother can get up in here since there is a simple generic gate code that everyone knows, this includes the ice-cream truck that rolls in. There are a couple different entrances and the gate closer to where I live always seems to be stuck open in one way or another. If you stay up late you will see that weird shit goes on in the parking lot in certain areas. I have a buddy in law enforcement and I've had to give him a buzz a couple times to see what in the blue fuck has been going on out here. The management when I first moved here was good. Then they changed management with no announcement and changed the website which prevented me from paying online. I had to go in the office and see what was up. They added a room with computers to use for residents in the rental office and the printer would always seem to have an issue. You're better off renting a house and saving hundreds a month. Floor plan on the Manhattan and Tribeca are nice, but stick with a house. Preferably in Rhodes Ranch where \"gated community\" actually means something.
