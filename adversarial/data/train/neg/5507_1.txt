Predator and deceitful. WARNING!! Do not use them.  I reserved an SUV for $23 a day collision insurance $10 a day. I used Travelocity. The guy at the counter only asked me if i wanted to bring back the car full or pre pay for a tank. I said fill it myself. He then reprinted the paperwork and said sign and initial. I was in a hurry and signed. They added $277  if insurance and tons of taxes and fees. Travelocities rate clearly says it includes taxes and fees. When i returned the car after 5 days they charged over $716 !!!!  Nothing matched what i signed up for thru Travelocity.   BEWARE THEY ARE SCAMMING PEOPLE.  Even the girl that checked me in said she has seen others over charged by $400.
