Sent flowers to my sister in law who had just lost her brother to cancer. I live in Phoenix and she lives in Palm Springs. Delivery barely resembled what I ordered and paid $85 for. Won't make this a long story. I called and complained. They sent out another arrangement the next day and half the flowers pictured again were not in the bouquet. No Gerber Daisy's, no green carnations or lavendar daisys. There were a couple of Lilys and a few pink roses.   My advice - search for a local florist in the city you are sending a floral arrangement to and deal directly with them. Expensive lesson for me and a hassle for someone who was grieving and didn't need anymore stress. Q
