I do really enjoy it here. Though the nitrogen isn't as strong as other places I've tried, the flavours are amazing. The cheesecake is definitely my favourite and actually tastes like cheesecake. The tiramisu has a good strong coffee flavour. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the Cheetos because I couldn't actually blow nitrogen out for every Cheeto and so I was overpaying for Cheetos but other than that I would come back to try the other flavours. The super cute flower wall really adds to the aesthetics as well.
