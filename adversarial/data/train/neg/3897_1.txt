I wish I could use less than 1 star. Ordered the mango berry smoothie for my son and I and it actually tastes bitter. Not ripe fruit? Imagine they are using frozen fruit so this is strange. When we placed our order my husband said he wanted something cold. The proprietor\/server suggested an iced mocha. So he ordered that. When it arrived it was a hot mocha. When we explained we ordered the ice, she argued with us and said we didn't until we quoted the conversation verbatim and she finally conceded that we were right (guess here, customer is never right?!?). Our cinnamon sugar crepe was so heavy on the cinnamon that it was gritty. Also dead bugs on the windowsill as we ate, did not help our experience. We do not recommend.
