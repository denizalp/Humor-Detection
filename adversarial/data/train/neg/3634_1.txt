Went on a recommendation. I'm wondering how long the unpopular dishes are allowed to revolve on the conveyor?Small prices for small portions. I ordered an Alaska hand roll off the menu. The Sushi Chef handed it to me and it looked great. Only problem is, that it wasn't squeezed tight. As soon as I got it in my hand it came apart leaving me with a sloppy mess all over the little plate. Just because the concept is volume, upping the quality and paying attention to detail would go a long way. I'm definitely on the fence about trying this again.
