I recently moved to Madison and was nervous about picking a new salon. I went here once over the summer for a pedicure and had a great experience, so I decided to try out the hair salon side of things. I'm so glad I did! Everyone that works there was super friendly (even though my appointment was early in the morning!), and the atmosphere is very relaxing. I had Monica cut my hair, and she did a fantastic job! She talked me through everything she was doing to make sure I was satisfied. I will definitely be returning! \nAnother thing I really liked about Rejuvenation is the super easy online appointment scheduling on their website. It also explains their services and pricing, so there are no surprises. Great place, I will definitely recommend to friends.
