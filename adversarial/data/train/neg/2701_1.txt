I posted a good review the day after I got my nails done. Three days later I had lost 3 nails. Do not go here. What a waste of money. Within a week and a half I had lost all but 2 nails. I had gotten my nails done for a vacation to a film festival. I was completely embarrassed by the shitty work and will never go here again. I spent a bundle too.
