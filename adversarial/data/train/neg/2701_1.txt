Brunch is delicious, with lots of fruit on the side. Way more than just a \"garnish\", which is great. Unfortunately, the staff are rude and snobby. I went for dinner a few weeks ago, and was greatly disappointed. I was the happy to see they had mussels on the specials for the night, but had already run out by our 7:00pm reservation. Very disappointed overall.
