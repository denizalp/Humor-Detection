David at new heights dog training is the best!!! I was at my wits end with my stubborn 1 year old rescue pitbull, he was about to go back to the pound. He wouldn't listen and I didn't trust him, but after 6 training sessions at new heights I can truly say I have a whole new dog. It has taught him self control, he is calm, finally follows commands and no longer shows signs of aggression. I would recommend this facility to anyone in need of training!!
