Competitive prices and honest service are my experience with Bumblebee.  I have dealt with this company twice and I may call them back.  I do think they are trying to provide good customer service.  I saved by going with another company on a water heater because I had a service contract with them.  The management at Bumblebee does care and will follow up.
