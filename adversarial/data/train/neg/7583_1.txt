We got a special through Travel Zoo and saved quite a bit. Beware of service charges for each ticket. Stage production was incredible as platforms shifted and moved the entire time. An amazing show with fantastic visuals. We saw it on a Monday night at 7 pm and it was packed. Arrive early to take photos and get your beverages served in a souvenir cup. If you love the Beatles, you will LOVE this show.
