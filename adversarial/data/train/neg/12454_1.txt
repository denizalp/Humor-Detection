I just found this cafe today for the first time--I was looking for a chill place to sit and maybe have a cup of coffee and just kill time waiting for friends, and I stumbled upon a gem. The staff is so super friendly, the drink was amazing, the atmosphere is very eased and they play lowkey jazz music, the decor is very artistic and the chill, casual coffee shop vibe you're looking for. I have nothing but praise for this place and I'll definitely be back. I sat in Roots for like 2.5 hrs today just killing time and it was so relaxing. 10\/10 would highly recommend. The drinks aren't expensive, the atmosphere is super relaxing, the decor is so cute, and I felt very comfortable just hanging out and relaxing.
