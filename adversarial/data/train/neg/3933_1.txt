I've never shipped through FedEx, and I called them the other day to figure out all of their rules and the lady was completely helpful and didn't make me seem like i was dumb for not knowing any of it :) hahaha. I had to packaging tape to finish taping my box and the guy behind the counter took the box & taped it for me and also taped the shipping label. i had a great and fast experience there and it's super close to me so i'm stoked to keep shipping through FedEx!
