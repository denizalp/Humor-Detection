Just had dinner here. Really good. I ordered a Supreme small minus the green peppers. Because who eats green peppers on pizza?! Anyways - very tasty and I will return. Only one unisex bathroom but that didn't effect the food at all. The gentlemen behind the counter appeared to be owners or what have you. They seemed to be enjoying their jobs and smiling even tho they were busy. That kinda charm I always tend to notice. Great little shop you have there!
