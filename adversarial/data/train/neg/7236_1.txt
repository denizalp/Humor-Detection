I had a great experience with AW Collision. This was my second time using their services. First time (about 4 years ago)  I had an accident in my Volvo C30 (not my fault lol), and the repairs were flawless like nothing happened. Their customer service and communication back then was so good that I decided to use them again this time around for my Mini Cooper. There was debris on the freeway and I could not avoid it and it did a lot of damage to the bumper and fender. I bought the mini in Portland from a dealership almost 3 years ago. That dealership lied to me when I asked them if it had prior damage\/ accidents and they said no. One month later in this hot and dry climate my paint started cracking on the hood and progressively spread and got worse because there was damage and they did a Mickey Mouse job on repairing it. So I figured I'll just get that repaired as well while my car was there already to get that other damage repaired. Once again it looks flawless and better than new. The customer service from everyone there  is great, they explained everything in detail to me. From what they were going to repair, to why my paint had cracked, to the quality products that they use and why. You get a lifetime guarantee as well which makes me happy and confident that they stand by their work. I've had two separate great experiences and I will refer people and use them again myself (hopefully not anytime soon lol). I brought my car in kinda dirty and when I picked it up it was so clean on the inside and out! That too made me super happy because I was planning to get and nice car wash after I picked it up and now I did not have to. Thanks so much you guys a big thumbs up to you all!!
