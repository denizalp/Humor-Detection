I stopped in here for dinner before heading over to a coffee shop for some music. It was pretty busy and the staff was a little frantic!\n\nI sat at the bar and waited a few minutes to be acknowledged. There were a couple of other people at the bar that were also waiting to be served. The guy behind the bar was very nice and apologized for the delay. \n\nThe chips were very good; thick & crunchy. I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos.  They were pretty good, if a little on the bland side. Adding some salsa helped. \n\nOverall, it looks like a nice place. The menu had a lot of variety. I think, if they were a little more organized & prepared for a busy Saturday night, it would have been a much better experience.  At least the chaos provided a topic of conversation for the people sitting at the bar!
