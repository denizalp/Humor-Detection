So I came to this location couple months ago & there was 1 young girl working with an accent. Now I rated this place low because of this girl & my experience here, nothing else. So I ordered a horchata frap & paid & was waiting maybe like 5 mins before she asked me \"do you know how to make that drink?\" ... I'm looking at her like.... \"no, isn't that ur job?\" She's all oh yeah yeah yeah.. so then she goes and like looks at some book (I'm assuming it has the recipes in it)... and she's like \"I don't know how to make this\". I'm like well is there someone else who can make it like it's in the menu .. she said no it was just her. So I'm kind of irritated cause I really wanted one but wtv .. She said \"yeahhhh...... uhhhh...... my bad\" I'm jus staring at her like well wouldn't u have known that u didn't know how to make this drink when u were ringing me up for it? Omg but she gave my money back but it was just the most awkward situation, experience I've ever gone through. I'm scared of that Starbucks it was weird. I'm surprised they left her by herself if she was still training because she didn't have the social skills that we normally are greeted with at Starbucks, nor the knowledge of some of the drinks.
