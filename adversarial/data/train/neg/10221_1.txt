I had to change nail places because I moved from Chandler to Phoenix.  I was referred here by a coworker because her nails are always so pretty.  Once she told me she goes to stashhouse to get her nails done by Ale, I had to try her.  I was sold after my first appointment.  I can get my regular acrylic nails, with gel polish with many different varieties. I don't do too much with my nails but I am very critical of them and Ale does a fantastic job.  Not to mention she is one of the nicest people!  Just be prepared to spend a bit more money as it is a private nail shop, but the quality that you get for the price, you can't beat.  Not to mention, the vibe in there is so eclectic it's amazing!  This is my new nail shop in Phoenix!
