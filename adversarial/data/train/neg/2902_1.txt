Solid brunch. But doesn't quite measure up to the other culinary delights that Vegas has to offer. \n\nPros:\nDelicious empanadas\nAwesome fruit salad with chili powder - refreshing, spicy, fun\nBottomless mimosas for $10 in 8 different flavors? DELICIOUS - the lemon cucumber was my favorite.\nChicken and Blue corn waffles were pretty great.\n\nCons:\nThe rest of the food was pretty average. It tasted good, but nothing really stood out. The eggs benedict came in a huge, dense biscuit that wasn't really conducive to trying lots of small plates. The red velvet pancakes were a little dry. \n\nDon't know if I would go out of my way to go again, but wouldn't put up a fuss if someone else wanted to go.
