I really liked this place. My friends and I only tried the soy ice creams, but I want to come back and try the foods. \n\nI like the chill, hip mood inside. It's a perfect place to come and chat with someone. On one side of the restaurant are car doors. There are plenty of tables and booths. \n\nYou order & pay for your food at the cashier, you get a number on a stand and the waiters come and deliver it to your table.\n\nI tried the cookie dough ice cream, which was pretty good. I noticed they had some korean items, which I'm interested in trying next time.
