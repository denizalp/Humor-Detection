For the amount of time it took to get our food, you would have thought everything would be super fresh and delicious. Unfortunately, not the case. Had to wait 20 minutes to order and another 40 minutes for our food. Then 15 more minutes at the end of the meal to get our waiter's attention so we could pay. Probably could have walked out without them noticing. The food was average, and had it been quick and with great service might have warranted a better rating, but unfortunately nothing was stellar about this restaurant. I would not recommend.
