Don't even know where to start with this place... I'm always down to support local businesses and I was excited to try this place out after it just opened in my area. \n\nThere are are so many Portuguese restaurants around St. Clair and this place was packed on a Saturday night so we assumed it would be great. Not even close! \n\nService: sucked. We sat for about 10 minutes before receiving a menu or a cup of water and another 10 until we got to place our order. We noticed other tables received olives with their bread but we didn't (weird) and we had to ask for water and butter for the bread. \n\nThe menu was outdated somehow although they've only been open a couple months, and I was told that the steak I ordered wouldn't come with the sides that were listed on the menu. (Potato pur√©e and veggies) She gave me an option of rice, and I asked for beans as well since they didn't have what was listed on the menu and I was told they couldn't do it. \n\nI ordered the ribeye steak ($24) medium rare and for some reason it was served well done. I didn't have the chance to tell anyone because we didn't see a waitress until it was time for her to try to sell us on some dessert (not even for a water or wine refill). \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and you should probably spend your money at more deserving Portuguese restaurants in the area as there's so much choice. \n\nOn top of this we were told we can't split the bill because the boss doesn't allow it (lmao). \n\nI would have preferred if they re-opened the crappy Coffee Time that was here when I was growing up.
