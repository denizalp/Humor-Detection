My agent was fantastic. Scott Pisan is his name. I didn't interact with anyone else in the company really, but if Scott is any indication, you'll be in good hands. He was available constantly. He knew every detail of the entire process. He had ideas to solve every problem as small issue popped up. He explained things well, and offered candid advice to me when needed. Just can't say enough good things. Thank you, Scott!
