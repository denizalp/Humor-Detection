Rented a minivan as a gold member and the counter staff was friendly and helpful.  Process was easy and quick. No annoying sales tactics.  The minivan was ready to go.  The only reason for 4 stars is because the car could have been washed better but the inside was relatively clean.\n\nDrop off service was a breeze. No issues.
