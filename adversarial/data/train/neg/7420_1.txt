4 Stars for the price to food quality.  The food was great for the price you pay.  The bar has decent priced drinks as well.\n\nHOWEVER....\n\nThis place is in the ghetto vortex of the strip.  You know that place from M&Ms world until Planet Hollywood?  That is the ghetto vortex.  Tattoo parlors, porn slappers galore, bums cursing at you for not smiling (really?), those creepy statue people, some lady at a stall trying to sell a towel that wraps around a woman's waist (reallyx2?), some dude with a shirt that has LEDs on it (kinda like an updated bedazzle), and another dude trying to get me to go to the Grand Canyon.  They will ask me \"you wanna go to the Grand Canyon?\"  The best thing to do is to reply with a \"you wanna go to [insert horrible city here]?\"  I usually use Port Arthur, TX.  This area of the strip reminds me of the part of the Thriller video where the zombies come out of nowhere and scare the hell out of the girl...then MJ turns into a zombie for some reason....everybody dances and things get annoying.  The ghetto vortex is like that.  Kinda creepy and very annoying.\n\nWatch out for the ghetto vortex and eat a burger at Fatburger.  It is a nice change from the fine-dining expensive restaurants.
