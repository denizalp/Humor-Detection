The truth is - every review comparing this place to a \"cafeteria\" is right on money. The seating, quality of food, presentation of ALL dishes in an aluminum bowl, and the tiny plastic utensils all reminded me of a school lunch! No hair nets in sight, but were likely within reach. I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone with moderately advanced taste buds. Only those who want to give this novelty restaurant (and their bodies) a try- and even then I'd recommend the Phoenix location. The cookies were, however, surprisingly good!
