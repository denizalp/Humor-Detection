This was our second time here. They use to be at the M Resort, but moved to Rio. I am not sure if the relocation of the restaurant has caused the service to go down hill, but it was the worse. Our waitress took our order in a rush, had someone else drop it off, and brought the bill right after. Never checked to see how we were doing or anything. \n\nI have no complaints towards the food, since it was delicious. Last time I got Andy's safe fried chicken farm Benedict, and it amazing. The fried chicken and Benedict had a great transition of flavors. \n\nThis time I got the the farm scrambler with hardwood smoked bacon, avocado. Very delicious and exceptional. \n\nThe food is amazing, but the service sucks. Gave it 4 stars because the food is so good.
