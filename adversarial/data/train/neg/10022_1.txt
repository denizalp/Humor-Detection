I wanted  to treat my friend to an Italian dinner for her birthday. I had high expectations because of the reviews. Maybe it was the off night but, both of us ordered penne primavera  and both of us thought that it lacked significantly in flavour. I couldn't taste any spices, if at all. I had to garnish my dish with pepper and mozzarella quite a bit but, it still wasn't palatable. Disappointed.\n\nIn addition, the restaurant is on a smaller side so, the noise level was very loud. Not the best place if you want to have a chit chat. also, I want to add that I went on a Friday night.
