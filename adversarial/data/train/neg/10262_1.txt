Yum! Yogurtini is delicious! I like the suggested mixes on the board. I do not like the line of contemplating customers who feel the need to sample every single flavor but that comes with the territory when you frequent yogurt shops. I love the mint flavor with some dark chocolate chips and andes mint bits.
