I moved to BM almost a year ago and cannot say enough good things.  I'm about to renew for another year!  I really like it here, and I don't say that lightly because I'm a nester at heart who divorced and sold a big, beautiful house.\n\nThe property is well appointed, well maintained, quiet, and convenient.  The rooftop pool and common areas are nicely decorated and comfy.  The gym is adequate.  I appreciate the \"no smoking\" policy because I like opening my windows and balcony door without the risk of a neighbor's smoke wafting into my apartment.  (And don't move here thinking you'll get away with sneaking it because the office is adamant about enforcing the rules.  Huge plus.)\n\nComplaints?  The parking situation is not ideal because the garage is shared with the retail shops, and parking is sometimes tight.  Many of the parking spaces are \"compact\" so, out of necessity, cars are frequently double-parked.  There's a private garage with a limited number of spaces that residents can pay a monthly fee ($100?) to access.  I don't love having to schlep my stuff up the elevator from my car but such is life in a mid-rise building.  Also, the 24-hour complimentary coffee machine only seems to work part-time.  Oh, and the building's fire alarm has triggered (despite NO fire) every few months which sets off a mind-bending shriek from alarms in your apartment.\n\nThe staff here is FABulous.  Samantha is cheerful and exceedingly helpful, and if I needed an employee of my own I'd hire her away.  Tara, the manager, understands customer service and the concept of rewarding good, loyal residents.  The maintenance guys, CJ, Brian, and Vernon, are sweet, accommodating, and very responsive.  They go above and beyond their job descriptions to help residents.\n\nThe turnkey lifestyle here is ideal.  One phone call for all maintenance issues, and nothing to worry about when I leave town.  Ahhhh.
