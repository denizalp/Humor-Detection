This guy was AMAZING! I called at 7am in desperate need of an alternator swap. Within 30 minutes he was here at my work swapping it out for me. I couldn't believe how quickly he came to help me and was very personable. I had already purchased the part and in less than an hour he not only got it swapped but noticed another problem with the fuse box and was able to fix it on the spot for me for no additional cost. I am SOOOO grateful for him, I didn't know what I was going to do. THANKS SOOOO MUCH!
