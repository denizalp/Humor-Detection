I started going to Jolie's Place because they are across the street from my dog groomer and they open early.  I could pop in there for breakfast and a drink while I waited for my dog. I have always had excellent service and even ended up hiring one of the bartender's band for a gig. Jolie is friendly and welcomes everyone.
