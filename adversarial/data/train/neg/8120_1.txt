Food was pretty good. Everyone in our party was satisfied with their sandwiches and my southern chicken sandwich was actually quite good, with a good portion of chicken and served on a tasty jalapeno roll. Fries were decent. They are cut like thinly sliced steak fries, but nothing special. What mostly left me unimpressed with this place was overall service. On a Monday night, we were one of five tables with customers in a mostly empty restaurant. The bartender promptly took drink orders but our waitress took a while to get food order. I'm not sure if her shift ended as food was delivered by another gentlemen. He was very friendly but it took a while to order a second round for the group. I guess I just assumed service would be a little faster, especially with the place not being busy at all. Place seems like it could be a good spot to grab a drink and some bar food while watching the game, but my initial experience was just ok.
