DANIEL G NEEDS TO BE PROMOTED...\n\nMy hubby took me here as a surprise because we like to try new places (new to us). We had horrible service (which will be a separate review by my husband), but I wanted to post a review about our Food Server Assistant Daniel G.\nHe saved the day for our visit, because he was polite, smiled, had a great personality and helped us more than our own server did.\nDaniel's goal is to be a server, and he is working his way up to that point, but in my opinion Daniel G. should be put into a server position and the server we had should go back for more training.
