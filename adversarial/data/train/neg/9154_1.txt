Have the Bloody Mary! \nThe chili, burgers and \"Quad Fries\" were really good but the standout is the scratch made Bloody Mary. WOW! It was the best I've had in years made and served by \"ShareForFlavorTown\" And, with the garnish, it's a meal all by itself. How do I post a photo? The service was absolutely outstanding.
