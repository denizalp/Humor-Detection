One stop shop in the East Valley for your shooting needs. While I don't care much for indoor ranges, this one is done very well, with a good selections of rentals so you can 'try before you buy'. While I never attended one, they do host several shooting matches which provides shooters an exciting departure from standing square and punching holes in a paper Target.\n A good selection of firearms and accessories with gunsmithing services on site.  Most important though is there knowledgeable and friendly staff that won't intimidate anyone new to firearms. \nI have taken their CCW classes and reccommend it to all. It's not the cheapest in town but their firearm simulator (video training system like the police train shoot or don't shoot situations) is worth the price alone. And having the range at the same location as the class room is real convenient - like I said, it's a one stop shop!
