One of my favorite hotels in Las Vegas. In the land of over the top, this place is king. My favorite feature is the grand canal which, if you ask me, might actually be an improvement over the murky waters of the real Venetian Canals. All they need is pushy Italian men walking around. We were there right after Christmas, so the decorations were still up and it was pretty nice to walk around and take in all the sites. Just make sure you have comfortable shoes on because this place is massive. There are multiple food courts with pretty reasonable options for families on a budget or for people looking for a quick bite. Pepper Chicken at Panda Express is my jam
