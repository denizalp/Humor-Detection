I've had a bad experiences with shady dentists before and this was one of them.  I had been to my own dentist in California not less than 8 months before seeing Dr. Tounian so I knew my teeth were in good shape.  All I wanted was to get the exam\/X-rays\/cleaning for $40 and start a new relationship since I had recently moved to Vegas, but deeply disappointed with his dishonesty.  Like others, I did not get the cleaning as advertised because Dr. Tounian said I needed scaling and planing.  That's an extremely aggressive deep cleaning (not to mention expensive) and my own dentist in California confirmed that not only was it unnecessary but would damage the enamal on my teeth, aggravate my gums and way beyond what I needed.  Dr. Tounian also told me that I needed a couple fillings and a crown that would've put me over $2k worth of work.  Those claims were also confirmed to be false by my dentist as my teeth are in good shape.  On top of everything, when I asked for copies of my X-rays from Floss Dental I got 1\" square paper photo copies.  What is my dentis going to do with those besides have a good laugh?  Steer clear of any dentist with low pricing.  It's never a good sign.  Needless to say, I'll be driving to California to stay with my old dentist since he seems to be the last living honest one left.
