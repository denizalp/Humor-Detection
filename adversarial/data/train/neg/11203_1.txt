I joined the Fitness Nation boot camp about 2 months ago. I was very nervous and thought I would not be able to do it. When I joined, the trainers and members were very welcoming. The trainers modified the workouts for me as I was new and made sure my posture was right (which in many other places I have not seen)! They are extremely knowledgeable, supportive and fun to work with! As much as you want the results, they want it for you too.\n\n The best part about all of this is that you are a part of a family,  all the members and trainers are very down to earth, everyone motivates one another and there is no intimidation from anyone. Everyone goes at their own pace and are cheerleaders to each other.\n\nI never liked the gym and I thought it was boring and that's why I always kept on quitting, now at the boot camp, I get restless if I don't go for a day or two!! I am 100% motivated thanks to Fitness Nation and the results are already showing!  Love love LOVE Donovan, Marc, and Rogers!
