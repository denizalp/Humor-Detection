Sad, Sad, Sad. This place is very expensive, total bill $18.03. \nFour of us doing a test taste.\nWe ordered 1 double burger $7.29 with cheese $0.99 bacon $0.99 (bacon was slimy, yuck!) lettuce and tomato $0.59. On my receipt it says- add wedge lettuce and tomato, there was no wedge it was a sad piece of old lettuce and a slice of tomato. The total cost of the burger was $9.86. We were not impressed at all. We've had amazing burgers for under $7.00. (See my other reviews for that information).\nAlso, ordered 1 Chocolate Shake $3.99, it was okay. It tasted like drinking Hershey chocolate syrup out of the bottle and then (drum roll) one amazing Strawberry Shake $3.99. The Strawberry Shake was outstanding. The only reason why we gave them 2 stars is because of the Strawberry Shake. I migth stop in for a Strawberry Shake in the future but nothing else.
