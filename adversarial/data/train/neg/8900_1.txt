My friend does some catering with them so they allowed four of us to come in and try out the restaurant before it opened.  It's in a great South Park location where Manzetti's used to be.\n\nThey started us off with chips and dip which included a warm basket of chips, hot salsa as in heated not spicy hot, and a side of pureed guac.  Everyone liked the warm salsa and guac.\n\nFor apps we had the Brisket Nachos and Bottle Caps which were a combination of deep fried pickles and jalapenos with chipolte sauce...tasty!  The nachos consisted of about 10 nachos each with a piece of brisket on top with cheese etc.  Both apps were good and priced in the $8-10 range each.  The apps portion sizes weren't huge but eveyone was able to get a taste of each.\n\nFor entrees we had the Ambushed Shrimp and Brisket Tacos.  The 9 shrimp were bacon wrapped with a cheese topping.  The entree came with slaw and rice for $18.  A tad pricey but very good!  The brisket tacos are avaiable in hard or soft shell with rice, beans, and slaw and received a thumbs up.  The tacos are approx $12.  \n\nFor dessert we had one Tres Leches for the whole table.  I must say it was some of the best I've ever had.\n\nThey brought out our bill for 4 which also included 8 Dos Equis beers for a total of $122 not including tip.  Our friend took care of the bill but we left a nice tip for our great waiter.  We collectively gave it 3 stars due to the upper end pricing for tex-mex but if your looking for something a little different it's definitely worth a try :)!
