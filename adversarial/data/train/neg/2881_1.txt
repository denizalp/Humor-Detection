This review is only for the sushi bar!\n\nThe first time I was here, the sushi tasted AMAZING! The Baked Alaska Roll was topped with salmon that had a smoky taste, which gave the roll an extra kick. I've came back twice to get the same roll, but it no longer had the smoky taste...perhaps it was by accident that the first time tasted so perfect!\n\nI've also had the Boston Roll, Hanalei Roll, Pittsburgh Penguin Roll, and probably a couple more.. don't remember. They consistently have a good balance of ingredients and sauce. \n\nPresentation was great. Last time, I had my rolls spread out on the plate in the shape of a giant flower hehe\n\nService was always fine, never have to wait too long for the dishes. I always come here if I'm in the area.. even if I've already had dinner, just to get a sushi roll to-go!
