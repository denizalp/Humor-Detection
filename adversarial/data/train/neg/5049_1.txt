Located in the Cosmopolitan, it was easy to find with a 20 min line as expected. This was my second visit - I remembered loving my sandwich on my first visit months earlier so this time I brought friends. \n\nSadly, the sandwich was mediocre, no delicious flavor like i had remembered and my friend's Egg Slut entree with an egg over pur√©ed potatoes in a jar was bland (and a small portion for the price!) \n\nI asked for salt and pepper but to my surprise, they didn't have pepper. Surprising for a breakfast joint. \n\nI'll be exploring other breakfast venues next time I'm in Vegas.
