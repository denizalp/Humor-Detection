After a few months of service hiccups Famous Dave's on Flamingo got it right. It's perfect for Saturday lunch when the crowds are not too heavy. The baked potato for lunch is my favorite and you have to kick it off with fried pickles. \n\nHaving the packaged hand wipes on the table is a great move. Anyone can clean up after the meal because sometimes you just gotta lick your fingers here.
