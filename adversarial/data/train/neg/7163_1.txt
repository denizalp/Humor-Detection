My husband and I had dinner here tonight and we were very disappointed. After we got sat and ordered a drink we noticed they had birds flying around inside. When we mentioned it to the wait staff she laughed and said \"if you catch it you can keep it.\" They didn't seem to care at all. I was ready to leave after that but my husband wanted to give it a try. The table next to us left right when we got there but their dirty plates sat there for about 20 mins and they were not even busy. My husband ordered a rare steak and they served him a medium one. He isn't one to complain or make a big deal so he just ate it. One bite into our meals and the server came to ask how it was then we saw her once to refill our drinks when we were pretty much done. We had to ask the manager for a box and our check. After the manager gave us a box she came by to give us free shots. My husband and I both agreed that the shots were the best tasting thing we had and the brussel sprouts we got for an appetizer. I will say when our server was waiting on us she was friendly and the manager.
