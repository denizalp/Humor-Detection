The place is convenient for a quick meal before a game or concert but the menu is not that creative and meals are standard offering with no uniqueness.  Our service was acceptable and understandable slower than normal since they were super busy mainly due to location. They need to update the menu and really focus on better appetizers and better sandwich offerings.
