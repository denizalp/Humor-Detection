It is a wonder that when what potentially best differentiates shopping in person versus shopping online is the human touch of customer service.  Even in a busy shop the employees can make a sincere attempt at acknowledging and being attentive to customers who are waiting, but it was not my experience today at Bartle and Gibson.  To be fair it seems that plumbing showroom customer service is generally very poor.  For those interested I definitely recommend you shave and wear a shirt and tie to attract the attention of the staff.\n\nToday, I regret that I picked out the units I wanted and am just ordering on Amazon.  There is nothing you can get here that you can't just order online.
