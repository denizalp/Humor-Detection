This is a nice place to hang out as well as get a bite to eat.  The food is much better than your typical bar, and the drinks are generous and reasonably priced.\n\nThe service is excellent and if you come often enough, your drink will be served without you even asking for it.\n\nSome of the kinks mentioned in earlier reviews have been worked out and Lou's seems to be happy to be a neighborhood joint where half the people in the place walk to it.
