Definitely a fan of the sandwiches here. Very reliable lunch spot in an area where there are very few quality options. \n\nKnocking them a point down for two reasons: 1) the sandwiches are about a dollar overpriced for what you get, and 2) they switch the menu up a little too often (I miss the old grilled chicken sandwich they made).
