Went to this restaurant for the first time after it changed owner.  This is an upscale restaurant and it reflects on the prices of the dim sum..  I took a photo of the dim sum menu, it looks very nice and show pictures of some of the dim sum. One can enlarge the menu and can clearly see the description of the items. The entrance is vastly improved from the old one.  The decor is good and service is good too.  The quality of the dim sum is a mix bag, based on what we ordered, see photos.  Overall, we have a good experience and will definitely go back again.
