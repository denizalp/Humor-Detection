After a couple restaurant iterations at this location, Primanti's is an ideal fit for the space and surrounding 'hoods. The diverse crowd and continual take-out orders are healthy signs for longevity if you aren't already a convert to their \"Almost Famous\" sammies that helped put da 'burgh on the map. At happy hour with your large half-off beer, you'll be lucky to get two sips in before the larger than life sandwich appears...even before the appetizers! The service is quick and can be overly attentive depending on the server. Not a bad \"problem\" to have, really. For a bite filled with your choice o' meat, fresh cut fries, sweet 'n sour slaw, cheese + tomato you're going to have to mash down the Italian bread (and\/or cut it in half), but it will be so worth it. FWIW, their pizza is actually quite good, but their wings are on the smallish side and sometimes not the greatest quality...oh and my kid is partial to their hamburger. For the real deal hunters, late night is where it's at. All the aforementioned n'at for $5 at 5 after 10:00 (time & grub vary by location). You can't tap into your inner yinzer more than breakin' bread at your local James Beard award-winning Primanti Bruthas! 4-1-2 stand up!
