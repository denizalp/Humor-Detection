Our favorite \"must\" while in Vegas. My husband has Celiac and nothing makes him happier than enjoying done amazing gf fried chicken once a year. It's crispy and juicy and you don't even miss the gluten. And you have to try the butter lettuce mango salad. It will turn the pickiest of eaters into a salad lover. The service here is beyond amazing. Everyone is so friendly and attentive. A dirty dish never sat on our table for more than a few minutes.
