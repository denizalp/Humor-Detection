I've been to this location few times, and 1\/3 of the times they forget something. Ive had it at this location. Might just stop B.K. entirely. Not only did the rep had to repeat the order 3 or 4 times on the microphone, messed it up at the window, waited 10 mins before being asked to park at the front. Waiting another 10 minutes, no apologies for major delay. Then I get home to realize order on onion rings missing after repeating it 3x, then to open Whopper w\/ Cheese, but no cheese and double side same bun. So I tried to called the location 3x, no pick up, no manager. Contacted the Burger King Corporate, still nothing 48 hrs later. I wont worry about horrible service, sad case of people that can't take a simple order and have it delivered in timely fashion.. Guess Fast Food isn't so fast any more.  This place has officially lost all my business.
