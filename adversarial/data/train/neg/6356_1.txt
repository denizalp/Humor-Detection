As I take time to write updates and additional business reviews, All American deserves an update. I wanted to add that almost a year later, everything we purchased from All American still looks as good as the day we bought it! My initial review didn't list the extent of our purchase - significant in quantity of chairs, tables and umbrellas. We never cover it and only need to spot clean or wipe down any bird droppings or dust. Every piece we bought looks great and functions perfectly. And if it's possible, it's even more comfortable as it gets broken in!
