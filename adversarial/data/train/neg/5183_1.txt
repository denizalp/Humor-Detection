We went there few months ago. The waiter was so inefficient and seemed inexperienced. She never checked on us to ask if we did like the food or if we need anything. The food itself taste good but the portion is a JOKE!!! Very small portion in relation to the price you pay. Not only that, with there rude service they deduct gratuity from the total check too. \nI think they should improve their service and increase the food portion!
