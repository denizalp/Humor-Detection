Saw this place on Check Please Arizona so the wife and I decided to try it out for dinner on a Friday. We didn't quite know what to make of it walking in. It had an odd sports bar, family dining, casual upscale feel to it. Sounds strange I know but I don't know how else to describe it. We were seated right away though and the staff was friendly, the service timely, and the food outstanding! I had the Rigatoni Con Carne and my wife had the meatloaf. I'd probably wash dishes for a week to get the recipe for mine and the meatloaf was just about as good based on the one taste I had and what my wife had to say about it after (I know right ... meatloaf?!). Can't speak to any of the negative reviews but as for my wife and I, we'll definitely be visiting them again.
