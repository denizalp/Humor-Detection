Open 24 hours! Convenient location when I'm commuting into North Mississauga, but a little out of the way if you live in downtown Brampton. Found some good deals on meat in the past, and most of their prices are in line with the rest of the grocery chain world. Definitely not a discount store, as it features everything you'd expect in a full service grocery store, but they don't charge you a price premium for 24 hour access like some chains seem to.
