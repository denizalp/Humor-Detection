I was uneasy about my appointment here bc of the previous yelp comments. I went in expecting the worse yet hoping for the best. Let me tell you I was very very pleased with my appt. Hannah was beyond amazing ! She listened to me, understood my likes and dislikes and was so simple to talk to. I definitely recommend this place to anyone. Yes the prices are a bit high but what they carry is beyond beautiful. Definitely worth the price on the tag. Thanks again Hannah! You rock!!
