Very good and very consistent. More expensive than the chain pizza stores but worth it. We normally just get pizza (take-out) but have tried various sandwiches, pastas, salads and appetizers. I can't think of a thing we've been disappointed with except for a few burnt garlic knots once. They are our go-to restaurant when I don't feel like cooking but still want to eat at home, which is usually once a week.
