Is a small restaurant in a small plaza north of dundas in hwy 10. About a dozen tables and 9 food items on their menu.  They do the 9 items well though.  One of the best places in mississauga for soon tofu.  Different levels of spicy to choose from and protein choices. \n\nTheir extra spicy is perry good but lots of stomach burning after!  Their soon tofu soups come with hot pot rices (the purple Multigrain kind), although sometimes they use the stone put and then put it in a bowl for you instead of serving it.  I think they are short supplies for the busy times.\n\nSides dishes (banchan) are great and fresh.  Always ask for more if you want ;)\n\nService is polite and straight forward. Water and utensils always at the table. \n\nSolid!
