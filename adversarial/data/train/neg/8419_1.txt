On our girls trip to Vegas, Border Grill was our first stop. I've eaten there before and loved it and my friend has a wheat allergy and their menu is clearly marked for her. I brought her here specifically because the service had been nothing short of amazing on my previous trip. Our server did not disappoint! She took time going over the menu with us, making recommendations and helping us decide. The service was perfect. And the food....absolutely wonderful. I will visit this place every time I am in Vegas. The food is amazing and the staff make you feel special!
