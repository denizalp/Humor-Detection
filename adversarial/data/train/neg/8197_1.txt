I did my homework... went on 4 consultations and decided on  Dr. Leverett. So HAPPY with my choice! His bedside manner is unmatched. He actually cares about his patient's outcome. \nI found him humbled, attentive and always concerned about my situation. Jessica is fabulous. She was available to answer all of my concerns and went up and above to make sure I had the best care. Thank you.
