Very professional staff. Did a web inquiry and they returned my call within the hour to set up an appointment. Came over, explained to the electrician what I wanted and he got started right away. 4 hours later, rewiring my surround sound from one wall, through the attic, into another wall, he was done. very professional and very reasonably priced. $250 charged by the hour. great job! i highly recommend them!
