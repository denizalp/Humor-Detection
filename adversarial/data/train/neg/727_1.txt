Super disappointing... hot and sour soup tastes like white pepper with corn starch, combo fried rice wasnt good at all, hardly any flavor, pot stickers were mediocre at best, chow mein was not even as good as panda express.... the only decent thing was the orange chicken. This is probably the worst $60 meal I have ever bought through uber eats. Anyone that says their food is good might want to seek a doctor about theirbtaste buds not working or try a real Chinese restaurant.
