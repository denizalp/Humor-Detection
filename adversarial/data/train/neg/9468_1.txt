Four of us came here for some desserts. \n\nThis is a lovely place to spend a nice time with friends. Although the place is quite small, the staff is extremely friendly and the decor is clean and modern. \n\nThey offer sweet and savoury crepes, desserts and cakes. Crepes and waffles was amazing. We came out very satisfied. Again, a really nice place to have the relaxing moment with friends.
