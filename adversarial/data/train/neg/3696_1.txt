Live close-ish to Kokame and was less than happy with earlier experience a few years ago.  Big difference (for the better).  Fresh food, good quality rice, fresh seafood (hwae\/sashimi) and almost friendly service.  Had hwae-dup-bap (sashimi don - sashimi salad with cho gochuchang) which was decent, except the cho gochuchang was way too sweet for my taste.  Observed other dishes which looked very good.  The kimchi was delicious, fish was fresh and nicely cut and they served a good quality green tea.  I will be back, for sure.  They are on the right track in terms of food quality.  Also seemed to be a very nice clientele which always makes the dining experience more pleasurable - i.e. no shrieking babies and cell phones ...
