I have been a regular MAC makeup user for years! I love MAC makeup, but I dread this store location. Although I was just a few miles away and made the effort to fight the mall crowd to get to this store I still found myself driving to the Biltmore location to get service, any service! By the way, I love the Biltmore location and go there regularly for my MAC needs, the staff is great and extremely attentive and helpful. Every time I go to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location it takes several minutes before I am acknowledged in a store as big as my bathroom. The staff are always rude and short with me. Today I walked in the store and stood in the middle of it for over 15 minutes without being acknowledged by any of the 7 staff members. A few looked at me a few times and then continued to ignore me. After about 5 minutes of that I asked a woman for help and she said \"I see you.\" and that was it. All I wanted was one lousy bronzer and I walked out with nothing... No bronzer and no service! I will not even consider this location after today. The longer drive to anywhere else is worth it.
