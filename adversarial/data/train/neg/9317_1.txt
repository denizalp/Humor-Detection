My wife and I hired Hutchcraft to move to our new home. The next day, my wife's engagement and wedding ring were \"missing\". Come to find out, one of the movers is a criminal. The mover has 2 outstanding warrants from 2017; how was this guy hired by Hutchcraft? Hutchcraft hasn't apologized for hiring a criminal and has victim shamed my wife. \n\nDON'T DO BUSINESS WITH HUTCHCRAFT!! You never know if there will be a criminal in your house
