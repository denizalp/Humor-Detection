We went for my husbands birthday, and they did not disappoint. We came in and it was aloha hour so we got a tempura roll and martinis. The drinks were great, and the roll was amazing. When we sat down they had inserts in the menu saying happy birthday to my husband. The server was amazing. She was knowledgeable about the menu and the ingredients.  And they ended the meal with a happy birthday coconut cake. This is a definitely a place to go, special occasion or not. We will be back on our next Vegas trip.
