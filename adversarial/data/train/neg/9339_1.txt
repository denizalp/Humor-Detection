Not sure if anybody has discovered this Hooters as it was fairly empty on a Friday night. Great drink specials during the 2-6pm happy hour and beyond. You can get a shock Top pint and domestics for $2 and most other craft beers for 3 bucks. The chalkboard has other deals after HH ends and yesterday it was Corona for $3 a bottle. They have all the sports packages and Yankees game was turned on quickly. The two bartenders that night were attractive and talkative as well. Still, can't pull the trigger on food, but might try some mozzarella sticks during HH next time, which are four bucks.
