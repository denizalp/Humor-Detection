This was my seconds time here. \nI bought 4 bagels-spinach cheese, sour dough, cranberry bagels,  half lb lox cream cheese and strawberry cream cheese, black&white cookies and\n, chocolate rugulach, apricot rugulach. \n\nThe spinach bagel was ok. \nThe chocolate rugulach was a bomb. Soft and chewy. Plenty of chocolate but not overly sweet.
