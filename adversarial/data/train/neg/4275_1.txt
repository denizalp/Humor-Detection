Went here for the Calgary Big Taste and did the $35 dinner menu 3-course meal. I was a little hesitant on how I would feel since a lot of fine-dining restaurants have the risk of not living up to the hype. But I have to say, I was more than impressed with Q Haute. The menu changes everyday but they ask you what you like\/dislike and any allergies. It was supposed to be a 3-course but they give you a snack in the beginning to wake up your taste buds and then they gave us macarons along with the bill. It has great ambiance and the staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. Very romantic atmosphere if you are planning for a special date night. Highly recommend!
