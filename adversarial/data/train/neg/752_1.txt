We contacted Costco for new flooring - saw a demonstration in the store of waterproof wood-look flooring. Joe was our sales person. We have a very large downstairs and the decision on what style flooring to use was very hard. Joe was super patient with us. He understood what a big decision this was. We went with quality vinyl plank. Then, the hard decision of which color and style. Joe went over the choices with us, then left samples for us to move around the house. After a lot of effort, we still couldn't decide between two choices. Joe brought out a box of each so we could really see what it would look liked. That helped so much!  We are very happy with our floor and thankful for Joe's assistance.   He was knowledgeable, helpful, patient, and truly a man of his word. I would work with Joe again. He helped us and advised us through the entire process. Thanks, Joe!!
