This place is awesome! We used to go to the Good Egg for bkfast but that place went downhill. This is our new bkfast place. Food is always excellent & service is very good. We've been there w\/ a toddler & infant & they get us our food very quickly! Highly recommend the pancakes (they're huge!) & the biscuits & gravy. My hubby likes the bkfast burrito.
