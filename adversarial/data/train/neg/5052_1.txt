This is the spot to be early afternoon when you're in Pittsburgh. Any Pittsburgh sports clothing you are looking for is here for a decent price. The farmer's marketing is the reason I visit the Strip. I have found strawberries for $1! You can't beat those prices.\n\nThere are also boutqiues and other markets to browse through. Parking can be kind of a pain, but it is always worth it! The stores typically close early, but there is some nightlife. The Altar Bar, a popular music venue, has bands playing most nights.
