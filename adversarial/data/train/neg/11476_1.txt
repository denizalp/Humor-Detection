I hate writing this review because the first few months I went there the service was great! Needless to say the more I went the shittier the meals were prepared. My last 4 meals were lacking. I always asked for two extra tortillas which they did until last 4 meals. It started with them giving me two small tortillas then on 2nd and 3rd no tortillas whatsoever. My 4th and last meal I got my tortillas but completely fucked up my burrito bowl like they didn't give a shit. Don't know what happen. Wont be going there anymore.
