Went here this morning with my step dad. The atmosphere is pleasant, the wait staff is friendly and helpful and happily answered our questions. The prices are good to.\nI had the Supreme Chicken Omlet with a side of grits (8.65), while my stepdad had the Spinach and feta omlet with steak fries and a grilled bisquet (8.15). The food is excellent and I will definitely be back. \nI highly recommend this place.
