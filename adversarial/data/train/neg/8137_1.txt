Bookmans has a large selection of books, CD's and other miscellaneous items. The cool thing is that you will never know what you will find on a visit to this store. It's an exchange based store so there will be times when they may not have what you are looking for. The staff could use a little help because if you are looking for an item they seem to shy away from wanting to help. I understand that it is not the store's fault but, some very strange characters are attracted to this store.
