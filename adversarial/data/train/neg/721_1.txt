Came here for brunch - at first I was disappointed by the small menu, but I loved my food! I had the BLT with a Caesar salad and a virgin Caesar (my favorite) and my partner had the French toast. My partner is a meat eater, and we both LOVED our food. The service was fast and efficient and the portions were great. \n\nI also came for dinner and had the beef sandwich, pouting and chili cheese fries. Was pleased with everything! I recommend coming early because there is a big line up and sitting at the door can get a bit loud and windy.
