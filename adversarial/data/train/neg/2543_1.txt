Upon entering this store, I found this place to be very cluttered and disorganized. The staff here is lacks knowledge but overall is friendly. However? I could not give this place two stars due to the fact that they refused to sell me an item that I know is completely legal. I could basically buy anything in that store but one item. \n\nI find that this place could really could do better if the prices were a lot more competitive unlike the ad that is placed outside of Sahara that everything states that everything is 30 percent off and that the employees should be current with Nevada law.
