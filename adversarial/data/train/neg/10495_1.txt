Stopped in the other night with my neighbor on our nightly walk.  Was very impressed with decor inside.  A bit noisy to talk, but great appetizers and drinks!  We had two wines and a plate of frites.  Nicely crisp potatoes with three different dipping sauces - a curry ketchup, a garlic aoili and chimichuri, very tasty.  We had eaten dinner before our walk so didn't sample the food but the menu is very interesting with lots of good choices.  Our barmate sampled the scallops which he  felt were outstanding!  They were nice and big and looked juicy. \n\nGreat choice of wine, beer and cocktails!\n\nTheir happy hour is $2 off everything, including cocktails!  Check it out! We are definitely going back for more! \n\nOPEN TILL 2 AM!  \n\nSHOUT OUT TO BRONSON the Bartender!  Very attentive!
