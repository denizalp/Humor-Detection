This place was fine, until my friend hit a kid in the face, got flipped off and then was threatened by the dad, he then came over and told me what happened, and we almost got escorted out, the rest of the time, we were repeatedly yelled at for stupid thing's, at one point I hurt my knee bad and was laying there and the manager yelled at me to get up... Not seeing if I was alright, just wanting me out of there. Would not recommend, go to gravady instead.
