My first bad brow experience left me with painful raw skin above and below my eyebrows. The lady was nice but just played it off like it was normal that my skin was so red afterwards. Plus I had to pay an extra dollar because I used a card, and I stupidly tipped her. Never going back!\n\nUpdate: got a full refund and they were very nice and professional.
