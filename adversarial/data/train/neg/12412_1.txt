I thought of giving 1 star but their Nachos are good so 2 stars. Flys in dine area sitting in the food is a big turn off and 1 of the side plate they served is not clean, not sure how it made it to customer table as the first rule of the restaurant is to wipe the plates with a clean cloth immediately once they are out of dishwasher(I worked in few restaurants while I am studying). In this case that was not done. Coming back to Fly, it touched all my food and I simply stopped eating after that. Simply bad experience.
