Is it weird to say I'm addicted to Brazilians' results? So I started coming to European wax about nine months ago. The first time I met Alesha I was obviously extremely nervous and awkward to have my first one done, but she is the bombbbbb. She walks you through everything, answers all questions, gives you tips, and overall makes you feel at ease. She's honest about everything and will tell you step by step what is going on.  She always takes care of me every time I'm there.  \n\nShe recommended the EWC serum to help prevent bumps and in-growns as well as the sensual strut (smells amazing) scrub to exfoliate and help slow the growth of hair.  Both products can be a bit pricey, BUT so worth it. I have seen such a big difference using both products and I bought each of them month ago and I'm still on my first bottles.\n\nAlesha is my girl, everybody needs to book an appointment with her !
