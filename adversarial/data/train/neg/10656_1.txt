This store seriously has THE MOST RUDEST EMPLOYEES, EVER!  When they \"greet\" you upon entering the store, you can tell they're so miserable like they hate their life. I was next in line to check out and this nice lady before me was asking the cashier (Starla) if they had a certain product in stock. The cashier was so rude about it, wasn't even paying attention to the lady, kept rolling her eyes and sighing heavily. This is all she said to the nice lady \"wellllll you can Google it\". After she was done ringing her up the lady told her \"Have a great day\" and rude ass starla replied \"mmhmm, bye\". She was also expecting the customers to put away the baskets for her....not our job.  Employees with poor customer service and poor personalities. No wonder she works there.
