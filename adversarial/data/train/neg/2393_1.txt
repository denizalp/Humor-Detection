I went to happy dog with my family last weekend and I had so much fun. On my hot dog I got cheese,chili,spagetiohs,cream cheese and nacho cheese. It was very yummy. We also got Tator tots. When I got my hot dog it looked humungous. I tried it and it was very good. Also my waitress was very nice. It was very cheap too.
