If you don't dine at Morcilla, you're missing out on a great place! Our dinner was delicious and Michael, our bartender made our dining experience perfect. We had a great seat at the bar and received excellent attention and service by all. As a vegetarian I enjoyed the brussel sprouts and butter lettuce salad. My boyfriend also thought the brussel sprouts were delicious, however he said the ribs were fabulous! We'll be back soon.
