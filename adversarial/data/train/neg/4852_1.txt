The fried green tomatoes BLT won me over! So delicious and well balanced flavor in every bite. We also ordered the famous chicken and waffles, it was good but in my opinion too expensive! I love the spiced watermelons  that came with it. The yardbird benedict was also good but some of the biscuit underneath was undercooked. Deviled eggs had good flavors as well. And to top it off we had bacon donuts  yum! Mimosa was expensive as well at $15?! But then again you're in vegas. I would definitely dine here again.
