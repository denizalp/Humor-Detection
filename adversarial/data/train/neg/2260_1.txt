Kymmi did a great job with our ceremony. We eloped so had a very short time to plan and she made things very easy. During our phone consultation, she put me at ease right away and I felt like she knew exactly what we were looking for. Our ceremony was short and sweet - perfect for us. It definitely did not feel like a \"canned Vegas script\". Kymmi put thought and effort behind each and every word. She even researched some traditions we wanted incorporated into the ceremony and made it seem like she does them every day. We would highly recommend using her when you have the chance!
