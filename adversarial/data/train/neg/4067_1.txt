We have ordered from this restaurant multiple times and I would say this was your run of the mill Chinese restaurant. Nothing great and nothing terrible. \n\nOverall, it's pretty average. However, the one item I do not like is the lack of consistency. Often, the food is either really salty or really bland. I have no idea what goes on there.
