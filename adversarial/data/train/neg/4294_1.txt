What a cute store! Pratt's has all sorts of animals that you can't usually find in the same place. Everything is clean and organized and the animals look healthy and happy. The staff is helpful and the prices are good. Even if you're not yet in the market to buy it's a fun shop to visit and touch some of the animals. Definitely a good place to get supplies!
