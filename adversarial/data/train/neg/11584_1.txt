Finally a Chick Fil A that is close to where I live and work. Yeah! I think they are great. Really good chicken sandwich. Plain and simple. Although I do add mayo and mustard to it. Got to love waffle fries!!\nReally nice and clean. Of course they just built it and it opened on Monday so I would hope so. It is a grand opening so all the corporate guys are there handing out cookie samples and coupons for free breakfast sandwiches. Line moved really good. A little confusing when we first walked in but figured it out. That is what you get for just blindly getting in line behind someone. Not as mobbed as I was expecting given that it just opened. Got right to the front of the line and food came out pretty quick. We got our food to go, a coworker and I, and took it back to the office to enjoy it.\nI will definitely be back at lunch time or dinner time. Chick Fil A is great.\nPlus they get extra points for serving Coke Zero.
