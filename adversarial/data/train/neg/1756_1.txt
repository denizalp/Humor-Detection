It is what it is-- a fast food restaurant. The food is pretty dang good though. The macaroni salad is off the chain. The only problem is that the serve mystery fish. If you ask an employee, they will either say they don't know or that it's Mahi. Well, I can promise you- this is not Mahi. Stick with chicken and fried shrimp.
