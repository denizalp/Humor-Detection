This Autozone store is a lifesafer unlike some other locations in the Valley.\nI've received nothing less than 100% customer satisfaction every time I've stopped by in the last few years. It's a convenient 5-minute drive from work, so if there's anything I need for my car I can quickly stop by and not waste an hour. A year or so ago I purchased some headlights from here and had another AZ install one, and a dealership the other [because other AZ told me the driver's side was too small of a space for them to install]. \n\nSo lucky me recently that one headlight died and the other started fading. I thought the bulbs I purchased were going to last more than 12mo like my OEMs but they didn't. So I ran to this stop and was warmly greeted by the Asst Manager [sorry can't remember his name!] who let me know it wasn't just someone not wearing gloves during installation, it was the bulb style I purchased that led me down this literal darkened road. He helped me pick up the long-term bulb and as I pulled out my debit card, he told me to put that away as they'd comp them for me and my troubles. PLUS, he easily installed both within a few minutes [wearing gloves BTW]. \n\nThe guy made my day 2x over and I know to continue giving them my business.
