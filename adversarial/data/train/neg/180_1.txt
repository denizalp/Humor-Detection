This is the worst fast food restaurant i north Phoenix. I don't usually give places bad reviews but when Ive given this place numerous chances and everytime it disappoints than it needs to be addressed to others. Today's experience: \n\nThe #19: burrito and enchilada.\n\nOkay... What kind of burrito?!? And what kind of enchilada?!? \n\nSo I kindly ask, what kind.. And they answer as if your an idiot like we're supposed to magically know what kind of burrito it comes with. Secondly... I asked to add cheese to the burrito... And instead of beans and rice as the side just do double beans.\n\nWhen I get my order, I realized they overcharged me on top of the astronomical price of $10 for a burrito that came with meat, cheap ass cabbage and pico. They also didn't add cheese like I asked but added beans... Then instead of apologizing they said, we'll give us back the burrito and we're going to refund you the dollar we overcharged you then ask for an extra dollar after because they realized that they forgot to charge me for the extra cheese that they originally forgot to put on my burrito. This place is unfreaking real and extremely overpriced.
