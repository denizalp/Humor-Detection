Absolutely five star service and food!  My husband and I and a very small group of people decided on VG for lunch after our wedding. They accommodated our celebration and went above and beyond to make us feel special and welcome! Everything on the menu was phenomenal too. The atmosphere is classy and warm. Absolutely perfect for our special day!
