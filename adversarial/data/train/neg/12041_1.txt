In light of the options I had available to me, I was thrilled with having FliPhones get me sorted out. My iPhone 5 stopped charging completely and I was out of warranty by two months and not eligible for a phone upgrade for another 10 months....was looking as if I'd have to pay the full retail price for my phone....\n\nFor $49, the young guy at FliPhone replaced the charger port within 20 minutes and I was back on my way. He was friendly, efficient and he seemed quite legit. \n\nPhone is working perfectly. No complaints from me at all.
