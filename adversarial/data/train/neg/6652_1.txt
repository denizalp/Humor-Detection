Absolutely unreal bbq. I'm from Texas, so I know good brisket. I have never had better bbq. Get the fatty brisket and jalape√±o cheddar grits. The beef spare rib is somehow even better. Beans are great!  Smoked pecan pie. So, so good. I've been 7 or 8 times now and recommended it to many people. It never disappoints. Worth the wait. Just do it.
