Most of the food IS really good but also really expensive. The truffle fries are awesome and so is the mac & cheese burger. The fries they give you with the burger are throw aways and the pepperoni pretzel sticks aren't any good, especially for the price. \nI would give the place 4 to 5 stars if I hadn't met Guy Fieri last time we were there. He happened to be there, and we are huge fans. We didn't want to act star struck so we waited until the crowds had died down and he was near us. I went up to him, told him how we watch all his shows, make all his recipes, go to all the DDD restaurants. His response was, \"just snap your picture.\" I was shocked. Not even a thanks. I always thought he was such a nice down to earth guy. \nWe are locals and have been there a few times even though the prices are ridiculous because we wanted to support who we thought was a good guy. $15 for fries and $20 for a burger is not worth it to support someone who does not appreciate his fans. A celebrity wouldn't be one if it wasn't for their fans, and Guy Fieri lost two fans and customers that night.
