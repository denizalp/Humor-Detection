This place just made me a life long Lowe's customer.  I ordered a grill gazebo on line because they don't have any in store.  Had it delivered to the store or else I would have been charged a delivery fee.  When I went to the customer service desk she had to call in the back to find out that it was already up front in her area.  Then I have to listen about how someone else didn't do their job and mark it in the computer right.  I also found out that they will not give the military discount for items bought on line was told I don't have that button. (Lowe's does for you vets). \n\nSo now I take my cart of items I bought in the store  up to an open line start checking out and grab my military Id to show it and she points to a little 4\"x5\" sight that they can't process military in that line so I go to the next line and she says nope don't blame us we're just following rules turns out that there is only one line that military can go through now and that happened to be the one with a line. Great\n\nSo now I go outside to pull my truck and trailer up can barely squeeze in their are like 6 trucks parked in under the shelter but nobody is loading that's weird until I find out that they put up signs for pro parking under the shelter yep so 2 lanes for loading nope not anymore one is for parking and the hashed lined area had another truck and trailer in it.\n\nOn the positive side I found someone to help load when I got in there when I made the comment about people parking and not loading he told me well we know them and they come here all the time. \n\nSo I left I'm done with Home Depot if you are looking for me I'll be at Lowe's
