Went to the one in la years ago so the boyfriend and I decided to take his parents and brother here when they visited. Decor was trendy, very open compared to la's location but maybe it's because the one in la was a lot busier than this location. Servers, manager, bussers, and food runners were all very friendly and well trained. This place is all tapas so we ordered 15 plates for 5 people.\n\n- Falafel: very crispy! It was good but I wouldn't get it again \n- Bone marrow: big portion. Very tasty. Comes with mushrooms with I liked\n- Saut√©ed mushrooms: comes with a variety of different mushrooms, not sure what sauce it was but I loved it\n- Couscous: super fresh tasting. Great side dish \n- Grilled octopus: I liked the sauce that came with it, but I wish the octopus pieces were meatier \n- Beet salad: so fresh. Comes with 2 kinds of beets and avocados. I would get it again \n- Lamb chops: they didn't ask how we liked it cooked so it came out medium. I'd rather have it medium rare. It was just ok\n- Chicken kebab: on the dry side but flavoring made up for it. And dipping sauces made it less dry\n- Saffron rice: what I liked about the rice was it didn't taste oily or buttery like other places \n- Wagyu beef kebab: too overcooked for my liking but I like the seasoning \n- Lamb roast: definitely on the chewier side but I did like this dish the best out of all the meats. It came with couscous and some sauce that went well with it \n\nWe were completely stuffed with a total of 15 plates. They recommend 2-3 plates per person and I could have finished what was left but then I would've had a belly. It was a good full for everyone.
