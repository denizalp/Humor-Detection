We stopped there after a family photoshoot. My husband had heard good reviews from coworkers. Not only they had a friendly and fast service, the food was out of this world. One of the best persian food I have tasted in my life even though I have  been in many persian restaurants in GTA. We were impresed with portion sizes, taste, and quality of the service. Perfect place to invite friends for fancy dinner or a date night. I highyly recommend Darbar to all my persian friends.
