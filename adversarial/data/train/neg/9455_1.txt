We definitely weren't the easiest group, and I really appreciated the great service that we had last night.  Our party arrived noisily- 3 adults and 4 rather rambunctious kids. We asked to sit on their lovely, heated patio, but quickly realized that the kids were not going to be agreeable for a nice meal... so we opted to place an order to go. My son and I shared the yellow chicken curry and pad Thai. Both were fresh and flavorful with just the right amount of heat. You know it is good when a seven-year old asks for a third helping! I only wish there had been more rice... I have leftover curry to eat and we finished the rice last night! I'll be back for sure!
