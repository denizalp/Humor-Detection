Our experience with Nathan was nothing short of fantastic! As buyers we knew exactly what we wanted and once we found our perfect home, Nathan was there to close the deal. He was able to communicate with the builder, get us a private showing and we ended buying it! During our inspection period, there were some problems with the roof that he negotiated to be repaired. This particular builder is very popular in Arcadia and known for some of their custom features (pantry doors, front doors, laundry rooms, etc). We really wanted one of their custom shelves made from restored barnwood which wasn't in the blueprints for this particular property. He made sure that the shelving was supplied before close of escrow to complete the renovation!
