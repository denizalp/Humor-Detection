I am always amazed at how delicious this place is. I fell in love with Korean food here. I always order \"mee-Gaw-jun\" which is a spicy vegetable and shredded beef soup, served in a metal bowl. I would recommend their \"bi-bim-bop\" in a hot pot with raw egg! I love the tofu soup it's spicy as heck and I love spicy! If It isn't spicy, it's not worth eating!!!!! Also, the bulgogi beef is my 5 year olds favorite food. Try the seafood pancake too if you get a chance!!! My favorite Korean food restaurant. They will be opening  a new location soon! Hualapai and Tropicana!!! Yay!!! I wish these guys the ultimate in success!!!
