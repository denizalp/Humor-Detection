WAY TOO LOUD!!!!!\n\n\nTuesday Night at 6:30pm. \n\nChildren are permitted.. not sure if it is just for dinner hour or all hours. \n\nFood is A++   \nVery reasonably priced. We had boneless wings, mozza sticks, nachos, onion rings and FRIED PICKLES mmmm. \n\nAtmosphere .... was a bit too loud. I am not sure if it is the way the room is designed, but the volume of the space was just unbearable. They blared the music, and yelled on a mic. I am all for a fun place but I felt alone at the table with my friend. We couldn't hear each other it was painful to try and have a conversation. \n\n I will never suggest this place for a group of friends - we like to be able to have conversation not just eat and awkwardly stare at each other or pretend to be watching a tv.\n\nI will go back. I will go for the food. Actually looking forward to trying one of their burgers.
