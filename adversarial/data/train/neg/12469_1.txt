I really like this place, very welcoming and friendly customer service. The drinks all look very delicious and appetizing. From the homemade thick whip cream(delicious!) To their puree fruits they use, I traveled from california and I definitely wish there was one of these where I'm from.\n\nThe atmosphere was like walking into a little elegant cafe with friendly warm greetings. It was slow but an introvert lilke me will probably prefer it that way. Great for catching up with friends, family, or colleagues. Very nice setting and dessert presentation.\n\nI can't review for their desserts other than their gelato. Which was similar to all the other gelatos I've had but I still prefer to get them here and enjoy one of their specialty drinks. The combination of them just works. Creamy whip and then a bite of a tarty strawberry or mango gelato. I wish I could've tried their desserts.\n\nI sadly had only one specialty drink. It was the strawberry latte and it was delicious. Although I'm on vacation I think I might have to stop by again before I go lol. I wish I could try all their drinks but one drink and the atmosphere there was enough to leave them a 5 star review. Definitely will be thinking of you sweetbox T.T\nThis is definitely a place people come for cravings. Great job!
