Originally from Europe and I never seem to find a place that really makes baked goods that compare to it... Until I came to this lovely place. Very kind people who operate it and eager to engage in conversations with a smile. Now I'll be it, I only had the cinnamon croissant roll but it was delicious. Served on a hot plate with a fork and knife so there's no mess and leaves a warm filling sensation inside when done. It's no bakery like you'd fined in Belgium or France but it's close, call it an American touch to it if you will. Give it a try!
