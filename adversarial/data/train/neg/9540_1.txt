I really dig the urban feel of this Target location. Strangely, it somewhat reminds me of the Target we used to frequent in West Hollywood. Even though this is a huge chain store usually reserved for the suburbs, I imagine due to space issues, I like being reminded that I am still in the city while shopping for low priced, good quality toilet paper and Febreeze. \n\nSince it has been open for about a month now, the typical new-store-shopper-madness has significantly died down. Everyone who works here seems happy an willing to help, ESPECIALLY the Pharmacists. Wow, they are so nice and pleasant. There is a big open space where you can enjoy a coffee and\/or snack, and a big window overlooking Penn Circle. Yeah, there is still a view of construction, but the newly planted trees along Penn are starting to get bigger and it's great to see people walking around and sitting on the new benches.\n\nAND.....this location still carries Boots Body Butter, which has been discontinued at the Monroeville location. Best.Stuff.On.Earth! The only other place I was able to get this is at the Boots drug store in London (unfortunately I will not be hopping the pond anytime soon to get some there). :( \n\nSo....yay, yayyy, yaaaaaaaaay for Target East Libbbb. You nailed it!
