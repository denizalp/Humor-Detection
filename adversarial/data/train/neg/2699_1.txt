I came here on my own the other day and was seated very quickly on one of the benches that are perfect for dining on your own or if you prefer not to wait and have 1-2 people with you.  \n\nI decided to go with the shrimp and pork wonton soup - which is actually soup as opposed to the other \"soup\" options which specify \"steamed\".  And also ordered the hot spicy wonton noodles under the \"dry noodles\" section of the menu.  \n\nOn retrospect I should have ordered one or the other because it was wonton overload and generally food overload, I barely made a dent in either and had plenty to take home.  That being said, I enjoyed the soup and was able to eat about 2 of the wontons.  I was imagining a small bowl of soup but this could dish feed a family of 4 or more!\n\nI wasn't in to the hot wonton noodle dish.  I got the wide flat noodles (as opposed to the thin rice noodles) so not sure if that made a huge difference because it was the flavor that didn't make me swoon.  You can definitely physically feel the heat of the dish but I didn't think there was much flavor.  I was sweating and my mouth was reacting to the spice but it was spicy hot as opposed to spicy flavorful.  Perhaps the name of the dish makes sense then.\n\nI would be curious to go back and try something else.
