Vintner Grill is so special to us as it's where my boyfriend & I went on our first date here. We decided to celebrate Valentine's Day there tonight and it was superb. We were greeted promptly & genuinely by a great host. Our server Bernardo (not quite sure of the spelling) went far above and beyond to make our experience memorable. He was pleasant, professional & friendly. He knew the menu thoroughly & made lovely suggestions. He was very enthusiastic and when I suddenly didn't feel well due to a recent round of chemo he immediately got us our check & arranged for dessert to go in a flash. His compassion and empathy was greatly appreciated as I was afraid I was going to have to head to the hospital. He genuinely wished me well and invited us back. The food was phenomenal as we went with a delicious cheese plate and the Valentine's Day surf & turf. Compliments to the chef! The amuse Bouche was extraordinary and my lobster tail & filet mignon were absolutely perfect. Our Busser was also very attentive and friendly. We will be back after my next round of chemo to celebrate & are hoping to have our engagement party there on their gorgeous patio! Well done to the team, especially our server whom went above and beyond for us!
