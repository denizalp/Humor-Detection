We were looking for a good Cuban sandwich in Pittsburgh. After reading the reviews on Kaya we decided to give it a try. The Cuban was very good and as we were ordering the group at the next table told us how good the sandwich is so we ordered with the sweet potato fries.  Very good Cuban. Would recommend highly. The hostess was very nice and friendly and our server was great!
