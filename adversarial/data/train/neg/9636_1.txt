Although it is quite expensive, this is far and away the best Greek food I've ever eaten.  My wife and I first ate in their Montreal restaurant, then Las Vegas and finally in New York.  The food was equally fantastic in all three, but the NY restaurant was much too crowded to be truly enjoyable.  The LV place is much more relaxed with plenty of space between tables.  The fish couldn't be more fresh, the appetizers were wonderful, and the yogurt with honey was worth the visit all by itself.  You're in for a real treat when you eat here.
