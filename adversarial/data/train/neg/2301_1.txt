I used to drive by the Miami Beach location all the time when I lived in Miami but never stopped in. When I saw they had a location at the Venetian in LV I had to go. The fried chicken was excellent, I loved the bourbon syrup. The waffles were forgettable and not as good as Roscoes. Big portions. The fried green tomatoes were very heavy with the fried pork belly along with it. Very nice cocktails. Nice ambiance. I was super stuffed and could not eat any dessert.
