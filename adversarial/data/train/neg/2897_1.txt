I grew up eating at Sonny's and the food is always good. They have options for all you can eat and a nice salad bar. I was in town for a while and my parents brought me here during my stay. The food was pretty good, our fries were a little cold when they arrived, but otherwise it was enjoyable. I got a pick 2 combo deal they were running for $10.99 and opted to add a salad bar for $2.99. I definitely got my money's worth in food.\n\nThe service is a little hit or miss at this location. Our waitress was very nice, but she would disappear for periods and we would need drinks or reorders and could not find her. I'm normally sympathetic because I worked as a waitress for years, but it was dead for a Friday night and there were plenty of servers on.\n\nIf you're looking for a decent meal while at the arboretum, it's a solid option.
