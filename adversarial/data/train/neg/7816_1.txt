My layover here at Charlotte Airport was extended by a few hours due to weather delays, so to pass the time I decided to stop at this bar\/restaurant for a beverage and to watch the last bits of Monday Night Football.  \n\nA Taste of Carolina features beers from Charlotte's Old Mecklenburg Brewery. Listed on their menu are several styles and even a flight of 4 of the beers that brewery offers.  For me on this night I wasn't in the mood for beer (I didn't want to have to pee during my upcoming 2 hour flight) and also wasn't looking for a mixed drink, though this place does feature a full bar.  I settled on a glass of wine, which they offer in 6 or 9 ounce pours.  A decent 9 ounce Cabernet Sauvignon was $13\/glass, and Bill, the guy behind the bar, was friendly enough on this night, though it was nearly 10:30 when I stopped here and he made no secret of the fact that they'd be calling last call soon, and closing soon after.  Pity, as it was only 10:30 and lots of people were stranded at this airport in search of food and drink due to the bad weather in Charlotte on this night. Most all the larger restaurants and better food options in the main center concourse at CLT started rejecting patrons before 10 p.m., and sending everyone to the smaller bars and restaurants like A Taste of Carolina out in the gate areas.\n\nI was able to catch the end of Monday Night Football and finish my drink before Bill finally came through and told everyone they were shuttering the place.
