Tried a variety of their dessert offerin471gs. Pretty decent but none really stood out. Most disappointing was the creme brule because the top layer was not caramelized sugar but actually a liquid syrup. Most of the desserts I tried were between $3-4 each. The dessert I liked the most was the coconut butter tart. It had a nice caramelized top coating and inside was the sweet liquid center and of course the butter crust tops it off. And best of all their $1.50 each. I picked out a total of 4 different desserts but apparently if you choose 5 different ones they don't charge you the taxes so I went ahead with it. My recommendations out of all the ones I tried is the eclair and the butter tarts. Everything else is just passable at best.
