If you want to impress family I'm friends without going downtown- this is the spot.\n\nOrder a round of oysters for the table ($3 a piece- way more expensive than oysters downtown but it's the ambiance and experience your paying for)\n\nTry the Canadian whitefish stuffed with scallops\/ shrimp and lobster. Drizzled with delicious sauces. The portions are quite small. And each dish is roughly $35 \n\nYou should definetly check this out atleast once. If it's in your league you might become a regular.\n\nI've found it to be more fun and a better experience to buy oysters from the fresh seafood market called dianas seafood. \n\nBut for a summer lunch dining my the lake is beautiful. Defiently a patio you want to be at.\n\nOnly 3 stars because the service is not always attentive. And for the quality and portion size of food. The portions have become much smaller.\n\nEnjoy!
