Came in with my girl at 8:05 on Tuesday, store closes at 9pm screen cracked on iphone6+, phone works great just a little fuzzy on front camera.  She has Apple care insurance plan, 7 \"apple professionals\" there 3 helping customers, 4 standing around.  Approached one saying she would like a new phone, \"professional\" said there's no need for a new phone, just a new screen, unfortunately you don't have an appointment and there is no appointments available until Friday,  so we can set something up for you then.  So we thought to ourselves what about the other 4 \"professionals\" doing? So my girl said I just want a new phone. The \"professional\" said well if the screen is just cracked there is no need for a new phone, so we can make that appointment for Friday. At this point one guy did say that he wasn't doing anything and could do it, but we just wanted a new phone. So we had to be a bit rude and insist several times that we just wanted a new phone because we wanted it now.  Finally they relented and got the phone and our the door at 8:35.  A little to uppity attitude.
