This place provides unique Asian fusion flavours into their cakes and macarons. I like that the creator (Christopher) is also part of baking most of the desserts. Their macarons are so cute and are themed (e.g. Disney theme and anime theme). I was able to get a last minute cake for my mom here. Their HK tea cake was just okay. We only could taste the HK tea on the cream (top) and just coffee cake in between.
