TL;DR tasty Sichuan-flavoured fish. \n\nCame here for a weekend dinner and ordered a small Special Cod with lotus, clouds ear, some other veggies. We chose the Hot Pot Tofu (3 chilies) after seeing that chopped chilies looked like chopped sweet peppers and decided against it. We are glad that's what we went with - the flavour was intense with a serious spicy kick that we loved. \n\nThe fish arrived cold with a small fire underneath to let it boil at the table. Our fish was nice and tender after being cooked with incredible flavour. The veggies were also a nice add-on. \n\nThe only downsides are that the servers are a little impatient and the fish arrives cold and needs extra time to warm up. Also, if you hate bones, make sure to order fish fillets - the regular selections are very boney!\n\nWould we return? Yes for the great food despite the impatient servers.
