Last time I was in about an hour before closing. I asked if they had time to do a full set and they said yes. So, I figured I'd get good service. Everyone was friendly and I was excited....until I got to my nail tech, Jason. He was really bad. He was in a hurry. He cut my finger. He just wanted to get done and get me out. I asked him to make my nails shorter and he responded with \"they're already short,\" and he didn't do what I wanted. When he started putting the nail polish on, he stuck his finger in one while it was still wet and didn't fix it! I was extremely disappointed. I felt rushed. And when I complained, they didn't even offer to fix it! \n\nIf they had told me, \"hey, we're about to close, but we're open tomorrow,\" I would've loved to set up an appointment. I will never be back here again. A total waste of money.
