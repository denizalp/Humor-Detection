Love it, love it, love it!  Forget those \"other\" over-priced chicken chains!  Come check out Pilon for amazing food and wonderful service.  We came here because of other great yelp reviews and we were not disappointed!  If you walk in a little clue-less like us as to what to order the staff is super friendly and helpful.  They are very proud of the food they prepare and they should be!  I eat A LOT of chicken and this was top notch! The chicken was super juicy and flavorful.  Really nicely seasoned.  We had the mixed veggies and fried plantains as our sides, really yummy!  And they give you a large portion of food for not a lot of $.  Also the dining area is decorated super cute with lots of bright colors. This is now on our list of regular spots we visit for great food.  I highly recommend you check it out.  They will take care of you and you will leave with a happy tummy!
