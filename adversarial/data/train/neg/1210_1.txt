This place was great. The staff was so nice. A photographer was there that took our photos and printed them out for us. The food was absolutely delicious and the portions were VERY generous. We didn't finish our meal but as soon as we got back to our hotel, we scarfed it down. The decor and atmosphere was very soothing with the blue tones and the seating is very comfortable because every seat is booth style. Open 24 hours and a great place to dine in LV.
