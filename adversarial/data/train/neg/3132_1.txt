Being from Cali the only Fry's we have is a Electronic Store. However Fry's in AZ is like an Albertsons or Ralps. Luckily i made it on Thanksgiving Day 10 minutes before they closed to pick up some pies to bring to our Thanksgiving dinner. Place was hectic, but i expected nothing less shopping for something last minute on a holiday.
