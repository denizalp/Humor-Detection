I am SO upset!!! I have been going here for a while, and have never had a problem -- until now. I asked to have my acrylics removed, and then get a simple manicure. The guy then removed the acrylics and tore my pinky nail right off!!! It was torn all the way to the nail bed, and hurt like hell (luckily, I wasn't bleeding). He really didn't do anything, until I asked him how he was going to fix it. He said they would \"fix it\" with an overlay. After everything was done, he proceeded to charge me $25 for a $12 manicure. I questioned it, of course, but they said it was $15 for french, $3 for the tiny bit of glitter \"design\" (which is freaking ridiculous), and another $7 to take off the acrylic. Now normally, I wouldn't bat an eye at the charges, but this was absurd. They damaged my nail, damaged my finger, and still charged me for removal??!! Then, when I argued, the guy basically called me a liar -- he said that I never pointed out my natural nails (I did -- clearly). He also said, \"There is no guarantee with nail removal; no guarantee\". Of course, my retort was, \"What does that mean? You can just tear off all my nails?\" He got huffy with me, went to register, grabbed a $5 bill and slapped it down. \"Here. I only charge you $20.\" We argued more on my way out, after I told him that I was extremely upset, and this was not the professional way to resolve it. Of course, I will never be going back here; they have lost my business, and my respect. And I'm sure other people will think twice after reading this review. Avoid them like the plague. #NailsOfTheWorldMassiveFail
