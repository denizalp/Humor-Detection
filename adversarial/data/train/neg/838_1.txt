The food is great but the service could use some polishing. On my second visit, I was left standing by the doorway or entrance for a good 5-10min without anyone approaching me. The place wasn't busy at the time so I was quite irritated that no one came up to me to ask whether I had reservations or if I was dining in. I literally had to walk up to one of the servers after waiting for some time to get a table for my friends and I, and only then was I taken care of. The staff needs to be more attentive, especially when customers want to come in.
