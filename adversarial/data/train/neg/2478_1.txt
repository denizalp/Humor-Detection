Food was excellent and so was the service! I got the watermelon margarita and spicy shrimp tacos, my boyfriend got a beer and the sirloin burrito, and we shared the cheese bombs and a pizza cookie. Hostess was right there to seat us and waitress quickly followed. Great experience! Will be returning.
