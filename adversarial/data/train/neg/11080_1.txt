Service is great. Friendly, attentive and fast. \n\nFor summer lobster special, I would give 3.5 stars but overall, I think this place has solid menu for steak, big portion size food and nice mixture of formal\/informal ambiance.  You will feel comfortable having a business dinner at a quite area (corner side), or casual happy hour at the bar area or a group\/family dinner at the main area.\n\nLobster taco and gratin come with only a few small pieces of lobster.. so I'm not sure if these are worth the price.\n\nWarm complimentary ciabatta-like bread was good.\n\nPS: Most popular cocktail is Ceasar (basically blood mary with a bit of spicy kick).
