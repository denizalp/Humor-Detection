Don't listen to the bad reviews on here! This is seriously the best day club ever!\n\nThose who rated negatively just have no idea how the party scene works in Vegas and hence don't belong there in the first place. Drinks are pricey, so? You're on vaca!\n\nTop notch DJ lineup, beautifully decorated venue and friendly staff!\n\nAdvice: DJ's come on late so be sure to stay sober long enough to see them!
