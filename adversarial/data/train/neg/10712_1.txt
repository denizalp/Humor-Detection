My wife and I were looking for a meal along the way through Cleveland and we happened upon this little gem on Yelp. It is a little family owned restaurant that may not look like much at first but DON'T LET THAT FOOL YOU!!! The food is cooked fresh to order (so be prepared for a well worth while wait) which of course means extremely fresh, hot, right off the stove\/oven food. This was possibly the best Indian cuisine I've had. Definitely check them out!!!!
