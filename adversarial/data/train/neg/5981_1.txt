We came here wanting to try out a restaurant in downtown Chandler. When we got to the front desk, hostesses asked us if we had made a reservation. Since it was a spur at the moment thing, we did not have one. They told us that even though there were tables that were opened inside the restaurant when we arrived, they were all booked up and offered us to sit in the patio area. We were  getting ready to turn around and they offered us a couch with a huge tables that were shared with two other parties. The waiter was very attentive and certainly knows his menu very well. He offered us many great suggestions and we did end up ordering what he suggested. I ordered a duck and my friend ordered a plate with different variety of meats, cheese and bruschetta. The duck is very tender and juicy. The portion is perfect for one person. I also love the dishes that my friend ordered since I enjoy small bite dishes. \n\nOther than not feeling very happy to share a huge table with some loud mouth customers (not the restaurant's fault), we had a enjoyable meal. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because we saw 2-3 empty tables on our way out...and these tables were empty when we first walked in. Oh well....another time. I am happy that the hostesses still tried to find a spot for us to sit inside the restaurant.
