Stopped in about quarter past five on a Saturday for an oil change. I was greeted in an exceedingly friendly manner and was walked through the process of getting the oil changed in a manner that was professional and not condescending. The usual upselling was there, but it was done in a manner that didn't make me feel pressured to buy extra services, though I did opt for a new air filter after being shown how filthy the previous one was. I would definitely drive out of the way to come back to this particular facility.
