Both the savory and sweet pies are delicious from Mama Toledo's. We live in the west valley but had an appointment not far from here so my family decided to have pie for dinner. Between the 8 of us we had the chicken pot pie, beef pot roast, and verde pork. My husband and I couldn't choose a favorite. The kids finished every last bite. Then we took dessert home and the coconut cream pie was outstanding. The only downside is the limited seating to dine in for those of us who don't live close enough to grab and run home to eat while it's still hot.
