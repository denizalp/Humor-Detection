I love the Sahara in Tempe. It is a small, moderately appointed Middle Eastern restaurant just east of the NE corner of Southern & McClintock. The owner is one of the friendliest restauranteurs I've ever met. The food is excellent. I especially love the lentil soup for my first course. The Sahara's babaghanouj is my favorite anywhere. I'll take theirs over hummus anytime if I have to choose only one. It's \"earthy,\" as hummus should be (if you catch my drift). Entrees are numerous, though what you'd find in a typical Middle Eastern restaurant located in most U.S. cities. I usually order the vegetarian combo because I get a little of everything. However, their meat dishes are excellent, too. If you're in the area (just 0.5 mi. north of the 60\/Superstition Fwy), give it a try. But don't go Sunday--I think they are always closed Sundays.
