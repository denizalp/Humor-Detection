First I would say I gave this restaurant 3 stars only because it took 17 minutes to get a small garden salad.  I ended up being late getting back to work and that was something I would not have expected when ordering something like a salad.\nI will say however that the salad was very good. Fresh lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, romaine cheese (I think), croutons and apple slices.  The only reason it took so long is they do not have premade salads and in my book that is a plus.  I took a menu and will definitely try them again but leave room for the wait.\nThe service was friendly and they were very nice when I started the time crunch, look at my watch dance.  As a customer I appreciate the fact that they understood and this is another reason why I will go back.
