The kids like it here and we have had some good experiences when they're not busy- but it seemed understaffed when we went during peak hours. We were told 30min but then waited about an hour for a table. While waiting we noticed lots of empty tables that were not been cleaned. Our server was super nice and fantastic with the kids but she had to run around the place to get to every table.
