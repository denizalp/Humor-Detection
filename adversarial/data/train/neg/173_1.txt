I like Nakama, but you need to be ready for more of a bar \/ party type experience.\n\nThe hibachi is good.  The food is good.  It really comes down to the chefs.  They have a couple chefs that put on a crazy good show.  If you get one of them, you are in luck.  They each seem to have their quirks.  It isn't the typical show of a little bit of flame and a shrimp tail in the hat.\n\nThe sushi bar and regular bar are where Nakama really shines.  Nakama has a great bar scene and good sushi.  The sushi isn't the best in the city, but it is well done.  The fish to rice ratio is great and they have a diverse selection of pretty sushi rolls for people who want to go beyond your standard single fish product and rice.\n\nI'd strongly recommend Nakama if you want some good sushi and drinks in a upscale busy bar environment.  If you are looking for an 'authentic' sushi \/ hibachi experience, this is not the place.  Nakama fits the Southside scene.  You hit Nakama before a club or party bar.
