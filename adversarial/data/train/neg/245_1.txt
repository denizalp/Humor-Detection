I was traveling to Toronto on work, and normally steakhouses like The Keg are a bit out of my client's budget range, but I had an investment banking friend in town from New York City, so obviously I had to throw down so he thought I was successful.\n\nThe Keg is a solid steakhouse that actually doesn't punish your checking account or corporate card as much as some others might.  The atmosphere was refined, the steak was really well done (by well done...I mean medium rare), and our server was helpful in pointing us toward some good wine to pair.\n\nI know they have a handful of locations around town, so pick one for a good time out to celebrate a special occasion or taking out clients.\n\nFood: 4\/5\nValue: 5\/5\nService: 4\/5\nAtmosphere: 4\/5
