My son and I go see Nancy every 2 months and we love the service we receive. The atmosphere is nice and the other hairdressers make it a pleasant experience. The owner is always at the front desk to greet us with a smile. You're always offered water or coffee if you have to wait. They differently have tons to offer. Shopping for a hairdressing? Stop by and see what KHARIZMA has to offer for, you'll fall in love with them. Just as I did!
