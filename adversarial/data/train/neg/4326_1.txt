long time customers here. the price is worth it for all the food we eat. we like the house special crab (since were long time customers, we get a little discount) the minced chicken\/corn soup is delicious especially on this cold day. we always order two mongolian beefs because it is tasty. the Hong Kong style noodles is very very tasty and a family favorite. the salt pepper shrimp is delicious as always. sometimes we end the night with warm tapioca. the food comes out fast and delicious. although, they are sometimes slow with the drinks.
