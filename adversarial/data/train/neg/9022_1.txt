We've been fans of Cafe Hollander in Milwaukee & gave this one 2 tries. Not giving them a 3rd. The setting & decor is my favorite part of this restaurant. They don't have the meals we loved & we weren't wowed by the Plan B options. The Husband said his omelet was almost as good as Denny's. The final straw: I upgraded my fries to sweet potato fries with a curry ketchup, both at an extra charge.  The fries were so salty they were inedible. I told our server, not much in the way of \"opps\" or \"sorry\" & when the bill arrived, full price, no attempt to make it up to me. Okay, I'm done. Still need a Madison Cafe Hollander replacement, what do you suggest?
