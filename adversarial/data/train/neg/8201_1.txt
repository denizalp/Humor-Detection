The two of us ordered two bowls of noodles and a side dish of spicy beef shin. My boyfriend ordered the MEGA size special beef noodles, while I got the braised beef tendon noodle.\n\nThe MEGA size was totally worth its value! Flavour wise, the soup was superb! The spicy oil was perfectly flavoured as well. However for the noodles itself, I was recommended to get the third thickest round noodles and was told that would be regular. It came out pretty thick! Much thicker than the authentic Lanzhou hand pulled noodle should be. The texture of the noodle was quite hard, making it hard to chew and digest. \n\nThe side dish was great! Flavoured perfectly. Just the sliced were quite big, making it a little hard to eat, but that's not a big deal.\n\nI was would come back if I was ever in the area on a cold day, maybe I'll try a thinner noodle next time to see if that would be better.
