Oh In-N-Out, how i love you. I'm not a big fast food person, but if I'm going to indulge in a little this is where I go. It's one of those places where I can completely pig out and not feel like death afterwards. My usual is the Double-Double with fries. And I'll eat every last bite in a matter of a couple minutes, it's that good. Sometimes I add on one of their awesome chocolate shakes. I've never been disappointed with an In-N-Out burger & fries -- it always tastes fresh and seems like a fast food option that's not as bad for you. (Is that possible? Maybe that's just what I tell myself)\n\nAlso, this location has been pretty busy every time I've been there, so prepare to wait. But don't worry, it's worth it! Last time the drive thru was probably a dozen cars deep. Just goes to show how great the place is.
