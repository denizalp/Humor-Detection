The sauce on the enchiladas looked and tasted canned. Flavorless rice and beans were on the side. This restaurant is super noisy. They were nice enough to bring a birthday treat, but the fried ice cream tasted like it had been fried in old oil. They accommodated our large group but one drink order came 20 minutes after it was ordered. I have to wonder if the people rating this place over two stars had too many drinks or are related to the owners. Another telling sign was the all white crowd. Come to El Caminos in Sheboygan for better food!
