Worst place ever. Very rude over the phone when trying to get directions. I called before I came and ask about blood work test and the girl said I had to come in for the doctor to examine what test I need. I get here and THEY DONT EVEN DO BLOOD WORK SO THE GIRL AT THE FRONT DESK CLEARLY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE OFFICE. Thanks for making me drive across town and getting horrible service
