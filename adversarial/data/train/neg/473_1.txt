Neelam is amazing! She can whip out any heena design you so desire. I'm amazed at how quickly she can draw the most intricate details. Whether you're looking for traditional Indian designs, Arabic designs, or anything you can come up with Neelam can surely do it. I can't count the number of compliments I've received from the henna she has drawn on me. I'm now a constant costumer. I would highly recommend her without reservation for your henna needs. In addition to henna, she sells a variety of goods from India that you won't find elsewhere.
