Great stand alone deli. The service was fast and friendly. Their bread is of course fresh accompanied with quality Boars Head meats and cheeses. You can't order a bad sandwich here but nothing that stands out either.  The prices are good and the portions are adequate. I wouldn't mind a meaty sandwich but honestly I always walk away full. Overall I would recommend if you want a good sub with quality ingredients.
