This location is my preferred Walmart in the area, though the one up on Fort Apache isn't bad. They have the auto service center, pharmacy, market, and everything else you'd expect from a Walmart, though they would benefit if their staff were a bit friendlier.\nTheir greeters are good, and though I'd not day they're unhelpful or really unfriendly, they likely won't say a word to you unless you seek them out with a question specifically.\nI had one experience during the night shift where I base the self-check attendant to have a good night as I departed, and she didn't even look at me, much less return the pleasantry. Everyone else at least replied when I talked, and the price and stock are good. So they could be a *good* Walmart instead of average, if they were friendlier.
