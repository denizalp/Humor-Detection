Two years ago we picked out this terrified pup from a shelter and brought her home. For the first two months I could only take her outside after dark because she was so timid but then I called my friend Leighton A Oosthuisen at Partners Training and asked about private lessons. We were paired up with Jen Shelton who totally changed my Tori's life! She is now a goofy playful pup that loves other dogs and people. Jen  used her own dog Violet to help socialize Tori and show her how to be a good girl! If you need help training your fuzzy kid please give Partners a call and talk to Jen Shelton!
