I'm really glad I found Jeff and his business to come clean our windows. So often you take a chance trying to find a business that is responsive, affordable and up-front...but if you're considering having your windows cleaned, you can stop looking because Jeff at Window and Solar Services will be the only person you'll ever need.\n\nCommunication:\nSuper easy. Sent email through the website. Found a coupon for 20% linked out to his Facebook page. Asked a question in Facebook - got an immediate answer. Also got an answer via email to my original inquiry. Jeff even proactively reached out a potentially rainy day to reschedule.\n\nPricing:\nI *LOVE* that Jeff has instant quotes on his website. If you know your sq. footage, you know exactly how much you're going to pay. It's that easy...no counting panes like some companies! I also appreciate that there was no extra charge to pay by credit card.\n\nQuality of Work:\nThe windows look great. We paid extra to have the screens cleaned but it was totally worth it. Some of our windows hadn't been cleaned professionally in 8 years but Jeff made them all look new again.\n\nBusinessman:\nI love supporting local small businesses. Jeff owns and runs the business...making sure he's on time, personable and respectful. He was appreciative of the business, was easy to talk to and an all-around nice guy.\n\nBottom-line:\nWhat are you waiting for?! Call Jeff today. Thanks for the great work!!
