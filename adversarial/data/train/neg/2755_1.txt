Simply the best Mexican food I have had in Madison. A friend and I visit Francisco's after hitting the bars, and the service is first rate. There is always great people watching here, especially with the folks pouring out of Argus and Maduro at bar time.\n\nI have had their burritos, which were sizable portions and delicious, but my favorite dish here is the Alambre, a dish that few restaurants do well. At Francisco's, you get a sizable portion of grilled chicken with melted cheese, peppers, rice, beans, and some tortillas. It is the perfect end to a night of indulgence, and it won't break the bank.
