This place is absolutely  beautiful. The restaurant is one of the most beautiful most impeccable places I have ever been to. Every detail was perfection and even their bathroom was beautiful. We went there for our anniversary  and I really wanted to love it! The service was outstanding, friendly, attentive, special. My only problem was the food itself underwhelmed me a little. The starter courses wrere fabulous then came a salad that was very meh except for the candied bacon that was delicious the other ingredienta (some grana padano and a bitter dressing) not so much. My husband has a steak that was just okay nothing memorable and I had some scallops and they came over some lentil based and it was just underwhelming , they were well cooked but the other ingredients didn't  mesh al well. Their dessert was complimentary for our anniversary and  it was a phenomenal rum cake. I loved the place and service but the food did not do it for me sadly because it was definitely one of the prettiest places I have seen!
