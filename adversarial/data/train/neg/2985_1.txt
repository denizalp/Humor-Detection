First time in for breakfast and I will be back. Ida was my server. Very friendly and informative. Spoke to Forrest, the Kitchen Manager as well. The line cooks seem to have a cohesive team. As a cook, it's always fun to see how other places execute their menu.....\nPrices are pretty much comparable to other breakfast spots. And I was excited to see they offer grits in place of potatoes!!!! \nGlad I stopped in!
