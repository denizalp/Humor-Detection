On various food shows I had seen reviews of FUKU Burger.  It always looked good, but being from out of town, I didn't think when we went to Las Vegas, we would track down a food truck.  Fast forward, 9 months ago (give or take a few months) Fuku Burger has a restaurant in what looks like an old Taco Bell.  We went for lunch and wanted to stay for dinner.  The hamburgers were out of this WORLD!!!!  In and Out is a basic staple of a good burger, and we thought Bachi Burger was good, but this is above and beyond.  I had the Buta Burger, which is a burger with bacon.  The hamburger was so moist and they topped it off with red ginger which made the burger unbelievable. The french fries are sprinkled with togarashi red pepper.  Everytime we go to Las Veags, this will be a \"for sure\" stop on our list of places to eat.
