I really like these folks, and they are open 7 days a week.  I had a critically ill dog so that convenience was such a comfort.  We now have a large goofy teething puppy and we have had his shots done here, and nail trimmings.  Vet techs have been fantastic with him andDr. D is great, he spends a lot of time with his examinations and has always been very patient with our questions when our other dog went thru his illness.  I cannot recommend these folks enough.
