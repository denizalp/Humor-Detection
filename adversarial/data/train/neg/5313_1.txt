When we asked for delicious food, our reggae-playing Uber driver went rouge and dropped us off at this bistro. Seedy as hell looking at night in this neighborhood but we were hungry and in for whatever. The drinks were game set on point and the food was one of our favorites during our trip. Uhhh, thanks Uber...???! Our meal: Burger with a fancy presentation for the guy. I opted for a single sized pizza. Great date night!
