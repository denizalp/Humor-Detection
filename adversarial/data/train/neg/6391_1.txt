Honestly, from the outside I didn't know what to expect, if anything it just looked like another sport's bar. Walking inside, you're greeted by a bowling alley and a view of the dining and upstairs areas. Walking around, you'll find rooms full of pool tables, a ping pong area, and several arcade machines upstairs, as well as two bars in the front and back. My friend and I sat down to eat, and we were pleasantly surprised by the choice menu selections and very quick service! I definitely plan on bringing a bigger group during my next visit!
