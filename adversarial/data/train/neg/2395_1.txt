Made my friends do this with me for my birthday and we had an awesome time! From beginning to end all staff was in character mode, made the experience feel that much real! Parking was a little limited tho, had to park around the block but not to bad. All the rooms had me fangirling, it was just like the movies! Unfortunately we couldn't escape but we were so close! It was harder than I expected but we did have a lot of people and personalities lol Definitely will try to successfully escape next time!
