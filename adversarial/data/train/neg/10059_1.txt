I dined here with a family member recently, and overall, the experience was pleasant. We had  reservations close to when the kitchen was closing, so we expected a quick meal. The servers were pleasant and attentive during the experience. We ordered the special of the night which was the gourmet sabzi and the aloo gheysi. Each came with a salad which consisted of arugula and mixed lettuces in a very tangy vinaigrette that my dining partner and I didn't particularly enjoy. As I didn't wish to have the rice, they provided an extra serving of this salad for my dish, although I didn't finish it. \n\nMy dish consisted of a a stew with fenugreek, kidney beans, a lime, and boneless lamb pieces in an herbacious stew. It was a bit bitter at first, but I requested additional spices on the side to make it more flavourful. Overall, it was satisfying, but not a dish that I would order again.\n\nMy dinner date ordered the aloo ghyesi, and although the chicken, rice and salad were quite good, my friend did not really appreciate the sweetness from the apricots. After trying the dish myself, I would have to agree. It seems like they simply dropped dried apricots into a chicken dish, and although there were supposed to be plums, we could not locate them.\n\nOverall, the experience was 'okay'. I recall it being better several years ago when I first went there. It did end up being quite busy for a Wednesday night, and I'm sure that this institution has built its reputation on providing its customers with quality Persian\/Iranian food. \n\nMy dining companion described it as 'different' and 'interesting', which I am in agreement with.
