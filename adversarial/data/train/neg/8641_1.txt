I only ate in the Peppermill restaurant and I didn't go to the Fireside Lounge.  I like the jungle ambiance of the restaurant and the service was fast. The food was also good, but it wasn't a knock out and it definitely was not the best late night food I've ever eaten. But in a city that claims to have all this late nigh food, I'm glad at least the peppermill is around.
