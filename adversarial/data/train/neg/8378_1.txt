I popped by here quickly for lunch the other day as I had some errands to run on the weekend. Came in for lunch around noon on a Saturday and it was getting busy, but luckily there was still a table available for me so i got seated right away. \n\nThey have a lot of choices for the ramen noodles, particularly in terms of the broth there were definitely a few selections. It looked like the hokkaido ramen seems to be one of their top contenders, so I decided to try that along with a side of gyozas. For their ramen they had 2 sizes and I got the regular size.\n\nThe gyozas were pretty good, nicely fried and it was hot, the dipping sauce was nice on the side but I just dipped a little bit otherwise it would be too salty.\n\nThe ramen was amazing! For this shop I would definitely says i'ts a hidden gem coz there are certainly a lot of restaurant options in the area, but i was quite surprised to find this place their ramen is certainly more than decent. I love the hoikkado broth - i did drink it and i even packed some home LOL. I was worried it would be too milky for me, but it worked quite well along with the thickness of the pork bone broth and the combo together was just lovely. Ramen was springy and had nice texture to it and I felt the price is quite reasonable for a bowl of ramen this size. \n\nAll in all, I was quite pleased with my discovery and I would say this is definitely a neighbourhood gem and should I be back in this area again in the future I would definitely consider coming here again!
