Been here before and we tried it again. Walked right in and didn't have to wait for a table. They brought bread before we order and had our meal but there was no butter. It would have been nice to have it but I thought it would have taken some time to get it. I had a burger, and I had have to say it was good. The service is OK but I wished the server would have come around more. I ran out of my drink and when I needed it I was empty. They push some food reward club on us which I didn't like. The reason was it was for a lot of different restaurants that are not in this area. They seem to me they are pushing it for some reason too. Maybe the server get points or something like that.
