Only reason they don't get 5 is because I don't give 5's. Have been here a bunch now and it's true Korean. \nBimbibap, ramen soup, gyoza, are all great. Sushi is better than solid. The owners and workers are all really appreciative that you came. \nOnly downside is they are starting out and have to multitask between server role, host and register. \nI'm rooting for this place and encourage you to stop in.
