I stopped in today to get a quick grooming appointment. (Anal gland expression) the girls there were very friendly and where able to take my dog right away. My dog was new there and the process of getting him in to the system was quick and easy. While they were taking care of my dog I decided to get a bone for my dog. The cashier was also very friendly and upbeat. I usually go to pet club on Ray Rd and the service there is terrible so this was a nice change. I will be shopping here more often! Thanks for the great experience!
