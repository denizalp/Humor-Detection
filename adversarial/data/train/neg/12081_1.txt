The first time I've ever given zero tip. Sheesh. Everybody there was cool except for our server, and it only takes one to make a terrible experience. The food was good, drink was good, but damn the customer service was terrible from the server. From the moment I asked for a drink to leaving, I got this frustrated attitude. For the ID, asking about the food, asking if moving tables was ok (squished seats vs open table), everything! Never got asked if we wanted anything, more to drink, and didn't even pick up the check. We all work lady, but not all of us are totally rude about it! \n\nThe other employees were really nice. One of them even had to talk over her rudeness when I asked to switch seats. It's too bad I didn't get served by one of them to begin with! \n\nOh well, at least the chicken philly was really good. Came with yummy fries too. Shoulda got it to go!
