Fixed the recall on my car, but service advisor David Scott rose his voice at me because I was upset that my 10am appointment that HE told me would be done wasn't done.. He then went on to say \"they\" shouldn't have given me a time when he was the one who did. More than upset with him than Honda itself.  Won't use this service for my baby again.
