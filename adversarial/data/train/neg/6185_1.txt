Located in NY NY Hotel Casino on the Famous Las Vegas Strip. The portions are huge, the prices reasonable. What else do you want? Great drinks? You got 'em! A fun Happy Hour? They gots that too.So what are you waiting for? Stop by and try the fun food on the menu. I recommend the Duck Wings! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!
