The food is ok, good, nothing out of the extraordinary! If you've never been there I do recommend you go at lest once, it's one of those type of restaurants. I sat out side in the FATBAR, but I wasn't ordering alcoholic beverages so the lazy waitress said to go order inside cause the out door sitting area of the restaurant is a whole different owner or some non-sense like that.
