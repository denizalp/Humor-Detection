Stopped in after a massage for happy hour - Andrea was great ... friendly with samples and Phoenix recommendations ; got a local draft (hop knot, yum) and the tempura fries - freshly fried and good.\n\nWill bring the family back for the unique selection of pizzas and the gluten free option. \n\nIn a nice strip mall...clean and friendly- and the windows were CLEAN (ask the tender)!\n\nWould recommend that HP starts to delivery to the Residence Inn by the Mayo Clinic- they would make a killing!\n\nCheers HP
