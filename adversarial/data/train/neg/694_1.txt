I've had no issues with this business. In fact, they were so extremely helpful. My dog is on rx indefinitely. When I called, they got what they needed from my vet and even called me back to let me know there was a promo on prescriptions that month.\nWhen the rx was initially denied, by the vet on call in my vet's office, for that promo quantity - the customer rep called me to let me know and ask what I'd like to do. I told her my personal vet would be in the next day and I'd get it straightened out. She put my paperwork on top on the pile till  morning, we got it straightened out and I saved a couple hundred dollars due to their lower cost & the promo.\n\nUrsodial is normally a very expensive drug not regularly carried by my vet. They'd special order it for me 3mo at a time. Getting it in a compound formula through roadrunner saves me hundreds a month. And I found them very helpful and friendly the couple times I've used them so far.
