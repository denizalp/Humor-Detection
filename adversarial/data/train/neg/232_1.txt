The new and modern renovations give out a futuristic feel. There is a large parking lot for both the library and the park right beside it. They have great lighting indoors and also private study rooms. Though the private study rooms aren't fully soundproof. They also have an area just for children with a few toys and building blocks. And also small desks for children to sit at the computers. This library is always clean and I find the people who come here are mindful of their noise level. Librarians and workers here are very helpful and nice. Of the many times I've been here, I've never seen any of them frown. It's a nice place to go and study at for free or spend time with your children at.
