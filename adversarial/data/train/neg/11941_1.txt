Good price, delicious food!\nTheir signature dish is the fish noodle bowl, and you can choose to add things like other kinds of sliced meat and tofu in it. I recommend adding the fish tofu! \nThe bowl was pretty big for me, and I was not able to finish eating everything in it. \nPerfect for a winter night. \nBe sure to come early as it gets crowded into the evening. We went at around 6pm at a group of 4 on a Sunday evening, and did not need to wait for a table.
