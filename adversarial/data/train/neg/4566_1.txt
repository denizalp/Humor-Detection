Overall I am disappointed. I'm not sure if all the reviews built me up for a let down by setting such high expectations or if I just caught them on a bad day. First of all as soon as I walked in I wanted to walk out just based on the appearance and cleanliness. It has not been updated in what looks like -ever. They weren't helpful in the method of ordering as some customers took to a counter to fill out a slip while other walked straight up to the counter. We placed our order and continued to the dinning room which was even messy and the floors were sticky. It just seems like none of the employees care to make sure things look clean. The food was just okay nothing exceptional. I tried 3 dishes the jade red chicken, bbq pork, and the chili relleno with the plain fried rice. The chicken was the best of the 3 but probably not good enough for me to return.
