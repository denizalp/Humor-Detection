I've come here twice now - once on a Wed (pro am night for $5) and again on a Saturday (dinner and show for $27 not including tax and tip). Had a great experience both times. Well worth it for the money you're paying.\n\nFirst time I went, we didn't make a reservation. We got seated near the back cause all the closer better seats are saved for people who made reservations. Spots were decent nonetheless, and there were a lot of comedians on for Wed. Some were really funny, some weren't as funny - but overall good quality of comedians keeping in mind it's pro am night (mix of pros and amateurs).\n\nSaturday was great. Host and headliner were really funny. Show alone would've been $15 if we didn't do the dinner and show package. Dinner was good! It was from 6-7pm, and show started at 8. It's buffet with salad, veggies, pasta, lasagna, roast beef and mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed the salad bar (lettuce, tomato, cucumber, carrots) with the 4 dressing options. The cheese on the pasta was good, and the mashed potatoes were actually really tasty. I wasn't impressed by the roast beef or lasagna. Make sure you start eating early enough, cause they don't refill the buffet items. Dessert was bite-sized butter tarts, carrot cake, and brownie. \n\nOverall, this is a great way to spend an evening, and I'd say is good value.\n\nSome things to keep in mind:\nBox office is cash only\nThey don't serve tap water in the comedy seating area (which I entirely disagree with, especially if you're serving alcohol) - but they do sell bottled water for $2
