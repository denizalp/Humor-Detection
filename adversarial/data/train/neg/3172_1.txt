This is probably one of my top 3 favorite restaurants. The food is EXCELLENT, big selection from American to Italian to good seafood (for Arizona at least). The portions are large, get a TOGO box and have a full meal the next day. I've eaten here at least a half a dozen times, never had a bad experience. Cost is VERY reasonable. I have nothing bad to say about this place, no complaints. \n\nPark in the subway lot and walk over, lot gets congested with cars and pedestrians.
