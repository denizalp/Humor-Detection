Wayne Dalton came to service my garage door today. They told me 1-4 pm, but called at 830 am saying they were on the way. So I missed work to run home to be there. I got home and was told it would be 15 minutes 3 times in a row for the tech to arrive. Missing work by the way. When the tech arrived he told me the price of the door was almost twice I was told on the phone. I called the company to seek resolution, they told me it was MY misunderstanding and they weren't responsible for MY mistake AND they were not going to do anything to resolve the issue.  I spoke to the manager of service and general manager and neither even acknowledged the inconvenience and  mistake by their sales team. So I miss work and charged extra because of THEIR scheduling mistake and pricing mistake yet somehow it's on me. Do NOT go with WAYNE DALTON in Arizona. They have  HORRIBLE service and do not take ownership of anything.
