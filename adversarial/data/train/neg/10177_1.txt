I  love dim sum. Every city I visit I want to find the best spots in that city to sample the local yum cha offerings. In Las Vegas I asked the sushi chef (no he wasn't Japanese) in the Fulton Street Food Hall in Harrahs if he knew where local Las Vegans went for dim sum. He explained that while he was new to the area having recently relocated from LA he recommended the spot over in the Gold Coast. That spot is Ping Pang Pong.\n\nSadly I got there a little late and yes there was a wait so the dim sum offerings were scant. I was told that they have dim sum all day, but by 3 there were only 5 items left. I was there with two dim sum neophytes. In the light of all of my enthusiasm they found the offerings underwhelming and ordered off of the regular menu. The spare ribs were some of the best I've ever had. In fact we got two orders. The sesame seed balls were different from the ones I've had on the East Coast but I liked them. In fact, the remaining two items I ordered were different but not bad. I'm giving this restaurant a 3 because I believe I wouldn't have been underwhelmed if I'd had more to choose from. The service was sub par though, we had to wait quite a while for refills on water and tea and the extra napkins we requested but the place was packed. That said, I really need to visit again to render a fair review. It's worth a 2nd visit for sure.
