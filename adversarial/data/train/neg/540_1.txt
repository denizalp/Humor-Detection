I came for a nice patio dinner with friends and received horrible service with mediocre food. \nIt took 30m for someone to serve us water.  \nWe would ask for something it would it would take forever to get it.  Otherwise if we didn't get it we would have to ask 1 2 3 times more for the same item.  \nTo the point where when we didn't get what we needed one of us walked up to the DJ and ask him where he asked our waiter Nevin was doing something else at the back.  \nI would understand the poor service if it was a busy night with a full patio and restaurant.  Buy there were 2 groups of 4... 1 group of 8 and us.  Oh I forgot 1 guy at the bar.\nI have been here before a long time ago and the service was just the same.  Sad nothing has changed in 5 years. \nFAIL FAIL FAIL.
