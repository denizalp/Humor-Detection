... and having been back again a few days ago, I will leave my rating as 3-stars. The service was faster this time and the food was okay, but I really don't find anything special about it. I had a bowl of the Witch's Brew chowder which was pretty good, and the coleslaw that I missed the first time. Overall, I would say that the food is on par with other places that I have had fish and chips, although a little more expensive than some. I might return if in the area, but wouldn't travel across town just to go back.
