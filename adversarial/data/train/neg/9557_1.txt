Oh man. This is the bargain of the summer!\n\nThis little place is located just north of Bloor and Landsdowne. It has a pretty descent patio and even if it has lots of people on, it doesn't feel too crowded.\n\nThe service is quite fast and very cordial. \n\nNow, the food.\nThe range of choices is pretty vast and the quantity isn't overwhelming. \nVery well priced, the avg price for each item is in the ballpark of $5. \n\nThe ham and cheese sandwich was tasty like the \"prego\" sandwich (pork stake in a bun). But the real winner is the chicken wings. \nThe choice is between 12-18 and 24 pieces. Now, the whole msgs are very big but surely they are juicy and rich in flavour. \nThey come in 4 type: mild, medium, hot and honey mustard. \n\nSo, want to enjoy a pub fare for a very affordable price? Get your car and drive here. Or alternatively, you can hop off Landsdowne station and walk 5-10 mins north. \n\nGive it a try, you won't regret it! :)
