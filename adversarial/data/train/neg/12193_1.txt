When Mi Taco opened more than a year ago I wasnt a big fan. After a couple of visits, I learned you can custom your taco to taste legitimate, and I understand that they have to cater to all clientele. This is the best place to come with people that have different perspectives of mexican food, they will do the burrito with pineapple salsa, as well as the humble carne asada taco with corn tortilla, one of my favorites. Their salsa is one of the spiciest, as while I recommend to keep your choices simple, you can definetly customize your taco.
