Great lunch spot in downtown Gilbert! I came with my parents and we all got sandwiches. I got the hummazing, my dad got the pot roast dip, and my mom got the Reuben. We all loved them. The meat on my parents' sandwiches was perfect- not too tough or chewy. Mine was delicious- even without meat. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful. They gave great recommendations and explanations of the menu. \n\nThe only complaint that we have is that when they cleaned off our table there was an extra napkin that we don't think we used (and the staff surely doesn't know if we did) that they just put back on the clean pile on the counter. I know they were probably trying to reduce waste but it's also unsanitary because what if someone had used it or if it had gotten something on it while at the table.... I surely don't want to use used napkins when I come to a restaurant. (So we took off one star for this...)
