Bought LV at this store, my first one was purchased in Las Vegas, a Neverfull Damier Ebene GM.  Went there not sure which bag  I wanted.  My SA was Tiffany.  She gladly showed me an Alma, a Speedy, an Artsy and a Tivoli.  Settled on another Neverfull BM Monogram.  Love it.  Tiffany was pleasant and helpful.  My experience was great.  Will go back to buy a Speedy Damier, the large one soon!
