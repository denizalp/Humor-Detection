As someone with a long history of questionable haircuts, I approached this appointment with caution. The staff were so friendly and accommodating, and not at all judgmental (which I have encountered at places). They offered complimentary sparkling water, tea, coffee, espresso, & lattes. My appointment was with Shawn who was very friendly, but also didn't talk my ear off (which is perfect for me). He asked what I was looking for, I showed him two pictures on my phone, he said 'easy peasy' and got to work. He started with a stress-relieving neck, shoulder & scalp massage (amazing!!), then a shampoo, and then the cut. He was quick and professional, and asked throughout the cut if I wanted more water or anything else. At the end, my hair looked just like the pictures. I couldn't believe it. I will definitely continue seeing him. I'm almost sad it will be in 10-12 weeks.  To top it off, I got a gift bag with some samples and coupons when I left. Such a fantastic experience. It's a tiny bit pricey (compared to the hair schools I usually go to, which are obviously very discounted) but very comparable to other places and SO worth the money. Go here.
