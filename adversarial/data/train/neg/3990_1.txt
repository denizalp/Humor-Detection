The restaurant itself is quite large inside, offering patio seating where you can bring your dog to dine with you. The servers all wear plaid and it has a very American comfort feel to the place.\n\nWe dined here for lunch and half of our dishes were good, the other half so-so. We ordered the queso appetizer and I loved it. It was a bit spicy with fresh cilantro on top served with Cajun tortilla chips. For my entr√©e I ordered the bbq pulled pork sandwich with fries. The pork was extremely fatty and not a lot on the sandwich, it was mostly fried onions and coleslaw so I only had half of it. My friend ordered the tomato pesto pasta and I loved that. The serving sizes are large and come out on big plates so you can take some home for late. \n\nOur service was alright. Food came out quickly, our server checked on us a few times but nothing over the top. Overall it was an okay experience.
