This store's hit or miss with me. \n\nI've been able to find broccoli, lettuce, pre-made vegetarian burritos, desserts, etc.. all for a good price. I like that their tofu's always about .98 cents. Everywhere else it's a bit more. I also like that you can check yourself out--no lines! I've also gone in on a few occasions and left with nothing because I couldn't find any good deals. I do love their pre-made mozzarella and tomato sandwiches. So, so good. I tried re-creating it at home on my own (all with items I purchased at this store, ironically) and couldn't do it. I don't know how they do it, but they do.
