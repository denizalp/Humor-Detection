First time and we will definitely be back! From the minute we walked through the door we were greeted by Tony and Mike who introduced themselves to each member of our party individually. The service was amazing and the food was wonderful! One of the best Calazones I've ever had. You can tell that the food is made in house, from scratch. Great atmosphere, great service, great food. Thank you Casanova Brothers for the excellent experience!
