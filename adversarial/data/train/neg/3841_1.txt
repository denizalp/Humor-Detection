the desserts are so delicious! i had 3 of their cakes in one sitting... sooo goooddddd.\ncute little place.\nmade on the facility and totally fresh.\nhighly recommended!\nMy fav dessert is the Mille crepe- it's available on the weekends only. I enjoy creamy and mildly sweet desserts, which is why I enjoy this dessert the most.\nThey had their grand opening on Sunday Feb 22nd, and they sold out. I will definitely come back
