There are only two things I need from a waitress: a full drink and the ability to pay and leave when I want. This place had neither.\n\nI get it- it's an airport. I also get that I was there in the early morning, but it was during your open hours, so there should be no reason for me to be leaned over 7, count 'em, seven times for other waitresses to put random stuff on my table. They didn't want to refill my drink either. \n\nThe service was terrible. There were 5 waitress and about that many tables. We're dealing with a one to one ratio here. With that in mind, it's unreasonable that I be visited so little by my server. Once to order, once to bring my food, and once to bring the bill I hadn't asked for (that's cool, I won't have anything else) where I had to suggest that my  long-empty drink be refilled. \n\nShe never came back for me to pay- I approached the bar to do so after a long wait. Let's review for a minute that this is in an airport. People have flights to catch! \n\nThe food was actually decent- I didn't expect a good breakfast from chili's, so that's why this is a two star eating instead of one.
