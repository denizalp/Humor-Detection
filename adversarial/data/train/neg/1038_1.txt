Service was slow, never got bread, and the halibut special wasn't anything to brag about.  Halibut never really tastes fishy but when you cover it up with a weird white sauce and throw crab on it you might as well put cod on the plate.  Just not what you would expect from a $100+ dollar meal.\n\nCheck out the flemmings potatoes though.  It's a glimmer of hope, even though an extremely small portion for a \"family style\" portion.
