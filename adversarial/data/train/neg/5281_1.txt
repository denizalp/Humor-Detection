I actually think this is a 3.5, not just a three.  \n\nMom and I decided to head off the Strip to go get mani\/pedis.  So relaxing!  The guys were so nice.  My toes still look awesome a week and a half later.  My fingers started chipping the next day, but the next day was spent in Valley of Fire, so probably not the fault of the polish.  Mom's polish actually held up better than mine.  I was really hoping they would get my cuticles cleaned up and my heels softened a little more.  They did a good job, but not quite as good as my ladies at Asia Nails in Chicago.  It was still an enjoyable experience though.
