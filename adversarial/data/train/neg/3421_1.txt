We had a maternity and a newborn photoshoot with Liana and we loved it! She made me feel very comfortable and beautiful against all those extra pounds. The dresses she owns and you can use are amazing! During the newborn session I could not feel more relaxed. I trusted her with every move and positioning. It's obvious that she has expertise in handling newborns and she does it with so much care and love. What can I say... we loved the pictures and had to purchase extra since could not choose only 20. We recommend Liana's business. You will find an excellent photographer in her, as well as a genuine person with a big heart.
