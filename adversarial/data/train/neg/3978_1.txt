Parents central A\/C went out. Called this company to come out and investigate outage. Technician stated it was a defective blower, basically $800 to replace. We held off, asked a friend who works on A\/C units, turns out it was a burnt out component worth $20 to replace. He replaced it, and A\/C has been working perfectly fine since. \n\nI'm starting to think all service companies in Las Vegas are shady, unscrupulous, and dishonest. \nUnless you know someone you trust you can guarantee you're going to get ripped off and over charged.
