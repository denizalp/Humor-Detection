Our 2nd time here! And I liked my food selection better this time. We were with another couple who were first timers and had a Groupon offer.\n     Started with   which was good, not great the bread was to chrunchy as when bitten into the bread fell apart~\n       All our entrees were very good, salmon pieces in pasta with a vodka sauce, 2 orders of  spaghetti & meatballs and rigatoni w\/ meat sauce. The first 3 were specials~ the dessert menu is meza meza~predicable Italian options of which none were ordered.\n    Our server was attentive & DEFINATLY knew the menu!\n     A very nice dinner out at good prices. Would go back again & again
