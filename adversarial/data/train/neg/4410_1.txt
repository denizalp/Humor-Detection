This place is awesome. Today they had some missing items but I was okay with that because it was New Year's Eve and they probably ran out of. It has always been busy but it's not because it was slow. I only noticed if you take their sandwiches  to go  they may get soggy if you get a sandwich with oil and vinegar it got really soggy. Nice sandwich shop.
