Okay, so I thought this place was overly hyped but damn are their cheesecakes good! \nThe dine in line up can be super long and ridiculous, so we lined up for take out instead and were in and out in about half an hour. \nI love me a red velvet cheesecake and this is my #1 go to, it's just so light and fluffy while also being filling. I've also tried the celebration cake which tastes exactly like birthday cake. The mango lime one is a bit too sweet for me due to the coconut crust, while the dulce de leche along with the chocolate hazelnut crunch left me feeling meh. \nThe actual food on the other hand is so-so. For the price of a plate of alfredo, I expected a bit more and it was pretty plain and bland. Just something to keep in mind if you're not coming here solely for the cheesecake.
