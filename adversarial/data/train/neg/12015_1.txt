I really liked this place, as it is a nice change from our usual place First Watch. We went on a Tuesday at 10am and it was not crowded at all. The decor is unique. The waitress was really nice and told us the portions were big so my daughter and I choose to split a French toast. \n\nThe food was cooked perfectly and the whip cream tasted like cool whip, which reminded my of my childhood. I liked it but I know some people don't. \n\nOverall service was quick, the food was good, and it was a nice atmosphere.
