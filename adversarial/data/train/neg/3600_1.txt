This is the only place I come for oil changes; it's just convenience that they're located right around the corner, but I would probably drive a few more miles to go to this place in particular. The rates for oil changes are competitive with other quick lube places, they aren't $10, but I'm also not sitting in a lobby for an hour and I don't know about you but my time and sanity are valuable to me. Besides, $68 for a full syn oil change is about right anyway. \n\nThe guys that work here are super nice. They're not pushy like the gentlemen that are trying to sell you chip repairs. This is the only con associated with Dino lube- those guys will always flock to you. Given an option, I would always have my air filters changed by these guys, the price is on point (if not even a little cheaper) than buying the filters yourself. \n\nSo if you value your time like I do- stop in and be back on the road before your coffee has had any chance to cool down.
