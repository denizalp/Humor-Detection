If you are familiar with Java House, or Nirvana, or Red Room, Templeton's is another in this genre of low cost, high value, good table service type restaurant. It's located across the street from Supermarket at the top of Augusta Ave.\nWith a dark wood and well-stocked bar staring at you as you enter, this is a classic Toronto bar\/ restaurant where you can plop down, order some drinks and peruse the menu all in one motion as effortlessly as grabbing a NOW magazine on a Thursday and checking out who's gracing the cover.\nMy Viet style stew with chunks of beef and more than a hint of lemongrass really hit the spot as did the glorious caesar drink with the jumbo shrimp adorning the glass. This is a nice little spot just off the beaten path.
