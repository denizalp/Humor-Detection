Ordered delivery. Took two hours to arrive. When I called to ask where it was, the employee was incredibly rude and defensive. He told me that there had been another order near my same location, so they kept my order sitting in order to deliver at the same time. Terrible customer service to start. When the food arrived, it was somewhat cold (obvious that it had been sitting)
