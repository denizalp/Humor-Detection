I love the concept! I went with a group of friends shortly after this place opened in August. It was a rainy summer evening and the line was out the door and starting to go down the street! We decided to wait it out to give this place a try. After an hour wait, we made it inside and placed our order. The man working the cash register and taking orders this night was one of the owners. He was very pleasant and a great guy! We were even giving him some potential flavor recommendations and he was listening to all of them with an open mind! (Except for the one guy in front of us that recommended \"Creamed Corn\" flavored ice cream. The owners quickly rejected that flavor! And I am thankful they did!) We placed our order and watched them make our ice cream. It was a fun experience, seeing the whole process from starting with the liquid cream, adding all the ingredients and toppings, and finishing with the rolled ice cream. The quality of the ice cream was very good and I felt the $7 price was warranted.\n\nHowever, with the $7 price, I will only be returning for occasional visits when I am in the mood to treat myself to a sweet dessert.
