It's definitely more authentic Thai, but the pricing is way too high for food amounts. Some of the dishes were a bit odd, and quite unpalatable, e.g., one dish was ground meat with a giant hunk of uncut cabbage. The pad Thai was ok, the steamed noodles were not, not cHive cakes were super oily and too chewy, just raw rice paper with very little in them. The traditional chicken dish with oily rice was very old dry chicken that was just not edible
