I took a tour of this venue for my upcoming wedding. First impression of ownership and professionalism was very poor. The place itself is beautiful, especially the outside. When my fiance originally left a message with Patrick to schedule an appointment, he called us back and came off extremely rude. We showed up there for a tour at the scheduled time and the front door was locked so we walked to the back to find some people who were setting up for a wedding. Patrick wasn't there so another staff member helped us out. The staff seemed miserable and didn't make us feel very welcome. We were given some minor details and shown some pictures, but had to ask A LOT of questions to find out the important stuff. All in all, I will not be going with this place after my personal experience and after reading all the other reviews from yelp and The Knot. I understand things can come up during a wedding, but I want to limit the drama and issues as much as possible.
