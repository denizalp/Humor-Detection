Ok, so I have to confess, I was super-excited for this store to open.  In the US, it's a pretty good go-to location for reasonably priced, but reasonably nice kitchen, bed, and household products.   Unfortunately, the first Canadian location here in Toronto did not come with American prices, but instead came with extra high Canadian prices.  In fact, sometimes I am just shocked at what they charge.\n\nThat being said, the trick to shopping here successfully is to stop by occasionally with a list in your head of \"things you need to buy at some point\" not a list of \"must buy\" items.  At times things will go on sale and become reasonably priced and then you should by them.  Other times, you'll find some of their items are pretty reasonable. \n\nThe staff here are generally quite helpful...if you can find one.  It's one of those situations that when it's not busy, you get 10 offers for help when you're just browsing.  Then when you really need help, no one is to be found.  \n\nOverall, this is definitely a welcome addition to Toronto.  I have to say...I just don't quite enjoy shopping here that much.  Something about the big box store design in a downtown location with eyeball-scorching fluorescent lighting just doesn't do it for me.\n\nA TIP:  sign up for their e-mail ads and get frequent 20% off coupons.
