LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and make it a point to get dinner here every time I'm in Vegas. Il Mulino never fails to deliver an absolutely delicious and memorable evening and last night was no exception.\n\nTo start, as soon as you're seated, they bring out they bring out a selection of delicious breads along with a huge wedge of cheese from which they'll cut you a piece. The breads are so yummy - perhaps due in part to the high oil content, but if you're eating here, you've pretty much written off trying to be healthy at least for 1 meal, so just enjoy it :) Next up is some bruschetta (I'm veggie, but if you're not, it typically comes with mussels), fried zuchini and salami (again if you're not veggie). All of this, before you even order! To be honest, I was pretty full before I even looked at a menu!\n\nWe got the special mushroom ravioli in champagne cream sauce. Best sauce I've ever had, bar none. I'd almost go back to Vegas just for this sauce. The capellini with vodka sauce was almost equally delicious.\n\nWe were celebrating a birthday (which I had noted on my OpenTable reservation), so they brought us out a cannoli with a candle (on the house) and sang. It was really sweet of them to do this and the cannoli was to die for.\n\nOh, and did I mention the drinks are great too? Amazing wine selection and they make a really delicious sangria.\n\nOverall, if you're willing to throw calorie counting out the window (after all, you're in Vegas), definitely go here!
