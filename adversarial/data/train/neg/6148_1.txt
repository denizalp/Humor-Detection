It is a beautiful restaurant with lots of staff, but provides a mediocre dining experience.   We waited for over 45 minutes between the first course and our entrees and had to beg for water.   The lamb chops were mostly fat and everything else was extremely salty.   We couldn't wait to leave.   Oh, and prices are ridiculous.
