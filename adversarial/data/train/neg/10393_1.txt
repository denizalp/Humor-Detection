Popular burrito joint in the heart of the entertainment district. This new location is larger and better built to accommodate all of the party goers who frequent here late at night. They call out order numbers over their speaker system to keep things running efficiently when it gets busy. \n\nPortion sizes are generous here for the price. But make no mistake, this is a place for cheap food that skimps on the quality. I ordered a naked chicken burrito and the meat looked like a mushy pile that tasted really dry. Everything else on the plate was standard fare for a  burrito and wasn't anything special. \n\nIf you're looking for a quick late night bite in the area, then Burrito Boyz is an option. But don't expect anything more than that Imo.
