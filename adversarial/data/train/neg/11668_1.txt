Worst waiting time. They told me only 1 hour to wait, after an hour had passed I went up to the front and asked how much longer. They informed me it was a 30 minute wait. So I ended up waiting 2 hours for a table. Ordered my food. The fries were cold and soggy and the pasta had no taste. It was so plain and not satisfying. We told them the food was horrible and the service was horrible as well. \nServer never came back to the table. Flagged another waitress down and asked for the bill. Only then did the original waitress come. I also ordered a cheesecake, she put that on the bill. Never brought my cheesecake. Ended up waiting 20 minutes cause she \"forgot\". Don't think im going back there if the service continues like that.
