I am so truly fortunate to live within walking distance of this hidden gem! Delicious, organic juices, healthy salads and gluten free baked goods that are so fantastic. Green Dragon is my ultimate fav juice- spicy!!, Keri Green when I want a little bit on the sweeter side and the Flu Shot is a staple every time I feel a little something coming on. Warning: Garlic and oregano will ensure NO VAMPIRES, nor sickness (or anyone else for that matter )coming close anytime soon:)! Seriously stops the funk dead in its tracks before becoming a full fledged cold!  Miraculous! \n\nThe kale and quinoa salad is nothing short of fantastic. Protein cinnamon raisin cookies and morning Glory Muffins will knock your socks off! \nGreat energy here- you are always greeted personally with a smile from lovely Jodi and the nice gal on Mondays who's name is eluding me. Simply awesome!! Can I double my stars??? 10++++
