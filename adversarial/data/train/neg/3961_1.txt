The food quality and quantity has declined in the past 5 months. We ordered Chicken Parmesan take out...the first time was excellent, the second time the chicken was smaller and less sauce. The third time there was no sauce on the noodles (literally no sauce)The food was dry, the salad had spoiled cucumbers, brown lettuce and the lasagna dinner was dry too. So disappointed!
