My family and I like this place because it's nearby. Their pad thai is probably my favourite dish. I love the firm tofu in it and it's the perfect amount of sweet and savoury. The pad thai comes with both chicken and shrimp for one price ($9.99) and a lot of other places make you choose one or the other or pay more to have both included. Their pho, vermicelli, curries, and pork chop dishes are good too. Their green curry is so yummy and has just the right amount of coconut flavour in it. There's also a generous amount of chicken (or whatever protein you decide to get, I suppose). Service is meh, but I never expect much from places like these. Sometimes you get a server that will crack a smile at you and other times, you'll get a server that looks like she would rather be doing anything else but working there. Totally random side note, but their take out boxes are pretty nice. Lol. Whenever we get take out, we keep the boxes so we can give leftovers to friends and relatives without losing our Tupperware.
