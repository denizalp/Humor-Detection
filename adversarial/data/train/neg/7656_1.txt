I've been here probably 10 times and never did a review but today was really cool. My printer crapped out on me so I needed to print some docs and sign them and scan and email back. \n\nIt's been awhile since I needed to do that. Back in the day it was a fiasco to get that done but Fedex has made it pretty easy. I was greeted by Lassiter who gave me a handshake. He explained how everything works and let me be. Pretty cool to be greeted because normally it's a point and grunt most places and you're left to figure it out. \n\nGot everything done in 20 minutes, even ordered Panera on my phone while I was working and picked up next door for the ride home. \n\nThis place was smaller but they bought the next door space and expanded. It's legit now and makes it easy to do business here. They get 5 stars because the place was clean, open and customer service was on point.
