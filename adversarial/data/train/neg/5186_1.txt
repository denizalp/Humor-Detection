Undoubtedly 5 star tacos. \nAll tortillas are hand made and fresh with every taco.\nHighly recommend which I believe to be the highlight of their taco lineup the \"Chiwas taco\".(combination of meats).  A close second would be their Carne Asada taco,(meat prepared medium rare~ LOVE IT) which I personally believe could benefit from some avocado based salsa option but still excellent with out. \n \nTacos are smaller, but plenty of meat and garnish with each one.  I personally would recommend 6-7 tacos to be satisfied. \n\nSmall place , attentive staff, could also benefit from a drive thru. \n\nThank you and we'll be back with some friends!
