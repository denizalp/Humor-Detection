Best place for sushi in town, especially vegetarian sushi. They staff is always friendly and knowledgeable about the amazingly large menu The service for the sushi the last couple of times has been slower than when we first started coming but it was back to it's old speed tonight. I would give it a 4.5 only because of that minor inconsistency. The food certainly deserves a whole hearted 5-Stars.\n\nTry the tempura cream cheese maki for a subtly sweet offering that pairs well with a sushi meal.
