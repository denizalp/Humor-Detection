Interesting little shop that sells candy and soda. All different types of soda and candy that I haven't seen in years. I wonder if the candy is still being made now or if they are selling candy made in the 70's. lol. Astropops! They still make you? Big League Chew! It was a blast from the past.\nThey have a TON of metal signs on the walls that are cool and available for sale. There was nothing here I wanted to try, but it was very cool coming in and seeing all the stuff.
