We were in Vegas visiting family, and wanted to take them out for a nice meal.  My choice was to head over to Ghandi for some take tasty Indian food, but the group's overall palate wasn't up. To that.\nWe settled on this place because my Sister had heard great things about it.... I figured you couldn't be in business for that long if you sucked....wish I had read the yelp reviews first before dropping almost $300 on second rate food.\n\nWent in at 6 , and were asked if we had a reservation. No, we didn't, considering the (outward) size of the place didn't think we would need them. \nWe were given the choice of eating in the lounge...I'm ok with that,in fact I believe you can usually get better service in lounges\/bars.\n\nOur server was efficient and friendly, if not a bit aloof.  That was pretty much as good as it was going to get.\nFood was Sizzler quality,at best.  MY rare prime rib was med_well. Wife's food was cold,, mushroom on her special not even cooked. Our server did get her a new mushroom for her filet, which was also overcooked. . The appetizers (scampi and crab cakes) were amusing,in an amateur chef kind of way. \n\nThe rest of the group's meals kept the same,low standards... burnt baked potato, etc.  To add insult to injury, I was charged for 2 extra pieces of bread....classy.\nNo manager presence to be seen until on our way out the door...\n\nOur server did her best, and was friendly, but Decent service will never compensate for second rate food.\nMoral of the story: don't waste your time or money.
