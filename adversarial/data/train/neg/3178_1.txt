Veronica did the best job! I got my hair and make up done for my wedding 10\/08\/2016. I had previously been for trials a couple of months prior so I already knew it would be great. What I didn't expect was that'd I love my day of hair and make up even more than when we went through it the first time.\n\nI was running a little late the day of, but when I finally made it I wasn't made to feel rushed or stressed at all. I got right in and we went right to work. I enjoyed talking with Veronica throughout my appointment. It definitely helped to keep my nerves settled. The end result of all her hard work was beautiful and I received so many compliments. She's awesome! \n\nAll in all, the customer service was great, the end result was great, the services were affordable, and I would definitely recommend. I will be back if and when I need hair and make up done for anything.
