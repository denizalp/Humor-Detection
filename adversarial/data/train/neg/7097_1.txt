All you need is LOVE!\n\nWhen in Las Vegas, you must see this show!  I didn't think anything could ever top O, but somehow LOVE just blew it out of the water.  LOVE seemed to be more modern dance-oriented than circus-oriented, while also incorporating some great video footage.  The music took me to a happy, nostalgic, and euphoric place - marijuana not necessary!  I loved all the characters.  I want to see it again and again, and share it with everyone.  If John Lennon could see LOVE, he would be so proud.    \n\nNote: I would not recommend it for young children.
