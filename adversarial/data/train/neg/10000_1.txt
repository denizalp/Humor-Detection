It's early in the morning at the PHX airport, and there aren't very many food options. What should one do? Go to the golden arches, then hate yourself afterwards? Nah. Don't do that. Go to Paradise in the C concourse of Terminal 4. Especially convenient if you are flying Southwest Airlines to Denver. It's open really early and you'll actually enjoy (somewhat) what you are eating.\n\nI can speak for breakfast and lunch here. Breakfast is more of a two-star experience given that the bagel, sausage, egg and cheese sandwich I had could have more flavor if it was dipped in jet fuel (which it might have been). The lunch\/dinner options are much better, ranging from 3 to 4 stars, for an airport mind you. Try anything with a croissant. It will rock your socks off.
