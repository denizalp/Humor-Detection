This restaurant is so bomb!! Definitely a go to spot that never ever disappoints. They always check if you need a refill on your chips,salsa,  and water. Food is so fresh and their fajitas are amazing. Always be aware of what time you go there because it can get super packed. I would recommend going for lunch or as early as you can for dinner cause I have definitely waited a decent amount of time to get seated. Worth it though!
