If you like kabobs you have to go here, and if you don't like kabobs you need to go here. \nPro tip: Order a wrap (don't get it hot unless you want to lose your face - that sh!t is seeeeriously spicy), a Greek salad (much much better than you'd expect a salad to be) and ask them for the garlic sauce  You're welcome.
