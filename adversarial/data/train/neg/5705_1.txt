First visit today. Excellent brewed coffee. Clean with plenty of seating. Prices are very good. The four stars are for the coffee.\nThe bad news: the few food items are not so good. I tried a turkey and cheese brioche. They do not offer to warm them for you, instead you are handed a cold meat and cheese brioche, when you ask you are directed to a microwave out in the dining area. If you warm it for the recommended time it is scalding hot on the outside (I actually burned my mouth) and still frozen on the inside. I would only give the food a one star.\nI will stop by for coffee to go in the future, but will skip any of the food options.
