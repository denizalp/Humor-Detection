I am probably out of the norm based on other reviews but I really don't get the hype here.  The place was packed at 11:30am...the line was literally out the door and a 20 minute wait.  \n\nI had the double double and fries (not animal style).  What I got was a double double animal style and soggy fries.  The burger is way oversauced and super messy.  The taste pretty good but I don't think it is anything ridiculous that I haven't had at other decent burger chains.  The fries should definitely be ordered well done as another yelper suggested.  Mine were soggy and lack luster.  \n\nI'm not one for crowds or lines for burgers and fries...but that is just me.
