My own Lawrenceville bar crawl has serendipitously become the usual routine when I find myself with a free day.  This inevitably starts with a stop at Hop Farm and I work my way down Butler Street (and sometimes across the 40th Street Bridge and into Millvale, but that's another story). \n\nWhen Hop Farm first opened, I have to admit, I wasn't really impressed.  I think the name turned me off as I am not a fan of really hoppy beers and nothing really stood out to me with their first few offerings.  But once they started offering samplers and pints and branched out their brews, my feelings started to change.  Could I like a place with the word \"hop\" in its name?  The answer: yes!  I've enjoyed their session ales, coffee porter, even a pint of their more sour beers while sitting at a corner of the bar.  They even offer sausages and a cheese plate that pairs with their samples.\n\nThe space includes several tables as well as the bar for easy entertaining whether by yourself or with a group of friends.  Even when it's crowded it doesn't feel crowded.  The atmosphere has a nice open flow and the owners\/bartenders could not be nicer.\n\nBe warned, parking there can be a little tricky.  There are a few spots at the side of the building but the road is very narrow.  Hop Farm happens to be on part of Butler Street where there is no parking so you'll have to go a few blocks down or turn down a side street if there's no space next to the building.  My suggestion is to get their early.  That way you don't have to worry about parking or finding a seat at the bar.
