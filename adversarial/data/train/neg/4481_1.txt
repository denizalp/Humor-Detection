Wish I could give zero stars. This place seems like a health hazard. The first rule of food prep safety is to keep the cold items very cold and the hot items very hot. Anything in between becomes a breeding ground for bacteria growth. Multiple items that we tried were lukewarm. I asked for a refund. The manager wouldn't take my word for it and went to check with the kitchen. Eventually he admitted that some of the items I complained about were below 140Â° (apparently that's the magic number). He offered a partial refund. I wouldn't budge, and ultimately we got the full amount returned. Beware!
