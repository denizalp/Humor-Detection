I absolutely loved the vibe at Olive and Ivy! The indoor is just as great as the amazing outdoor.  The open kitchen and spacious dining room is great.  The food is definitely delicious and innovative.  My compliments to the chef and the creative minds who put together the menu. I recommend this place for a cocktail after work, dinner, or even a nice weekend afternoon, I will definitely be back.
