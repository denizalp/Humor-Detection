I have actually been to Pizzeria Bianco a couple of times, and every single time, it is as delicious as the last. This time I took my fiancé, as she has been wanting to go for quite some time. The service was fantastic, like we were usuals who come in often. They made her experience memorable. When it came to ordering, our server recommended the Sunday Gravy, and my fiancé absolutely loved it. We ended up sharing that, and a 50\/50 pizza. The food couldn't have been any better, and I look forward to taking her back again soon.
