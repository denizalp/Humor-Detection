I went for dinner with a group of friends and was super excited for this place. I missed Lisa G's and unfortunately, my expectations exceeded reality. The menu was good and some of the items were somewhat original, but it was the same theme among restaurants serving lunch food for dinner.  Central Phoenix seems to be notorious for this and I typically do not mind it most nights but tonight was different. \n\nI split the mac and cheese and goat cheese salad with my friend that actually worked out perfect. The food was good, but somewhat bland. Thumbs up for the chili peppers in the mac and cheese to heighten the taste. The goat cheese salad with strawberry was flavorful but the dressing was a bit too sweet for my taste. My other other friends ordered the sandwiches that came with chips and were satisfied with their orders. They have a great beer draft menu and saw a couple of beers that I have not seen in other restaurants, which is a total plus! \n\nSo the food was good and had a great selection of beer, so why 3 stars? The SERVICE from before I even stepped foot into the restaurant! I called earlier that day to see if they were taking reservations since we had 6 people. She said she wasn't sure if they were and that she would call me back. I never received a call so I called back later that day for a followup. During dinner, there was a consensus that our service was not up to par, and we thought our server had some personal issues going on. After speaking with the waiter, who was very nice once he talked, made it known to us that they were understaffed and was having a busy night. I didn't think it was his fault for his lack of service but thought that management should of hired enough people, especially on a Friday night. \n\nI am planning to revisit at a later time when they are more established and I have great hopes for a better experience.
