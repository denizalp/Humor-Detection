Good decor, good food. But honestly, $45 for a soltani is borderline theft, if you ask me! Go to North or some other Persian restaurant which is as good, and save yourself $20. At $45 for a meal, you can get a decent steak at a steakhouse. With apps and a drink, you're paying close to $80 with tax and tip.
