Quite the variety of appetizers and entrees.  One of the best filets I have ever eaten.  We went there on a Friday night and it was busy, of coarse.  I didn't have a reservation but I think they slipped us in.  The server was very knowledgeable about the cuisine and all-in-all liked everything.  Thanks Vintner!
