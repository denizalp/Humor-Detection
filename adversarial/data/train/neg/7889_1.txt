Could have been that they were not prepared or hungover from the CES conventions. However, this place was incredibly overrated. Kitchen with less than 20 tables in the restaurant was backed up by an hour. Wait was 30 minutes to sit when clearly there was multiple tables open. After sitting 15 minutes to get drinks. Food came 1 hour later. So all in all was my burger that good? Not exactly. I would say In -N - Out for 75% less than our bill is just as good if not better. \n\nIt could be the fact the were an hour late on food service so they hurried through to make it. But being on the strip with competition of the best restaurants to eat in the casinos I would have expected more.
