The Franklin lounge is perched near the lobby area of the hotel. The lounge is intimate and seductive with dark brown tones and dimly lit. Love the aesthetics! \n\nThe well crafted drinks range from classics to creations to barrel aged. As for the Classics, we've selected the Basil Paloma, which was very refreshing with the added Jarritos grapefruit soda. Another selection was the the Delano daiquiri. \n\nAs for the Creations section, the Mr. Hyde was the choice for the entire night. Other good choices were the Tea for Eleanor and Apple of my eye (literally smells and taste like apple pie). \n\nKeep in mind that luxury like these well crafted drinks comes at a price - you'll find drinks are poured for a premium, but they're worthy of the charge.\n\nThe one thing to keep in mind is that the lounge is fairly small and can get crowded quickly. In all, it's a very good choice if you prefer and value well crafted drinks with an intimate setting.
