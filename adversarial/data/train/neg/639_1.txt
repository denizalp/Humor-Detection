We used to go here all the time a few years ago.  Raved about the food.  But now they hire high school kids or younger individuals that only refill your glass once before the bill.  I am disappointed as I informed the owner, via their website about their poor service.  Sadly no reply.  I am disappointed that their owners were not proactive in retaining customers and just moving forward with hiring their kid's friends.  I have always enjoyed the food here but the service sucks.  Who wants to wait 45 minutes for a water refill?  I've given this place a try and try agin as I want to go here as it is very close to my home.  But there is only so much you can do if  management provides sub-par service.
