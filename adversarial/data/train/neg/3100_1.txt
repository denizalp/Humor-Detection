If you don't have health insurance, this is the place to go for eye exams. They cost $77 for glasses which is the cheapest I've found, except Wal-Mart ($70), but you're getting a quality eye exam here. They accept both walk-ins and appointments. \n\nThis office is spotless and carries a good variety of frames ranging from high-end designers to more affordable options. The doctor and his assistant are very nice and helpful. While their lenses are pricey, I definitely will return for my annual exam.
