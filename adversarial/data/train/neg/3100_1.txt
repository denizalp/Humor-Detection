Enter Fawn: a world of mix & match, elegant-retro and effortlessly cool-looking fashion. Fawn stands for \"Fashion attitude wit nostalgia\" and owner Kasha Bilobram stays true to her vision by curating thoughtful collections in this Queen West boutique. \n\nShe carries clothing and accessories from up-and-coming brands (e.g. Montreal's Complexgeometries) interspersed with some carefully chosen vintage pieces. A lot of the clothes have a chic-unique aesthetic created by pieces that have interesting take on cut and draping but a minimalist perspective on prints and colours. \n\nThe accessories are more playful and even quirky at times but don't reach kitsch-level, maintaining the elegant yet edgy vibe of the boutique. You can find Fawn (and a completely styled outfit with the help of Kasha- she's pretty friendly when prodded) under the Chocolate Factory Lofts and across from Trinity Bellwoods Park.
