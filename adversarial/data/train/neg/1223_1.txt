I went here for lunch on a weekday with the bf. It was just ok. The carrot soup I had with my sandwich was very good. But the BLT I ordered was just dry and lacking in flavor. The Niciose sandwich the bf got had the hardest bread. He didn't like it too much either. This place is also in a somewhat sketchy area it seemed.
