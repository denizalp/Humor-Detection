It was about time I wrote up a review for Sun Devil Auto.\nI see that they are always busy and the reason I know they don't have any Yelp reviews is because they happen to be near a lot of mobile homes and senior communities.  There are A LOT of thank you notes and letters in their shop though, rather than internet reviews. :D\n\nI've taken all of my cars there and let's just say I have not had one bad experience.\nEvery time I come out and think to myself, \"It was cheaper than I had originally thought!\" which is a very good thing.\nChrysler 300's are notorious for this little pink plastic piece breaking in the gear change assembly.  The car wouldn't shift out of park.  Reading up on it on the internet, my dad and I thought we could do it our selves.  We did manage to fix it, but then the key wouldn't come out of the ignition.  After a while, I decided to take it to Sun Devil and they could have charged me for a couple hundred bucks.  Instead, they showed integrity and told me one part had been put back together wrong, and said they would only charge for the labor of taking it apart and putting it back together.  They ended charging me less than twenty dollars even though they had spent considerable amount of time on it.  Honestly, they could have charged me two hundred bucks and I wouldn't have been the wiser.  \nI take all my cars here for the oil changes and they never try to sell you air filters and belts that every other oil change place seem to do.  \n\nAnother good example of their stand-up service is how they always give you a ride to and from if need be.  One time I was there, a couple from another state were having trouble with their van\/RV and they stopped by Sun Devil Auto for some help.  The staff was friendly enough to take them to the nearby laundromat so they could do their laundry while they waited for their car to be fixed!  \n\nIt's too bad I moved to North Phoenix though, I'm too far away now!
