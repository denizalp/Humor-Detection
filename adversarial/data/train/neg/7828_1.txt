Came today with a friend whose car was to say the least a challenge. They did a great job inside and out and were extremely thorough. Everyone on staff was friendly and accommodating as well.  They have an inside and outside waiting area which is nice, and offer soda, water, and soon coffee while you wait. The best thing is that while it is part automated wash, it is totally brush-less, and they do a majority by hand.  So far they beat those Fabulous guys by a mile as far as giving a good end product.  I would imagine that as people get to know them it can be busy and the wait could be better than half an hour.  I think it will be worth the wait.
