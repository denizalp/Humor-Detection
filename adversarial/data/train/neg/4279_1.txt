I love this place! It is so awesome how they don't try to nickel-and-dime you like most places. I went in because of a Dying battery and also because a piece of plastic under my car had been knocked loose and was dragging. Not only did they honor my lifetime battery warranty comma replacing it for the second time. They also didn't charge me anything for putting the plastic piece back up. That might seem like a small thing to some people but when you consider the way most car places try and get out of honoring warranties if they can and charging for every little thing it's pretty impressive.
