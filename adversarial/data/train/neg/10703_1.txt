From the drinks to the decor this is place is perfect. I loveeee my matcha and I haven't been able to find ANYWHERE in Arizona that has a decent iced matcha latte until I went to Teaspressa. No joke the matcha was easily the best I've had-- so much so that I thought about getting one to-go. My best friend got a London fog and said it was also to die for. Although the rose petals make for the perfect Instagram aesthetic *beware* they're not very appetizing when accidentally sipped lol. Also, know that parking is very limited as well as time restricted. My friend and I met there to chat, so we ended up parking in the neighborhood right next to it!
