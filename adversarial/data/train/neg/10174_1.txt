Have been sitting at the bar waiting to be served since 7:14pm it is now 8pm. Took 2x to get food ordered and it has yet to be served. Asked for chips and salsa and when it came out with the bus boy the waitress took it from him and gave it to someone else. Took another 10 min to get chips and salsa. Cola has been sitting on the bar watered down and has not been refreshed....DONT come here if your hungry and want good food.
