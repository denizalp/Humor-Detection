You have to try the lobster bisque! It would be the only reason I would come here. We were put at the table right in front of the kitchen. It was loud and hard for my partner to hear me. The table had drink marks from the previous couple who were sitting there before us. When we asked to be moved somewhere else, they were a bit hesitant but moved us anyways. \n\nFood took a while to come, but was understandable since the restaurant was packed. We had the seafood paella which was decent and ribs which were okay. The soup was delicious. It was steaming hot when they brought it to us and the puff pastry was fluffy.
