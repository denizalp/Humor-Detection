Been to Anatolia several times but hadn't had anything memorable til my last visit. The seafood saut√© was excellent - I couldn't choose between salmon and shrimp and this was the perfect mix, also including calamari. The sauce really made the dish. I also tried their baba - it was really bland and I was disappointed. I also think they charged me the non happy hour price for that app and that was annoying since the dish wasn't good at all! Their pita bread is swerved warm and is soft and pillowy. Yum! They also have my fave sauvignon blanc (Kim Crawford). I'd definitely be back for the seafood dishes. The restaurant is busy but wasn't too crowded for a Friday night. They have a cozy fireplace in the back, the ambiance is good for a date. It was a a little pricey compared to other restaurants on Lee, an app, entree, and one glass of wine was $42.
