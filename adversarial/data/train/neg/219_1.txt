Excellent! Only one downside: very very small counter for dining in, seats max 2 people \n\nNow for the good:\n\nWe had the rib eye steak burritos (one with rice and one with noodles)\n\nAsk for it with no chipotle and extra spicy sauce for a kick \n\nLove that they use high quality rib eye steak, cooked perfectly + fresh tomatoes and cheese \n\nIncredibly tasty - would make a special trip into this area to eat again
