When I work late nights at work, I'll drop by Harry's.\n\nI'm unsure of their hours, but I usually reach here around 9:30ish and they are still open.\n\nSuper cheap burgers, with one of the best poutines I've ever had! And the poutine is in a huge take out box, it's enough for 2 or 3 people! Totally worth the money!\n\nCash only.\n\nA must try!
