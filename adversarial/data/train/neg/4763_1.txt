Simply put, Swenson's cheeseburgers are the measuring stick for all other burgers.  So far, none can compare.  I would take a Swenson's double cheeseburger any day over a $30 kobe beef gourmet burger in a hoity-toity upscale restaurant.  It's simple, elegant, the meat has the most incredible (and mysterious) flavor, the buns are perfection, and the melted velveeta cheese is dynamite.  Do yourself a favor and try one if for some reason you never have.  Oh, and don't forget an order of the potato teasers and a mint whip (a most curiously delicious & light \"milkshake\" thing) while you're there!\n\nOh and if the weather is bad do the hardworking runners a favor and pull in close to the building under the awning - don't make them run around in the cold rain\/snow!
