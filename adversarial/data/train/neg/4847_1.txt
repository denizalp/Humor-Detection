I went in to pick up a bike with my wife today. Tim had specially ordered it for her, he obviously cares about his customers and works hard to make them happy. She got all the safety equipment and accessories she needed and wanted and was riding this afternoon. Thanks Tim, and all of you at Global Bikes.
