My friend and I went to Burger Joint as soon as they opened today so we knew we'd be the first ones there. We were warmly welcomed and, of course, told to sit anywhere. I'm a vegan but my friend is not. She enjoyed looking over the menu quite thoroughly while I had the sole main \"burger\" option for myself. She selected the patty melt medium rare and I had the portabello mushroom burger. We also decided to share an order of tater tots that come with a side of sriracha ketchup.\n\nWhen our orders came, I was so pleased to see how perfectly cooked everything was. The portabello mushroom for my \"burger\" was cooked just right. Quite often they are so drippy, but this was not the case. The avocado was also divine. Nothing worse that a nasty avocado. \n\nMy friend was also quite happy with her patty melt. She made a lot of yummy and mmm-mmm sounds so I'm guessing that was a good sign. ;)\n\nI have to say I was a BIG fan of the Tater Tots. And loved the sriracha ketchup. I love spicy foods and this was just right. They don't add a ton of seasoning to the Tater Tots themselves, so you'll wants to add a touch of S&P, but that's it. These things were addictive, but so BIG! After that big portobello burger I really couldn't eat that many of the tots, even though we were sharing.\n\nI really enjoyed our lunch here and even though we were early I was surprised that more people weren't coming in as we were leaving. I'm wondering if people don't want to pay for high quality ingredients (which they DO use) or if it's the fact that all they do is burgers? I'll be spreading the word, for sure, because even for a vegan? I really loved it.\n\nGreat job, Burger Joint. Thank you for a wonderful meal.
