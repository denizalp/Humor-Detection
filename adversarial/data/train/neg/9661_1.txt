We are new to the neighborhood. We were regulars at Papa Murphy's in our previous neighborhood, and know what a good Papa Murphy's product should look and taste like. We've tried this location several times to give it a fair shot. There is no consistency in the pizzas. Sometimes the thin crust is thin and other times it's slightly thinner than regular crust. We've ordered on line and paid extra for extra toppings only to receive light amount of toppings. No leadership seen at the store. Often the kids working are understaffed. They are usually polite to the customer and each other. Just very very inconsistent with their product. Good luck when ordering from this location.
