Efficient staff with even measured decorum. I had two eggs with creton and baked beans. Odd, their creton is served in a market-wrapped portion. Probably accessible in grocery stores soon. All elements of the meal we're fine. My wife had the egg benedict. The hollandaise sauce was rather sweet but still pleasant. Really folks, a good breakfast place but without the charm of a 'mom & pop' intangibles.
