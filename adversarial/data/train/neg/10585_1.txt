This is one of my favorite movie theaters in the Charlotte area, despite my lack of enthusiasm for shopping malls.  I normally attend movies in the late afternoons or evenings during the week and I don't purchase snacks or drinks; however, I'm super appreciative of this theater being clean and easy to locate within the mall (down at the end, across from Forever 21).  The movie schedules are great and I have even seen a few movies here that most other theaters do not show.  (For example, Dallas Buyers Club.)  There are electronic ticket kiosks if you don't want to wait in line for a ticket and I've always been a fan of the lighting near the entrance of the theater.  It doesn't really feel like you're in the middle of an outlet mall.  (Thank goodness.)  I'd give this theater five stars if the seats reclined.  :-)
