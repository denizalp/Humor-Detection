Disappointed by this place despite excellent Yelp rating. \n\nService and ambience were excellent. The mushroom quesadilla appetizer. Was very good although little bit small for sharing. The arepase appetizer was also quite good but incredibly tiny. My Venezuelan friend was very surprised by the size of each bite sized arepa.  I'm vegetarian, so they customize one of the entr√©es for me. It was quinoa with roasted cauliflower. The quinoa was overly salty and roasted cauliflower wasn't cooked enough to really complement the  quinoa. .\n\n\nMargarita was average considering it was a specialty drink. I think it was the one with Tamron and\/or chili pepper in it.\n\nMy dining companions also ordered dessert of churro lollipops. They said it was good but not spectacular. \n\nWould not come back. Excellent service and ambience brought up my rating to 3 stars.
