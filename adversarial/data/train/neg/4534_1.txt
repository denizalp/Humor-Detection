I have used these guys a couple times in the past at other locations, and always liked them. I went to the location on Tropicana and Pecos to get my oil changed for $19 a couple weeks ago.  They had also gone over some areas that needed attention and showed me how bad my front tires were, so I was there at this location today to get 2 new ones.\nThe price they gave me at the other location was the same here, I mentioned the Yelp $75 for $50 deal and got that, and I was given an estimate of 90 minutes for them to change the tires out. I walked around to the nearby bars and shops, there were lots in walking distance. They called me after about an hour and said she was ready, I walked back, paid the bill and was out the door. \nAs a young-ish single woman anything with auto shops can be one big sales pitch, or I get worried they're going to take advantage of me. I didn't feel that way at all, they notified me that I needed new brakes for about $200 more including labor and I felt that was fair, and believed they did actually need replacing because they were screeching. Bryan assisted me and was great. If you want fast and easy repairs for a fair price, I highly recommend!
