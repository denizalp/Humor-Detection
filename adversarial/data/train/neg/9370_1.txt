This place is just your avg linen store. Thryve got a large selection of curtains but the longest they carry are 95\" and of course we need longer than that. I did score some place mats on clearance for .50 :) They've got a little As Seen On TV section and that's about the highlight of that trip.\n\nFriendly workers,  clean & organized store.
