When i got there i was like WTH? Small little casa you park in the back but then you walk in and BAM!!!  All sorts of good stuff! Good  DJ and great menu of drinks. I had the strawberry horchata and it was one of the best non alcoholic drinks ive EVER had. Go to this place get a whatever and chill out if the temperature isnt at SCORCH outside!
