This is CASH ONLY FYI. Came here while on a business trip. My co worker and I were in need of some r&r. The staff is friendly. But the really nickel and dime you. I paid $80 for a full set of acrylic and a classic pedicure. My nails were also not worth the price. I had to tell the lady 3 times my pointer finger was crooked and she kept saying she'll fix it, only to not fix it and when I reminded her again she said it was because the way my finger was shaped. She ended up filing the other side but it is not a fix. Over all I have had much better for less. And I didn't even get an actual manicure, she clipped my nails and then began to glue the tips on. She didn't trim my cuticles or do anything else for my hands. My acrylic was supposed to be $35 but because I asked for the coffin shape they added $10! And she didn't tell me that until later. And I only got regular OPI color. Classic Pedicure for $35 was worth it, great foot massage. But my co worker got screwed. She came in with gel on her fingers and toes and just wanted a mani\/pedi with new gel color and they charged her an additional $5 removal fee per hand and toes. Her gel mani was $40 and the pedi was $50. So $100 just to get a gel mani\/pedi. Only go here of your desperate. Clean facilities A++.
