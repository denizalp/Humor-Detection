I'm a little torn between the weighing maching and the traditional way.  Reading the other reviews online it seems that some people were charged over 4 bucks for 2 scoops.  When I get my 2 scoops it is nomally around 2.50 per cone.  I think that is a pretty fair price.  The ice cream itself is nothing special.  They also do not have soft serve.  I would much rather have a East Coast Custard, but here you get the Tremont experience.
