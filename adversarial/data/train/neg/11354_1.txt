Ordered some various poke and was disappointed that the amount they give you is less than the actual amount because of all the sauce that's in the container. I ordered Spicy Tuna Poke, Wasabi Poke, Kim Chee Cucumber, and Top Shell Poke. I loved all except the Wasabi Poke as there was way too much Soy Sauce that was marinaded in. My favorite was the Spicy Poke. They don't do Poke Bowls so you have to get rice next door if you want to have a Poke Bowl. It's kind of out of the way from the strip but I wanted Poke for dinner and the place near the strip closes early. Good option for later evening poke.
