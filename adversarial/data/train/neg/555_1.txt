I love Wild Thaiger.  I only gave it 4 stars because the service can be hit or miss.  Lately it has been a great experience (yay).  I love their hot and sour chicken soup and their Tofu Towers (awesome).  Another favorite of mine is their yellow curry tofu lunch special.  Give it a try and see for yourself!
