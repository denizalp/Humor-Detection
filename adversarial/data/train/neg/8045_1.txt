The whole experience, from design to installation, was outstanding.\n\nI first worked with Great Spaces, owned by Melanie, who did the design and worked with me to maximize the space in my small master closet. She was so creative; I never imagined how much storage she could create with so little space. She made great suggestions that I never would have thought of myself.\n\nAfter the product was ordered, we had to postpone installation for a long time while I was desperately trying to get my closet floor tiled, which had to be done before the closet could go in. In that time, the business went through a management change (Great Spaces is now owned by Tailored Living), but Melanie and the new owner Jerry kept me apprised of the situation and made sure I was taken care of. They were so patient while they waited for my floors to get done -- even though it meant they had to store my materials. They were understanding about it and never made me feel rushed.\n\nWith the floors finally done, Jerry and his assistant Karina just finished installing the closet today. The closet is beautiful, even better than I had envisioned. I could not be happier. Some of the specs ended up being a little off, which they could not have known until today. Without hesitation Jerry said he would order the extra product to fix it. He also made a suggestion during install that made the design work even better in the space. He is truly going above and beyond to make the job 100% perfect.\n\nThe installation was quick and completed on-time, and they cleaned up after they were done. They explained everything to me and there were no surprises throughout the entire process.\n\nI will absolutely use this company again and recommend it to anyone looking for custom closet\/storage solutions.
