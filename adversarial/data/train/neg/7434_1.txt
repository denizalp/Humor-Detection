My family and I went here for a late lunch. I order the tomato basil and half a grilled cheese, my mom ordered the egg salad sandwich and a cup of chicken noodle. The sandwiches were a lot better than the soup. My 2 year old niece really enjoyed the egg salad. The sweet tea was also very good! But the soups weren't very flavorful, I had to add two packs of salt and pepper to get any flavor. My mom said hers tasted like a store bought soup.
