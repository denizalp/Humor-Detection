I went here for a nightcap.  I just ordered drinks and no food.  Overall selection was a little disappointing since they were out of many beers.  The excuse was a long weekend and they hadn't restocked yet.  A bar should always be stocked in my opinion, even after a busy weekend.  Staff was fine and food looked okay, but I probably will head elsewhere for drinks next time to take in better selection.
