Great place for a simple and small morning breakfast sandwich. Went here on a Tuesday and there was no line! The sandwich itself is very runny because of the egg, something I did not expect. It can get a little messy so grab some extra napkins! The sandwich comes \"wrapped \" in a little mini brown paper bag which I thought was very clever. There is limited seating but you can easily sit anywhere or just be on the go with your sandwich. Would definitely recommend to try this place.
