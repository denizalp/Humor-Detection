I've made about four visits to Cravings the last couple of times I was in Vegas, lunch and dinner.  Some were planned, some weren't.  All visits were positive.\n\nThe food selection is great.  They have a great salad bar.  They also have a bar with some TVs.  There's a seafood section towards the back and also a noodle section that serves wonton and Pho.\n\nThere is also the meats and pizzas and all the other misc stuff.\n\nIf you have not been there, give Cravings a try.
