I've been going to see Jinia since moving to the East Valley in 2012. I found Flict through Yelp reviews, and I am SO glad I gave them a call. Absolutely the best staff and atmosphere out of any salon I have ever experienced. Everyone knows your name when you walk in the door, and you receive the best service every single visit. I am super picky when it comes to my hair, and it can be very finicky to style (thick, coarse, wavy), but I've never walked out with a cut I didn't LOVE!!!
