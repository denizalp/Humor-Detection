We moved to Phoenix AZ in 2003 and always looked forward to visiting Jack's Deli when we visited. We were there last month and found the food was very bland. The Matzo Balls had 0 taste. I've been eating and making them all my life and they definitely need a new recipe. My husband had a corned beef sandwich and had to ask for more but had to ask for more bread because the slices were so thin. Sadly, we won't return when we visit. I also wish I would have read the prior reviews that they have 10 health code violations. Never again.
