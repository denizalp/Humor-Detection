Sandwiches were decadent and very popular! Come early, by 9:30 am there was a 50 person line. It takes like 30 minutes to get your food. Very annoying to get to the cosmopolitan\/this restaurant unless you're staying there and now the charge parking down at all the hotels and casinos, so be prepared. Maybe uber or use lyft.\n\nSeating is limited so you might want to take it to-go or sit in the areas around the chandelier bar.\n\nThe Gaucho was tri tip beef (mid-rare) with chimichurri, an egg, arugula and red onions. For $15 I was happy. It was on a luxurious brioche roll: it was perfect.\n\nMy husband liked his burger for $10 but was not that impressed with the quality of the burger.\n\nIt's a funny name for a restaurant and when you eat your sandwich, it's quite graphic. The eggs explode while biting into your sandwich which are double-wrapped. Don't wear white. Bring hand wipes. \n\nThe coffee is $5 and is gross. I don't know if it's burnt or what, but it's overpriced and not worth it.
