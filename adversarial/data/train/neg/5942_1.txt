I ordered more stuff on Amazon than I actually needed so I could qualify for same day shipping. I should have received my packages by 8:00pm Thursday. Here it is Sunday afternoon and I still don't have my packages! I needed them for this weekend, so it's too late now. The tracking still says it's on the way, but it's said that same message for three days with no progress. Next time I order something from Amazon and they list OnTrac as the carrier, I'll just cancel my order.
