Such a great studio!! \nI had been following the groupon's around the valley to get my yoga fix. When I arrived at this studio, I knew this is where I would stay. The instructors are so great. Motivating, Friendly and know your name (I love that part)!!  Staff is helpful and friendly and I enjoy the occasional laugh before class. This place is clean, affordable and not to Cutesy. I have brought a few of my friends and we all enjoy this place. Makes me look forward to going to class.
