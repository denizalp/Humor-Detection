Went here for dinner with the family. The hostess sat us down quick and the waitress took our drink orders right away. The menu looked like it had some very good food on it. So why only the 3 stars!? The service just kind of stopped. Maybe a shift change or something? Not sure. I ordered the Skirt steak for $27 dollars and it didn't even come with a side. I asked for medium but got rare. Not that big of a deal but was hoping to share a few bites with the little kiddo. Too rare for that. The skirt was very tasty. Margaritas were also good but $14 good? Not really. My wife and son had the shrimp and scallop plate. I liked the food but when I asked the family what they thought we all agreed. It was good food but a little pricey for what you actually got. I expect the Mandalay to be expensive but in return I expect to be wowed.
