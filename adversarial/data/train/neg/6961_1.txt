We came here on a recommendation of a friend and her family. Watch out here; They charge you for the chips and salsa that are free everywhere else. I had chicken fajitas; chicken was moist and tender but not grilled and had no seasonings. Veggies were tasty. Black beans were so-so. Margarita are not sweet and quite strong. My friend had a Caesar salad, she was not impressed. I didn't remember what our other friend had. After dinner we all agreed that we would not return nor recommend it to others.
