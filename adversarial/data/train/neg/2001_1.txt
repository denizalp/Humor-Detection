The best cheesesteak in town. The red sauce is a nice treat, the prices are affordable, and the menu options all tempting.\n\nThe staff is very friendly, and make you feel at home. I got the regular Philly to test out the place and will be coming back very soon to try the other options. \n\nGood stuff.
