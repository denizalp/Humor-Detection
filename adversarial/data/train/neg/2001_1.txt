This was a great local cafe that serves coffee, tea, cold sandwiches and paninis. I ordered a panini with ham, mustard, rocket, tomatoes, and cheese. It was delicious. In particular, I really enjoyed the thinner bread and mustard. Overall, it was quite tasty.\n\nAnother bonus, my travel partner got the extra smoothie left in the blender.
