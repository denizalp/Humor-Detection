It's pretty tasty Pho. I have eaten here a couple times. The first time the broth had some beef grease which I love, more of a home style pho. The second time the broth was clean, but still both times super hot and flavorful. The only thing I think they need to work on is meat portion, my bowl had a little more of one type of meat than another. I do understand food cost but don't skimp on the certain cut of meat you like. Anyway service is as expected from a Vietnamese mom and pop joint but what can you do? The Pho is tasty and legit here. My only other critique they should use bigger fried egg roll shells, make them bigger and they'll probably sell more egg rolls. Overall decent pho, decent prices and good mom and pop joint. Just bring back the grease. Pho is healthy enough.
