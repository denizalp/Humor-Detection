Hands down my favorite restaurant in Calgary. Great service, great ambiance and great food w excellent plating! Every dish was an art piece. I had their Wild Ramp Mignonette Oysters, Gamay Noir Red Wine and High Country Bison Striploim. The oysters were fresh and juicy, the gamay was medium bodied w an earthy finish and the bison tasted like a leaner file mignon. On top of my meal, I was working on a dead line that evening. The waitress took notice and mentioned for me to stay as late as I needed and insisted that I get whatever I need to get done. I was floored. I tried not to stay too late and left close to 11pm and they were hospitable down to the last minute I was there. Genuine folks that really take care of you without any pretention.
