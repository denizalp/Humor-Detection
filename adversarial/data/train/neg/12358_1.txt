This location is pretty great. I don't come here often as I do not live that close, but I will come here if I am looking for something specific or fancy for dessert. I placed an order for a birthday cake here and the bakery did a great job. The cake looked and taste amazing. The staff was also pretty friendly and quite efficient.\n\nWe tried their pizza special on Tuesday (I think), and it was ok. However, it is a busy place so we had to wait about 30 minutes for the order.\n\nLongo's can be pretty pricey so just be aware of that. All their grocery items are are very fresh and tasty. I enjoy walking around to see what is new and creative. They have a fresh food selection and a hot table if you need a quick dinner or lunch. \n\nI would return to Longo's in the future and look forward to going back soon. In fact I think we might place a 2nd cake order here soon.
