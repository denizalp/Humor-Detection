If you're ever in the SW part of Las Vegas, #TheSparklings on Rainbow is the place to go for your American fusion fare. The crab and spinach dip with fried and grilled pita was scrumptious! The chandelier cocktail w peach and bubblegum vodka and pineapple and cranberry juice is a good one. You get the ambiance and fun vibe of a Strip restaurant without the Strip prices!
