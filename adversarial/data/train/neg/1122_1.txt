Note to Mom:  this is how brussel sprouts are supposed to taste.  They slammed it with their crunch and sauces.  I also ordered the smoked salmon belly nigiri and it melted in my mouth.  So fresh.  Thanks, Megan for helping me with the menu, too.  You're kind.  1 star deduct for location but once here, I like.
