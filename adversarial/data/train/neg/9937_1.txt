Always the best with no regrets.  Their Il Purista sandwich is about as good as it gets.  This time I got warm bread with cool ingredients speaking to the freshness of everything they do.  The deserts were all perfect and I think our group downed six bottles of wine while there.  Great prices on wine in case you have not looked.  We had a 2010 Zepaltas La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Noir, Sonoma Coast that knocked my socks off.  Damn good wine!!!!\n\nThe Linguine with white clam is killer as are anything with their meatballs.  In the deli case is a home made sausage rolled like a spiral that has parsley and cheese that has to be the best stuff on earth.  If you have not tried it just do it with some good bread they sell there and you will be in love!\n\nI've known Tony for a long time now and must say he and his wife are some of the sweetest people.  It is great to see a family owned and operated restaurant do so well and keep\/improve their quality over time.  It's places like this that keep food alive and well in America and keep the massive restaurant corporations away from ever receiving a dime of my money.  \n\nI've been in the back kitchen and the place is spotless.  Everything they do they do well and they are a solid Yelp 5-star joint.  I just wish he would open a Gilbert store in DT Gilbert.  Would be a perfect place for that location!
