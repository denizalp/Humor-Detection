I try to be a fair observer, giving a business the benefit of the doubt. However, this Walmart has time & time again proved to be the worst I've ever frequented. Every visit, I get smacked in the face with the most horrendous stench! I've no idea where it's source is. The aisles tend to be dirty & the frozen foods aisle, forget about it. All the ice cream packaging has a thin layer of frost on them?! Moving on, several occasions I needed to ask more then one associate for help, either because one didn't know english or didn't have enough product knowledge. Even the customers themselves have attitude problems, their all badasses obviously. Lastly, I've never had an \"express\" checkout. Seems a problem always is happening.
