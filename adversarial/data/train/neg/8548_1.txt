Last bar standing!  One of the older bars in Lakewood with the original woodwork and bar.\nTwo sides to this place - so it's fairly large.  Yes, it is kind of divey and dark - but it is a good feel\nall the same.  If they never change anything ( but keep it clean!) it will be an attraction in \na historic way. \n\nEverybody seemed to enjoy their food.  Excellent wings, tater tots, hamburgers cooked to order, specials on the board.   Try the soups.\nGreat happy hour and not too expensive otherwise.  Fairly good taps although some\nwere out.  \n\nWe had good service at the bar and table top.
