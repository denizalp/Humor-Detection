OK So we found our new go to sub sandwich place.  We ordered the ham and cheese with extra turkey with coleslaw and the italian sub.  The bread is amazing and holds up well.  Even the way the sandwich is constructed is smart and really kept the sandwiches from being overly soggy.  I can't wait to try the turkey, dressing, and cranberries.  Also the pickled peppers are freaking amazing.  Makes me want to try it on a cheese steak.  Only reason I didn't give it a five is due to two facts:\n\n1.  Over 2 hours for delivery.  (I can understand due to the fact that they are probably really busy due to the product we got.)\n\n2.  The coleslaw was a little dry and lacked flavor.  (Could have used a little sugar, salt, and pepper.)
