Really good record store. Moved here from Vegas and this place was my first stop- incredible selection. \n\nRecords: Great stuff that you never see at very reasonable market prices. Also, the records are cleaned by a sonic cleaner- I didn't even have to nitty-gritty them once I got home because they were cleaner than they ever will be again lol. \n\nStaff: The store owner is super friendly and very knowledgeable- he did a wonderful job putting together the ideal shop. \n\nExtra's: Sells inner sleeves, outer sleeves, spin clean machines, high to medium end turntables and audio equipment \n\nSelection: Off the chain- tons of great 60's-90's collectible records as well as current in print 180g records at great prices.
