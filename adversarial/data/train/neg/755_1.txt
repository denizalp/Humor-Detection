I went here on a weekend towards there closing time. They had a lot of selections remaining and I couldn't believe how adorably cute everything was. In my opinion, I think the macaroons were a bit too overpriced so I opted for the Earl grey cake which featured raspberry. I was pretty satisfied with the taste which consisted a blend of tea, chocolate and raspberries and texture of the cake and would be curious to try their other selections - just hoping it was slightly more affordable!
