To keep it simple:\n\nPros: great location, diverse menu options and flexible substitutions, fun atmosphere. I would give the menu and food 5 stars. I love the Acai peanut butter bowl and they have quick and easy snack options too. \n\nCons: it is understandably very noisy inside so it's hard to eat inside if you need to have a conversation or phone call and there is no outside seating. (Recently got one table). Additionally, the bowls take a very long time to make. Also understandable due to the process but hard if you are in a rush. Lastly, the staff is not overly friendly in any way.
