Some friends and I dined here for Sunday brunch while visiting Las Vegas in March 2014. \n\nFood was wonderful. I had the chicken enchiladas poblanos which was really, quite good. I would order it again in a heartbeat. We also ordered dessert. The Mexican chocolate cream pie was extremely delicious and very, VERY rich. I ordered the smaller portion and still couldn't finish it. My spouse had the flourless chocolate cake and said it was quite good. I had a small bite of his, but between the two, I prefer the Mexican pie. \n\nAtmosphere and service are nothing exceptional. It's a perfectly ordinary restaurant that happens to put out some exceptionally good Mexican food. They do get bonus points for sustainable sourcing of the meats though. That's something that's important to my family and I was glad to see them take that stance.  I can't say that it's a \"can't miss\" establishment, but if you have the time and are craving Mexican food, this is a great place to try. \n\nI'd recommend brunch, for the added bonus of $10 bottomless mimosas.
