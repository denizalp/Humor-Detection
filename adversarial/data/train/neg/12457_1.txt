The fountains are my favorite free thing in Vegas.  Beautiful choreographed water\/light shows during the day and night!  I've been watching them for more than a decade and always enjoy the new ones.  In fact I'm writing this right now from my room at Bally's which only has a partial view of the fountains, but I still enjoy hearing them go!
