Went to casanova's recently, food was okay but not over-the-top good. What I did find to be very odd was the demeanor of the people that work there. They called everyone mr. Thomas mr. Blake, Mister Jerry, excetera over and over and over again and it just felt weird. It seemed like it was rehearsed and very insincere and did not at all. They need to just be themselves and be nice to people which I'm sure they can do
