So ... My family and I were craving some butter chicken and samosas and we didn't want to go to our usual place up by Britannia and Creditview so, we searched and stumbled across this place.\n\nPRICE\nReasonable and some really good valued lunch deals.  We got butter chicken at 8.99, two orders of veggie samosas 3 for 3.99, chicken briyani 5.99, an order of seasame naan and regular naan, all came out to $26.  Lunch specials are $9.99 includes rice, main and naan.  \n\nSERVICE\nTwo thumbs up.  The cashier was nice, friendly and quick to serve us.  The kitchen chef also came out to the front to give us our order and asked if we needed anything else.  The restaurant was a good size with plenty of seating and booths.\n\nTASTE\nOf the two naans, seasame was my favourite because I love the toasty smell.  The regular naan was also a winner for my family members.  Chicken briyani was delicious with nice big pieces of chicken and the serving size was plentiful.  Butter chicken tasted exactly the way it should, creamy and savoury.   Veggie samosas were good, the wrapper was a less traditional type thinner.  The filling of the samosas was tasty and not as spicy as I usually have them.  Overall, good eats and I would return.
