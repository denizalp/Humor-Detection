I should have written this review years ago, when I first starting shopping for my dogs food here as well as using the self wash.  Kathy and all staff are always so welcoming and helpful, when it comes to food questions or making sure everything is wonderful when using the self wash.  I cannot imagine going any place else.  Thank you
