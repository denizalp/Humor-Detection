I live in Hollywood but I have trained with Jason on a stop to Vegas and what an incredible person to learn from. He shares his knowledge as a fighter in a very passionate way, and I would say that he's as great of a coach and he's as a fighter. I will definitely plan on coming more often to train with him, if I lived locally, his place would have been my daily go to gym. Much recommended.
