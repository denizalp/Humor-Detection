I have been coming here regularly for about a year now, and I still love it. My nails are always lovely and I receive so many compliments on them. That, and anytime I broke or loosened a nail (I'm very hard on my hands) my nail tech has been more than happy to fix it. I always ask for Peter, but on the rare occasion I appear without an appointment (ugh I feel so guilty admitting that) and see a different tech, I still leave pleased. \nThey use quality polishes; especially the gel. My paint job always lasts the full 2 weeks.
