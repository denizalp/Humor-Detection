Spacious, clean and friendly service. Came in to check out some Christmas decorations And they had some nice ones here. They also had wrapping paper and gift bags for a good price. Wouldn't come here for furniture or appliances, it's about the same price if not higher than Walmart or target.\n\nGreat parking, quiet area and good savings on most things!;)
