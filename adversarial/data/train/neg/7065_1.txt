The defining feature of BLD is not just the design, but the attitude and ambience.  When returning to Chandler, I make it a point to stop at BLD as I am guaranteed an enjoyable evening.  The menu has the ideal artisan experience and offsets the pricing.  Best of all, the patio is canine friendly and makes for a wonderful evening.
