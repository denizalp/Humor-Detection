Opulence everywhere! Has a dance floor and djbooth in one section, then across the pool is the bar with card tables. It's surrounded by cabanas and day beds (it's encore beach club during the day time) drinks run at $15.. Shot girls go around with yummy shooters.. Sometimes you just have to tip them well and you can have the whole tray. Guest list is worth it because they waive the cover on non holidays.
