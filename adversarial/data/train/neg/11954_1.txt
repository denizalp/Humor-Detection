Beautiful restaurant and the quality of the food is extremely high. It was not traditional Mexican fare, but Mexican flavours and ingredients heightened. I really enjoyed it and will be back. The only criticism is the price point is still slightly too high for lunch, but they don't pretend to be inexpensive.
