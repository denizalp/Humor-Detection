The food is AMAZING but the reason I am giving 3 stars is because the food takes FOREVER to come.  I ordered at 8pm and did not get my food til 8:45 pm.  Also dont expect to receive your full order.  One of the items I ordered never came, and I heard all the other tables around me question the server about where some of the things they ordered were as well.  Dont know whether or not I should ever return here.
