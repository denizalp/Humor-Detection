I enjoy Courtyard by Marriott hotels.  My room had one of the old drip coffee makers with ceramic mugs!  If only all the Courtyard rooms did that!!  And if the front desk is going to call to see if everything in the room is to my liking, they should get a calmer ring on the phone.  Nobody ever calls me on a landline, and the harsh, urgent ring nearly made me jump out of my skin.  But I always find super-comfortable beds, nice showers, clean bathrooms... and this was no exception.  Oh - get the oatmeal for breakfast!
