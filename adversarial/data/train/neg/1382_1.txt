I went to Laservue to get a second opinion after being told that i am a good candidate at a different place. \nAfter taking the tests with the optometrist I was introduced to Dr. Marc.\nHe told me that since my vision is pretty good all around I should actually wait at least several years with the procedure, to the point where I will feel the need to start wearing reading glasses. \nI really appreciate Dr. Marc for the honesty and professionalism. It is rare that you go into these places and you feel like money is not the top priority. \nKudows Laservue!
