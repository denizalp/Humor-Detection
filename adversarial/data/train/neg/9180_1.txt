This review is purely for the service I received trying to book a group dinner (had to cancel at the last moment). I worked with the manager Bruce and he was so nice, responsive and accommodating. Everyone else I spoke with at the restaurant was also great. I had a horrible experience trying to book another dinner for that same weekend where a restaurant was requiring a sign a contract and put down a deposit for a group of 16 and was pushing me around from person to person. I thought that was ridiculous, but Vegas requires weird things like paying for the first night of your hotel in advance, so I thought maybe this was another Vegas thing. Then I reached out to Wolfgang Puck's and got a completely different experience. The staff here is wonderful!
