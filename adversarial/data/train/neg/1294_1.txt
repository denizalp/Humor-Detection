We visited the restaurant less than a week ago and we're really disappointed. We were seated outside in one of the few locations not under the fans and the service started out okay with Nick but eventually there was none. He visited our table only once without being prompted to fill up only half of our water glasses in the 113Â° weather. We had to keep asking each time after that and then they left the pitcher in the sun so only luke warm water without ice was being poured. \n\nEach of our orders was disappointing,  lacking flavor. Honestly,  other than the Triple T fries and the Vegas fries, the entire meal was a bust. None of us would recommend the restaurant to visitors of Vegas in the future.
