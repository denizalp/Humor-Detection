I tried Thai food here for the first time with my girlfriend and her family and let me say, this place is amazing. The service is great and so is the food. I get Chicken Pad Thai with a level 4 spicy and it's just the perfect balance of noodles and chicken with just that kick of heat to turn up the tastiness!!!!
