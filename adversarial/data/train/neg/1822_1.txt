My coworker told me about this place and how they have great $8 dollar haircuts. I was skeptical since I've had medeocre experiences with this in the past but the service I got here was great!\n\nAbsolutely loving the cut and it was nice and fast. Polite service, and the lady actually got what I wanted. \n\nDoes not come with wash but what can you expect, $8!\n\nWill def come back
