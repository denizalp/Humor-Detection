I wish I would have read the reviews prior to renting a car at the Payless - Phoenix Sky Harbor. I rented an SUV for the weekend and upon arrival the salesman offered me both insurance coverage and prepaid fuel, both of which I declined. They ended up charging me over and additional $80 and said that I requested both services. \n\nI did not request or authorize either service. Whatever they signed on my behalf after I left it an extremely shady business practice, and by reading the other reviews, appears to be a common one by this office.\n\nI would never request additional coverage because it is covered by my credit card that I use. Additionally, when I received the car it was on EMPTY and I had to fill it up immediately after leaving the airport, so this is proof I did not request the fuel or they would have filled it up.\n\nUpon disputing the charges they agreed to refund the insurance coverage, but are refusing to refund the fuel that wasn't even in the tank. I would NEVER recommend using Payless, and I will not be using them ever again.
