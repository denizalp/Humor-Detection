So I do give good reviews and find I am lenient but maybe not so much here. They hit my soft spot. I came there to get my headlights restored. I asked about the process and Tony told me they did seal it up with a sealer afterwards. So the job took a while and it looked fantastic BUT. He said the reason they don't use a sealer is because it is pointless with the hot sun. He told me to bring it back in, in a few months and they could polish it up again meaning dropping another 20 dollars on the job. I could do the job myself but for 20 dollars, it is worth someone else doing it because that is how much it costs in getting the supplies myself. The reason they sell a NON-yellowing clear coat is for the fact that I would not have to bring it back in. I hate how these shop guys think we are not educated. I am a mechanic and play dumb sometimes just to hear what these guys say. Plus, there is youtube. Save yourself time on doing headlights yourself.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UEJbKLZ7RmM
