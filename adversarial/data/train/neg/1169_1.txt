After living in Arizona for close to five years, I finally made my way to the AZ Science Center. A friend was visiting from out of town and had to decide between here and the DBG. \n\nOnce we found our way to DTPHX, we got a parking spot and headed in. I guess they're doing construction or something because there's a temporary entrance, but it wasn't difficult to find. We paid our way and cruised around the current exhibit which is called \"Races\". While there were quite a few families there, I wouldn't say it's solely for children. My friend and I had a pretty good time and there are a lot of interesting exhibits and demonstrations. We spent probably a good two hours there, and we didn't visit the IMAX or planetarium (which is an extra cost). \n\nI'm not sure if I would come back, not because it was bad, but I'm sure things don't change too drastically. But it is a fun place to get out of the sun for an afternoon if you've never been.
