Busy enough there's nearly always a full house, but open enough to squeeze you and a friend in with 30 min notice, this place is my new go-to for nails! While they don't offer you a drink and they have a policy that requires cash tips, the nail techs are perfectionists and the prices are very reasonable. I'll definitely be back!
