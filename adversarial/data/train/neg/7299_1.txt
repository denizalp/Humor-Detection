This is my 3rd JC Photo in 2 years. My reason for changing locations you ask? I'm a stalker! Lauren is the photographer\/managers name and making sure SHE takes my sons photos is my game! I had a bad experience with a photographer who didn't have much experience with kids and Lauren did her best to salvage my experience last year and I knew she was the one. We booked our next 2 appointments with her for Christmas photos and my sons birthdays photos and everything has been great since! I recommend using a groupon to find yourself a great deal. \n\nTo further explain why I drove from the Southwest to the Galleria for photos (in case I wasn't clear enough).........LAUREN!! This location also had a staff that was extremely friendly friendly compared to the other two locations as well!
