I had the pleasure of having my nails done by Kristy today.  I have tried numerous salons in Sauga and wasn't happy with any of them until now! \n\nAllure will be my new go-to spot.  They are so clean and tidy.  Doesn't look cluttered and all the colour choices are hung in the waiting area and really organized by colour palette.  \nThis is the first place I've been to where I felt welcome.  I was greeted by Kristy when I came in.    I'm so used to nail salon techs talking to each other in their own language and I've always found that rude.  Not here! The other two girls were making conversation with their clients while we all watched Kim's Convenience and laughed.  It was like being with your girlfriends.\n\nKristy did a great job on my nails.  She asked for my approval along the way, did quality checks and even took time to make sure my nails were evenly filed.  She offered me my file and buffer as they don't reuse those items.  Tools came right out of the sanitized kit.  I was really impressed with this place.\n\nI don't think walk ins are allowed as it states you should make an appointment.  This also made my appointment relaxing.\n\nI will definitely be a regular.  Thanks Kristy!
