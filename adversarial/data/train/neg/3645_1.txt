Great casino with an indoor Gondola ride which tries to mimic the ones in Venice.  Honestly, the ride here is probably better than in Venice since the water doesn't smell like sewage as it does in Venice. lol.  \n\nGreat shopping (Grand Canal Shops) which connects you to the Palazzo.  My favorite things to do here includes visiting:\n- Royce Chocolate - a Japanese chocolate shop with the best chocolates ever.  Ask for a sample if you do pass by and you'll see what I mean\n- Visiting Bouchon Bakery - located down the escalator by the self parking and by the Theatre.  Great place to get some macarons, coffee and some french pastries.  \n\nA lot of other things to do here as well and it has become one of the casinos\/hotels I visit most often on the strip, mainly because of Bouchon being at the Venetian.
