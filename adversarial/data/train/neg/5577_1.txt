I bought a hoover carpet shampooer and after using it 4 times it failed to pick up water. I tried to call but was transferred from one auto machine to another. After 1 hour I was connected to a person. I took my machine in and was called to pick it up. The first time I used it the machine still failed to pick up water and I noticed a piece had been broken off so I took it back in. After a week I got a call from the 1-888 number and they said that they couldn't find the broken piece that was cracked off. I told the exactly were it was. I still didn't hear from them so I called and asked where my machine was located. I was told that they didn't get the information on the location of the crack and that they would give the information to the technician and that they would call me. As of this date I still don't have my machine.
