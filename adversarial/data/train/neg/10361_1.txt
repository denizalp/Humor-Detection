We were visiting Toronto from New York and my sister and her family decided to treat us for brunch.  It was during the summerlicious week.  We had a big table, probably 9 altogether.  We were a little late and when we stepped in, we weren't greeted by the hostess.  Instead she looked rather concerned and asked us right away, \"How many more kids are coming?\".  I thought that was quite odd, we only had two kids (ages 5 and 7) with us and the reservation would have that information.  We then sat down, waited for 10 min and no one handed us kids' menus.  So then I realized perhaps the purpose of the hostess' question was not to see how many kids' menus she needed to get, but to gauge whether our table was going to destroy the restaurants' ambience.  \nWe visit Toronto a lot and we frequently go to the bar on the ground floor at the Four Seasons with our kids (even after dinner in the evenings because they have great desserts) and never have we felt unwelcome by the host or wait staff.  \nThe food was very mediocre.  I don't know if it has to do with summerlicious.  The flatbread was stale and not crispy - the ones we usually buy from Pusateri's were way better.\nIf it wasn't my sister's idea, we would have gone to a much better place.  There are so many great choices in Toronto for Sunday brunch.  I would not go to the restaurant again.
