When we go to a Korean restaurant we only get Kalbi ribs and tofu soup. This place in my opinion have the best kalbi and tofu soup. We got the LA Kalbi and the spicy tofu seafood  soup (hot). Their Kalbi was on a sweet side, my daughter loved it (I did too) and even told the lady that its  \"AWESOME!\" The tofu soup was delicious. It was perfect amount of tofu and spice; it had shrimps and real crab. Lastly, I checked in and they give you shaved ice for free. (Red bean or fruits). Thanks! By the way they're not stingy with their banchan like other Korean places. Oh the ladies that served us were super nice.
