There are definitely some things I really like about this place. I've only tried the bottom level, Emporio, but am looking forward to trying the other levels as well. Emporio's thing is meatballs. All kinds of meatballs. All kinds of ways. This is a really cool concept; however, I could see how this could get old and the menu could feel a bit limited.\n\nThe ambience is cool, with plenty of rustic elements to make it feel contemporary, yet warm and welcoming. I haven't been for dinner yet, but there are always plenty of tables at lunchtime, with or without a reservation.\n\nThere are a variety of meatball options (pork, turkey, vegetarian, beef), and there is always a special as well. You can get your meatballs saucy-style over pasta or quinoa, or another base of your choice, or you can get them in a soup (I would recommend the wedding), on a slider, in a grinder, etc. There are lots of sauce options so you can really mix things up if you like. My favorite sauces are the tzatziki, Sunday gravy, and the government cheese.  \n\nOne of my favorite things on the menu is the mac and cheese. I get it with the government cheese, but i'm sure the creamy parmesan option is delicious as well. It's really delicious, and the perfect accompaniment to the port meatball with tzatziki sauce. Yum!! The fries are really good as well, and are plenty big enough to share.\n\nAll in all, this is a great place to go for lunch before a Buccos game or a concert. Easy to get in and out, and plenty casual.
