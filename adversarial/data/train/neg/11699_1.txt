This place is the best at what it sets out to do. I love everything from the eclectic decor of the restaurant to the displays for social activism and environmental responsibility everywhere you turn. The Red Herring is truly a wonderful addition to the Champaign-Urbana community. \n\nThe entrance is a little bit hard to find. Just look for the vertical sign that says \"OPEN\" (it would be covered with a tarp if they're closed) and go down the stairs. Once you walk in, you can order first at the counter and then pick a seat. When your order is ready, the waiter will come out and call your name, and when they see you, they'll bring it right over.  All the staff are incredibly passionate about what they do and it really shows when they interact with you!\n\nThe food, especially on cultural nights, is delicious! Cultural nights feature \"Platters\" which are generally between $9-11 with all the appetizers and entrees. There is a separate dessert menu. I am always excited to eat here (pretty much every Wednesday night) because I know I'll most likely be trying something new, but I'm still confident it'll taste great. Are there some misses? Sure.  But the overall creativity and cohesion of each meal is a party for my tastebuds. I would caution that this is a place for adventurous eaters or those who are enthusiastic about vegetarian\/vegan food! If you need your meat fix, look elsewhere!\n\nPROTIP: Always get dessert! Even if it's to go, because there is so much effort that goes into putting together gluten free or dairy free recipes that you can taste the difference. Their cake is always spot on!\n\nI have yet to stop by for lunch, but their breakfast is just meh. The only savory options they had were toast, and while it tasted very good, I feel like I could have made it at home. \n\nConclusion: Come here for dinner! This is a great place to try vegan if you've never eaten it before.
