I'm really happy with the apartment and amenities. Greg, Leslie, and management have been very responsive, helpful, and friendly from the beginning, and the other building staff are great. The location is convenient to much of Pittsburgh and there are places to eat and shop within walking distance, as is Shadyside. It's adjacent to Mellon Park as well.
