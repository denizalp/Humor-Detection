This is my favorite place to go for all of my nail needs. Mani, pedi, acrylics etc.. Everyone here is friendly, and they make you feel welcome and comfortable. Kiki is absolutely fantastic. She listens to what you want, and ALWAYS delivers your vision. She has an amazing free hand, I ask her to create a new design each time.
