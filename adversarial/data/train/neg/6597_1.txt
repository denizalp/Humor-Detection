I am in love with my gel mani! Donny did a wonderful job! I've lived in Vegas for almost two years and I've been unable to find a decent and CLEAN place to get a manicure. I'd completely given up on getting gel polish... But on a whim decided to give SweetNails a chance! \n\nI waited a couple days to give a review because I wanted to see how the gel Polish would hold up. Day 5 and they look like I just stepped out of the salon! No cracks, no chips and still shiny! \n\nEveryone was very friendly and the shop is nice and bright. $40 for a gel manicure. I'm from the Bay Area and things like manicures are generally more expensive in Vegas... But I'd gladly pay $40 for the excellent service and attention to detail. Bonus points for the location!! Right near home and next door to my favorite threading studio!
