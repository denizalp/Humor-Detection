We had the burger and a couple of  pizza's and they were both very good, the only little thing\nI had a problem with was the fact that the runner brought out the food to both guys first, and then a very short time later the women got their food.\n\nEvery place I have gone to eat, the women get served first, don't know what happened in this case
