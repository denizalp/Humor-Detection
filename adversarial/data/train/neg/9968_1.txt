really nice space. a little too dark but i guess that bodes well for people looking to hook up because after a few drinks everyone starts to look good in this place. my friend and i made this our first stop to begin our adventure for the night. drinks were pricey but i always expect that at most places. didn't have to wait very long for drinks. i loved that the ladies room had \"sexy bitch\" on the door. an obvious photo op. the music started out great when we walked in and then started getting a bit too house for us. so that was our cue to leave. i'd come back.
