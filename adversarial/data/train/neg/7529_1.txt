this is by far my favorite sushi place here in the valley! i would usually come here after work and the staff is so friendly and attentive. the service is quick and the sushi wins me over every time. highly recommend the chef specialty rolls, especially the orgasm roll! dont pass up this small sushi joint, one visit is all it took for me to be hungry for more!
