Not a bad place to grab a beer and when they have live music it's guaranteed to be good. When it gets really busy though, it's like sitting in a hot-boxed car, the amount of smoke in unreal. I would highly recommend that the owner get a new or additional smoke eater. I would recommend this place to people who wouldn't mind getting lung cancer or emphysema.
