I wish they had a Sushi Samba where I live! My husband and I were visiting Las Vegas, and came across this amazing place. The waiter was so friendly and helpful in showing us the ropes of the menu +  gave us recommendations. Well he did a great job of that, because our food was succulent, flavorful and just a amazing! lol...Seriously I will go back for more when I'm back in the area. It's the best sushi + calamari I've had. Well worth it!
