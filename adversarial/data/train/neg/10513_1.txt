Right on right on.  Soul food that's not your mother's, but darn near close.  Fried swai nicely done with a side of mac and cheese. Quite delicious and filling for myself. Also got the cornbread and will not get that again.  My sis got BBQ... the brisket (beef) and the 1\/2 chicken with collards.  She loved it all.  I tasted the greens and pretty darn good.\nOwners moved restaurant from Queen Creek. \nParking in back, comfortable seating inside.  Tables outside for when the sizzle ends.  Hey what more can you ask for. \nYum
