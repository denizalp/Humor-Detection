Brilliant! \n\nWent on a Friday night for a casual pint with a friend and zero expectations...  walked away with a new favorite T.O. bar!  The staff were AMAZING - sat at the bar and watched the detail that went into making every drink (seriously!!). Lots of good looking people, friendly atmosphere and killer tunes!  A must if ur in the east end... but get there early if you want a seat.
