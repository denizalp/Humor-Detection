Quick Rundown: \n\nI love the Venetian and The Palazzo! They fall into my top 5 picks for my favorite resorts in Las Vegas. I always recommend one or the other when people ask where they should stay during their visits to Las Vegas. My parents also insist on staying here when they come to visit and love taking the gondola ride down the indoor river (a must do for tourists). \n\nThere are endless restaurants and shopping located within the resort to please everyone. In fact, you could come here and stay and never have to leave the resort.The rooms are huge and every last one is a suite that includes a living space with a sofa to sprawl out on. They have been recently renovated and I have nothing but praises for the resort. The hospitality from the front desk, bellman, and housekeeping staff have all been excellent during our extended stays and short 'pop-by'  visits. I've also attended a handful of conferences here at the Sands Expo Center that have all been seamless.
