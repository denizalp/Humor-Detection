If you go to Tott's enough times the GM will eventually know you by name. He's always there and lives on a cot located in the back room.\n\nIf you bring a date he'll know her by her name too and he'll have no qualms flirting with her. \n\nStill, shouldn't every Mom n' Pop restaurant in your neighborhood be like that? \n\nTott's has more ambiance than your average Mom n' Pop place. I kind of see it as a small corporate place that just isn't named Pei Wei. After all, the restaurant is connected to Starbucks. \n\nRemember, this isn't a Chinese restaurant. It tries to cover the Asian gamut by offering some choices of Thai and Japanese food. You won't find sushi here, but you can get a big bowl of udon and there are a variety of thai curry sauces to choose from. \n\nI usually get take out from here but it's got an elegant little dining area and the outside patios with its metal tables really are quite nice when the weather allows. The dark wood tables and non-traditional flooring makes you feel like you're eating in a place fancier than you really are. \n\nTott's has raised its prices more than once over the last few years though. Pei Wei moving into the same parking lot didn't help matters. \n\nAlso, the workers who you see on the same regular basis are not nearly as friendly as the GM is. It's not that they're nasty, but you don't have to ask me my name on a take out order if I just paid with a credit card (with my name on it) or if I've been there (and seen you) multiple times that month. \n\nPeople I've taken there like his personal, friendly approach and enjoy the food. Tott's serves some non-traditional dishes though and it's not for everyone. \n\nTwins Pork has jalepenos and bacon. The Lo Mein has somewhat of a smoky flavor to it that I think blows YC's out of the water. Also, some of these dishes are spicier than people are used to at a Chinese restaurant. Other dishes are very thick and syrupy over meat (stir fried crispy beef). \n\nThere are a number of items I really enjoy on the menu. I notice that portions differ though. My black plastic box on take out never seems to be all the way stuffed and lunch specials are made to be bigger than they are by giving you half a plate of rice. \n\nWhen prices go up and I feel I'm getting lesser portions I have an issue. \n\nI've also never heard of paying extra for friend rice with a lunch special until I started eating here. The brown rice, which is free, is good though. \n\nI don't eat here as often as I used to. It's tough to pay nearly $9 without a drink and not be completely filled up on a take out order. \n\nI find that some of the thai dishes tend to be very saucy and are more of a value. \n\nI give it 3.5 stars. A few years back I would have said 4.5, but it's just become less of a bang for your buck and in these recessionary times, that matters.
