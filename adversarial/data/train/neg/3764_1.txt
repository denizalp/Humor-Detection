Avoid Omar. I went to this dealer, couldn't get anything done but it was 5-stars and the sales associate was awesome, the sales manager Chris Hess, was very professional. One month later, I called because I was in better shape, the associate, Omar, was rude. He told me they get busy and that I need to he ready to do a deal. He told me not to go anywhere else. As if they were entitled to my hard earned money! They lost my business when Omar spoke with his false sense of entitlement. Chris Hess, you need to reiterate how to talk to customers in a polite manner. You can be direct and pleasant at the same time!
