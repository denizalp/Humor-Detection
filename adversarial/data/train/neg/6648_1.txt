I ate lunch at the cafe, toured the Clayton mansion, viewed art at the art museum, and toured the greenhouse. At the cafe, the staff was surprised that I did not have a reservation, although you do not need one, especially when the restaurant is empty of other customers. The website describes the cafe as \"one of Pittsburgh's most acclaimed restaurants, which offers culinary masterpieces\". I disagree. The cafe is just a little soup and salad place. The food was good but nothing special. General admission for the mansion tour was $12. My husband and I had a docent all to ourselves. She was knowledgeable about the architecture and art in the house. She encouraged us to ask questions, and she answered all of them. I enjoyed seeing how a rich family lived decades ago. I did not have a docent for the art museum so got in for free. I viewed a few rooms of many early Renaissance and eighteenth-century French paintings. The greenhouse plants not as pretty as I had hoped. It is definitely not a miniature Phipps Conservatory. I did not stop in the car and carriage museum or buy anything at the store.
