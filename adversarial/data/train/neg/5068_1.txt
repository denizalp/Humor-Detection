Here for the Montreal race.  Really nice place on a Thursday night.  Had the salmon and liked it.  Others has the filet and it was very good.  Cheese bread was hot and tasty.  Good service.  Very much an American style steak house.  Service was good and friendly.  Looking for a good steak house in the French dominated city try this place.
