Rooms are clean and well renovated. The hotel itself is very charming. They have a section near he lobby that's set up with all kinds of funky sectionals that you can totally cuddle up on for a relaxing moment or little snack. The kids club is ok - it's quite small and the girls that are in charge don't interact very much with the kids. \n\nThe food is good. The breakfast buffet was good a decently priced at $19.95. I did not try out the regular menu so I'm not sure. \n\nUpon checking in they gave my kids a little gift bag that included a water bottle, a manoir mug and hot chocolate mix which my kids enjoyed. \n\nThe gym is pretty well stocked, though it is small I'm. It sure if it was full how having a proper work out would be. \n\nI plan on coming back with bathing suits next time so I can check out the indoor and outdoor pools.
