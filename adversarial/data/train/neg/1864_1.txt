so this is the third time i've been here, but each time it's been a different bar! there is no longer a pool (thank goodness), but instead a giant dog friendly open air patio! love that. we only had a few beers here on a pub crawl, but it seemed like a friendly place...lots of good looking people. \n\nwe'll be back with our pooch next time.
