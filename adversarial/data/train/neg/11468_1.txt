I Googled \"24 hour coffee places\" and this was one of 3 that came up for the entire valley. It was basically on my commute in so it worked for me. I pulled up to the place and it was well lit and inviting. I walk in and there are 2 employees inside who greeted me. I went to the counter to order my coffee and the lady was very nice. She asked what my name was and I gave it to her. She introduced herself as Amanda and asked if I had ever been there. I said it was my first time and they both thanked me for coming to check them out. I let them know that I probably would only be in about once a month because thats how often my job requires me to work in the middle of the night.\n\n They said they had only been open 24 hours for about a week. I guess its lucky since I was desperate for my fix. My coffee was ready and they hooked me up with a cookie for ciming in to check them out so I thought that was pretty cool. The coffee was pretty good and Im wide awake now as I write this review! All in all it was great personable service (which unfortunately is somewhat rare these days) so I would recommend this place for all your caffeine and baked treat needs! \n\nOh also they didnt have stir sticks. They had regular tea spoons to stir my coffee as they were trying to be as green as they could so I respected that. \n\nGive UB a chance!
