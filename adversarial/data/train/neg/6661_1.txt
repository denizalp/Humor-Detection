While on a road trip to Sedona it was past dinner time and we were getting hungry, so I checked Yelp to find a place to eat that wasn't your typical fast food choices. Wongs had 4 stars and enough reviews that I decided to give it a try. When we pulled up in front my first impression was that it doesn't look like much from the outside. When we entered I was quite surprised to find how large it was inside. Very traditional Chinese style decor with even 2 levels of dining.  The restaurant was dated, but clean (including the bathrooms) Our server was very friendly and brought hot tea and water.  I ordered the Chicken with Broccoli in brown sauce. It was good, but not great.  We also ordered the Vegetable Fried Rice which was also good. My husband enjoyed the Kung Pao Chicken.  If you are a big eater, you will love the large portions. There was enough leftover food for 2 more meals. Would I go out of my way to eat here? Probably not, but for me, much better than a fast food chain. Very standard Chinese food.
