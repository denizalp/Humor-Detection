Nice room nice staff.  Security guard with tactical vest was unnerving and they made us drink on the lobby instead of on patio.  Other than that fine.  Nothing around but I'd you have car stuff is close enough to not be a problem.  Has to go back and forth to trac a bunch of times and passed enough stores and restaurants
