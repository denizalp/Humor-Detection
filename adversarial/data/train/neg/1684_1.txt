The atmosphere is fun and laid back, but the food was definitely lacking. We ordered the beignets, which included a chocolate sauce that tasted like Hershey's syrup.  The eggs Benedict was horrible- the poached eggs sat on thick, really soggy biscuits. I couldn't even eat them, which is a very rare occurrence.
