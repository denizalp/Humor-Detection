The lunch special is a great deal that gives soup, sandwich\/pizza and dessert. The service is spotty, with a long wait for the starters and we were given teaspoons with which to eat the soup. The tomato soup was hearty and delicious, with garlic croutons. My main course was the prosciutto flatbread with figs and cheese, which was delicious. The dough was fresh and had a great consistency. The seared tuna with salad was tasty and had a perfect sear. Dessert was a choice between bread pudding and ice cream. That also took forever to arrive, so we asked for the bread puddings to go. The waiter neglected to let us know that there was an ice cream accompaniment and we were forced to eat that before leaving. If the restaurant fixes the service issues, the experience would be a lot better.
