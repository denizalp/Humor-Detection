Came here because we were at San Tan mall and wanted Mexican food. Didn't realize it was going to be this fancy, high end place tiller walked in. the service was great and the free chips and salsa were good and they kept them coming. drinks were filled. the food though... definitely not authentic and their ceviche I was soooooo super sad after I tried it. they jazzed it up with things that shouldn't be in ceviche like capers and olives and it wasn't in a tomato juice broth and it was so sour and pickled that I couldn't finish the seafood in the dish to atleast get my money's worth. my mom got their fish tacos and those were pretty good. overall it's ok but I wouldn't come back.
