Perfect meal and flawless service! Excellent job Nolen Kitchen, we will be back.  Tonight we ate at Nolen Kitchen and were thoroughly impressed.  The service was spot on; polite, efficient, and extremely attentive.  Our food was perfect.  I ordered the sea scallops with risotto.  The scallops were cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth good, and a good size.  Risotto was also fantastic.  My husband ordered the braised short ribs, another win.  My son wanted the kids pizza with mushrooms and not a crumb was left.  We took everyone's recommendation and started with the zucchini chips. Yep they're right, a must order!  Chips were crisp, well seasoned, and accompanied by a great dipping sauce.  All in all a wonderful Friday night out dinner.  Definitely recommend!
