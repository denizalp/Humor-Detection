A party for our fearless leader... put on... by herself. In any other situation that might seem lame but, as usual, this was yet another fantastic event at Pinky's! Great job Nikki and happy burstday!\n\nSo reasons why this event was killer- As Maricel wrote, very seldom do I see events up on this side of town with all the cool things to do in uptown and further south of the city, and as such, I had to make it a priority to simply drive around the corner. \n\nI was previously aware that Pinky's was a great burger joint so getting the opportunity to try the delectable eats and cocktails (and fo free!) was always good too. But I have to say, the best part of the event was getting to celebrate with, and give back to, our fantastic elite leader. Simply showing up was the very least we could do for her, given all she's done for us and the Yelp community.\n\nThe food, cocktails, and service here are definitely a good reason to come back. The burger sliders were fave but the finger food items (i.e. fried pickles!) were also great. Although there was also beer provided by Sierra Nevada, the cocktails provided by Pinky's with Sailor Jerry rum (big fan) were fantastic. The service was absolutely impeccable. Even though there was a good amount of Yelpers, it seemed like the staff was well on top of their game. \n\nProps to Poprock for some great pics on the event, the staff at Pinky's, and again, the greatest 1 yr old I know- Nikki.
