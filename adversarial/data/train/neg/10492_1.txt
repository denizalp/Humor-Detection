I was there buying a shoe for my wife and a young blonde girl named Veronica helped me. She was the sweetest thing she was very kind and gave me a lot of advice on what to buy and that is great since I really don't have any experience buying woman shoes. Workers like Veronica are a god send for a store like that so helpful and patient with customers like me that no nothing about those shoes but want to get perfect shoes for their lady.
