Fancy and comfortable atmosphere, cute environment. \n\nHad spaghetti, pesto pizza, strawberry ice cream waffle, and the rose lycee drink. \nVery small portions considering the mid-high prices. Two of us spent 50 dollars without feeling very satisfied. Very over-priced. Taste was so-so, my friend and I was not very impressed. Presentation of the dishes are your typical instagram pictures.  They told us the dining time is max 90 minutes, however the food come out very slow. \n\nCute waitstaff with maid aprons. Pink princess-y interior. Very girly and feminine place.  \n\nThey open at 5pm.. wish they could open for lunch \/ afternoon tea times as well.
