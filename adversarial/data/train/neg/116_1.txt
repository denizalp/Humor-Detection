I could see how this would be a culture shock for people who aren't from Asian extraction or those who haven't been to Asia. Anyway, this place is awesome, stink and all. Every Asian food product I could possibly want I could find at Super L from dragon fruit to Pocky. I really wish Phoenix had a legitimate Chinatown, but the Chinese Cultural Center will have to do.\n\nAnother two major pluses about this place: the bakery and the boba cafe. Once I moved from LA I thought I'd have to scour high and low to find boba or an Asian-styled bakery. The chiffon cake as well as the bean buns are worth the trip to this place alone.
