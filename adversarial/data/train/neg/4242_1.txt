To me there is nothing less professional or rude that a company can do that is worse than returning a call. This is becoming more and more common in this industry. Real estate agents fail at an astounding rate. Maybe they should be taught to return calls along with the rules of real estate in that particular state. Wouldn't do business with these folks if they were the last on earth.
