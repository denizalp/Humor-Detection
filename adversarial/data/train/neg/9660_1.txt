Fantastic.   Flavored iced teas are great.  4 cheese sandwiches  and one beef 'Sicilian\".  All excellent.   We all took home half a sandwich --so they are big servings.  The sweet potato frys are to die for.   Service was excellent and they sent each of us home with an Iced tea.  Definately a repeat.
