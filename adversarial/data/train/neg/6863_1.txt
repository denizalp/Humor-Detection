First time at Ru San's and the sushi\/sashimi was amazing. They provided a cucumber appetizer upon seating which was a great surprise. I ordered three pieces of yellow tail, two smoked salmon and one piece of scallop sashimi along with their kiss of fire roll. The kiss of fire is mix is tuna and salmon with avocado, topped with sriracha sauce.  Their wait staff are very friendly and welcoming.  I'd give this place ten stars if I could!
