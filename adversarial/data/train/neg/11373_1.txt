Came in for dinner and ordered the cheese fries for the appetizer. I always ask for them layered so that you get a lot of cheese and bacon throughout the dish. These used to be a lot bigger than they are now, but for the two of us, the portion was fair. We both ordered the outback special 6oz with baked potatoes and salads. The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned great. The baked potato was loaded up with everything and they definitely weren't skimpy with the toppings! The service could have been a bit better, especially since it wasn't that busy of a night.
