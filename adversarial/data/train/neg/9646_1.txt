Not good. We went here a few years ago and remembered it being pretty good so we decided to one back only to be severely disappointed. We ordered their loaded tots and they were okay at first and then as we dug further into the pile they were absolutely smothered in cheese wiz and I couldn't eat it and trust me I LOVE cheese. Next came the cheesesteak sandwich and it was way over-cooked and dry. The au jus it came with had no flavor almost as if it had been watered down. I might as well have dipped it in dishwater. Service was pretty decent, but a good waitress can't fix bad ingredients ingredients and bad recipes. We probably won't ever be back.
