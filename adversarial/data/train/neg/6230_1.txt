The management team is responsive and helpful.  The pool is not finished, but by appearances, it is a matter of days, not weeks until it is open (their plan is before 4 July).  This is not a 5 star property yet, only because it is not fully done, but I have no doubt that it will be the best apartment complex in the Strip.\n\nThe management team got a grassy area on the non construction side installed for the dogs and the clubroom now has a nice coffee station, a computer\/printer, a pool table, a conference room, and light snacks.
