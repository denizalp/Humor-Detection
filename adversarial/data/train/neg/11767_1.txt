I've seen this place before and thought I'd give them a try. Wrong move. After waiting 15 past my appointment time and listening to one of the stylists yapping and yapping about nonsense I just walked out.  I thought to myself I'd rather leave then have to sit and listen to this lady talk about her husband anymore.
