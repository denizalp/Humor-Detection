I'm assuming their pastries are fine. They actually look amazing. However, their breakfast panini was disgusting. For a pastry shop I'd expect something other than Wonder Bread, American cheese (when they have smoked Gouda on the menu), MICROWAVED eggs, and precooked, soggy, paper-thin, microwaved bacon. \n\nThere is no excuse for using frozen egg patties in a high-end bakery that features breakfast sandwiches. The public expects a certain level of quality if you charge $5 for a sandwich and McD's actually now cooks their eggs fresh. \n\nI wouldn't have even posted this, but when I called to ask if the eggs and bacon were microwaved, they saw nothing wrong with that and defended it. I'll give 2-stars only because I have a business and if our business fell short, and the customer reached out and we made it right then that should warrant changing the rating. They did not do that.
