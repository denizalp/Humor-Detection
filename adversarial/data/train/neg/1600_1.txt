Ate lunch and loved it.  I had the Mac n cheese bacon burger and fries.  The fries are delicious, all cut differently and that made it fun! Seasoning salt was awesome. The burger was so good! No wait and staff was super friendly. I highly recommend it. The table next to me had the ribs and they looked amazing!
