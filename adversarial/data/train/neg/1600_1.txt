Worst. Chinese. Ever.\nThe service was friendly and fast, however the meal was awful.  We ordered the Beef Rice Noodles and after the first bite, it was obvious it had been cooked in old recycled oil and possibly in a wok with burnt residue.  The old dirty oil taste was so overwhelming, it took over the entire dish and we couldn't taste the dish itself.  We had two bites and left to eat elsewhere.
