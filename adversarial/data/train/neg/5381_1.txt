In town for work and after reading the reviews decided to give Thai House a try. Glad I did! I had the shrimp pad Thai and it was so good! The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the pad Thai has so much flavor. Anytime I eat Thai I have to get a Thai Iced Tea...and I was not disappointed. The tea was probably the best I have ever had. The restaurant itself was kind of dark, but the decor was nice. Service was fast and friendly. Food came out HOT and fast! If I am in the area again I will absolutely go back. Well priced.
