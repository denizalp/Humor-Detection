Amy! Amy! Amy! She is just the best piercer there is. She is beyond amazing. She was my piercer in San Diego and unfortunately for me she moved to Vegas a while back. So while on vacation we decided to get pierced and of course we went straight to Amy. I got a facial dermal and my boyfriend got two conch piercings. She was just the best. The shop is great too as are the tattoo artists. The guys at the shop are funny, super nice and very welcoming. If you are in Vegas go to Johnny Laws on Fremont. You will absolutely not be disappointed!
