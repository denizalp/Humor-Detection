We thought this was a very fun way to get an introduction to Red Rock Canyon and get ideas for future ventures, and we were right!  The reservation process was very easy and smooth - I called because of a question and got immediate attention.  Driving around in the scooters was really fun - I can see why people buy the big 3 wheel motorcycles now.  It took awhile to get to the park and we made several stops and will be going back for some hiking.  Shawn was our guide and he was great - very personable and professional, and always making sure we were all doing okay.  I would definitely recommend this tour!
