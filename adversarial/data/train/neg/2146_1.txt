Ate lunch at Beach Cafe yesterday. I had the Beach Club sandwich, which was the best I have had in my life! Could only eat 1\/2 as it is pretty big. One thing I liked about it was that it was grilled on sourdough bread on the flat top instead of toasting the bread. It was cut in half instead of the silly 4 triangles. My wife had the San Francisco burger which she liked but thought it was a little greasy. It is a burger on grilled sourdough w\/ avacodo, bacon, and swiss cheese. The homemade chili was very good also. The staff was very friendly, the decor has a casual Hawaii theme. The prices are good and the place is clean. I am going to try breakfast there this weekend.
