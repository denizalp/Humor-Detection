Have had the Bulwarks service for 6 years and it has been nothing but wonderful. We have not seen any bugs in our house and I was worried when we moved in since all our neighbors were having trouble.\n\nThe last service call we had was performed by Benjamin Sykora and he was pleasant, thorough, and respectful.
