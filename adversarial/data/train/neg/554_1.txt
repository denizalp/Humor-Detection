Do NOT do business with this company!  You can never get in contact with people who leave voice mails, they sent the incorrect supplies, I'm trying to return the incorrect things they sent, and have had to deal with incompetence at every turn!  This, and EVERY time I call, they \"remind\" me that I have a small outstanding balance. Yes, I do, and I have told them every time that once they bill my insurance, then and only then they can send me a bill and I'll pay it.  There is no way in hell that I am going to give these idiots my credit card or bank information!! Run away fast from using this company!
