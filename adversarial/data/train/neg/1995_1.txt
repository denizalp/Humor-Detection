We were going out with friends and wanted to try a local restaurant that none of us had been to before. Il Chianti fit the bill.\nAmbiance: the restaurant is one of several eateries small nondescript strip mall just off the 515 freeway. The restaurant is fairly small and only minimally decorated. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights they have a piano player \/singer. When we first got there, the restaurant was pretty packed. The combination of a crowded restaurant with a piano player \/ singer made it pretty noisy when we first got in. As the night went on the noise level went down and it was actually fairly enjoyable.\nService: almost immediately after the hostess seated us, our server, Rose, was at our table to get our drink order. She was also very helpful in making menu choices. She was very friendly and welcoming. I especially like it when the owner or the chef work the room to make sure things are going well. Rudy, the owner and Chef, was in the dining room multiple times during the night talking to the guests and getting feedback. Overall, five star service.\nFood: photographs of the adobo mushrooms made it appear incredibly appetizing. We ordered them as a share item for the table. It did not disappoint!! An outstanding dish. For a main course I ordered the chicken Angelo. It is a huge portion of food with a couple of pounded chicken breasts, artichoke hearts, other veggies , in a light creamy sauce. Delicious. My wife had the chicken Vesuvio. Also a huge portion and quite delicious. You can bring your own wine for a corkage fee of $20.\nValue: excellent service, huge portions of very tasty food , an owner \/ chef who circulates throughout the restaurant during the dinner, live entertainment, all for about $25 a head. Now that's real value in a local restaurant. I will certainly return.
