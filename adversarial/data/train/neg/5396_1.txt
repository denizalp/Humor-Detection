Dude seriously? I came here for a detail and my seats looked fantastic. They were like new. (My car is pretty much brand new .. Daughter made a mess :\/) HOWEVER... My console and dash were virtually untouched, as were the sides of my doors, my rear view mirror has spots all over it like it was sprayed and not wiped, as do my side mirrors. I complained about the lack of quality work and someone \"touched it up\" but it still looks crappy and I'm NOT HAPPY. I'll just go back to Craig road car wash. Cheaper and waaaay better
