Great Place, Dr Kohler is the best!  He is extremely knowledgeable and explains options to you, as well as, tells you what he is doing as he is working on you.  In addition, he has a very light touch, which I think is extremely important with a dentist!  His dental assisstants, Rey and Callan are also wonderful.  This dental office is a winner!!!
