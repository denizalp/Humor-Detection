I am only rating the fantastic happy hour because that is all I had.  Delicious blueberry lemon drops for only $6.00!  We tried the inexpensive calamari and beef carpaccio, both delicious and heavy portions!  Both under $7.00!  Fantastic happy hour.  My only gripe is the atmosphere.  Inside, it's very dark for happy hour.  Outside, your noisy view is of University Ave.
