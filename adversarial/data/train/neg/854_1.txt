They have really good sandwiches and offer chips, apple or bread as a side.  I love their paninis too.  This was my first time at this location. I told my parents how good they were and took them there while they were in town.  But unfortunately they messed up all of our orders and we all got a sandwich other than what we ordered.  It was frustrating but we didn't say anything because we were hungry and didn't want to wait any longer. I hope the next experience will be a better one.
