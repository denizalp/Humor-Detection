Listen. I'm a baker, worked in 2 different bakeries and I know my ish. I've actually lost interest in eating cakes because they were making me fat and Caketini pulled me back into the rodeo for good. This place was the bomb, I was skeptical because of the many dry cakes I had been eating since coming to AZ, but this place turned me around. I had the vanilla confetti cake and am now obsessed, I kinda wish I wasn't though so I could lose a little weight...DANG these cupcakes was right and tight!!
