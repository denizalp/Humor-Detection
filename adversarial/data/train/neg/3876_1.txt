Had a groupon for this place so the Mrs. and I ventured here after church today. I was impressed overall. Clean inside and looked new despite being around for a few years. Staff was friendly and helpful. I got a the 6 wing combo. They had no issues with getting multiple sauces which is a rarity in this day and age. My wife ordered the 2 wing with salad combo. They have a salad bar which we thought to be an original concept for a joint like this. \n\nThe food is good. I got the Garlic Parmesan wings which is a sort of dry rub. Usually not a huge fan of the dry wings but there were definitely a cut above the rest and I would gladly order again. Ordered Hot wings also which were typical. Wing sizes are large in comparison to a Buffalo Wild Wings. I'd say prices are competitive with other wings joints if not better given the size of the bird. Fries are of the shoestring variety and were excellent. Fountain drinks were easily accessible to patrons and the much-coveted Mr. Pibb was available. Punch cards are given which ensures future visits for this duo. \n\nOverall a great place and some of the better wings in Las Vegas that I've had. Will have to do the AYCE soon.
