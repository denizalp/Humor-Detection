I've been to AK twice now and due to brittle nails, i opted to try the SNS Powder Dip.  While I'm still not completely sold on the process, my nails look amazing.  They are strong and last much longer than a regular manicure.  Marie is an amazing tech and helped with the color selection.  Ask for Marie as she very detail oriented and took the time to make sure that my nails were perfect.  Also, the salon is very friendly and makes it a very pleasurable experience.
