Fugo has so many different Asian inspired flavors and my favorite one would have to be the HK Milk tea. All of them are really good, but the reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is that sometimes they're sold out of certain flavors and it's a win or lose situation if you're planning on going to try one specific flavor. But everything else is great! Friendly and helpful service , good ice cream,  and the store is super cute. Keep in mind that the store does only have around 10 seats , so if you plan on staying there, be prepared to stand during busy hours :)
