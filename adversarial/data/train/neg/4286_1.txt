Totally great! I made my own grain bowl using quinoa, kimchee, grated carrot, grated squash, tofu and avocado, topped with carrot miso dressing.  It was super good, and with a juice\/smoothie, could be split between two people for a decent sized lunch.  I recently tried the Goods on Dundas, and I didn't like it nearly as much as Bolt.  Will totally hit this up the next time I need a clean and tasty lunch!
