Update as of 4\/8\/18\n\nSadly this location continues to suffer. Drinks are not up to standard and bartenders are more interested in talking to each other about how hungover they are than interacting with customers. It feels a little like Vanderpump Rules without the cameras to justify why this is going on. Absence of management in any capacity at the downtown location. Continues to be a disappointment. \n\n------\n\n\nBarrio downtown USED TO BE good. It kind of hurts my heart to write this because we were regulars-but no longer. \n\nWe came in again after moving downtown hoping things had changed but the service was terrible besides the red head at the bar and the bar itself was dirty. Honestly the whole place feels dirty now. It also took a much longer time to get food and check than previously. We miss the old crew. This used to run smoother.\n\nWe used to love this place so much. So disappointed in what It has become, clearly neglected by management. Hope they are reading this. Please revitalize downtown Barrio!
