The other reviews have this place more or less pegged right; the food is not bad, but it's mostly fried, specials are a bit too expensive, it's perhaps as much western as it is Japanese, and the service is disinterested at best. \n\nOur food was nothing to complain about, really. You could do worse on any given evening (it's probably a much better night-stop?) But we came out both realizing we had our fill of fried food and that we couldn't think of anything on the menu that we would want to make a return trip for.
