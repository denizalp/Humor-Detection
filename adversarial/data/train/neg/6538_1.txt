Was completely hyped with my new gym until alittle air was let out of my bubble today! \nI attempted to tan to be denied access due to it's 1 1\/2 hours shy of 24 hrs of my last tanning.\n\nSo that means I would have to come  use facilities the same time everyday or later not everyone can do that !! \n\nDaily tanning should be aloud no matter of time of day.\n\nChecked into today and brought guest seeing I'm BLK card member now being told that my guest can't use the tanning and can only use the facility one time in the black car membership extended facilities.
