SHAUNZ! that's what I like to yell at the top of the lungs every time I enter the miracle mile. \n\nShaunz is the bleeding edge of fashion. Everyone knows that wide flare denim jeans require the widest of collars. You'll be very pleased that Shaunz certainly does not skimp on collar width! The shirt patterns are crazy and fun! THERE IS EVEN A BUTTON DOWN WITH THE ENTIRE LAS VEGAS STRIP SKYLINE ON IT! How Vegas is that? Looks excellent worn over an AFFLICTION or Ed Hardy tee! I honestly couldn't keep the ladies off of me at the day club...so I  even wore my shirt in the pool! (would recommend wearing shirt in pool to reduce UV exposure). My only regret that there isn't a Shaunz closer to me. I would probably try to move into a loft directly above it so I could rock a new SHAUNZ fit everyday!
