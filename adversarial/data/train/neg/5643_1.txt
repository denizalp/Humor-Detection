Was suppose to go to Fiamma for Restaurant Week on Saturday but they didn't start theirs till Sunday. So we ended up going to Crush instead. \n\nWasn't sure what to expect but we ordered everything on the menu and it was great. I got the Arugula Salad (I don't like those veggies so it was okay) and the NY Strip Steak. I like how they sliced the steak into thin pieces, that was great!\n\nBf ordered the scallop crudo (amazing and the sauce poured on the Arugula Salad made it taste even better!) and the Grilled Salmon. At first I was like meh, grilled salmon, nothing interesting. Little did I know that it was filled with explosive tastes! I  mean wayYYYY better than Cheesecake Factory's Miso Salmon (and its the only salmon I ever eat). Sad part was that it wasn't enough, need more please!! Just add some rice or have option for rice and it would've been a full meal! \n\nLast was the Nutella Squeeze. Oh em gee, nom nom nom!! I would definitely go check this place out if you're interested!
