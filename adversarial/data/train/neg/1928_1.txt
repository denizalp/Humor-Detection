I've been here a handful of times with my friends and often are able to snag a seat. If you call ahead, you're often able to make a reservation which is what we usually do after dinner as we've found it to get pretty busy in the evening. It's quite spacious inside and it's a dimly lit cafe that can get loud as it fills up. \n\nI've never gotten takeout, only ever sat down, and you receive complementary popcorn as you're waiting for your drinks. I've had the salt and pepper chicken which is quite nice (deep fried chicken bites)! In terms of bubble tea drinks, I've always gotten ones with grass jelly as I looove it! It seems to me that they sort of give you half the can as the chunks are quite large. I've tried the aiyu jelly as well, but none of the servers could really explain in English what it tasted like and was offered a sample of it before ordering. (It's kind of sweet and semi-firm!) \n\nOverall, it's a great place to hang and enjoy time with friends. We often bring board games with us to pass the time, they don't mind!
