I was looking for a sushi place on the strip and ended here based on the reviews on yelp.\n\nService: Pretty normal. Nothing really worth noting.\n\nFood: Yellowtail tacos were amazing! Sashimi quality and sushi rolls were good\/sorta expected. Also got the pork belly ramen, but wasn't as good as I imagined. The ramen was good but didn't care for anything else in it. The broth was a little spicy as well. \n\nPrice: I think the bill was $110 for 2? It's not the cheapest place but most sushi\/Japanese places are similar in pricing and on top of it, it's on the strip. So that's not too surprising. \n\nOverall: I think the tacos and salmon sashimi really did it for me. Everything else was ok. Now I'm thinking is 4 stars too much...I'd say 3.5 stars if I could.
