I really enjoy the space, good amount of seating, cool art pieces on the wall, has an industrial\/urban feel to it. \n\nI was really excited to order the mama grubbys from reading a lot of the reviews. But the bagel came out really small. It didn't have the perfect round bagel form, it was deformed n misshaped. It didn't even cover most of the egg\/avocado\/cheese\/tomato that was in between it. Was hard to eat since the ingredients kept falling out. The avocado was fresh though.
