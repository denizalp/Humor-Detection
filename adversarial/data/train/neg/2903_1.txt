This young brewery is off to a decent start, and I look forward to seeing it grow more!\n\nThe current tap selection is decent, but nothing outstanding. Out of the starting lineup, I enjoyed the IPA most. I would love to see them try out more small batches and develop their beers further, especially to compete in the hefty craft scene in Charlotte.\n\nThe venue itself is nice, with both inside and patio seating (and parking!). I wish it were closer to the main Noda drag, but it's worth driving a bit further to visit this place. I will definitely continue to support it and its all-women set up! You go girls.
