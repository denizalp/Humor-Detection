I've always had a good meal here. I'm not sure what there is to gripe about. I think as a Yelper it's important to focus on the food and overall niche that a restaurant serves to it's community.  If you're looking for a red sauce kind of Italian restaurant (lasagna, meatballs, spaghetti) this is not the place for you.  As a matter of fact, not ALL Italian food consist of red sauce dishes.  My suggestion is to attend La Piccola for lunch as there are a plethora of excellent sandwiches.  While you're doing so, sneek a peek at what a potential dinner might look like.  Take some time and speak with the owner, you'll find he's an educated man and takes great pride in his restaurant and  fresh food.
