I went with a big group from my company while we were here for a meeting. I was not super excited about the show but I wasn't paying...so I went along with it. \n\nThe size of the venue and style of show demands audience interaction. Our show was about half full and on a weds night so let's just say that the actors didn't get all the woo-ing they wanted especially early on.\n\nThe show has a lot of 80s style comedic relief, including plenty of stripper-style dancing. There was lots of ass-slapping and actors faces shoved in each other's privates during dance numbers. I found it to be pretty racy and normally would have been fine with it...but having been with coworkers that night it left me a little uncomfortable. \n\nSome of the storyline, writing, and jokes  were pretty bad IMO. In the second act, it got so bad I just started laughing when it got ridiculous. Alcohol is a near requirement to make it through. \n\nDespite all that, I thought everyone in the show was great. Lots of energy and great singing, especially the lead male. But everyone could sing and dance very well. I could have done without the interpretive dance in one number, that was weird. \n\nThe intermission was 7 minutes exactly, timed, which unfortunately did not leave enough time for us to wait in line at the bar and make it back to our seats on time. \n\nI was disappointed that some of the songs they just played a snippet or intro. When Final Countdown started playing I was so excited, but they only played the first few bars of the song. \n\nI think there are a lot better shows in Vegas to see, but this one is okay especially if you get your tickets for cheap. \n\nOh and don't forget to pick up your free \"lighter\" when you walk in the show!
