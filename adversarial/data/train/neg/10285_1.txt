My favorite falafel in Madison! I also love the hummus, and well, everything I've had there. Unlike most reviewers I've never been for breakfast, but it's one of my go-to lunch places - enough so that the owner recognizes me and my falafel-addicted friends. Friendly, warm service, great food, beautiful patio, yes please.
