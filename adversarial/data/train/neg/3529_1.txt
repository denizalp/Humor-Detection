The lunch specials are awesome at this place! The lunch salads are amazing and filling, yet they are perfect complements to half a sandwich or slice of pizza. The environment is friendly and welcoming. The owner, Stacy, is ever present and a delightful hostess. \nI have dined here at least 2 years, so it's time for a review. I will come back again and again.
