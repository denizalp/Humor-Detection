You never have to wait in this place which is kind of a shame. They have a great air-conditioned waiting room. Beautiful. Clean. Inspiring, Every time I leave Las Vegas Collision, I feel compelled to go home and clean my room. They have fresh coffees, teas, cold water bottles, candy bars, big screen TV, comfy couches.  I went in the yard today to look at my bumper (truck tire blew and attacked by under carriage at high speed) and it's obvious that management made a decision to keep appearances up through out the premises. Very organized. Even the guys who work there looked fresh; hair combed, clean clothes, like they can just go out after work without changing.  Point is, Las Vegas Collision lets the Customer know that they care from the get-go. For those who feel uncomfortable about bringing a car in and getting a quote, relax. The quotes are fair. First one you meet is a pretty lady at the counter, who my wife says always looks perfect, no matter what time of day it is.  Next you meet Patrick who will come out to check the damage. If there's no parts involved, he'll give you a fast quote. Again, he's fair and easy going. No pressure. Something very honorable about Patrick, and I think he's a big part of why people come back. There's no delay in fixing your car. They get right to work. As you may have gathered, I've been there several times. Besides my bumper on my Van (officially not a collision), my wife insists on perfecting the art of having an accident with my Honda. Every time she gets in the car, I now honestly think, well, thank goodness for Las Vegas Collision--there when I need them. They do beautiful work. Twice, the whole front end was taken out on the new Honda Civic. Same exact accident; popped air bags, the works. Still, when Patrick and the crew were done, both times the car looked and drove like new.
