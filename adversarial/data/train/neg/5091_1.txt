Had an excellent time at BeerBistro.   I don't love beer, but loved Close By since it was below freezing and super windy.   Gave the place a whirl and loved it.  \n\nSat at the bar, and it was lively, open airy, and fun.   If I were in a talking mood, I could have met new friends.   Greg behind the bar welcomed me with a hand shake and a smile, and asked me where I hailed from, how I was enjoying my visit, and gave me some great reco's.   \n\nLoved 2 Belgian beers that were unreal, both on tap.   The burger was just one of a ton of delicious options.   After starting with a cute beautiful house salad, which was awesome, the burger was a perfect finish. Bison on a great non-overbearing roll.  \n\nExcellent place.  Have already forwarded to my dad for him to visit on his next trip to TO.
