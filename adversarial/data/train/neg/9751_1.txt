Great ordering system, great atmosphere. Great excuse to eat tater tots as an adult. \n\nI love the variety and amount of topping options here, and the sauce selection is superior to any other place I've visited. \n\nEvery time I come to the Cleveland area to visit family I make it a point to come out and eat. Purely awesome. Can't wait to try a vegan dog.
