So happy our search for good Indian in Vegas is over! The whole family loved it. We ordered mango lassis, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, a shrimp curry, and both garlic & plain naan. The chef\/owner also gave us a complimentary bread pudding. Everything was absolutely delicious, but the garlic naan was possibly the best I've ever had. We've already recommended Paradise to several friends and are looking forward to many more visits.\n\n*Just noticed that the info section says 'not good for kids.' Not sure why...we took our 11, 10, and 6 yo with us and they all loved it. They do eat Thai, Sushi, & Indian pretty regularly, however. Anyway, I'd consider this a family friendly, casual place.
