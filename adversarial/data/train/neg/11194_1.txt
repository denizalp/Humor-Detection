I have to say that I was really interested to dine here. I'd heard about the outpost in NYC and since I was in Vegas and heard that there was a location there now, I wanted to try. And the experience...it kinda lived up to the hype.\nThe food - it was very tasty. The sushi that I had...and I had quite a bit...was fresh and good. And they offered a couple of different sushi options that I hadnt seen at other sushi restaurants. The menu was quite interesting. If you dont know about the concept, its japanese and south american & latin american fusion. And I think it pairs together very well. For the quality...I thought the prices were set accordingly.\nThe ambiance - very hip...very cool. The vibe of the place is incredible and you just get that feel that youre in a chic and sexy place. The music, the decor, the servers...its all there. The bar area in the front is very accommodating and there are large tables and booths set up for large groups as well.\nSo why only three stars...? The service. Now I know you cant always judge a place completely on one visit, but the service was very suspect here. Now, I should have known better than to expect great service from a bar seat for dinner...however, it was a slow night there, so I thought it would be decent at least...and it was just barely that. Slow...slow...slow. And my bartender\/server just seemed not aware of everything that was going on. Bringing me incorrect sushi order at first, then a incorrect drink order, then completely mischarging the order of the gentleman next to me. And when all this was happening, the managers just seemed to be too concerned about a large birthday party of ladies than what was going on with the gentleman order and bill or my incorrect orders. I think this place probably still does very well cause its a cool spot with a great location inside the Palazzo...but service is very important. I will go back again and hope that my service experience will be different next time.
