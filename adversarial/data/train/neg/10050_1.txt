We have been going to this Mod Pizza for several months. I can't say enough good things about it. Always friendly (which is nice) but the true star is the pizza. It is always superb and delicious and looks awesome when you open the box! I love that you can put whatever you want on the pizza without any up charges - extra pepperoni?  Gorgonzola cheese? Sun dried tomatoes? Asparagus? Peppers? Etc, etc, etc? Yes, yes, yes and no - no extra charge! Even my super picky mother-in-law LOVES this pizza, enough said!
