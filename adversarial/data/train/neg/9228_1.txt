I love the wine bar concept.  They have a really nice selection and a knowledgable and friendly wait staff.  A great place to go on your own and sit at the bar to have a glass or two and try out couple of tapas from their nice selection.  There isn't much around the neighborhood, so if it's too busy and can't get in you'll have to settle for much less. If I lived nearby, it would definitely become a local hangout, especially after a long day at work.
