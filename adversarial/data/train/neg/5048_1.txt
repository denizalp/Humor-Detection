Was in the area when I saw it and remembered I bookmarked it ages ago to try. Tried the shawarma on a salad and like other reviewers mentioned, it was a little pricy for a salad but delicious, meat was not dry and large portions.  Hubs and I shared it as an afternoon snack.  It was really busy for middle of the afternoon - after lunch and before dinner.  Steady line of people were ordering burgers.  Have to come back and try the Burger before we can give it a 5.
