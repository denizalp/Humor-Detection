This was our second time to come purchase their popcorn.  Our first time we had no issues, but this second visit made me not want to do business with them ever again.  It started off with us asking for samples.. the lady in the back gave the lady in the front the wrong samples twice and were corrected.  We asked for two different flavors in small size.   We didn't realize till we got home that they made a mistake on one of our flavors so I called them.  Instead of being nice, the lady says well we are not suppose to take food back but I will exchange it this one time in a snooty way.  \n\nSo I get there to do the exchange and then was accused of having opened the bag and was complaining about the size she would have to replace with the right flavor.  Im sorry but you don't blame your customers for your mistakes.  You should be checking the orders you receive from the back to make sure your getting the right bag of popcorn before placing it in the customers bag.  We are trusting that you know what your doing.   The lady at the front register needs to learn better customer service.
