I can't wait to come back ! I have told everyone about this place for brunch. The food was phenomenal. The plates were small so we could have a little taste of everything. Then there were around 7 different mimosas ! All of them tasted like champagne to me haha but they were very pretty and our waitress kept them coming. There was one that was infused with jalape√±o and I didn't really like it but some people are into that. The menu offers organic items and gluten free which I loved since I try to stick to a healthier diet while binge drinking in Vegas haha. Love this place, had a lot of fun outside on the patio. The small plates brunch costs around 35$ then the mimosas were unlimited for 10$ ! Can't beat that.
