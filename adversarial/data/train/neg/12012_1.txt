A\/C stopped working on a Sunday. System is about 7 years old, so I was dreading what the problem could be , hoping I didn't need a new unit. Did a little research and some testing, but there was no way I could fix whatever was wrong with it. Turned to Yelp, saw the great reviews for Duke, so decided to give them a call. They answered the phone and had a technician out to my home within an hour!! I talked with the tech, gave him an overview of the problem, and he went to work. I was hoping it was just the capacitor, the cheapest part I would need to replace. Well, it ended up being my fan motor had seized up and was shot. He explained the problem which jived with what I had observed, and gave me a quote BEFORE he started doing any actual repairs. While it was more expensive than the capacitor, he did not try and sell me a new unit or upsell me on any maintenance package or anything like that. I gave him the OK, and he got the job done in about an hour, and had the motor on his truck. A\/C now working fine and the fan motor I got is a much better quality than the stock one it replaced. He even told me I should not have to replace the fan motor again for the lifetime of the system. Prompt service, even on a Sunday, knowledgeable and friendly technician, and honest pricing. Could not ask for more.
