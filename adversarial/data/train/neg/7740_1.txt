After living in Tempe for 2 years, I'm very grateful to be now living within 10 minutes of this Whole Foods. If I had to rank all WF in the valley, this wouldn't be at the tippy top, but it's a huge improvement from the Tempe store which would certainly be at the bottom. Way more local produce, much larger salad bar and prepared foods section, and more events.\n\nPeople don't call it Whole Paycheck for nothing, but it's worth it to come mid-week when I couldn't make it to the farmers market and see some solid local options. I'm giddy when they have a huge selection from Sunizona Farms. Since it's also 10 minutes from Arcadia, I am one happy local girl.
