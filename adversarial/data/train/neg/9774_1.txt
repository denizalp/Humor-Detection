As far as on campus grub goes this place is top class. The Boston Dog is a classic here; in my opinion it's their best menu item. The reason I'm so high on this place is that for an on campus establishment it's actually reasonably priced paired with quality food. They are definitely known for their hot dogs but they do have other items (the sliders are good) and are now serving breakfast (haven't tried it yet). If you're ever on campus and looking for a spot to eat, I would recommend Dave's anytime.
