Woohoo as good as it gets is right! I have heard nothing but good things about Apteka and the rumors are true, if you haven't been, hit that bookmark button right now!\n\nApteka has endless options, all vegan and some gluten free. I had the pierogi's, something I haven't had since I switched to a completely plant based diet over 2 years ago, and they were mouth watering. \n\nThe staff was also incredibly helpful, and patient while I narrowed down my decision(s). They were excited that I was excited, and it could not have made for a better experience.
