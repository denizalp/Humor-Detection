Went and saw Rock of Ages on Christmas Eve with my parents and Aunt. I loved the show since I grew up in the 80's. I was worried that my family might not like it but they also enjoyed the show. I would of given it 5 stars but there were points in the production were the music was a little loud and it drowned out the voices of the singers. I would see this again in a heartbeat.\nThis is a great fun time but I do not recommend it for anyone under 16 or so. There was a lot of sexual content.
