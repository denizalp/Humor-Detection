My family of five & I frequent Red Robin at least twice a month.  We had been in Flagstaff for a few days & saw their new commercial for their new items.  The don't have any locations in Flagstaff so when we returned home we went to the Superstition Springs location for dinner.  It was a Tuesday night after 7:30 PM so we figured we would have pretty good service.  \n\nThe Manager seated us quickly.  Our waiter came & didn't introduce himself.  I hate that. Luckily the manager told us his name.  \"J\" took   our drink order.  When he came back we had some questions.  We were wondering if the $4.79 salad price was discounted with an entree item?  \"J\" informed us that we could order a salad as a side & it would be smaller or the bottomless fries would come with our burgers as a side.  Everyone ordered their usual.  I decided to try the new \"Mt. Olympus Burger\" with the garlic mayo on the side.  \"J\" seemed to only have two other tables he was tending to.  \"J\" forgot my son's pickles on the side, we had to remind him a couple of times for extra napkins and we had to \"flag him down\" a few times to fill our iced teas (my husband had a cold).  \n\nMy husband noticed that they had started to rescue the miners in Chile on one of the t.v.s near the other side of the restaurant.  We were the only people on our side of the place, I asked \"J\" if he could turn the channel so that we could see the news.  \"J\" seemed confused but went to ask the bartender.  \"J\" said that the bartender told him that it wasn't the news but they had just cut in to the soccer game.  (They were both wrong)  We had been straining to watch it the entire time we had been there and it was on half screen since it was LIVE HISTORICAL BREAKING NEWS.  My children had wanted to watch the rescue as well because we had been explaining it to them.  My young son asked why we didn't get to watch what we had asked for?  My husbad told him that the waiter was confussed way back when he started taking our order & we would have to wait until we got home to see it.  I had tried to flag down the manager but he was BUSY.  We noticed how the bartender & the manager stood watching the channel we wanted on the 3 t.v.s by the front\/bar.\n\nWe finally had a visit from the waiter for more tea & ordered more chocolate milk for our children.   He offered us some dessert and realized that he hadn't yet offered us some more steak fries.  So we accepted the offer for more fries.  The waiter FAILED to mention that everyone's refills were free except my oldest son's.  Two chocolate milks for him were almost $6!!  (I am pretty sure I could get a gallon @ Walmart for less than that).  When I noticed that on the bill I ordered a cup for him and one for me for the rest of my iced tea.  \n\n\"J\" came back and said that they had to put in a fresh order of fries for us.  Perhaps he was wishing we wish decline the order.  We had ordered a box for my daughter's leftovers when we ordered the cups.  The box came and no cups.  We reminded \"J\" again.   By the time the fries showed up everyone was done \"nursing their hamburgers\" and my son was falling asleep.  We finally got our cups so we packed up our cold burger and our new fries and headed home.\n\nFood was good but service was sadly lacking. Perhaps we will make the extra drive to the Tempe location next time.\n:-(
