We have been here twice now and love everything about it! The owner is very passionate and involved in his restaurant. He was serving customers, busing tables, and even sat down to have a conversation with us. The brick oven pizza is excellent! We also had the fried ravioli, which was a special of the night and the house made red sauce that came with it was the real deal. Beautiful property.. Would definitely recommend this place.
