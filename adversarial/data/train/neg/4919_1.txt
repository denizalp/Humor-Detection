I come here probably every week, and it is in the \"top 5\" restaurants of mine. I always sit at the bar and see Tony, who is incredibly nice and knows mine and my boyfriends drink by heart (in other words the service is amazing). The canestri Alla vodka pasta is my all time favourite here. As a salon manager with a large clientele base, I always recommend them to come here!
