Went there for lunch. Clean and comfortable.  Food is very good and prices are reasonable.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I would have liked potato and\/or macaroni salad offered as a side (I'm from Hawaii and the Korean restaurants there have it...goes really great with the Korean BBQ flavors). I was a little disappointed that Chop Chae\/Jap Chae wasn't an option as a side also. And it would also be nice if they offered 4 sides with each meal (again, my criticisms are only because I'm used to the Korean restaurants in Hawaii). But overall I really enjoyed my meal. I will be definitely be back!
