We have used Las Vegas collision center for professional business and recently needed to use them for a personal matter.  They are fabulous!  Not only was the car fixed in a timely manner they kept us updated on the status continuously.  When we picked up the car they explained all the work that was done and the car looked brand new!  Thank you so much!
