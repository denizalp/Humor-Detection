I would've given 1 star but we were recently reimbursed after all of the trouble.\n\nMy wife had leased a corolla through this dealership, and when the lease came up she needed to buy out her car. The salesman was great, very nice. We were then taken to Ryan McNeil, one of the financial managers who walked us through everything. At the time, we were told that the tags and registration would be taken care of with all the signing paperwork for the car. This was back in The end of October. Come December and we hadn't received anything in the mail. Now Ryan gave us his personal cell number to contact him if we needed anything. Not a reply from him at all. My wife's registration expired at the new year and so after complaining to Lena the customer relations manager things finally started rolling. However, instead of actually taking care of it we were just sent a check to do it ourselves. So we went and it cost more than we were given so we asked to be reimbursed. Come to find out that it's normal for lease buy outs that the owner is in charge of the tags. We would've been completely fine with that if we were told that FROM THE BEGINNING. Ryan didn't bother to explain that, or to respond at all to us. Very unprofessional.
