I came into Anna's shop for a quick bite as the first place I stopped in Cleveland. I was happy to see that a place so close to my hotel had a natural juice selection. When I walked in, Anna was incredibly nice and helpful with the menu and juice options. I tried the kale, ginger & grape juice and it was fantastic! A lot of the juice options sounded great so I'll definitely be going back there again! I also got the egg salad & bacon wrap, which was also very good. I would definitely recommend for a downtown Cleveland lunch.
