The food is amazing!  I ordered the brisket which melted in my mouth. This is literally the best BBQ I have ever tasted. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is due to the wait and lack of seating. This is the problem with being so good. So go early or eat a late lunch and you will be ok. If you go right at 12:00 though you will have a problem if time is of the essence. The owner himself served us and is really friendly. I hope they will move to a larger location soon as clearly they have the best BBQ in town.
