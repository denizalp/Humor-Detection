Giving them 5 stars because they really don't deserve the low rating of a 3 average that they have right now. The atmosphere and service is LEAGUES above shitty \"Chat Time\", and their selection is amazing. They even offer free popcorn once you sit down. Finally a bubble tea shop that is reminiscent of the classic ones from Richmond Hill.
