First things first- This place is AMAZING! Their juices are so fresh and vibrant I love them all! I couldn't decide what I wanted when I first got there, but thanks to the helpful and very knowledgeable staff I got to try a little bit of everything. I think the Bee Cosmopolitan (the light pink) was my favorite. It reminds me of pink lemonade, very nice and refreshing especially on a hot day. Another one that I got to try was the Bee Grateful (the orange drink), and the combination of flavors just blew my mind. The carrot flavor was really subtle but was perfectly complemented by the pineapple and ginger, and I felt like I could totally take over the world after drinking that. It wasn't too heavy or lacking anything at all. I am most definitely impressed and will tell everyone about it. \n\nP.s the Acai Bowl is the bomb!
