Went in there today for the first AND last time. I decided to eat in, not take out. They were not busy with other customers, I was the only person there. They were cooking take out orders. During my entire visit they did not engage me in any conversation. The cook walked in front of me at least 5 times, did not acknowledge me at any time. The counter girl did not say anything to me outside of taking my order. When I left, they both completely ignored me even though I was the only one there and saw me get up, walk to the door and walk out. I will not patronize any business that does not even understand common courtesy or make any effort to be appreciative or decent.  South Euclid Location.
