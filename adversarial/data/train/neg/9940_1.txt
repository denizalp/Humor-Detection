if you're looking for a really nice restaurant with amazing quality food, this is the place to go. it's pricey, but more than worth it. my boyfriend took me over the weekend and we dressed up real nice and went and I did not feel overdressed at all. the lighting is dim which makes it a cozy environment in my opinion. it felt really high class. the staff was really nice, the valet guy held the door open for us when we came in and back out. our waitress was nice and I noticed that all the waiters and waitresses tell you all about the meat they serve and give you really good info which was nice. we both got filet mignon and we both agreed that it was by far the best we've ever had. it was \"melt-in-your-mouth\" steak. it doesn't come with sauce- but trust me. it doesn't need it. we also got sour cream mashed potatoes to share and they were absolutely delicious. they were smooth and creamy and had the right amount of flavor. you have to order your dessert in advance because they bake it fresh. we got the molten chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream and it came to us hot and fresh and it was to die for. if you have the money and you want to treat yourself and whoever else, please go for it. this place was the nicest I've ever been to.
