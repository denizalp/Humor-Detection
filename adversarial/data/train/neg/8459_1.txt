The Phoenix franchise of Window World has to be one of the few old-fashioned companies left who truly believe in customer service.\n\nWe had seven windows installed in August, and even though the installation itself went smoothly and the windows looked great, my new inside-mount blinds would not fit.  I live in an older brick house that had casement windows and a sloped outside window sill, as well as tile on the inside of the windows that was pretty fragile.  After writing a rather terse letter to the company, the installation manager called and arranged a meeting.  Not only did he show up, but the salesman, the installation supervisor who was on-site, and the owner of the company came as well.   They all brainstormed and came up with a solution to my problem.    Shortly thereafter, the installation crew was back again, removing and reinstalling the windows.  They did so without breaking any of the plaster, brick, or tile.   \n\nIn this age where it seems you have to fight for everything, this turned out to be a pleasant surprise.   I will call them again when I am ready to order the other windows for my house, and will certainly recommend them to others.\n\nKudos, Window World!
