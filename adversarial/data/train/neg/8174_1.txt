I have high expectations of fish and chips and am normally disappointed, but not this time! I had the haddock and chips and my partner got the 2 and 1 of pickerel. Both of us were impressed by the quantity and quality of both the fish and chips. \n\nThe customer service was also excellent and although we ordered for take out I would consider eating in next time. We'll definitely be back.
