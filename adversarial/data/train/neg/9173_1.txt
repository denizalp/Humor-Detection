Just don't do it... its not worth the wait or the calories. Their crepe isn't even thin like european crepes. They have terrible service and they could care less. I got the  tomato&basil crepe; their cheese & tomatoes were so bad I couldn't even eat more than couple bites. Just save yourself time and try one of many other amazing spots in vegas!
