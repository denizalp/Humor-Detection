I went and ate at guys tonight, and I was so let down. I absolutely love guy, and watch all of his shows on food network, so of course I was so excited to go there. We had a 20 minute wait, and it sucks because there really was no place to sit while waiting, and if you've been walking all day, that is so annoying. Finally we are seated and we sat there for about 10 minutes before a waitress even came over and talked to us. We ordered two pops and the bbq wings, and the bacon mac and cheese burger. It took about 20 minutes before we got our food. My burger was very plain. It needed some salt or something added to it. It was just very bland. Even with bacon and mac and cheese the flavor was NOT there. Also the mac seemed very dry like it had been made hours before. Then I tried tearing some chicken off the wings with a fork and it was really hard to do. The meat was very dry and not fall off the bone at all. The bbq sauce was good but the chicken was not good. Also both our pop glasses were sticky. So sticky they left a stickiness on our hands. It was the same on the new cups we got on our refills. It disgusted me because it makes me think they are not cleaning their glasses correctly. And at $4 for one pop and $20 bucks for a bland burger I was terribly disappointed. To be completely honest, I have had better wings from pizza hut.
