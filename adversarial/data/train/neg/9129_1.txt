Favorite Sunday brunch place in Pittsburgh for Vegans and Vegetarians. Love the vegan buffet and I could eat just that, but then you also get a great entree to choose from too. Try the green beans, sesame noodles, and the vegan deserts. \n\n The only drawback is that sometimes the entree portions are too big. Don't take people take people who don't appreciate a diversion from the norm. \n\nI really feel like I can get my fill for $10.
