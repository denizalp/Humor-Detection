Definitely a hidden gem !   They have weekly $12 pasta specials, $10 pizza specials and their appetizer portions are generous.  Not to mention that rack of lamb was juicy, flavourful perfection I just couldn't get enough.  \n\nWe went at 6pm for dinner since we had some help from my mother in law baby sitting and didn't want to be out too late.  The service was amazing, the food fantastic and I can't wait to go back again.... maybe even with the baby....
