I bought my car in Dec. of 2013.  I was in the middle of a bankruptcy and had my car turned in as part of that case. I was desperate! This dealership is top notched in customer service. The entire team was kind, non judgmental and helpful. \nI came there as a reject from a Nissan dealership, down the street, who sent a letter promising to finance me. So I expected no problems. Wrong they dragged me through their lot for hours driving car after car then telling me the only car they could sell me was a little tiny used and over priced one. When I walked away I felt humiliated. \nLast night I took a dear friend to purchase a used car. He was a first time buyer and had 0 as a credit score. His only possible co signer had poor credit. \nWe went first to Drivetime, who claimed to be able to finance a car. We were told to wait and wait and wait. At 7 pm we inquired and were told to wait but they close at 8 pm. I suggested we go to \"my dealership\", Newport Motors and long story short, my 20 year old friend bought a beautiful car and drove it home. The customer service was superb too. Special thanks to Brent (finance), D'won, and Eddie.
