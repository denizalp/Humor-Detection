Dinner visit with friends after basketball. Upscale Vietnamese restaurant targeted at the Western market. Staff are Vietnamese so that's a good start. Ordered Pho and Rice rolls. Both were good and same applies to the service. Prices slightly higher than the usual venues but not complaining since the establishment is much nicer. Overall, I would revisit and recommend others to give them a try
