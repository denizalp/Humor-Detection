A very impressive steakhouse.\nThere are good steakhouses (Barberian's and even The Keg at its price point) and there is the completely disappointing (hello Ruth Chris and your useless oily meat!) and Hy's falls in the former category...\nThe room is dim, well-appointed and immaculately clean. It is a very special dining room behind the large entrance.\nThe service was polite and attentive. There was no pushy selling or intrusion. The waitress was there when needed and not there when not. \nThe hostess was well put together and presentable. She had a polite and sincere smile on her face.\nWe had the day's special peppercorn steak and it was exactly as ordered and deliciously tender and tasty. The Liver is also another dish I would recommend. I tried it and it was very well done. The side of asparagus and garlic mashed potato were very good.\nThe cheese bread sounds tacky and cheap, but theirs was light, fluffy and again delicious.\nThat would be my only criticism of Hy's. For the price and the type of restaurant a complimentary basket of high-end bread and accompaniment is a must! However, that is not enough to deduct a point..
