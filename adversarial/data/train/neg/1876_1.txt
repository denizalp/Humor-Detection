I must say, the service in every respect here exceeded my expectations.  From the moment I walked in the door, until I picked up my glasses, everything was top notch.  \n\nI was pleasantly greeted, and was given approximately 6 different frames to try on within 5 minutes of arriving.  The staff member put them into two rows, and had me try of the first four pairs, then told me the last two were her favourites for me, based on face shape and some other observations she had made.  She was bang on.  I loved both, and settled on a pair that she liked the most, and when she went on to explain why, talking about what drew her eye, and even asking me what I did for a living, I was totally impressed with how \"on\" she was.  \n\nThe owner, Joe, fitted the pair, and they did everything so efficiently, I left there with such a satisfied feeling.  My glasses even came in earlier than I expected which is another reason why I liked this business.  It's all about managing expectations!  Joe looked after me when I came in to pick them up.  I was given some free goodies, and again, left with very clear instructions regarding breaking in the transitions properly, and even a lesson on how best to clean them.\n\nMy experience was superb.  I will definitely go back here for all of my eye wear requirements, and will recommend them highly, whenever I have the opportunity to do so.  \n\nThanks Joe to you and your team.  You were all awesome.
