I got the rib eye steak and it was pretty good, but fatty.  The baked potato was good and the salad was decent.  They came out with fresh rolls with the salad, but my brother in law got the hamburger and he was disgusted with the buns.  My sister got the top sirloin and it was not too bad either.   My wife got the filet and it was just ok.  The service was slow at first, but then after we ordered it picked up a bit.  Not a bad place, but overly overly priced!!  Outback is half the price and double the great taste!!  I will not come back here.
