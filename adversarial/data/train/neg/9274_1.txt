The all you can eat was $17.99 for Lunch and $24.99 for Dinner.  Considering each Meat order was about $20 it was definitely worth it.  The food was delicious and the waitresses were very kind.  The only reason it has 4\/5 stars is that they were not very good with filling my water.  \n\nAwsome food and nice staff.  Just be sure to ask for extra water from the beginning. :)
