Incompetant staff. Lack of communication.  I purchased progressive lens with hesitation. The employee said if they don't work I could bring them back and get single lens. What she did not tell me is that I would not be entitled to a credit nor did she give me a price breakdown of how much more I'd be spending. Had I known that up front, to the tune of$174.00 I would have never purchased the Progressive lens. The response from the manager was \" read your receipt\". What difference would that have made since I had made the purchase not to mention I didn't know that I was going to get stuck paying the entire amount based on the information , or lack there of from the employee. The Dr. wasn't much assistance either.  Ever since management\/ owners changed, including Doctors this place had really gone down hill in terms of service. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. I had a previous negative service incident and thought I'd try them one more time. Never again!
