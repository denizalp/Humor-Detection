Our AC & Furnace (split system) was 12+ years old.  Was getting noisier and we were having repair people out too often.  Long story short we contacted Cooper Climate Control and now have new duct work plus a larger & much more efficient Lennox AC installed.  Our house now cools to the desire temp in minutes (honest!) rather that the long slow cooling we were used to.  We can not speak highly enough about Cooper Climate.  Their employees were clean, polite, dressed appropriately and clearly new what they were doing.  Due to the amount of duct work we wanted done this was a 2 day install.  The employees worked till almost 9pm (seriously, who does that?) the first night to get the system running so we could cool the house to sleep.  The 2nd day they showed up & finished the additional duct work and explained the system to us.  Kendall Ryan (boss man) was here several times during the install to oversee their work.  Today (day 3) Kendall was out again to personally inspect the finished project. This included him crawling into the attic again for a full review of the work performed.  He answered all of our questions and helped us with the paperwork for the SRP rebate.  I don't know how he or his employees could have done anything to make this any better than it was.  One more thing:  when the employees left there was no mess of any sort remaining.  They even brought in a vacuum to clean up any dust around the crawlspace & into our hallway.
