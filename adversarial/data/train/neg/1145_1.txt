The Rumfish will be fun when the outside bar and eating area open up.  Just opened and have about 12 beers on draft, about 12 beers in bottles, about 12 beers in the can,about 12 red wines, about 10 white wines.  Nothing to shout home about but OK.  \n\nThe menu has some seafood, some meat and some apps, and sandwiches.   We shared a Rumfish stew that was OK,   The couple beside us had the shrimp tacos and the Island BBQ and were pretty pleased.  Of  course they just opened and need some time to get their legs.  But this place has a lot of potential!   Hope that is reached!\n\nWas looking to order more but the kitchen closed about 9:30.  Wish it was open a little later!\n\nOur bar person was somewhat distracted but just learning the ropes, hope she improves!\n\nCurrently open at 4.  Not sure about future times, but there is a happy hour.
