The best BBQ in Phoenix.  My favorite is the  lean brisket, but others I have dined with prefer the fatty brisket.  You can't go wrong here.  Last Thanksgiving I ordered turkey breast and it was mouth watering delicious.  Their location is a bit quirky, hidden among an odd assortment of businesses immediately south of the airport.  Be aware that there is almost always a long wait, and it is worth it. Open for lunch only, Tues-Sat.
