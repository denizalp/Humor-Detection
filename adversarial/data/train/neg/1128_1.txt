When my plane landed in Vegas this past Friday morning, I had two emails from Brian, a host at Body English, that I had spoken with previously. He offered my group buy one bottle, get one free, for that night which I promptly took him up on. Brian met us outside Body English at 10:45 pm and walked us to our table. We had a great corner table on the second floor. My only complaint about getting a table at BE is that they are really close together so you don't really get the super intimate feel that you do at other clubs. However, this definitely encourages a social environment as we talked and danced with the guys at the table next to us and another table gave some of my girls shots from their bottle.\n\nOur waitress was really nice and paid really good attention to us all night long. Bottle prices are actually a bit lower than at some other Vegas clubs I have been to (bottles start at $400). BE played good music all night long, although I could have done without hearing two Lady Gaga songs back to back.\n\nBE is definitely a fun club if you want to venture off the strip, although if you aren't doing table service, be prepared for a clusterf*ck of a line to get in.
