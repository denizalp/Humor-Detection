I would give this place 10 stars if I could. I have ALWAYS had a great time here and the waitresses have consistently been amazing! I love their garlic sauce and they always always always give it extra if I ask for it. But the location at finch and duffrine (sp?) is so bad that they charge for each tiny dip you ask for! Hence I NEVER go there anymore. \nRecently I have switched my lifestyle and the way I eat. I went to St Louise (the one I am reviewing) and reluctantly ask the waitress if she could accommodate my request. She not only accommodated my request she even suggested some ideas within my guidelines!!! I loved the experience! Then I went back again yesterday the same waitress attended to us. When I started telling her what I could and couldn't eat (thinking she must have forgotten me from the last time) she right away remembered me AND my requirements!!!! She was just awesome! \n\nAll in all I LOVE this location and their business practices. Good service, good food, good people. Will continue to go back there - ALWAYS!
