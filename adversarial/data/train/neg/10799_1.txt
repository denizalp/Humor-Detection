Start to finish:\nArriving the place seemed PACKED. asked the hostess to put our name in \n(4 people) and she said it was going to be 45 minutes. Walked around to the bar which was also packed and got some mimosas. Then we started looking around. All though the place seemed packed, only about  1\/2 their tables were occupied. We soon found out the reason: owner and\/or manager was this old mean lady who was incredibly rude to both customers and wait staff. \nFinally a waiter snuck us into an empty table in his section after seeing us standing at the bar for 30 minutes. Manager\/owner then proceeded to come over and yell at him in front of all the diners. Despite her actions the waiter held his ground and we were able to keep our table. \nOur waiter was awesome! he totally took care of everything we wanted, kept our waters full, joked around with us about, gave us some great advice about where to visit, and talked us through the whole menu. He even brought a sample of the chocolate bacon for us to try!\nThis is what we had:\nBloddy Marry- Loved the veggies and chocolate cover bacon that came with this. However the mixer seemed a little thin and tasteless to me. All in all 4 stars\nPumpkin Cheesecake Pancakes-Not enough Pumpkin flavor for us personally, but they were still great. Eat these fast! 4 stars\nCaprese Benedict-Egg was poached perfectly and the pesto tasted amazing. 5 stars\nBreakfast Burger-Fried leeks were amazing but the burger meat itself needed more flavoring. 5 stars\nDutch Apple French Toast-Apples were cooked perfectly and the cinnamon butter was to die for. 5 stars\nProsciutto & Chocolate Chip Waffles-Super yummy, but it was bacon not prosciutto served with it. 5 stars\n\nAll in all we will definitely be coming back here because of the food and the wait staff. Hopefully the manager\/owner will start to understand she needs to work behind the scenes a bit more.
