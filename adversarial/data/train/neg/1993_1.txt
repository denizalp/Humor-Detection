Let me just start with Kim who has always a warm smile for us and our little guys, she is efficient, engaging and she makes us feel like family.  Like her all the the reception desk crew is very warm, friendly and competent!  You guys rock! (Kelin, Sara, Jasmine and anyone else I may have missed inadvertently). The therapy and nursing staff gave us some amazing 2nd chance days, you guys work as a really big and friendly team that truly love animals!\n\nJustin, the kennel manager would stop say hello and interact with my dogs and get to know them as would Dr Anderson between patients always friendly and warm. \n\nDoctor Ensign and Doctor Hill were wonderful with our beloved miniature poodle Mr. Kiwi.  \nOur Kiwi was 18.5 years old and unfortunately time had caught up with him and that tough decisions had to be made. \n\nDr Hill counseled us and consoled us as his, and our options had run out after years of treatment.  Acceptance that our baby Kiwi's quality of life and time had run out was extremely difficult but Dr Hill gave us her time and even skipped her breaks and lunchtime to counsel us and allow us to consider the few alternatives left.  The staff at Boca Park Animal Hospital compassion and consideration was tremendous and consistent from our first experience till the end. They allowed us to give Kiwi the dignified passing with all his family around him.  We shared a final meal with him as we said our goodbyes as he went on to his next journey.\n\nEven though we are devastated by his loss our days are brightened knowing there is a group of kind compassionate and competent veterinary group to assist you with all the stages of your companions life. Thank you Drs Ensign, Drs Hill and the staff at Boca park Animal Hospital for being there for us and Kiwi!
