Pinbot, Bride of Pinbot, Black Knight, Xenon, the list goes on.  This place is super cheap and a celebration of our abandoned friend, the pinball game.  There are a few duds here of course, but that's fine.  You can play games from the 40''s (?) to present day.  \n\nPresent day pinball (is Stern the only maker anymore?) is pretty awful, and hard to find.  Do yourself a favor and support this place!
