I've been here numerous times.  Love the varied menu but am a fan of breakfast.  I am not a fan of the hash browns which are never done, in my opinion, cooked enough.  I opt out of those each and every time.  The staff, for the most part, are friendly and efficient.  A few servers have left a bad taste in my mouth so I avoid their stations if at all possible.  French Onion burger is the bomb as are the sausages.  Great place but can be crazy busy on the weekend.
