Pita Jungle is a great place to get inexpensive Mediterranean food (as long as you don't mind a bit of a wait).\n\nThe food usually gets served up really fast, but then your waiter leaves and -never comes back-.  I'm not ususally a stickler for outstanding wait service, but I do like to get my glass refilled and be given my check in a timely manner.\n\nNever-the-less, the food is so good it makes up for any other flaws.
