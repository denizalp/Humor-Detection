What a great surprise! We'll be returning especially as it's so close...a very short drive.\nWe started & shared the Thailiciousdumplings with the side dipping sauce - excellent. Partner had the Drunken Noodles - loved it. I had the Thai Basil rice with chicken - very good. I had an Asian Sidecar to drunk & my partner had a Lucky Buddha beer.
