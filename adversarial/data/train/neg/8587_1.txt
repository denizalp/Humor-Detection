The burrito I had for breakfast was amazing. My wife and I were both impressed by both the quality of the food and the speed of service. The location was easy to find, and it was \"seat yourself\". Prices were in the $7-10 range and we will definitely be back to try other things from the menu. If you're looking for a breakfast that you recognize but with a twist then you should give this place a try. It was great!
