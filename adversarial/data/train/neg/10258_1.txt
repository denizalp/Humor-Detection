Great laid-back vibe, live music a few nights a week, friendly folks, and real authentic food. Brought a friend from Monterrey and after we devoured our tacos al pastor, carnitas, barbacoa, lengua and some rocking elote he declared, \"just like the best taco trucks in Monterrey, but clean!\" \n\nNot to mention I was pleasantly surprised by their beer selection - dead guy ale, rotating local beers, and more.
