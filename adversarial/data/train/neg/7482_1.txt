If you live in Highland Creek or Sky Brook area. This pizza joint is a great addition to the other restaurants around our hood. You can order by the slice or pie. Great place to have a quick beer and slice of pizza. Beer specials during the week. New York style pizza with attitude. Small bar area with plenty of free parking. I'll give it 5 stars just because I like their NY attitude & close to home.
