Went there with a friend to watch playoff football. There was one bartender and maybe 8 patrons. He took his time engaging with each of them in conversation, which I personally like in a bartender. \n\nBeer selection is good and brewed in-house. A bit expensive but otherwise good.  \n\nI got the loaded potato flat bread. It was an excellent mixture of flavor. Defenite recommend.\n\nOverall, this is a neat additional to the flats. Check it out if you want a nice, more low key (read: family friendly) environment.
