I don't know how Echo sushi got the yelp rating it holds. This place is so unimpressive. \n\nCONS:\n\nNo hostess or even welcoming staff\n\nTerrible table service- hasty waitresses that quickly slap your order on the table and reach over your food for empty plates several times firing your meal\n\nBut worst of all- the sushi is just meh. \n\nPROS\n\nA large menu including some healthier alternatives like brown rice sushi with fruits (see pics)\n\nFast service, albeit unfriendly \n\nThe space is small but clean. \n\nI RECOMMEND: looking for other places in the area. I prefer Ho Su Bistro up the street near Eglinton\n\nEXTRA TIP: The beef teriyaki was very tasty and the spicy fried chicken wasn't bad, but order slowly because leftovers mean extra charges
