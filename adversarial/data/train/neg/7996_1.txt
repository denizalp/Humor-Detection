This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I came here with friends for Queens Feast and it was fantastic as always. The food was stellar, amazing service, and great cocktails and wine. I had the Sea Scallops, Duck La' Orange and the Warm Apple Galette. I also added their Fois Gras supplement for $18 but you only live once. I've never had it before so I had to finally try it this time. Everyone at the table raved about their dishes so you really couldn't go wrong with anything. If you decide to come for Restaurant Week in the future, book it weeks in advance. It's no longer the hidden gem it used to be bc they book up early now but it's completely worth it.
