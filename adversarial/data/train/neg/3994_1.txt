I had my backyard done, which included an irrigation system, plants, sod, gravel and pavers for a patio extension. Kylee was the designer and she was a joy to work with; very knowledgable when it comes to plants. They are reasonably priced and completed all the work in one day. Another company gave me a quote that was literally twice the amount I paid and did not even include the paver patios. The owner Lance has come out to show me how the irrigation system works and they even replaced a pipe at no charge when another company cracked it when putting up scaffolds. They actually answer the phone when you call, don't have a long wait time and send out 15 men to get the job done quickly. I am very happy with the results! My backyard is my own little paradise now
