I really wanted to like this place, WAS having a blast perusing the aisles and googling various beauty products  and things like Araroot Powder; a customer was super friendly and gave me a namaste even.\nAt checkout, however, the lady ignored my greeting, rang all my stuff up and looked away without telling me a total. It was super rude so I just kind of waited and she literally just stood there...............................overly committed to no eye contact\/ words. When I rhetorically asked what the total was, she was condescending and took over the pin pad transaction as if I'm retarded and continued to not acknowledge me. \nWhatever, right? Nope. I shrugged it off and tried the Vegetarian Kitchen. The girl that took my order was very short with me, also treated me as if I have a mental deficiency for asking what a couple items were. I ordered my food to go and then sat down to try it. At one point the other girl behind the counter looks at me, says something, and then they all look in unison and have a good laugh. I am not dumb, I ordered it to go deliberately, not being wasteful. I felt like I was made to wait unnecessarily long and that I may have been overcharged. The divider in the center of the food prep area was extremely sketchy bc it made me wonder what they were hiding behind it\/ potentially doing to my food.\n\nNot only did I feel extremely unwelcome in the store, the herbal face washes I came for ALSO contain artificial dyes and fragrance (aka irritants) even though they are labeled as \"neem face wash,\" the food made me sick (the prepared food in aluminum to-go trays on the countertop without refrigeration is concerning\/ health code violation), and the staff has a serious naan up their ass (asking for naan was apparently a blunder LOL).
