Are you in for a fun dining experience? Dick's Last Resort at the Excalibur Hotel & Casino is the place to go! You're in for a great day\/night of fun. Don't be insulted when the waiter is utterly rude to you, it's their fun for you. Don't hold back, yell at them when you need your food and drinks! They're up for it and you should be too!\n\nCost: ~$15+\n\nMy dining experience was great! Good drinks and great food. My buddies and I got the \"Big Ass Burger\" \"Brisket Sammich with pulled pork\" \"bucket of garlic Parmesan fries\" \"a pound of wings\" and topped it off with \"a daiquiri.\" The fries were the best, I'm a huge fan of potatoes and I've always loved my fries at Buffalo Wild Wings but this has topped it. You'll get the potato texture, yes real potatoes, with a light dash of garlic and Parmesan. The brisket Sammich is to die for, I would definitely come back time and time again for it. I'm not sure how the big ass sandwich was but I'm sure it was filling! Wings? Eh I could pass on it and get it elsewhere. The wings weren't the best but they were delicious. I wouldn't be a splurger on it if I had the choice again. The brisket sammich is a must try.
