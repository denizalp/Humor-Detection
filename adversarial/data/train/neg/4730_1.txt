Set up appt to check out a vehicle when we arrived they told us they didn't have one on the trim package we requested - after we waited 20 minutes for them to \"get one off the back lot\". We left. Tip for sales lady if you don't hVe the car, don't set up an appt, have the car ready and at hand at the time of the appt. SLOPPY
