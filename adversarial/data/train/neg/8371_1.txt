Dr. Anger is relentless in identifying the source of my dogs health issues (unfortunately as he ages there are many).  She has worked tirelessly beyond our 'appointment' to get to the root of problems, offer the best treatment options and help him live a happy and healthy life during his senior years.  She seems to care about my dog as much as I do!  I highly recommend the team at Animal Hospital at Tatum Ranch!
