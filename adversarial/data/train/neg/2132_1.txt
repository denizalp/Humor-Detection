Ok so took me longer then expected too come back for more Buldogi Dogs. It had the perfect excuse come one of my hockey teammates told him about the place and he like got try it. We meet up for lunch. The only reason dropped it one star is because Buckeye Dog was great but not awesome or wow factor like the Angry Dog. The things that was great about the Buckeye Dog really like the crispy bacon squares in every bite, corn relish was good, and on whole nice balance of flavors. ALL the Buldogis Dogs look like artwork. It kind of sad thinking about the best way too attack it. One thing sure if hands don't get little messy not enjoying the whole experience. \n\nI also ordered the Angry Kim Chee sweet fries. It not good idea since my friend not into sweet fries and lot too eat for one person. I did my yelp best! Lol! It was really good. So much flavors going on every bite different! Me big fan of fried egg on top of just about anything and everything. Kim Chi too talk about the kicker! \n\nThe service was again awesome! I remember too use my yelp checkin discount. She really friendly, warm, and since friend first time she was very helpful any questions he had and knowledgeable of the menu. Sure couple more Dogs need try so count on me coming back again!
