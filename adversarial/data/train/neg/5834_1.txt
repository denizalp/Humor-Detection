Unfortunately, last week I suddenly began to lose vision in my left eye.  Trust me, you NEVER want to deal with that situation. So, of course, I was desperate to be seen by the eye doctor, and when I arrived at Nationwide I couldn't even read the form they want you to fill out.  \n\nWell.  The guys over there at Nationwide Vision were amazing.  They took superb care of me.  They were nothing short of tremendous from start to finish and NOW I CAN SEE again.  \n\nThanks so much for the great care.
