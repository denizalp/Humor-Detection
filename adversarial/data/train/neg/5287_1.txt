I used to love this location when it was Bravo Cucina.  Stopped there today expecting to find Bravo, and it's since been changed to Brio Coastal Kitchen.  Not impressed.  Prices have increased, and portion sizes decreased. I ordered the house salad with shrimp.  The shrimp were micro-sized. Bravo used to bring out bread automatically.  Now you have to ask for it, and hope your waiter remembers.  Our waiter was aloof and had minimal personality.  Will not be returning.
