I visited the Yorkdale Mall location of Lush on a Friday night on one of the busiest shopping weekends of the year.  The staff were very attentive, friendly and helpful.  They were super knowledgeable about the products and eager and willing to do demonstrations for us.  We had a lot of fun shopping and talking about luxurious baths and how natural and wonderful the products are.\n\nThere was one young gentleman in particular who really showed me kindness and generosity and inspired me that night.  The staff was enthusiastically demonstrating and talking up the products we were thinking of purchasing.  This man showed us this year's scarf designs and since I was purchasing the \"It's Christmas Dear\" bath bomb tin, he showed us the complementing scarf.  It was not the same design as the tin...so I was disappointed since the tin was so cute.  He asked me to wait a minute, and went into the back room.  He retrieved his own personal \"it's Christmas Dear\" scarf from last year and presented it to me as a personal gift because I loved it so much.  I was nobody to him, just a random customer...yet he showed me such incredible kindness and generosity that night.  He gave me a gift of his own coveted scarf just to make me happy.  What a wonderful person!!  What a wonderful addition to Lush's team!\n\nI was thoroughly impressed by the entire experience and will continue to frequent this particular location as often as possible.  Thank you Lush!
