This is my neighborhood market and 2nd on my list of favorite stores next to the one near Desert Shores off Rampart and Lake Mead. \n\nThe people that work here say hello so often it gets silly sometimes. The customer service manager at night is genuinely one of the nicest people I have met at a supermarket. The guard at night (I will have to get his name and update) is also incredibly friendly, which is fairly rare for someone in his capacity. \n\nStrangely this Smiths offers some of the best prices on certain staple products I buy compared even to other Smiths. I am not sure how they work this out but I have had reason to shop at 2 other Smiths within blocks of each other and each had very different sales.\n\nThe primary reason I shop here is that they (try to) never let you wait in line. If people start lining up they will literally open as many registers as possible to get people checked out. I absolutely love this and its why I am willing to avoid Walmart.  Well that and the friendly employees. \n\nI took away 1 star since i often find that they have sold out items which I buy often and their selection is more limited given their smaller size. \n\nThey recently re-ordered a lot of shelves to make things more user friendly and the verdict is still out on that move. \n\nOn the whole, while this store is far from scintillating, it is neat and well ordered.
