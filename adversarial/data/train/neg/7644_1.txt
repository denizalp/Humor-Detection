Stephanie is great teacher with a passion for singing and bringing out the best of her students!  My 10 year old daughter's voice has improved greatly in just 4, 1 hour lessons-much louder with far greater range.  I can only imagine her potential now that she's learned speech level singing and microphone performance techniques from Stephanie.  I'm so glad that we found Sing Your Style Studio and highly recommend to others!  Thanks Stephanie!!
