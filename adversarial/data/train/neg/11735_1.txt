Great take on the good ole American hot dog. Loving their Korean take on the menu.\n\nHad the banh Mi! And the pickled veggies and sauce definitely tasted like an old-fashioned banh mi from China-town. Must try!\n\nWe had bulgogi fries, thinking it was side size. Wow that's definitely what it was, it's entree size. Either share or have alone, these are definitely filling.\n\nBonus, their fountain soda serves the green tea ice tea. Love it! Coming back for sure.
