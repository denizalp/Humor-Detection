I am torn with this place. On the one hand, this is where my department orders the departmental breakfasts, but on the other hand, this place is a wee bit pricey.  The price for coffees\/teas is reasonably. Sadly, there is no almond milk as alternative to regular milk & cream.  But the prices for the food buffet are too much because it's by the pound and it adds up immediately.\n\nI do like that they have chocolates, crisps, yogurts, fruits, cheese for that mid-day snack attack, particularly yogurts.\n\nMy colleagues who order from here have had very good experiences with the management in their catering needs.\n\nThe coffee line-up in the morning runs very smoothly and the staff is friendly.
