Stopped in with the family and had an excellent late lunch. Two loved the bacon cheeseburgers, one enjoyed the crispy chicken wrap, and I loved the mac-n-cheese. There was so much mac-n-cheese in the bowl that the fam dug in to help finish it. We had had a very expensive dinner the previous night at a chain steakhouse in Phoenix, but we all agreed that this lunch tasted much better than the dinner.
