I go to the high school up the road so this is a great place to stop before or after school! The people are always smiling and are very nice. I've had the coffee a few times, but my favorite is the tsunami energy drink! There are so many flavor combos that you can get a different one every time. I'm pretty indecisive between the long list of flavors so I either get the tsunami of the day or have the barista make me their favorite!
