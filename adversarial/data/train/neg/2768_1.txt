Considering this mechanic shop is not on the best side of town, they offer the best and most trust worthy work. My father knows the owner of the business and has been taking his vehicular here for years. \n\nI would highly recommend taking your car to this shop if you are in  need of a good mechanic. They offer car services at a great price!
