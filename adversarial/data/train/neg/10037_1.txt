Last year I brought my car there for service asking for a Transmission flush because I didn't know how long it's been since the car- previously owned had one and I felt as if the Transmission was slipping.  I've had cars in my days to know when the transmission is going out.  At only 70K I had to get a new transmission for my 2007 VW Jetta Wolfsburg edition.  My point is, I went to them with these exact statements, instead they steered me into an $1100 worth of \"maintenance\" that would fix my driving problem.  It didn't fix the problem, so I had to go back the next week to get a new transmission which was $4000.  I think as a FEMALE I was taken advantage of, even though I had specific reasons that it was my transmission.  The two pieces of paperwork that I have makes no sense.  The first one, it said customer concerned about transmission- found no transmission problem.... second paperwork, customer concerned about transmission- needs new transmission.  JUSTIN BEARDLEY the manager did NOT ever APOLOGIZE to me and he did not ACCOMMODATE me even after I emailed VWUSA.  So, I will not be buying another VW.  I am NOT buying from KEFFER.  Instead I am going for something else that gives better service and have better resale value.  THANK YOU KEFFER VW!  Merry Christmas to you JUSTIN!
