I've eaten here several times and its always been good breakfast and lunch food. However my last visit, the food wasn't that good. I ordered a knish with matzo ball soup. The soup, as always was delicious. The matzo ball was pillowey goodness. Unfortunately the knish was a different story. I ordered the one with meat. I cut into the top, unfortunately I couldn't cut all the way through because the bottom was rock hard. Almost as though it had spent too much time in the microwave to heat up. The meat was also very dry. Our waitress was awesome, I showed it to her and she ask if she could replace it for me. I said sure, I'll try the potato pancake. Again, it was overcooked. Very chewy... it did have great flavor. I love supporting local, so I will definitely be back However I may just stick to the bagels. They're always good!
