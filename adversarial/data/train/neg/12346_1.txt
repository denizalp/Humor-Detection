I ate there last Sat 5\/13\/2017, the staff seemed nice enough and food was ok. When I got the bill I noticed that there were charges on there that shouldn't have been. Once I spoke to the waitress she said she wasn't sure how that happened and then fixed the check. So imagine my surprise when I got an alert from my bank saying that the tip I left was very generous and I needed to take a second look at the charge. Seems the waitress added a 25 dollar tip to a 32 dollar tab. I have eaten at the Lazy Dog in Summerlin and had no problems, but I will never go back to the Lazy Dog in Town Square. If you choose to eat there, check your bill and bank statements to make sure that they don't \"give themselves\" a generous tip without your knowledge.
