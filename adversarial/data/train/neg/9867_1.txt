This place is absolutely fabulous. I love Brazilian steakhouses but don't love the price tag that usually comes along with them. There are two other great places in town but they are around $50 a plate. \n\nThis place was around $30 a plate and just as delicious!! \n\nThe environment was romantic and cozy and I noticed there was a karaoke area, though no one used it while we were there. The service was great too, the servers were attentive and friendly. \n\nI hope this place is around for a long time because it's my new favorite restaurant!
