I stop by showtime  auto spa for a car wash and found a diamond  in a rough. I came in to inquiry about tint and got more than I barging for. Ricky is an excellent salesman.  He ask about the cars we owned and sold us on rims and tint. They  have a 90 day payment option same as cash. No more down. \n If you looking for inexpensive tint and rims come see Rigo and Ricky. They have great customer service.\nWe were in and out with new tires, rims, tint and a brand new front windshield. \nCome by for all your tire needs. Windshields start off at $99.00
