I don't even know where to start with this horrible unethical doctor.  I brought my son here because he was having seasonal allergies.  They did a few breathing tests and \"concluded\" my son had seasonal allergies (which I already knew) and minor childhood asthma. All of this they were able to decide without the help of the doctor.  \n\nThe doctor came in and spoke with us for about 2 minutes and then sent his pharmaceutical sales man in and told us he knew more about the medications then doctors and he wanted us to try \"everything\" he gave us and if none of the 5 medications worked we could try something else.  \n\nREALLY? ??? MY son has seasonal allergies not a rare disease only found in foreign counties.  They did nothing to help us but prescribe a lot of medications to which no surprise none worked. \n\nNot to mention they get upset if you ask questions but most likely because they don't know how to answer them.
