Saeed's is basically everyone's last stop of the night after an evening out. It's a fantastic place to people watch.. especially the karaoke! They have 2 bars, one inside and one outside. Can't beat $2 jello shots, although I'm not sure they even have any alcohol in them sometimes! There's something for everyone here whether it's karaoke, pool tables, Cornhole or ping pong. Bathroom isn't the cleanest\/best, but I guess it's what you'd expect.
