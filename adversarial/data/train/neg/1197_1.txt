Good job doing a check up on my AC units. First day they did not show up for the appointment. I called the owner and she fixed the issue. Tech was at my house the next day and did not charge us the service fee. Nice save, but would've liked for them to show up the day scheduled.\n\nWill use them again. Thanks!
