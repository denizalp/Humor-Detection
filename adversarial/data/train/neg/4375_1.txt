Went there on Fourth of July weekend and saw this place during my last visit in December but didn't try it then.  This time there was five of us and it was kinda late so was really glad to hear this place is open till 3am on weekends.\nWe were sat within five minutes of arriving and waiter took our drink orders.  She was really quiet at times but really quick.  The menu has a good amount of choices.  My recommendations is get a bowl of soup as an appetizer.  A friend who like asian spots told me once to try start off with one of the soups on the menu.   If the soup is good, then the rest of the food will be good.  We decided to try a soup that had big chunks of pork and asian veggies with had an amazing broth.\nWhen it came time to order, we decided to get a bunch off dishes and try a little of each item.  Out of each item, I recommend trying the walnut prawns.  They are amazing!!! My brother enjoyed the roasted duck.\nThe place has a nice appearance and its full of Asians coming with large groups.  The table next to us was complaining about something on the order so there was a lot of arguing in Chinese, I think.  I can't wait to come back and get those walnut prawns!!  Heard they have dim sum during the lunch hours so gonna have to try that some time as well.
