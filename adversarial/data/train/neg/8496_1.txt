Items Selected:\nRed Velvet Pancakes\nCinnamon Swirl French Toast\nBanana Nut Pancakes\n\nLocated on South Durango and open from 6am until 3pm seven days a week Norm's Eggs Caf√© had long been on my breakfast 'to-do' list and with a morning half-marathon of miles already under my feet it was just after the small storefront opened that I arrived on Saturday, a smiley young server setting tables while Norm himself manned the oven and stove.  Every bit the quaint space its name would imply with exposed brick, worn wood, and a kitchen-side bar wrapped around a well-culled menu of classics from breakfast and lunch it was admittedly with carbs on my mind that I approached an order and eschewing a few interesting specials in favor of a trio of griddled goods the results were mostly what one would expect - as tasty and well made as what a skilled home cook could make but without all the prep-work and cleanup hassles involved.  Beginning first with French Toast before progressing to pancakes I will simply say that for my tastes the former was a bit too 'bready' but more than making up for it were the flapjacks, both styles proving delightful with unexpected levels of fluffiness despite thinly spread batter and each well paired with subtly sweetened cream cheese frosting flooding the red velvet while pockets of fresh banana dotted the nut-strewn buttermilk, neither really necessitating a bit of the unfortunately artificial maple syrup...though with an out-the-door tab under $20 I'm not sure it would be fair to expect the real deal.
