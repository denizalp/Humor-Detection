The words 'honest' and 'jeweler' typically don't go together from my experience. Jeff White is the exception to the rule because he has a business built on integrity and trust.\nHe's also one of the most skilled jewelers in Las Vegas which is why I entrusted him to design my wife's ring. This shop does not cut corners and Jeff and his son have great intuition in business and relationships.
