Palmer was amazing! She was meticulous with her work, and held a very engaging conversation to put me at ease.  I signed up for a package after my first visit. I also felt less pain than with the other waxes I've experienced, because of the unique formulation they use. \nPalmer was also very knowledgeable.  She put me at ease quickly, so the experience was not a bad one, and I'm about a week out from the work and still smooth, so she does great work too!
