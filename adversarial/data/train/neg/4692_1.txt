I was very excited to find this place on yelp and I immediately grabbed hubby to lunch there.  Both hubby were very happy to know the food is more of a Louisiana French, as we both enjoyed the food in New Orleans very much.  I ordered a BBQ Shirmp Po'boy and hubby had the Cochon Melt, and of course, we got the beignets as dessert.  The cochon melt was pretty good, but the po'boy is...a bit of a let-down.  Well, at least we ended it on a high note:  the beignets.  I don't know what it is about a freshly deep fried dough covered in powder sugar...  I should've just gotten the beignets and coffee.  \n\nRight before we left, I saw the dinner special on their board: Fried Soft-shell Crabs, Smoked Corn Grits & Maque Choux.  Yes, it's $24, but it's soft-shell crab and it's a dinner portion.  It'd be worth it.  We came back for it the same day, and had a mixed feeling....  While the crabs are fresh and crispy - perfect in every way and the grits and maque choux are also excellent, the portion size is more like an appetizer...  Was it supposed to be an appetizer?  No...it's not under the Les Hors d'Oeuvres...  I mean I didn't expect the soft-shell crabs to be more, but com'on, who would've thought they can be so stingy with grits?  There was so little grits that it looked like the fancy sauce they \"brush\" on the plate (like what you see in \"Chop\"). \n\nWe also got the chocolate croissant and mango panna cotta; both were not bad but I've had better elsewhere.\n\nI thought about going back for the Shrimp Étouffée, but I think I'll wait a while.  There are many other good places in Phoenix I want to try.
