If you are looking for high end Chinese food, you are not going to find it here.  But you will find a buffet that always has hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, garlicky blistered green beans, egg rolls, dumplings, chicken satay, lo mein noodles, seafood delight, chicken with broccoli, oyster mushrooms, General Tso's chicken, mixed Chinese vegetables, butter shrimp .... the list goes on.\n\nI have been coming here for years.  The food is always the same.  The waitress is always friendly.  The place is dumpy, but if you take the time to talk to the manager, he would tell you that they are looking for a new location because all of the buildings on the block have been purchased and will be razed.  Would you invest money into a building that you are going to be forced out of soon?\n\nUnlike the previous reviewer, my daughter loves this place, and she is a Chinese food snob.  In fact, husband and I will be going here for lunch today even though it is out of our way from our offices.
