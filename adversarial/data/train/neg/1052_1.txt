The vibe is good and the staff is friendly but the food is mediocre. We ordered the brisket nachos but the meat had no flavor. The jalapenos were freshly sliced and the tomatoes are fresh but you have to pick up each ingredient and place it on a chip in order to build a chip with any flavor. It was an interesting display when serving the food but beyond the initial novelty, the taste is just not there.
