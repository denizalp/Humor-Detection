This place is so straightforward and perfect. I went to Michigan State University where Pinball Pete's was the place to go for arcade games. How thrilled am I to find that Pete and his wife filled a giant warehouse with pinball machines from the ages? VERY. They are clearly passionate about what they do. There is always someone repairing or preparing a new pinball machine in the back workroom area.  Easily an hour or so of entertainment. Depends on how much of a WIZARD you are. Strap yourself with some quarters, get there, and make it rain! Way cheaper than a casino, even though those are fun too :)
