This review is for the hotel stay only. We stayed here one night and was impressed. The room was enormous given the couch area could easily sleep several people. The bathroom was huge, had a vanity mirror section, separated tub and shower, I would love to have this as my own setup. The room service staff was very friendly and prompt. The only downside which was minor is that it seemed like a journey from check in to actually getting to the room, easy place to get lost.
