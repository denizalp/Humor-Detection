Sunburst Shutters was fantastic from start to finish. The measuring by Dave was quick and he was super friendly. The price is fair and comes highly recommended from any store they are displayed in. The guys that installed them came on time and were done in 45 minutes. The shutters are just beautiful. I wish I would've done this sooner. I look forward to showing them off and saving money on my energy bill
