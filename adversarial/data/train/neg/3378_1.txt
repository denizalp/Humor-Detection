PARTY REVIEW \nGet Air vs Rock n Jump\n\nWe had our daughter's birthday here last year & had a great experience. So of course she wanted her party here again largely due to the rock wall. Unfortunately, there were times the kids couldn't climb because there weren't enough staff. When it was Rock n Jump we had a party attendant, now Get Air doesn't provide that. I was lucky enough to have family & friends help me with decorating, setting up, unloading, and loading of it all. They couldn't even be bothered to hold the door for me. I was really disappointed I couldn't fully enjoy myself. I was either stuck in the room setting up or busy serving food. One other little thing, they should put netting up over the rooms to stop fly away balloons.
