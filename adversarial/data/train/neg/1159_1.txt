I've only been here once. I was on my way to the theatre when my SO and I decided to grab a bite beforehand. Walking along Yonge, we see C'est Bon and decided to try it out. We were greeted and seated immediately. It's a cozy little restaurant and there seemed to be a lot of regulars\/loyal customers. The d√©cor was interesting to look at and the menu was really extensive. The service here was great, really quick and helpful, and they were really friendly. \n\nMy SO ordered Peanut Chicken and I ordered one of their signature dishes - I think it was called the C'est Bon black bean basil with Chinese eggplant? I think it's supposed to come with little bits of chicken as well, but there wasn't a lot in the dish when it came. This didn't bother me though. It was tasty, but a little too oily and salty for me. I had to portion it with a large amount of rice. My SO really liked the dish he had though. \n\nThe downside is that you have to order rice separately, it's not too expensive, but I suggest getting the Large size because the serving plates are generous depending on what you order. \n\nOverall, I had a nice experience and the people that served us were incredibly kind. If I'm ever in the area, I might go back, but will probably order something else.
