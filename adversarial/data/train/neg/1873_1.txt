I created this account for reasons like this; when exceptional services\/food  is rendered I like to acknowledge it. First, the staff was beyond friendly and did a great job getting me and my family our food in a timely manner despite how crazy busy they were. There were workers going through the lobby doing an exceptional job of turning tables, restocking etc. all while going back and forth delivering the yummy food. ( I know how hard this can be especially during rushes working in the food industry myself) We needed a to go box\/bag and right when I arrived at the counter to ask I was approached by 4 different people asking if I had been helped. Talk about service! It was awesome!! I also learned that I can call in and order my food or place the order online by the kind girl who was greeting people at the door! My lunch breaks are short so I love knowing that's an option.\n\nThe decor of the store is beautiful and I was quite surprised to find out everything is for sale!! Great for me not so much my wallet hahaha\n\nThe food....so delicious. I ordered a Chicken Rasperberry Nut Salad and about died at how large the salad was and it came with yummy fresh bread on the side. The Raspberry dressing was so good!!The pastrys...dangerous good for both sight seeing and to taste!! Truthfully you can't go wrong with any pastry from the looks of it. I had a chocolate dome and ended up ordering 2 more to go for my sister to try; she loves chocolate.  I love that everything is made from scratch and fresh. Overall my experience was an amazing one. I'm a person who appreciates good quality service and food and both those items where top notch here! I will definitely be back and won't hesitate to tell people to GET IN THIS PLACE, you won't regret it.
