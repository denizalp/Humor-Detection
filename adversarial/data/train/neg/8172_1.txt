My first time shopping at Savers and it happened to be (50%) discount day. That's all I needed to hear to put my hyper-budgeting mind at ease. I found everything on my list twice over! I'm particularly exited about all of the gorgeous curtains I found as well as some really neat vintage artwork from San Francisco. The staff there was so helpful in finding the things I was looking for and patient with me as I had to leave everything (a lot of stuff) on hold because of an issue with my debit card. I would have been bummed if I had to go through the store to find the pieces I wanted all over again. It could be cleaner, but I'm not about to complain. It was totally worth the time I spent in there. Now I get to settle into my new place here in Vegas and begin making it my own.
