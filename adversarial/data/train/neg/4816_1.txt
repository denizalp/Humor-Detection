I've tried the cakes before but this week was the first time I actually ordered one and I was not disappointed. Chocolate chocolate chip with the delicious frosting and a bow in the middle for our boss's birthday. The website would not let me order any earlier than 2pm but I needed it by 1130am so I called them up and their super friendly and helpful sales associate walked me through the order and told me it was no problem at all to have the cake ready by 1130. Everything was perfect when I went to pick up and I even got to try a sample of another flavored cake. This place is great ad everyone should give them a try if you haven't already.
