Critics makes great sandwiches, and more importantly - is consistently great!  Warning - these aren't sandwiches for those looking for a snack.  These things leave you satisfied.  Do I want chips? Heck no, not with this monster sandwich.  It is a \"no sides needed\" lunch - for sure!   \n\nI have tried a few of their specialties, but always go back to the staple.  A sandwich overstuffed with turkey, swiss, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles (hehe) honey mustard and a little mayo on their hearty wheat bread.  I tend to hit them up when I've had a \"later than expected\" weeknight evening and it just hits the spot!
