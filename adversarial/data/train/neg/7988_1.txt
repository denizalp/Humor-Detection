At an event we received a bag of Jenny's Popcorn and loved it.  I went to the store in North Ridgeville to purchase some for home, bought a large bag of classic, and a smaller bag of kettle corn.  The kettle corn was good, but had large hard bits of sugar (almost broke a tooth), and the bag of classic popcorn was stale - like it had sat out for a day.  Very disappointed, not too sure if I'll try it again or not.
