Horrendous experience, stay away unless you want your vacation to be full of loud arguing outside your door and the public hallway to reek of burnt Marijuana (all day). Thought we would give this place a shot, the pictures of the property and rooms made it seem like it had a nice relaxing atmosphere. That was definitely not the case. Upon getting there the first hallway we walked into still had Marijuana smoke still dissipating. Once we found our correct hallway, the smell was not as strong. After a long day of traveling we called it an early night after getting some dinner. We were awaken at 3 am by some loud talking rude party's near us. We were again awaken at 630 am by a group of folks that decided to have an all out verbal disturbance for about 10 to 15 minutes, again right outside door! It's a shame because the rooms decor and layout are very nice but the surrounding atmosphere was just not for us!!
