This place is SICK! It's so awesome that a place like this exist right outside of downtown Pittsburgh. I've been looking at this place on social media for quite the time now. I've finally had a chance to come and I'm so beyond stoked I did. On entering I was greeted by the front desk and helped since it was my first time here. You feel out a waver give your id snap a picture for the system and that's pretty much it. I brought my own bike and helmet so it was only around $21 bucks for all day. My buddy didn't have a bike or a helmet so $21 for getting in, $15 for a rental bike, $5 for a helmet. I can't really say anything negative about that or pricing because most people have there own gear plus the prices are super reasonable. I couldn't believe some of the bike they rented out and how nice there where. My buddy got a specialized dirt jumper p3 with upgraded rims. That's like a $1400 bike with $1k rims for $15 bucks! This place is massive and one thing I wanna say is they have a community work bike station for any small repairs. I had to throw some air in my tires and adjust my breaks and it really helped out a lot. Now as far as riding goes this park really does offer stuff for everyone from beginner to advanced lines. I spent a easy 5 plus hours here my first time and still was not board. I can't decide on a favorite part of the park yet but the foam pit is a blast! They do offer a changing room as well as a rest area to eat or drink. You can't have drinks on the floor being it's wood and don't want any one to get hurt. But they do offer a little shop area for drinks or candy bars or chips as well as parts. One thing I can say that disappointed me was they have signs everywhere that they ride with turners tea but there was no turners tea to be found anywhere. I only say that because I LOVE turners but it's not something to turn me away. Overall I'm gonna start spending a lot more time here working on becoming a better riders.
