This was the first dinner buffet we hit, upon arriving in Las Vegas. \n\nThis place honors the Military by offering 20% off the bill. That, alone was the reason they will get 5 stars. No other place we went to in the 4 days we were gave any type of discount. \n\nThe crab legs are split in half and were easier to eat. Our Grandsons love crab and shrimp and were in heaven. The Chef makes pasta and you can offer him a tip. Again, I say that Buffets that already charge $30 per person should not expect us to tip their cooks for  cooking something that should be included in the buffet already. \n\nTheir prime rib was delicious. I skipped the salad bar and filled up on potatoes and prime rib. It was as good as any place I've been. \n\nMy husband went for the Asian food and wasn't thrilled at all. \n\nDessert was fun. A little of everything. I would complain only of the dirty carpet and cramped tables. There was  not enough room to move around. All in all, for the amount of $$ we spent here, it was acceptable. Thank you for honoring your Military.
