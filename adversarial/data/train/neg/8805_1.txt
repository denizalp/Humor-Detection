Was a first time customer and it was so delicious that we went back again for seconds the next day. The line looked long, but it goes by pretty fast. We got the slut with bacon ( I didn't know the slut was made with mashed potatoes mixed with the half done egg), the slut was very good but a bit pricey for the small portion ( we ended up $65 for just 4 items). We also got the Wagyu steak burger, that was very very yummy. Definitely recommend trying both of these items.
