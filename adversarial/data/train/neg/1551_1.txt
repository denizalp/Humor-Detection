This little tiny hole in the wall BBQ shop is worth the drive and worth the extensive wait in line. The BBQ is melt in your mouth delish from the brisket to the ribs to the sausage to the pulled pork. The sides are good, but that's not why you come. The employees are like friends or family and treat everyone like gold. One of my most beautiful and favorite places to eat of my entire adult life. Aaahhhhhh........
