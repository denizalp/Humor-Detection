Just had my Vsg performed by Dr Kolasch and lets just talk about how amazing he is!  He is very friendly and welcoming the moment you meet him. Dr. Kolasch is also a great surgeon he tells you step by step what's going to happen and does everything in his power to make You feel comfortable.  AND OMG the staff is also just as sweet and kind. Even after surgery 2 of the staff nurses came to visit me to make sure I understood what I needed to do to stay healthy.. They are one big caring family!
