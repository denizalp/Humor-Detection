I called in the morning to check my Macbook, since the battery needed a replacement. They gave me a very late appointment at 2:30 PM. I come here and I see the huge crowd of customers hovering around tables and there's little space to stand.\nThey take me in and tell me that my laptop will be ready for a pickup later in the day or at most the day after at 11 am. I leave the place and receive a call approximately an hour later and they tell me that it's ready to be picked up. I go upstairs again and I encounter the over crowded scene one more time. Fortunately, they had cleaned my laptop and it made me feel slightly better. They charge a lot for every single thing you need to replace. In addition to the battery, I replaced the shoes of my laptop (Yes, those small black plastic circles are called shoes they tell me) and each cost $10!  So, my entire bill came about $194. Unbelievable!
