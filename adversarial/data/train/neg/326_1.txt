I was there for the grand opening today. They gave us little menus with specific items we could order, presumably to test different parts of the menu. I didn't like anything on my menu except the tomato basil soup so I just ordered that, and they gave me three cups of it (to keep order sizes consistent, I assume). I was okay with this, but EVERY staff member had to make a comment about my food choice, which was a bit annoying after the second or third time. I finally just said, \"oh, yeah, I'm just a picky eater I guess\". \n\nWhen I went to the bakery to get my dessert, that person I had made my comment to said, \"oh, here comes Miss Picky Eater.\" This just really rubbed me the wrong way, especially after having so many comments about my food choices already. I felt almost judged for my choice in what to eat, and it made me pretty uncomfortable to be there. \n\nThis is a shame, too, because the food was really good, and I had been really excited for this place to open. I'm not sure if I will return, but hopefully this was just a one time thing.
