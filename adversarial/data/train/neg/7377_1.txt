I looked in Ohio starting a year ago in search for a hairstylist to call my own....I went to Kent for New Years and spotted Skullz Salon' trendy and cool, pink and black esthetics, and thought they would be able to meet the level I received in Cali. I finally gave up on the salon I was visiting near my work and went in for a consultation with Jeremy. I was taken back immediately and quoted $200 for cut and color (dark chocolate on top, Carmel in the middle, and leaving my already blonde hair on the bottom-totally copying Kloe Kardashian's beautiful hair...lol, yes, I even showed him her pictures...don't hate on me for steeling Kloe's style ;-)). On Friday I went in and got styled, unfortunately, I didn't get what I want (YET) and that's why they are only short one star for now ;-).  Everyone was welcoming and friendly towards me (unlike the reviews I read!). It is such a young hip place that I felt awkward at first, but every employee made me feel welcomed and did not treat me like I'm 45 ;-). The reason I am happy with my experience and gave 4 stars for now is because Jeremy is NOT happy with results either and actually told me (UNLIKE OTHER STYLIST-they usually lie to get your money and send you on your way) and he told me to come back in 4 weeks to fix it cause he doesn't want to damage my hair. THAT' S AWESOME SERVICE AND WILL KEEP ME GOING THERE! I will revisit this post and add pictures when my hair is fixed ;-). Xxo, Nanette
