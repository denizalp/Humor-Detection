The books, music and movies are over priced.\n\nThe selection is good and so is their service as book sellers.\n\nI have had several issues at the cafe of not getting what I ordered and one instance of waiting for coffee for 15 minutes and after I went back to the counter then they realize they forgot to start brewing it. (They weren't even busy at the time.)
