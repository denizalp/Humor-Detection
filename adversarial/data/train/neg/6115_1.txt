It's nice, it's clean, it's about average for an AMerican Mexican resturant.  Doesn't strike me as all that authentic but my husband, who leans more towards the AMricanized Mexican food absolutely LOVES the Sonoran Enchilada.  He calls it \"Mexican beefy goodness\" and we make special trips from AJ just to get it.  Personally, and I can always find something there to eat, think it's just ok.
