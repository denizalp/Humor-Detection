I could not be happier!  I had PDQ cater my 4 year olds birthday party since I was running out of time and needed help. He loves chicken tenders as most 4 year olds do so I figured it would be a hit and I was right! All the kids AND their parents raved about the food and wanted more. They were on time and brought all the sauces, plates, napkins, & utensils. It was so easy!  Thank you PDQ, you made our party excellent!
