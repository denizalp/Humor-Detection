Food, service, and atmosphere was good. I would go back. My 2 stars comes from the coffee that spilled on my hand from the outside staton resulting in 2nd degree burns and blisters all over two of my fingers. They provide tiny cups with no lids and my coffee was spilled when someone bumped into me. I reached out to the owners via Andy, the manager, and have still received no response. I want nothing other than to inform the ownership of this issue. Had this been spilled on my 11 month old, an elderly person, or perhaps more than just a few tbsp worth of coffee had burnt me it would have been way worse than it was.
