This is where we always go for family gatherings etc. because people can come and go as they need to, everyone can pay for themselves and the food is halfway decent.\n\nThat is except for tonight. They ran out of cheese, didn't have any one-third pound burgers or any lids for kids cups. I have a two-year-old so not having a lid for his cup is a real bummer.\n\nLuckily, another party reserved the back area of the restaurant but never showed so we got to take over that entire area. That made up for the other shortcomings!!
