I recently came here for a fun afternoon of paddle boarding with a friend and they definitely delivered! \n\nFirst they do need to update the address on yelp, we followed the directions listed and ended up getting lost but found refuge in a Mexican restaurant. We told the bartender our troubles, he was able to tell us where to go( on the other side of the lake)  and after a few shots of tequila we were on our way. So it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Hurray for Don Julio! \n\nWhen we found the right spot, Zoltan was our instructor and was super awesome. He mentioned that a storm might ruin some of our paddle time but we went anyways. Turns out you should check the weather before you do water sports, who knew?! \n\nSure enough as soon as we get about 15 mins out we see a huge storm in the distance and decide to go paddle back to the Mexican restaurant for lunch, as soon as we get inside and sit down it starts pouring rain. At this point we had no idea what to do since we left all our stuff\/phones\/keys ect on the other side of the lake. Luckily our bartender Omar, let us use their phone to call Zoltan, he was already on his way to the restaurant to drop our bags off. So nice of him since at this point there was a crazy thunderstorm in progress. He also said when we were done with lunch we would her a ride back to our car by some of the other marina guys. And he also said since we didn't get to use the 2 hours we could come back and use the other hour we paid for at another time. Which they normally don't do.\n\nAll in all, paddle boarding here is awesome, Zoltan is awesome and check the weather before you go. Unless you like a fun wet adventure.
