i don't know, when you walk into a place and you exchange hellos with the \"host\", then there is that awkward  silence. What am I supposed to do? Does he know what I'm here for?  I'm in his house, he should be more welcoming, especially on Christmas Night dinner. Why doesn't he ask me if I have a reservation? Or at least ask how many in our party? Well any way we finally got seated, ordered some food and a bottle of wine. Appetizers were fine, soup would've been better if the soup bowl itself was hot keeping the soup hot for longer. My wife's salad wasn't even seasoned, unfortunately there was no salt or pepper on the table to use. When the bread service came around after receiving the appetizers we were both disappointed in picking up bread that felt like it just came out of cold storage. Unfortunately it doesn't get  much better, the Sea Bass that I ordered was very dry, the fish skin was crispy black which doesn't taste very good. Too me the crispy( not burnt) skin is the best part of the fish. The vegetables were a mixed bag of yes and no. The tomatoes were hot and tasty, the potatoes were barely warm and needed some seasoning. The sauce was interesting with a nice warm spice mix. Green beans could've been hot as well. Did I eat the food? Yes, every bit of it , because I was starving and worked all freaking day, and so did my wife! No I didnt complain at all, it was Christmas, but I should've. All I wanted was a simple, relaxed meal that was just cooked properly.
