This place is horrible. It looked like it would be fun with all the arcade games and the place has 4 stars on yelp. Well honestly this place deserves half a star. There's literally one car outside. The worst part of this whole experience was Drew, the guy behind the bar. Had a \"fuck off\" face and mood and even then we decided to give it a shot. He asked for our ID's which 3 of 4 of us had. Myself and my wife are out here visiting my in laws who are above 55 years of age and though 3 of 4 had our identification, my mother in law was hassled and spoken to rudely for not having her ID\nWe chose to leave and are currently at Hammers where there is music, good vibes and friendly staff.\nSave your time, don't go here. I don't leave many bad reviews but this one deserved it.
