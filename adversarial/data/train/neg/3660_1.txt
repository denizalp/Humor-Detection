We just had a catered lunch from here for over 200 people. They set up, they served, they cleaned up. Nothing to do for us by watch our associates chow down. \n\nEach person received a chicken sandwich, bag of chips, cookie, and...a card for a free breakfast sandwich! Is that cool or what!\n\nThe group had all positive comments about the catered lunch. There's nothing I would change.
