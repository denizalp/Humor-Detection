Pullman is my favorite wine bar! I love the style of the place and the small bites food are very tasty. It's quite affordable too, if you're not too hungry. They always have nice wines by the glass to propose, wines you can't find anywhere else it seems. The only thing that bumps me is that the seem to follow some ambiguous wine trends. Orange wines..... natural wines.... It's not exactly my favorite trends. it's a good thing it's not exclusively those so everyone can find something they like.
