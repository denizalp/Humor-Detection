Nice place for a leisurely breakfast after a bike ride - ok, I realize that is a bit specific; but this place is on the north east corner of Power and McDowell which is a perfect location for anyone riding out in Usery Pass \/ Saguaro Lake area. The restaurant has a large covered patio with a north exposure for lots of shade. When we arrived, we were seated on the patio and provided with a large picture of ice water. This was quickly followed by a carafe of hot coffee. The coffee was very good. The wait staff was attentive and very  friendly. They were also very accommodating. I completely changed one of their standard omelets to kick up the spice and cut down on the fat - they accommodated me without a peep. Their prices are reasonable, service is great and location is awesome.
