I work for Wells Fargo across the street, and with a limited lunch schedule Jimmy Johns has always came through for me in clutch. I have never spent more than 3mins in the location no matter what time of day I arrived. That is a serious plus.\n\nThe subs themselves are hard to mess up, I mean really....If you have something negative to say about a sub from JJ or Subway, just make it yourself...\n\nThanks Jimmy.
