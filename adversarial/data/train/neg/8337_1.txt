If you are ever looking for a place to watch a game and everywhere you go is packed, then heres plan C. This place is never ever ever everrrrrr packed. This place is our last option when we cant find seating at other bars and pubs. I dont know why people never come here because they have at least 8 tvs and there service is not bad. \n\nOn wednesdays they have the any burger special for $7.99 excluding the super burger. Burgers are pretty darn good. They have a lot of variety such as ribs, wings, calarmi, chicken, salads and stuff. Domestic pitcher is $15.99
