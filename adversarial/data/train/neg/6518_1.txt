Ice cream is fine, but 2 major problems with this place.\n 1) Why is only 1 person working? 6 people in line and very hard for the girl to keep up. I would think this is a major safety violation. If the girl is in the store alone and she faints and hits her head, you're F'd!\n 2) The exhaust vent was 80% dirty with black debris. Gross! No way did this happen overnight, so this is complete neglect from the Management for several weeks. The vent is right over the prep area. If I decide to go back to this place and see this, I will turn around.
