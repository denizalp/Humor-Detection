Rude and dumb. The girls behind the counter had the brain wattage of two carrots rubbed together. When asked for my email address, which should be in the system--I was told that it wasn't. Silly me, I asked what address did you put in? Answer: The one you gave me. THEN even with a receipt I was harassed and asked for ID to EXCHANGE, then made to take a store credit for less than $10. Shabby treatment. WILL NEVER SHOP at this wanker location again.
