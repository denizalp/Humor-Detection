This place is still an awesome place for authentic Peruvian food.  Now that El Chullo has opened, they are feeling the competition.  I would recommend that they add a couple of items to their menu, as the previously mentioned restaurant seems to have more selection or is more varied.  Regardless, this place is not fancy at all, but the taste is awesome, highly recommended to anyone that wants to try out Peruvian food, nothing on the menu will disappoint.  The Lomo Saltado is an old favorite, the Aji de Gallina is legit, the Jalea is solid and the Ceviche is as it should be, amazing, no weird flavors.  Try anything here and you will be pleased.  The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is the atmosphere and service leave a little to be desired.  Still, go now, and enjoy!
