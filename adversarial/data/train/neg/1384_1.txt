I was looking forward to visiting this place based on the reviews.  It sounded like such a cute place with great treats and a cozy atmosphere.  I was extremely disappointed.  The staff was rude beyond belief, acted like I was an inconvenience to serve and we were the only people in the place. The food was even worse. I had the quiche and got food poisoning from it. Don't go here!!
