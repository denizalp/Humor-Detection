OMG I don't know where to start from. I was there this weekend and I am checking out tomorrow. Starting from the room- best room I have ever stayed before, ginormous and with kitchen and laundry. When I was talking to front counter staff about how great the rooms are I bumped into the General Manager- Mr Mahesh Reddy who is a really nice guy, enquired why was I in town and I told him that I was in town to propose to my gf and he asked me when was it happening. After the proposal was done and I came back to the room and found a champagne and plate full of strawberry and a card said Congratulations. This is by far the best customer service I have ever received in my life. He not only won me for the rest of the life he also won all my family, friends and my customers of my business whom I deal with on a day to day life. \nThank you very much for the best service and keep up the good work.
