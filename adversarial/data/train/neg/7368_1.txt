I`m not a fan.\n\nThe shocker: Amongst my Vaughan local friends & family, I`m probably an anomaly. \nBut seriously! As an \"out of towner\" who has access to much better sushi elsewhere, I don't see the appeal to this place.\n\nThe sushi is mediocre. Even the word 'mediocre' is an understatement in this case. \n\nDon't get me wrong - this isn't a 'one-off' for me. I've frequent their establishment more than I should have.\nYou know, those times when you're hanging out and you happen to be super starving, don't want to drive far and ubereats just won't cut it. \n\nIt's cheap, that's about it. That's the only reason why I could see people coming back. \nHowever, when it comes down to the extremely mediocre quality, terrible (TERRIBLY grumpy all.the.time.) service, sticky tables with flies everywhere, is it reaaaally worth it? Is the value really still there?\n\nLocals are well aware of the unadvertised\/unspoken 10% percent discount off your bill. I`m not referring to their take-out, cash-only deal. It exists, 10%off your AYCE lunch or dinner meal. You may get it, you may not get it. Depends on your server and how they feel, even if you ask about it.\n\nAt the end of every meal here, I`m filled with regrets of not attempting to persuade my group into paying a few dollars more and going elsewhere.\n\nTLDR; Go somewhere else. Even sushi at Nations is fresher than this.
