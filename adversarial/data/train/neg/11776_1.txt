My wife took me to Matt`s Big Breakfast on Camelback this morning. Well, as I always say \" if it starts out bad, it usually gets much worse\". Damn, I was right. First, they seated us next to where they bring the dirty dishes...really noisy and crowded with servers and dishwashers. They should move this station outside the eating area, for sure. I ordered the cheese omelet with chicken apple sausage. The waitress brought me the hog and chick. Not ever dining here, I thought that it was what I ordered. The omelet was definitely not Big, the potatoes were very salty and the chicken sausage was ok. My wife and I ate our meals and then asked for the check. Wow, it was over $37.00 for an omelet, oatmeal and a $5.95 Five Spot. When I asked the waitress, she said that the cheese was $2.00 extra and the sausage was a $4.95 upcharge. What a ripoff and not Big like the name says at all.\nThe waitress asked me to speak to the manager and at 1st, she reduced the bill by 20 cents...no typo...20 cents and she told me that it was organic and the sausage was locally obtained. Who cares! It was overpriced and not all that tasty.\nTo top off the experience, I have been sick all day since leaving the restaurant and think that I got food poisoning on top of a lousy meal. First and last time to Matt`s Big Breakfast!!
