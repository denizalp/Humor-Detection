This restaurant is in and adjoining cool hotel. Having a chat with the woman behind the front desk at the hotel who wanted to warm up her lunch in the restaurant (Tranquilo) microwave and found out they have no microwave, nor do they have any freezer, and it shows. The food here is fresh, fresh like you're in Italy. Mexican fare, under the circumstances I thought it obvious to order the mole and wow it was a taste sensation. Everything down to the exquisite taste of their tortilla chips. A real pleasure
