Year ago, I would go after class and get a litre or two of beer during winter with a friend. The beer is cold and the atmosphere is warm. This time we had the arugula flatbread'za to pair with the post-bluejays game drinking and a flight of brews and a smaller stein of beer. The amber was sweet but spice bitter hops still there, great beer. The flatbread pizza thing was flat and just enough; sundried tomatoes paired well with arugula and goatcheese. \nA guy at the bar ordered a scotch (And seemed to not be a scotch drinker) and then complained about it. That was interesting to sit at the bar. The staff were all nice. \nThe washrooms were great, but a long journey to upstairs and the opposite end of the main space. So plan ahead. Prost!
