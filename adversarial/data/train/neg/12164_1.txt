May 4, 2018 - it is very hard to get parking here since there is only about 15-20 spots maybe less. I didn't count. But we parked just a few buildings down and walked over. \n\nWhen we got in it was a bit of a wait to get a seat. The restaurant is small and cute. After about 30mins or so we got seated. We ordered the small party tray (43 pieces), Octopus Balls and ribs. \n\nWe ate everything and we were so full, everything was yummy. I will definitely go back!
