I was very happy with Carpet Monkeys! I was able to get an appointment within a few days. Rick, the owner and Patrick, his helper were great. They called 30 minutes before to let me know they were on their way. They were able to clean the whole house pretty quickly, and my carpets turned out great! No hidden charges and very reasonable prices too. I'll definitely be using them again!
