I love steaks and mine here was the second best I have ever had. I had the free ranch rib eye well done. And it was cooked perfectly. The inside looks like a Steak House should, all dark and full of wood. The service was amazing. They work in teams and are always there when you need a dink or anything else. The only downside is the sides are pretty small.
