Do not show up without an appointment! I've gone twice around opening to get a simple oil change. Both times I had to interrupt employees conversations just to get the process started. The service guy was not very knowledgable as to the brand and level that was going to be put in my vehicle. The waiting area is surrounded by large windows. So the sun is either burning your back or in your face.\n\nRecently the shift interlock latch broke on my dodge (A common problem that Chrysler refuses to fix).  I had my vehicle towed in near the close of business on a Wednesday. They did not even begin to look at it until 11am the next day. At around noon they confirmed what I already knew and finished around 2pm. \n\nThis dealer charged me 260 dollars to replace it, after the tow truck driver did half the job for them by taking the console apart! They used the same quality piece as a replacement, although their is an aftermarket alloy out there. The price of the piece itself is 15 dollars. \n\nGet service elsewhere!
