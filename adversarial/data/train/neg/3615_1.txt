I don't really have a designated nail place so I did lots of yelping and found this place. I live about 10 mins away but the reviews were good and the prices looked right. When I got there every employee was with someone but I got in a chair fairly quickly for a gel manicure. I had a guy (I did not catch his name) and he did a good job! My only regret is that the glittery color I chose is kind of sheer so I with I had done some color under it but that's not their fault. Over all the service was good and they were moving people through well but not in a rude way! And $25 for a gel manicure is a great price! I will definitely be returning. \n\nIf I had to knock this place on something I would say the music was a little weird\/silly but what nail salon doesn't have some strange ballad cover playlist going haha!
