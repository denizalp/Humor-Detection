I recently moved to the area and found this place on Yelp. \nThe place is nice... in a good location. The lady i spoke to on the phone was very nice and accommodating, I wanted to see if I could drop in and get a mani pedi.\nA really awesome girl named Amy did my mani and pedi. \nI haven't had a pedi in a MINUTE and my feet were a hot mess. She hooked them up.. \nShe was really easy to talk to and was really nice and did A KICK ASS job. \nI love this place and will be back. :)
