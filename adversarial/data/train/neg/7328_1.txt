One of the best airport dining experiences I have hasd.  The only bad thing is that it is too easy to forget that you are in an airport, and thus loose track of time.  The restaurant is set back from the hub bub of the main airport traffic, and the seating is comfy, and the d√©cor is beautiful.  Plus, under the bar are electric outlets for you to power up your electronic devices while you wait.  The staff were friendly, and the server waiting on us at the bar was very knowledgeable.  The grilled vegetable open faced sandwich was incredible, and the bread was tasty.  The truffles were OK, nothing like Switzerland, but pretty good.  The local port was tasty.  They had a great wine selection, and even had some nice tasting flights of 3 glasses to choose from.  A highlight of the Charlotte Airport.
