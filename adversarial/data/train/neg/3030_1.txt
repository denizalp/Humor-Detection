Storefront looks so authentically Chinese on the all American Mayfield strip. Easy parking right out on front. I got the general tso chicken, which was a decent sized portion, unfortunately way too salty for my liking though. Seemed like a voluminous menu, wouldn't mind coming back to try something else.
