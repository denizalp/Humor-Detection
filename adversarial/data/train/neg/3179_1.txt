Love the Joint! It has an innovative business model by providing affordable chiropractic care without having to deal with the hassle of insurance. I rarely have to wait more than a few minutes to be seen (as it is walk-in only it is first come first served). Dr. Mandy is excellent at what she does. I always walk out feeling so much better. I highly recommend stopping in for a consultation if you have chronic back\/neck pain.
