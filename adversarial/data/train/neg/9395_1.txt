I'm not a huge fan of the food itself after trying it, but I can't deny that the ingredients are fresh, the service is excellent and it's definitely and interesting dining experience! This location is at the food court in Square One so usually it's crazy busy. Still, the line moves quickly and the servers are crazy efficient.
