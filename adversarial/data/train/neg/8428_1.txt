My favorite nail salon by far!!! Just moved to the area and decided to give this place a try! I had Amy and she was so so so nice and did a GREAT job on my gel mani and pedi!! Got an eye brow wax too and it too was great! They massage your legs with hot stones which was such a relaxing bonus I wasn't used to...and I only got the standard pedicure!! Very clean and nicely decorated salon and they do not rush... They focus on you and make you feel special! I will be back. :) oh and their prices are great!
