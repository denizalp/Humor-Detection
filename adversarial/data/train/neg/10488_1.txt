Took the vip west  rim tour. It was awesome! Shawn picked us up at our hotel and there were only 3 other people on the tour.  Shawn told us all about the area and lots of fun facts.  We were never rushed and everything was just chill and fun.  At the canyon Shawn told us what we needed to know,  gave us tickets for our lunches (which were really good!) and the bus and gave us lots of time to wander around to the different spots.  On the way back he stopped to show us the Joshua trees and take more pictures (we had him take LOTS of pictures of us). I would recommend this tour to anyone! Great time!
