[Good]\nFlavours - What makes this place good is the flavour of the broth.  It's always robust and tasty no matter what choice.\n\nIngredients - Not too bad when it comes to portion size and the amount of stuff that comes with the ramen.  Whether it's tenderous rib or BBQ pork, I don't feel like they skimp.\n\nMenu - Small, focused menu leads to better quality.\n\n[Bad]\nPrices - I used to come here a lot because it offered a tasty bowl at great value but it seems prices have gone up along with all the other ramen places.\n\nSlow - Literally just a mom and pop shop.  The wife serves and the husband cooks in the back.  Although a small restaurant, sometimes the food comes out slowly, especially when ordering yaki soba.\n\n[Worth it?]\nOn this latest visit, it didn't feel like old times and I didn't find myself enjoying it as much as before.  Maybe with the higher price I set a higher standard or maybe other places have stepped up their game since then.\n\nIn previous years it would be a no brainer value winner.  Now that prices have gone up, I'm not sure $15 for a bowl is considered value anymore.  Still, if you haven't been here before, it's worth at least a try.  If you have been here before, then you already know that you will at least have a decently enjoyable meal.
