I have been here several times this year and recently got a haircut and color.  You must meet *Nicole* for she cuts hair so professionally with time and care  . When it comes to color,  she presents the best realistic options for you.  For example ~  my color was brassy and I wanted  a rosy shade but the color didn't take. I was able to get it redone with color that would work on my stubborn head. It was so great she let me come back so we could get it right ! I'm very happy overall every time I come , but this time was exceptional !
