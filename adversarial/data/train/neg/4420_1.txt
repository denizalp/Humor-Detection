Great food friendly prompt service. We got there at 8 a.m. on a Sunday if you're going to go, go early the place packed out so be prepared to wait if you're not an early bird definitely going again and again and again. The omelets are delicious they are baked so they're more on the healthy side and the pancakes are to die for. You can eat and eat and eat and not feel like a stuffed cow afterwards :-)
