I have been two times now for four different services.\n\nAll services were beyond fantastic!!  Today blew the doors off all nail experiences for sure.\nMinday did my nails and Lee did my pedicure and repaired an acrylic broken toe nail.\n\nTrue doctors these people are.\n\nMy first visit I saw Victor for gel manicure, and that experience was what made me come back.\n\nLina  waxed my eyebrows beautifully.\n\nThank you, I found my new place.
