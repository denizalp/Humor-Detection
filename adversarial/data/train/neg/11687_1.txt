We ordered the sashimi mix, the beef tataki and a few maki, loved the Blue Ocean (which was scallop I think?). Everything was for sure delicious, esp the beef tataki! However everything took a super long time to arrive, we actually cancelled our last dish because it had been more than 1 1\/2 hr since ordering and we had to go somewhere after. I'm only docking a star since it was the first day open after they were closed for renovations on a Tuesday, and way more full than typical. They probably weren't expecting a full house, so would be willing to try again and see if it was a one off.
