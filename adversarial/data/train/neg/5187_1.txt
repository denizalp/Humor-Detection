This was my favorite meat pie place until tonight. The buttery crust is flaky and delicious as always however, the filling was extremely disappointing. I ordered the butter chicken and there was absolutely no chicken in the filling. Not sure what happened here. But will now try to find a new favorite pie place. Fries are also hit and miss. Sometimes they are fantastic and other time soggy.
