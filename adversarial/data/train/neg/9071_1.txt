I went in to buy some foundation and few other things. There was not one single person that was friendly or truly helpful. In fact they had a terrible attitude and were very rude. I asked for their ad and the girl was so rude about it. I've been here twice and not once did I feel welcomed. The brush sections was a disaster I couldn't find what i was looking for. I use to shop at the camelback location and it's completely a different store I will take my business back to them. This store is disappointing.
