Spoon is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. We have been three times and it is always delightful!  I usually try to stay away from the bread basket to save room for my meal, but you can not miss the wonderful assortment they have to offer.  The cocktail menu is fun and unique, as well.  \nThe first time we went we each had an appetizer and entree, which were amazing.  Standouts would be the gorgonzola blue cheese souffle and the miso glazed fish.\nThe second time it was Valentine's Day with a pre-fixed menu. Usually, I am a bit disappointed with this option, but everything was amazing!\nMost recently, we went for just drinks and appetizers.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  If you are looking for a consistently delicious meal with an upscale feel yet still laid back and comfortable, you can't go wrong with Spoon!  We hope to return soon!
