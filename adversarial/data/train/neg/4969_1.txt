I thought it was high time to affirm our five-star rating. We just lost a cat after a long illness, and Dr Reveley and his staff could not have treated him and us better. He thoroughly answered every ridiculous question we threw at him, and they were always able to see our cat quickly when something was amiss. I couldn't imagine a better place to take my furry creatures.
