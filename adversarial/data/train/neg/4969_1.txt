These wonderful people cleaned the rental I just moved out of. It was sparkling from ceiling to floor in every room! The two ladies were there right at the agreed time and were ready to go to work. They were friendly, courteous and were very professional. I am in the process of buying a house and plan to use them to come in a couple times a month to keep it clean. I would definitely recommend these folks to anyone who is looking for REAL house cleaners at comparable rates to other companies in the area.
