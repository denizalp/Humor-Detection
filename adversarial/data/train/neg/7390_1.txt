My first time at the USO here in Phoenix and overall it was great... Friendly staff, large lockers, stocked kitchen and free snacks and drinks everywhere. Nice computer kiosks and lots of seating areas. Only things lacking are toilets\/showers and sleeping areas. And if you have late flight sadly they do close at 2000 although there was a sign that said they could potentially accommodate an overnight stay for those I guess who have early flights and no place to stay. \n\nWill definitely use this USO lounge again if I'm ever in the Phoenix area.
