We took our 5 kids (yes 5, crazy I know) to eat spur of the moment. When we arrived we were greeted by a nice hostess and an amazing ballon guy!  When we were seated The waitress informed us that kids eat for .99 on Tuesday and I thought I had heard her wrong. She said no that's correct. I up front apologized for anything bad our kids may do and Laura our AMAZING waitress smiled and said no worries everything will be fine and not to worry. Just as she said the night was worry free and Laura made us feel welcome like the balloon guy did. The attention we were given tonight reminds me the power of GREAT customer service with a smile and we WILL dine at this location again. I only hope that our monitory gifts showed them how much we appreciate them doing their jobs with a smile.
