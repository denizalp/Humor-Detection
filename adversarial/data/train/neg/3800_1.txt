These guys were great in helping me out with a new MTB build. I usually go to a shop closer to home but these guys were the closest Santa Cruz dealers. I never been in the shop before but I've heard good things from a number of friends so I decided to stop by. I was impressed by their selection and floor stock of a lot of higher end items. Steve was great in helping me customize my new bike and even better was able to turn the bike around as all the parts were in stock within a day. These guys stayed late so that I can get my bike for a ride the next morning in Sedona. \n\nFor those who have commented that nobody made the time to greet them. I've been to a lot of bike shops over the years and it seems that customer service in general is on the lowest rung of the totem pole. I think in general bike shops are just busy trying to get stuff done. Don't be afraid to go interrupt and ask somebody for some help.\n\nLove the bike and the shop!
