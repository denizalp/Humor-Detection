This was an aggravating experience and we never stepped foot into an office. Because no one will answer the phone or respond when you leave a voicemail, I had to conduct all scheduling and communication via email and their web portal - which doesn't work correctly. I also lost hours of my life filling out the assessments and intake forms online for my two sons. Could not get an appointment scheduled sooner than a month later. \nThe only time I receive a phone call was from a scheduler to inform me that the day I had scheduled for my sons' intakes was \"no longer available\". The girl that called was unresponsive, cold, and without care of what goes into common courtesy. \nI called back and spoke to a much nicer individual who shared that within the entire practice- between five locations - there is only one medication provider for adolescents. One! And he's decided he only wants to work three days a week. \nWorking in community behavioral health myself, I understand the frustrations of staffing issues. However, the website of this business implies a large staff ready and willing to help children. But that isn't actually what's happening.
