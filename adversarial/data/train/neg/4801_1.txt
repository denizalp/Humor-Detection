I went to Birks three years ago to buy a woman,s watch as a Christmas gift. Willing to spend $300.00 dollars, I was horrified when the sales person said to me: \" I don't have time, because the next person that walks through that door will spend over $1000.000.\" Those were his exact words. As a result, I came home and made an attempt to phone their head office; as it turns out Birks Head office is in Florida, as Birks is actually a subsidiary of an American company. None the less, it took me over two hours to contact someone at their office in Florida; and when I finally contacted someone, I must say they were very sorry and sympathetic, and said they would be in contact with the Birks store on Bay street. And five O clock that same night, the manager from the store contacted me, and took action giving me a 100.00 discount. When I went back, I got dirty looks from this same person and the others that worked there. And although, I do appreciate the action taken by the head office in Florida and the manager, this should have never happened. It is disgusting, that a store could ever behave in such a way. I will never visit this deplorable store again. If you want my opinion, stay away from this store, as they are ill mannered and rude.  I wouldn't even give this store one star.
