I am never coming back.\n\n1. The first time I came in I asked for guacamole. The server brought us the chips and I asked my server if we can have salsa. She figured I was asking about the guac but she turned around and literally yelled that she is getting the guac. She later went to get a different server.\n\n2. I decided to give it a second try. I asked for a vodka soda and she NEVER asked for what type of vodka. When I later checked I saw they charged me for titos.\n\nNever coming back. Still have not had a good experience
