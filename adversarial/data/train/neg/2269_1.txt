I recently had a weekend trip to Cleveland, and was looking forward to check out one of the newest aquariums in the country. Working in a zoo, I probably tend to be more critical than most of the visitor experience at such a facility, but I really believe this place is not ready to be open to the public. Between near-empty tanks and extremely poor signage and exhibit design, the aquarium is simply not ready.\n\nBeing from out of town it was really difficult to find this place as there are no street signs directing visitors to the parking lot for the aquarium. Moreover, most zoos have more extensive aquaria than Cleveland's and charge much less. They do not even have discounts or reciprocity for zoo or aquarium members of other institutions. \n\nI understand that it's a labor of love (and LOTS of time) to build a collection and grow coral, but the institution is only hurting it's reputation with what it displays currently. I would not recommend this as a tourist destination. I would also strongly encourage the aquarium management to invest in some street signs and a larger sign for the building in which it is housed.
