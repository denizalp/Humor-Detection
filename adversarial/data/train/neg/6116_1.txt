WORST EVER! \n\nI JOINED YELP FOR THIS ONE AND ONLY REVIEW! \n\nZERO STARS! You're lucky my finger accidentally hit a star. \n\nThe Dr is money hungry, and he'll add stuff to your bill that you didn't consent for. \n\nHad a temp crown put on, and was given specific directions that the office was closed Fri-Mon. If the temp fell off during that time frame, buy over the counter glue and reattach. Well, that happened, twice actually. $1300 cash and then addition $47 to reattach. \n\nI was told that this incident was my fault because i didn't purchase HIS mouth guard over a cheaply guard from drug store. \n\nThe Dr then got on my case that I should have called his personal number, even though it was never given out. \n\nHe then would call every 2 weeks at 6am on my payment days, claiming he's with his accountant, to make sure my auto payment was accepted. \n\nHe has this  great speech first visit that he runs his business with trust and honesty. \n\nSome staff was friendly and nice, but the older heavy weight female assistant is rude and makes you feel like a bother and you're wasting her time.
