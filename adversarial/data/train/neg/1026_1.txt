Food was great, barg and chenge were cooked properly and we loved their kashko bademjun. Very pricey but who cares when you get really good service and food. Prefer to pay more and get a good service and quality food instead of pay less and get bad food and service! Thanks guys for the great food and service would come back again for sure!! Oh also koobide was great too!
