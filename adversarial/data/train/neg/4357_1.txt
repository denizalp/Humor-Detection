Everyday Noodles has a stellar menu of noodle goodness. They make their flour noodles in the restaurant which is a great authentic touch. The pork soup dumplings are out of this world and I highly recommend them. Little dough pouches filled with savory broth and pork. It's best eating them with the provided spoon. Poke a little hole in the dumpling to allow some broth to spill into the spoon and slurp it up! I ordered the beef noodle soup and it was a HUGE portion! Tender chunks of beef, a deep and flavorful broth, a chunk of bok choy and plenty of noodles. I had plenty leftover for lunch the next day. I also tried the Dan Da noodles which were spicy and peanuty and an equally large serving size. The cold sesame noodles were refreshing, light and also had a peanuty flavor. They also made for easy leftover since they didn't require any reheating. If you love noodles, you'll LOVE Everyday Noodles!
