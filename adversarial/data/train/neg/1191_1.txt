Worst food try in a long time. Overpriced food that will likely leave you regretting your choice. I ordered the mojito chicken which was disgusting and no chicken to be found. Aguas frescas sign at counter but none available. Moms special was bland and soggy. One person working at 2pm and no customers inside. On its last leg..
