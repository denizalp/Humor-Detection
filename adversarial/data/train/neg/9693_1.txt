My favourite go to local Mexican restaurant. Great food and friendly attentive staff. Also as an aside, I lost my wallet Thursday night biking home along Dupont and didn't realize it until Friday morning. Was stressed and upset not worried about cash but having to replace all my cards, etc. Then got an Instagram msg from one of their lovely staff, Rivannah, saying she found it on Dupont. It was returned to me as I'd lost it. With cash and all. Restored my faith in humanity :). Thank you and see you soon for tacos
