Decent burger place. Better than McDonalds. \n\nThe person working drive through was knowledgeable of the menu items and very polite. It did take a longer time then optimal to get our food with this being fast food.\n\nInteresting menu, the Chorizo Dog was spicy but really good. Onion Rings were pretty stellar. The chicken nuggets weren't bad either.\n\nThis is definitely a place I would like to see grow and adapt their menu items. I hope they get the chance.\nI will return and support a local business.
