I recently moved away from Pittsburgh and am really missing Eikon! Very friendly staff, really cute salon, but Dane is the reason was my salon for so long. As a blonde I have to say I am very picky about my color. Dane never left me with color or a cut that I wasn't in love with. Easy conversation and the best scalp massages and washes you could imagine (seriously- maybe he knows reflexology?). Love him! My trips home will be extended so I can get my hair done!
