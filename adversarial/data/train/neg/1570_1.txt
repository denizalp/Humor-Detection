This burger joint definitely gets an A for atmosphere and decor. The first thing I noticed was how lively the setting was. A little loud to converse but a nice place to hang and watch the game. Our server was fast and efficient, she got our orders and served it up with very little wait time. The TVs grabbed our attentions as the ball game kept us entertained. I was, however, quite disappointed with the food. Admittedly, the prices were reasonable and the choices were vast with so many ways of customizing your own burgers. The alcohol selection was also very extensive, ranging from tap to cocktail mixes. When it came to their specialty, I felt that the burgers fell short of what to be expected. The fries were less than stellar; both the regular thin cut and sweet potato fries were limp and a bit soggy - noticeably unevenly cooked. When it came to the burger, we ordered the bison burger and beef Burger. They came out looking great, the patties seemed to be at a nice thickness that would diminish some chance of overcooking. It was with the first bites that the flaws presented itself. The flaws were too major to ignore. Both patties had little to no seasoning, the only taste was lent from the sauces of choice...which, when you have a thick patty can leave an overwhelming bland taste of meat that off putting. I feel strongly that a well seasoned burger helps to keep the meat moist and juicy too. The burgers were both quite dry and overcooked. The bison burger especially was rubbery, dried and bland. With each chew, the meat just got tougher with what seemed like a lot of connective tissue. The beef burger was slightly better but not by much. I would return to this place for their alcohol selections and for the fun atmosphere but nothing about the burgers left a lasting impression. Check it out if there's nothing better you prefer or just want to hang with friends.
