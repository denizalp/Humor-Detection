This is my second time staying at the Grandview at Las Vegas while in town for CES. This is a timeshare property located off of the strip and directly across from the South Point Casino. Both times I've stayed in a one bedroom with pullout couch. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The kitchen provides the comforts of home, full refrigerator, dishwasher, all dishes and flatware and most anything you can think of. The complimentary coffee is surprisingly good. There is also a full sized stackable washer and dryer. The best features of the room are the jacuzzi tub and blackout curtains. This is a good option for families as you can book larger rooms sleeping more as well as adjoining rooms. It also works for those traveling to Vegas looking for an affordable option with a short drive to the strip. Upon check in the Grandview generously gives you a coupon book with discounts on many activities and attractions with most offered at South Point Casino which is located next door. There are coupons for free margaritas at Baja Miguel's at South Point which we took advantage of and the food was good. This coming from a SoCal local who loves Mexican food and can be picky about it if it's not on par with what we're used to. All in all another comfortable and enjoyable stay for a place to relax and unwind during the excitement of CES.
