I love Owen's. I have been going here for 6 years. The steamed bagels are among the best bagel sandwiches in Charlotte. Perfect for brunch or lunch. The staff are very friendly. Located in the pavilion, parking can be tricky. I usually park on the street behind the pavilion. Drink, chips and sandwich will run you $8 or $9. I usually stick with the Paul Ruben.
