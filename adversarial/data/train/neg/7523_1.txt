I've eaten at Roy's in several different locations (New York, Philadelphia, Hawai'i) and I pretty much know what to expect and I had high expectations since the other locations were always very good.\n\nThis location did not disappoint but I do have one major complaint.\n\nThe service was good.  The hostess that greeted us was friendly, but one of the waiters was hanging out around the hostess stand flirting with them and quite frankly was annoying them and me.  Our waitress was friendly and efficient (she was not the red headed monster as some reviewers previously described).\n\nThe food was typical Roy's - very good.  I had the butterfish (of course) and it was excellent.  The portion was a bit small however and left me wanting more.  My wife's scallops were good, but she was a bit disappointment with them - a tad bit too overcooked.\n\nWe sat outside and it was perfect weather.  The lighting was very poor but they did give us little flashlights to read the menu by.\n\nThe major complaint I have is that this location is overpriced.  While I understand that you are paying a premium because of the \"Roy's\" name, I found the pricing way out of line for a restaurant in Phoenix.  The pricing was more in line with a New York or San Francisco.  Not cool and I would not go back to this location for this reason. \n\nI'd give it 3 1\/2 Stars if I could. \n\nThe Marriott Hotel that the restaurant is inside is stunning by the way.  I definitely recommend staying there.
