This restaurant, although I'm sure holds sentimental value in the community in a capacity I'm not familiar with, doesn't meet any reasonable expectation for Italian cuisine.  Unfortunately for this establishment, sentiment isn't a condiment.  \n\nThe pasta I had did not look appetizing at all, and tasted what it looked like. \n\nI requested black pepper from the waitress, and she had no idea what I could possibly be talking about. This was the most sensational moment of my meal.\n\nMy table wobbled.\n\nUnreasonably priced all around.\n\nParking lot needs better lighting.\n\nI found the bartender to be slightly pretentious with no self awareness. \n\nIf you find yourself in dire need of Italian food in the Cleveland area, stay on 90 and go to Little Italy.
