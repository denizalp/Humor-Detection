Journey to a trendy Italian-style Manhattan Bistro while visiting Vegas!\n\nBeautiful decor and ambiance.  Never felt so pampered at a restaurant before!\n\nThe service was attentive without being overbearing.  The waiters took care of us without ever interrupting conversations and only made themselves known when we needed them.   Before I even had a chance to put my purse down they set a GIANT hunk of cheese in front of me and started carving it out.  They also brought out salomi and delicious crusty bread.  All complimentary of course!  \n\nThe appetizers and main courses were delicious and we finished every bite!  The cocktails were well portioned and you didn't feel like your martini wasn't stiff enough.  \n\nThey even brought out an after dinner drink - Digest-if to round out meal. Not sure what the check looked like (it is Vegas afterall!) but I'm sure it was worth every penny!  Will definitely be back to this place!
