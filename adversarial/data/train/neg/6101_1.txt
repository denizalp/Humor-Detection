So I wasn't quite sure what to expect from a \"hot dog\" place but I was actually pleasantly surprised. The ordering process was very simple and straight forward. Many options for trimmings but not a lot of options outside of that. \n\nThe all beef dog was delicious. I ordered it without a bun, pretty flexible in that regard. The veggie dog that I tried was pretty tasty as well. I would have given this place a 5 if it had more options beyond a hot dog and hot dog trimmings. But for what it is, it's a pretty cool spot and a nice place to grab a bite or two. \n\nCheck it out!
