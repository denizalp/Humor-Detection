I'm not a vegetarian.  In fact, I often tell people that I'm a MEATetarian (because carnivore isn't a fun word) .   However, I am open to interesting cuisines of all types... so my wife and I went to Fern a few weeks ago to see what it was all about.\n\nThe ambiance was great; really cute decor, and plants hanging everywhere.  The staff was super-friendly... everything felt quaint and cozy.\n\nWe each got a juice to start with.  I got something red which was a bit too sweet, and my wife got something green which tasted like a freshly mowed lawn smells.   I drank quite a lot of hers, mostly out of sheer amazement that it wasn't killing me.\n\nThe cuisine was all really imaginative and well executed.   This was easily the most creative restaurant we've been to in Charlotte.  \n\nWe'll definitely be going back.
