I ran to the DMV Friday only to be greeted with a REALLY long line. After checking in online, I knew I had time to waste and wanted to get something to eat. After a quick yelp search, I came across Norm's which also offered free wifi so I headed on over. \n\nI walked in and was quickly greeted with a smiling face. I sat down and started looking at the menu while the server got me coffee and water. I ordered and realized my computer was dead. They quickly and happily helped me move over the the bar\/counter and get set up. Shortly my order arrived and it was just what the doctor ordered. The food was great without being greasy. The eggs were cooked perfectly. The coffee was good and the service was friendly. \n\nI don't typically walk away from breakfast places thinking I should come back more often, but I definitely will swing by here next time I'm looking for a morning meal or maybe even lunch. I even must note the owner (or I assume that's who he was) was super friendly as well. I totally recommend this place.
