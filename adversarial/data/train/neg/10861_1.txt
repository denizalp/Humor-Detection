seems to be family run business a little while off the main strip. owners (I believe?) were very giving; we witnessed them giving a homeless lady some food and cash, they refilled our banchan a few times, and packed some extra for us with our take-out order. we ordered 4 dishes: saimin, chicken curry and spam\/eggs and rice and loco moco, total $57 w tax and tip. $2 more for brown rice. portions were ok for the price, $11-$13 per plate. taste was good and hit the spot for my hubby, kids and myself.
