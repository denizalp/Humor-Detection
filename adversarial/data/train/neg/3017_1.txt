I am a loyal  customer to the marshalls chain . This store was up to my standards and beyond !\n  Came here with grandma to do some last minute Christmas shopping . They had a full stock of everything you could possibly want to give someone as a gift. I love Marshall's  because there items are inexpensive but high quality . \n Customer service here was awesome . The store was filled with crazy Christmas shoppers but the Marshall's store associates kept there cool and even kept there smiles . Having great customer service means so much to me for a wonderful experience so I thank you for not letting me down !\n Overall , if you're looking for a great place to shop for yourself or anyone else this Marshalls is the hotspot !
