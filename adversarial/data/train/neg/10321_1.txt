I wrote a review in the past and it has been removed!!!!!!!!!!!! Corporate greed?????? Anyway, these people are okay ,but if you get Dr Rich, your dog might be in pain for three weeks and if you complain on the internet about this, you might not be allowed to talk to the doctor and you might have to have your consultation in the waiting room!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You will be treated differently if you complain on here. Plus, I tried to call about it, never heard back. I told the receptionist about it and she said there was a problem with him and he was gone. Our last appt there, he was the doctor!!!!!!!!!!!!! I did not say anything. I just am never going back.
