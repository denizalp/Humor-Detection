I am new to working in the Corktown area so my first priority was to find a good bakery nearby. I remembered reading about the banana eclair in The Star so yesterday, being my parent's anniversary, I popped in to buy some desserts. WOW. The girl who greeted me was lovely, and I can only say that the pastries were out of this world. I got the chocolate one, the turtle one, and the eclair. My entire family was obsessed. Well worth the price of everything. I am going back soon!
