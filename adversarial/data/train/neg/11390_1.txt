Excellent!!  A very casual setting that belies how amazing the food is!  My husband is Argentinian and he was so so very happy we found this place!  They sell these crackers that he used to eat as a child in Argentina.  And he swore by their desserts.  He was convinced that there's a little Argentinian grandmother in the back making the desserts.  He said their flan is 100% authentic Argentinian, not the typical flan we get over here in the States.\n\nI had the seafood plate, which I swear, except for the fact that there was no fish, it was the best cioppino I've ever had, which I've had at several restaurants at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  This was sooo much better.  The husband had the \"choripan\" which he raved about.\n\nWe stopped off on our way back to L.A. to pick up more desserts and pastries.  Yep, they're that good!
