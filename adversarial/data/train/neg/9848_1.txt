Not your typical Cirque show.\n\nI've seen Corteo, Ka, Totem, Kooza, Quidam, and Alegria.\n\nWhile this show is more about bringing the Beatles music to life (and amping it up with awesome remixes), this is super sensory overload!  There is so much to look at while everyone is dancing around in amazing costumes and revolving sets that come out of nowhere and everywhere.  Kudos to the mechanical engineers and backstage\/understage peeps making it all happen seamlessly.  While it's fun and energetic, I felt a bit overwhelmed at times.\n\nMy favorite bits were the quiet ones where there was a focus on performers and acrobatics (what Cirque is known for)... and didn't lovelovelove everything else.  I wish there was more clowning, too.\n\nThe show seemed short and I wanted more acrobatics.  The show had some serious undertones as well (love in general does have serious moments, I suppose), which weren't \"fun\" to watch but still lovely.\n\nThe music is amazing!  I love the Beatles and love how they've made the music extra special.  Tip - get the CD with cash from one of the many standalone vendors outside the store rather than fighting the crowds after the show.\n\nWorth a watch, but I wouldn't see it again.  There is no set story like Ka, and the lack of acrobatic feats was disappointing.  Come for the music, especially if you're a fan of the Beatles.
