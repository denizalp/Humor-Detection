I have had nothing but amazing experiences here at Graceland! I have taken my car here many times and honestly it is the only shop I will trust in the Pittsburgh area. The guys that work there are honest and direct, there is not beating around the bush to find the problem. Also they are quick, I have my car back ASAP and looking like new!
