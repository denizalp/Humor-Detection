We had a major water leak\/flood happening in our home. We called a handful of \"emergency\" plumbers. None of which treated our emergency as such. \n\nUNTIL we reached Robert Grimm from Scottsdale Plumbing! \n\nRobert told us how to turn off the main water line  which stopped the flooding (the other plumbing businesses had customer service people, not plumbers answering calls--even after we explained water was shooting out of the pipe, no plumber called back to explained how to stop the water).\n\nRobert was able to come out 30 minutes later to assess and come up with a plan to fix it all.\n\nRobert was honest, thorough and kind.  We highly recommend!
