Went in for a laser hair removal consultation with Prabhjot Gill. She was extremely informative and genuinely cared about my concerns. Asked appropriate and relevant questions about myself and gave professional feedback to my own questions. Their pricing for laser hair removal services is generous and even offered a 3-for-2 deal (buy 2 get 1 free)!\nTheir technology (Cutera Glide) works!!!! I'm moderate brown toned and my hair is thick, but this technology works wonders, even just after the first treatment!\n\nInvest your time and money with this clinic, they are great and worth it!
