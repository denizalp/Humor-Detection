I'll give Party City credit.  I had an issue - a big issue - with them.  I regrouped and went back to the store a couple days later to try my return again, hoping to get a different manager.  Nope.  But, I calmly explained my situation and we agreed on store credit.  I'm happy they took care of me, but would have preferred we got it right the first time.  Maybe that manager was having a bad day, or didn't want to deal with me on a busy day.  But I'm good now.\n\nI don't want to dislike this store.  They have plenty of supplied that meet many needs - i would hate to have to boycott such a valuable resource.  For now, they are on probation with me.  Be cautious - know the policies and ask questions if you think you may need to return something.  They might not give you all the details without asking.\n\nAlso, FYI, their Twitter account was responsive to complaints.  They had replied to me, but after my return was handled.  I don't think they played a part in it, but I appreciated their concern.
