Dude I cannot tell you how awesome Nicki is!!! My husband loves the German Chocolate so I come in here at least once a week to get half a dozen. After meeting me once, Nicki knew what I wanted! She looked at me and asked German Chocolate for the husband? This last time I was sad that there was only one left, but Nicki hooked me up and made me my order! Hurts Donut! Thank you for your awesome donuts but even more, thank you for Nicki!
