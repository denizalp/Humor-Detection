The Pinball Hall of Fame right outside the Las Vegas Strip is a great place to visit and relive some of the pinball glory days.\n\nThe establishment itself looks a tad run down but what's inside is what matters. Upon entering the building you'll find all sorts of pinball machines from every era imaginable. I'm still a kid at heart and enjoy gaming so this was a great place to make a stop.\n\nThere's notes on many of the pinball machines, dating them, explaining a bit about their history, and when they were reconditioned. \n\nAlas there were a number of machines that were no longer in operation (which accounts for the -1 star) but other than that, it's a great way to spend a couple hours (or a day) in Las Vegas.
