Food was mediocre at best. The customer service other than our waiter was sub par. We ordered a high end bottle of red wine which should have been served at room temperature. It was cold when it came out. Wanted to speak to the manager who came out after waiting for 15-20 minutes and defensive. Will not be back and will not recommend to anyone other than to take their money elsewhere.
