Will and the rest of his staff were GREAT! He spent about 45 minutes when I first was considering a bike.  Without being pushy, he even made me aware of a recall on a specific crank. \n\nOnce we purchased my bike, he spent another 45 minutes going over the bike features, and since my wife was new to MTB- ensured all of her questions were answered.  This resulted in some gear purchases that we hadn't even considered.   \n\nSpirited has definitely gained a customer for life!!
