Couple deep tissue massage with my boyfriend!! Complementary shuttle ride to the place and hotel. Make sure you tip the driver both ways! Our driver was Jenn. She picked us up right on time. This place isn't fancy with all the frills like inside a hotel spa. It has a nice vegas decor. Pictures of Elvis, Barbara Streisand, Beatles, etc. They have complimentary little 8oz bottles of water, tea, coffee, and fruits as snacks at the waiting room. Use the restroom before you get started!  I got Douglas & my bf got Brenda as our massusers. First, the massusers introduce themselves and ask a few questions. They says to undress completely and go under the covers. You will be draped with double aheets throughout the service. The massage beds were heated nice and warm inside a chilled room. I was worried because Douglas had hairy arms (another yelper complained about hairy arms) but it didn't bother me at all. I think Douglas used a unscented lotion. Which was great because I am sensitive to weird smelling lotions. My bf had shea buttter. Douglas started off nice touches and started to hit all my pressure points. He did my shoulder and back really well. Head to toes. No facial (thats separate) I do feel much better. A little sore but a good kind of sore. My bf says it was okay. At the end of our session they waited outside until we got dressed. They were waiting with a cup of water. Then we paid and asked for a receipt. And they don't give out receipt. Oh wells no biggie. Then our shuttle took us back to the hotel. Now I'm soft, smooth, and less sore! Happy!
