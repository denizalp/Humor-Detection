Food quality was decent (fries were the shoe string type so it felt like a lot of work to eat but they tasted good). Selection as expected at an airport location. Only things that took away from me he experience was the lack of understanding that people are in a rush obviously to catch flights. So when people ask for their check have a sense of urgency. And then the up-sell by the servers was a bit excessive. I completely understand add-one and increasing average ticket. But every single thing anyone ordered was followed with an additional purchase suggestion. Customer: \"Coffee\" server: \"with Bailey's?\" Customer: \"just the check\" server: \"sure you wouldn't like another beer?\" (Not exaggerated)
