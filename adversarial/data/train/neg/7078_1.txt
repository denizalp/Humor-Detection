Worst sushi I've ever had. I got it to go, otherwise I would have sent it back. The wasabi smelled strange and the Vegas roll was mushy, cold, and stale. I only ate a couple pieces and threw the rest away. I had another roll that was supposed to have spicy tuna and tempura. It was also mushy and there was nothing spicy about. I smelled a piece and it smelled straight up funky. I love sushi but this stuff turned my stomach.
