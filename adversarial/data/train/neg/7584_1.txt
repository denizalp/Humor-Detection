I want to LOVE this place but I can't quite give it a full five stars. If it were based on concept, they'd get it hands down all day but each time I've eaten here there's been a semi-serious issue such as noodles completely floating in sauce that kinda ruins it for me. However, the food does have awesome flavor, and the whole dtlv hipster vibe is unique and intriguing. With as much attention to detail with the food as has been applied to the details of the business itself, I really think they'd be golden.
