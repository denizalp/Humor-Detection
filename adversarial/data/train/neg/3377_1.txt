Really enjoyed our experience at The Yolk. I had the egg white omelet with TN Fries. Both items spiced and cooked perfectly. My wife had a more traditional breakfast with bacon, eggs, toast and fries. She requested items to be cooked a certain way, and they delivered. Service was Fantastic! Definitely going back soon.
