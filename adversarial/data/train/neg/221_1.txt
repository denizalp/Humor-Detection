The worst urgent care I have been time. Wait time is 3 hours, the providers cannot handle the small patient load they have and it shows how incompetent the staff and providers are. Thank god these people are not working in hospitals, where they have to handle big cases coz if they cannot handle small patient population with very minor cases how they gonna treat patients in a hospital. Now this place is called health care partners Nevada, do not go there!
