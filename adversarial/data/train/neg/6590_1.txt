Fresh is alright but I find their cuisine to be gimmicky and uncreative. It's kind of like the vegetarian restaurant in the imagination of a rabid meat eater. A lot of focus on whole wheat, smoothies, dubious health claims, meat substitutes, bland tasting greens. Less of a focus on great tasting cuisine. Vegetarianism doesn't have to be this gimmicky. That being it fills a niche in the city for a fast casual vegetarian chain and I appreciate its existence.\n\nI found the service at this location very good and attentive. The interior is well designed and comfortable.
