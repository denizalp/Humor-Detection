Katherine our sales woman met me at the door and first thing offered me something to drink or coffee!  She was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in my search for new furniture.  She learned my tastes very quickly and really understood what I was trying to accomplish.  She was attentive but not overbearing and seemed to be around just when I had a question.  She was very familiar with the brands that are sold here and other options available.  I am happy to say I could buy and probably will buy all the furniture now in one place.  Great selection of any style furniture you are looking for here.  The floor plan in this large showroom is easy to follow and situated by decor styles.  Great vignettes and not overwhelming at all.  The bedding was outstanding and very special.  Even though I am not looking for new master bedroom furniture I know I may now have to do it too because I found so many things I loved.  \nIf I had one small complaint it would be that the trade price I didn't think was enough of a discount.  The margin I think is too small for resale and designers.\nThis showroom is smack dab in Scottsdale, easy to find and situated with several other large fine furniture stores right next door!  Don't bother going into any of the others because they don't compare in quality, service or ease of looking at a lot of furniture at one time!  \nThis place is about as good as it gets, and I even came from Chicago to shop here instead of at the Merchandise Mart.
