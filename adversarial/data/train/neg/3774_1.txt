Gotta say i was really disappointed. Scrambled eggs were runny then burnt when they came back. The biscuits are terrible. They are dry like cornbread and the hashbrowns were hella soggy and the coffee was burnt... Time to replace kitchen staff with peeps that kniw what they are doing. Wont be coming back here and i dont recommend anyone else come.
