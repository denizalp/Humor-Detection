Typical Bath and Body works, with the typical setup and sales. This brand is pretty consistent from store to store, which isn't a bad thing. They get bonus points for not having a lot of overly aggressive sales people trying to force a shopping bag on you or talk your ear off. There was just one here (hence the lost star) who hovered for far too long, asked me if i liked a particular scent one too many times, and wouldn't stop talking. Thankfully she found others to bother so I could browse in peace because I seriously don't need body butter badly enough to be annoyed through the entire store.
