Everytime I come to deposit checks I have to wait at least 15 minutes. Don't go on saturday mornings. They have one teller working. As I write this there are 7 people in line and one teller who is chatting everyone up and taking his time. He even has other employees helping him. I am not sure he knows what he is doing. They need to have more people working here that actually know what they are doing.
