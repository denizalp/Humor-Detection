Please pay careful attention to the negative reviews here, according to my experience, they are all 100% accurate.  This company does not practice ethics or truthfulness.  They lied to me multiple times in the same phone conversation, and contradicted themselves.  They made up stories about coming to my house and no one was home, it was a lie because we were home, there were 4 people in the house at the time they said they came and I have a video security system at my house that proved they were not there.  They are rude, abrupt, unprofessional and their service falls far below any acceptable standard.
