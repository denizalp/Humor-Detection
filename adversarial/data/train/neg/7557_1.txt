Worst pool party line ever! I've been to 5 different pool parties and never have I felt cheated like I have today. We have been here since 11:30am and now it is 2 and we r still in line. We have been close to the door for the past hour and still waiting to go in. If we got here late and had to pay the consequences of a long line, I would understand but that is not the case. Now my whole group is in a bad mood, we have wasted half our day in line and by the time we actually go in, we will maybe be able to enjoy 1 or 2 hours? Not worth my time, and I will never ever be back!
