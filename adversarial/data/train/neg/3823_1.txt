I am still going to Cinema on a regular basis and still seeing Nicole. I love that I am able to sit down and just say \"fix it\" and she always makes me look fantastic! Everyone is so nice and laid back and I always feel like they listen and give me exactly what I wanted - even if I wasn't sure what I wanted when I walked in. \n\nNicole also did my hair and makeup for my wedding in 2012 and it was beautiful! Everyone in my wedding party looked great and we were very impressed with the service we received. They even let us stop back for a free touch up after pictures as it was a very windy day. \n\nI am so happy to have found a salon and a stylist I can trust and who all provide amazing and consistent service.
