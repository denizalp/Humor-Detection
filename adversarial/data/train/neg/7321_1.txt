I wasn't sure whether to go high or low based on my experience so it was middle ground all the way.  I ordered a vodka tonic.  Small or Large?  Large, of course.  It came out in a pint glass.  Not quite what I was expecting.  That being said, it tasted like it was just one shot in the huge glass...not good at proportions.  Our time there was fun, but it was the company; not the joint.  The blaring TV right over our booth didn't help with the ambience either :(
