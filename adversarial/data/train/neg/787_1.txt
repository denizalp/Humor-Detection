Stopped here for a quick bite to eat while waiting for luggage to arrive on the next flight.  This is part of the Radisson, which I didn't realize until we got there.  The margaritas were on special, but they tasted pre-made and were so so.  Companions has burgers on pretzel buns, to mixed reviews.  I had the fish tacos, which I thought were excellent.   Service was on the slow side, disappointing due to the fact there were few people there.  Overall, a bit of a disappointment.  Good if you want to eat at a hotel, but I wouldn't go out of the way to find it.
