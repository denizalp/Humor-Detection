Easily the best Persian food I've had in Toronto.  I came here for a special occasion and I was not disappointed.  The interior has a more upscale steakhouse feel to it than the other Persian places, and the service was attentive.\n\nWe had the Kashkeh Bademjan, an eggplant dip to start with some flat bread.  The layers of ingredients were layered into the bowl and you could taste all the flavours in there as you dip.  Next up is the Fesenjan, a pomegranate and walnut chicken stew, with chicken that was fork tender and a sauce with a nutty flavour that went well with the Persian rice.\n\nFinally the Kabab Torsh was expertly grilled.  The slices of veal were very tender and topped with a pomegranate sauce with a side of grilled tomatoes, jalape√±o peppers, and a pomegranate sauce.  The sauce bordered on sweet, but the meatiness of the veal complemented it well.\n\nWill definitely make this my recommendation for Persian any day.
