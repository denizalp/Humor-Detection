Ok, the second time was even better. Cafe Hollander is now fully open and you can order anything on the menu. I got the chicken fusilli - comfort food at its finest. It's thick and hearty and reminds one of home made chicken noodle soup on steroids. The orange zest sets the flavor off perfectly and the portion is large enough to make both dinner and lunch for the next day. Awesome. In addition, Madison is having a rare heat wave in October and the whole bottom floor has been opened up to the outside air. The atmosphere could not be better for a beer or two. I love this place.\n\nSome personnel are still being trained, but the overall operation seems smooth. I had been watching an employee pouring beer without tilting the glass at all. This was quickly corrected when the bar manager came over for a quick lesson .
