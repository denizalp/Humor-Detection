Really enjoy the new additions of more fresh fruit drinks with salted mousse - it's a nice departure from their gimmicky lightbulb series (which they still have). Their drinks are still on the pricier side for bubble tea but at least now I can justify it for the freshness of real fruit. I always enjoy places that are always reinventing the wheel and trying new things with their menu so I'll be back to try other items.\n\nThe service and attention to how the teas\/bubble waffles are made is much better than the uptown location.
