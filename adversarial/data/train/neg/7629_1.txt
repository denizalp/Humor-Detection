We have been here three times now and it has been great! My favorite are the chicken wings extra crispy honey hot. This is my favorite place for wings! I have ordered the steak sandwich which was awesome and the blue burger. If you are looking for a place to have good food with a casual atmosphere check this place out. \nThe food has been wonderful and it does not taste like it has been bought in. The burger actually was cooked properly, it was moist and delicious!\nThe service was great and they have always been friendly and super attentive without being annoying. \nIf you haven't tried blue 32 give it a try!
