Burrito is love, burrito is life.\nSeriously, best burritos in downtown Toronto, and the best Burrito Boyz shop in Ontario. Very fast and efficient service, reasonable prices (even after the recent increases), and even the small burritos are LOADED (the large is just too much for me!). My co-workers go here basically every day, and I make it a point to go once a week (for basically the last year).
