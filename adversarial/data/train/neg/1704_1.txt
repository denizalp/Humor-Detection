Watched a recorded episode of, \"Check\", and decided to go out and off Weight Watchers diet for a meal. We usually don't do that but had to treat ourselves for weeks of diet. with some hopefully tasty flavorful food. \nIt was lunch and everything,  almost all on menu included bread. Oh love good bread. I had a shrimp poorboy and shared an order of french fries. with my wife. She had a club sandwich on a dark brown roll. She was satisfied with her meal. I not so much. My bread item tasted like yesterdays or earlier as the dough part was stiff like day old bread.A baguette from Frys foods much better.  The shrimp covered only half the sandwich which is sad. I ate the cut side, or what I call the camera side as what one sees. and the interior was just a little lettuce and some sort of sauce. I didn't finish the bread and left it  on the plate. The shrimp tasted very  good but just not enough for the size of the sandwich. The French fries were great and I gave up many points for them and they were worth it. Of course I haven't had a  french fry in 2 months. They were worth it, did I say.  I read the menu and didn't see anything I wanted to come back for. to have on a second trip but then how often does one travel 2\/3s the valley to eat lunch.
