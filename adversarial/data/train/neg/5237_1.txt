A customer of this location rear ended my personal car, their customer gave me a fake number and said he was insured through this location. He was not insured with budget. I called to set up a claim and the location had told me that the guy already returned the car and it was already rented to a different customer. I am still filing a claim with their corporate office but I wanted to post this to warn potential customers that this location does not inspect their vehicles. A rental car that was in a front end accident (rear ended my car) was turned around and re rented when their customer returned the car.
