This place is horrible. My niece went here to plan services for my sister. Since my sister was going to be cremated my niece was told that the ashes would have to stay with the mortuary  after the service. In other words, a plot would have to be purchased. In October of 2013 we had services here for my son in law. We took the ashes with us. Someone is trying to make a sale. Greed !
