A friend and I went there Thursday night for dinner. We had the coq au vin special. The food was excellent, and the price was right. But, the waitress was exceptionally rude which tended to ruin the evening. If you don't like your job, get out of the business. I told the manager about the rude waitress and reminded him that there are many good restaurants in Charlotte. He knew us as we are repeat customers.
