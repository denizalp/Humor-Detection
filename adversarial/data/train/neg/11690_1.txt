I recently bought two Cartier watches and jewelry at this location with the patient assistance of the manager Julien.  And I am so pleased with the professionalism exhibited by everyone at the location.\n\nThey have an outstanding display of mens and ladies Cartier watches. The store is immaculate and comfortable. Buying a fine timepiece should not be a spur of the moment decision. The as staff at Bellusso know this ans there is no pressure to buy on the spot. For me games like \"today only we'll discount\" are an invitation to walk out the door and that does not happen at Belluaso.\n\nThe store is a cut above and, after shipping there, head directly across the walkway to Wolfgang Puck's Cut steakhouse for a fabulous meal.  But be sure to show off your new watch while dining.
