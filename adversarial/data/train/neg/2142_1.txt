It only gets one star because it makes you choose one. They are not worthy of even one star. \n\nThis might be the worst customer service we have ever experienced. We paid almost $300 for glow in the dark Service Dog patches back in August. When the patches arrived, the background was white instead of black, and the writing wasn't complete. On most of the patches, the G was partially missing. \n\nWe have called about 15 times with no answer. The voicemail is full so leaving a message is not an option. On the machine it says you can text with questions. I have sent at least three texts with no response. I have also sent multiple emails with no response. \n\nI hope this company feels good about themselves. They just stole $300 from a non-profit that provides service dogs for disabled veterans. Shame on you.
