Have been coming here regularly for about a year now - quite a lot of parking spots, all the rooms are very spacious and clean. it is located in a industria\/residential area so traffic is light and if you can't find parking, you can always park on the street.\n\nThe quality of the instructors vary so it would be great if you try out different classes and instructors to see what you really like best.
