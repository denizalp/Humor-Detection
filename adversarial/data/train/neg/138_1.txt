Over the years, I've wanted to like lemon chicken, but have always found it disappointingly syrupy and bland. That is, until Wong's. The best lemon chicken OF MY LIFE! Each crispy bite was had the perfect balance of sweet and tart, and tasted like... wait for it... ACTUAL fresh-squeezed lemon!\n\nAs with anything meant to be crispy, eating it fresh was definitely best. I'd say the lemon chicken was a 6\/7 when I got it home and a PERFECT 10 at the restaurant. \n\nEverything else was either as good as I've ever had, or better. The cream-cheese wontons...Hot and sour soup... Mongolian beef... Chicken chow mein... ALL fantastic.\n\nAfter eating at Wong's for the first time, I told my brother and his wife how amazing I thought their food was. He said (nonchalantly) \"oh yeah, we've been coming here for years\" and I just about blew a gasket he didn't tell me about it sooner. \n\n:-) Enjoy.
