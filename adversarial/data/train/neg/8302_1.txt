This was the best fast food\/pizza experience I have ever had. Whoever answered our phone call to place an order 15 minutes before close time was kind, thorough and professional. I have never wanted to befriend someone simply because of how nice they were over the phone until tonight. Plus the pizza was made and ready to go in less than 10 minutes and absolutely delectable. If you haven't tried the vegan cheese; do it. 10\/10
