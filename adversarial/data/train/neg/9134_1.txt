Went to Futo Buta tonight for the first time and the ramen was fantastic! The Brussels sprouts appetizers were great. The staff was extremely knowledgeable about the food and drinks on the menu. I highly recommend you try it. The staff is very nice, save room for the Desert the ice cream is worth the try! I lived in Okinawa, Japan so if I am telling you to give it a try you should!
