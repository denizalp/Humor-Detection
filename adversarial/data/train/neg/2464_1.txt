I went here the other night with co-workers. We started with the goat cheese and garlic appetizer which was absolutely delicious. I ordered the ahi tuna tacos which were equally delicious (though the ahi was seared a little more than I would have preferred). The service was good as well. \n\nMy only complaint was an issue with the delivery of our wine order. They didn't have the Pinot Noir that my co-worker ordered and instead of asking her what else she may want, they just brought her a substitute. Then they started pouring glasses of wine without saying anything about which one was which. We all assumed we were given the right wine order. \n\nI would come back if I am in the area again.
