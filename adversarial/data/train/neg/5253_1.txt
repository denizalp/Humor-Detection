Los dos Molinos is a quaint Mexican restaurant in ahwatukee. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a nice middle aged couple. The menu seemed to be very authentic and had different items that I've never seen before. This was interesting but, I am kind of a pikey eater so none of these cool items appealed to me.\n\n The overall service was kind of bad it took about ten minutes for drinks to arrive. I only got one refill the whole night. When the food arrived it was really good it had a great flavor. I ordered blue corn enchilada's, that's something I've never had before. Everything was great. Even the bathrooms were clean, and the staff was great.\n I\nf you are craving good authentic Mexican food, this is the place to go. If your In a rush I wouldn't recommend this place due to the bad service. But if you have time on your hands, this is defiantly a place you should stop in and check out. You will not be disappointed.
