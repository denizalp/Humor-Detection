There are so many moving companies to choose from, so it wasn't an easy decision. But I decided to go with Big Boys Moving after I read the reviews and then called to get pricing. The lady (Tandy, I think) who I spoke with was very friendly and helpful with scheduling my move. Richard and Gemario showed up and got right to work. They were friendly and nice and made my move SO much easier. All of my items made it safely to my new house- and I have A LOT of glass furniture. Thank you Richard and Gemario! I will definitely use this company again.
