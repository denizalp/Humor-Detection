Terrible place for breakfast. Dry potatoes, too crisp bacon and the smallest sides of toast I ever had plus a glass of orange juice was $5! Eggs were yucky too. My total was over $32 and I barely ate any of my breakfast. \n\nI should have know when I seen the servers taking back plates from customers that were over half full of food. \n\nAvoid this place
