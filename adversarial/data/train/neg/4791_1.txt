We received a Christmas Card from Ron and Sue Bishop which reminded me to write a review.  Another couple joined us for an evening at the Whimsical Pig B&B in August.  The entire experience was wonderful.  We traveled with our bikes to take in the Cuyahoga Valley National Railroad bicycle tour (also highly recommended). Ron was there to help us with our unloading and storage of our bikes in their garage.  We were shown our rooms and given a tour of the beautiful property.  My wife, an avid Gardener herself was completely impressed with the gardens, their appointments and the ponds.  A whimsical garden to be sure!  We were provided a selection of cheese and cured meats paired nicely with light wines.  Upon our return from an evening at the Akron Civic Theater, we discovered several bottles of wine left on the counter.  I poured a glass and retired to one of many seating areas in the garden and enjoyed one of my vices, a fine cigar.  Although late in the evening,  Ron soon joined me in the garden and asked if I would like a refill.  I accepted on the condition he join me.  We sat for a long time reminiscing about our high school football rivalry, Akron Garfield and Kenmore.  Breakfast was beyond expectation.  Sue spent three hours preparing our feast. I can't finish this review without comment on the detail given to the interior design.  The atmosphere was amazing.  If you ever dreamed of spending a day or so in an antique store, this would be the closest I can imagine.  With multiple sitting rooms full of interesting items from America's past; one has only the limits of their own mind to conger up what it must have been like to see these things new and a part of everyday life.  \nThank you Ron and Sue for the card and for an incredible stay!
