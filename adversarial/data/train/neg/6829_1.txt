On balance, it was really nice. The room was big. The gym was nice. The service was good. The whole casino smelled of smoke but that's pretty much everywhere in Vegas. I also hate paying resort fees. And they nickel and dime you on little things like early check in and printing out boarding passes.  But I'll definitely stay there again.
