Doesn't matter where you seat it's just so uncomfortable than every time I go there I regret. Those stairs are way too big steps and somehow doesn't feel safe. For the bathrooms are always clean and empty. Food small portion but good and drinks Vegas prices. So we will still go there but I wish who built goes there and seat in those chairs
