Great service and great food. Our waitress was friendly and so were the others who tried to accommodate our large party. I had the eggs Benedict, which I thought were ok. It came in a cute dish. I was blown away more by their mac and cheese and biscuits with honey butter and jam. My friends really liked their food.
