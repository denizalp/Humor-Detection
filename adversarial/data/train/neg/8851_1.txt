I passed by the restaurant around 7:30 pm on a friday night and it was packed. Went back in half an hour and was be able to find a table. we got chicken mole and pork stew and each dish was  $13 after tax.  They had pictures of all the dishes on the wall, which helped you to decide.  However, when the food came, they looked smaller portion than the pictures.  I still enjoyed them very much. Both dishes came with bean paste and rice. The reason I took off one star is I wish they could give more rice, as I think they serve good portion of meat and which needs more rice to go with them.
