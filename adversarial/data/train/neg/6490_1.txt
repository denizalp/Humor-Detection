It is currently  2:04 & my feet have been soaking since 1:40 on a Saturday & I haven't started my pedi. Let's just say this new location for nail salon is extremely busy. I recommend an appt. They have turned people away and have asked for numbers since the wait will be so long. It's a good problem for the business but not so good when you are trying to squeeze in a quick pedi while the kids nap.  They use nicer legit sandals for your feet instead of the flimsy sandals most salons use. I got the deluxe foot spa. She did great on making my feet baby soft, and the massage was great. I got French gel as well and they turned out great. The deluxe had an extra part that I've never experienced. She put a very hot liquid in a bag on my feet. After a few minutes she took it off and I realized it was a wax. That  was unexpected. I highly recommend an appointment because this place was packed. Down side is they do not do builder gel or hard gel. So I will prob only come for a pedicure.
