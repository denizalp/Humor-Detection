Firearm was transferred to Coyote after calling and checking with an employee. The gun arrived and when I attempted to pick it up, I was informed that they could not transfer it to me due to some landlord or ATF issue. Three weeks later they are still holding who knows how many customers firearms. Their price may be low, but if you have to wait a month to actually get the firearm you already paid for it's not worth it. This appears to be a very unprofessional and disorganized company! Will not return calls or give any updates as to what is going on!
