It's a mall that I have been going to since I first existed in 1997. The mall has a lot of stores and free Wi-Fi. Some parts of the mall are dated such as Walmart, Sears, and the movie theatre, but it is a great place if you are looking for low to high end materials. The food court is the most exciting experience, Man Chu Wok is my favourite restaurant there and there is a KFC with a refill station. It's connected to transit, and regional services, and across the road to a Best Buy and a Loblaws Superstore.
