My sincere thanks for the Yelpers who led us to this jewel!  The owner stocks the genuine Hawaiian Style drinks and I got a hit of my favorite which was guava.  Got the kalbi  and this much mentioned meat jun.  I started in on the kalbi, tender, well-marinated, very satisfying, but really loved the kimchee and the diced pickled radishes that were served first.  Then tried DH's meat jun.  OMG!  This is a new flavor and texture for me AND it was fantastic!!  Thinly sliced ribeye covered in egg that was fluffy that you dip into a teriyaki sauce.  The owner came over and added some bean sprouts and ate everything for under $20!!!  Worth the cab ride off the Strip.
