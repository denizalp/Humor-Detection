I'm so excited that the Hard Rock location is finally open!  I have been seeing Bailey at the Fort Apache location for several months now and have nothing but incredible things to say about her, Kelly and the entire staff at the salon. It's a one of a kind experience that is worth every penny and then some.  The Hark Rock salon is top notch and the perfect accent to the awesome environment you step into.  Really the best salon experience I have ever had!  I'm looking forward to coming to this place for many more years.
