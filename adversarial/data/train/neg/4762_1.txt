DON'T GO ThERE. First off, I visited RC of NV. three different times and every time I was made to wait well over 2 hours beyond my appointment time. This was at the Sienna office. The office staff is not friendly except for the Hispanic girls. The black girls and the white girls are very rude and condescending . Dr. Loo is a great guy and good doctor, but the staff is horrible. They show little concern for their patients . Dr. Wickens is a good doctor too, but is lacking in \"bedside manner\". Never wants to talk about anything. Will not answer your questions. Again, Dr. Loo is your best bet. But overall, I would NOT recommend this place to anyone.
