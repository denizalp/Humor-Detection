Ive been going to this place for years; management and ownership changed a couple of years ago.  The place use to have a true pub feel which was sacrificed due to renovations. I'm still not keen on the new seating arrangements but the food is good. Butter chicken is authentic and very good; kids love the wings and chicken fingers.  Half price menus on Thursdays and $5 domestic tall boys cant't be beat.  Worth giving it a try if you haven't been there in a while or need a change of scenery.
