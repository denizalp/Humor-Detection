We came from out town for a football game and wanted to watch the big UFC fight at nice, drama-free bar or restaurant. From the point I called here to verify that they were showing the fight I was impressed with their service. The person who answered was extremely friendly and went out of her way to describe the usual fight night crowd and advise us what time we should show up if we wanted a seat. Our waitress was just as friendly and took great care of us.\nThe food especially the Chicken Alfredo was delicious ! Mix drinks were not that strong. But we stuck to beer. Nice place over all I highly recommend it.
