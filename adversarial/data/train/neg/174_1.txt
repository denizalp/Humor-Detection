There may be equals but not better restaurants than the Wild Thaiger. (Have no idea what a Thaiger is...is there a tame one?)  Anyway, went there today for lunch for thefirst time and was super impressed.  Service by a drop dead georgeous Thai waitress was excellent.  Food was superb...don't see how it could have been better.  Wife had chicke curry which was excellent.  I had pad tai which could not have been better.  Food came immediately.  Steaming hot.  Lovely!!\nHardest part of visit was finding the parking lot.  Once you know where it is, you'll always know.  I parked on right side of the building.  Fortunately there's a sign saying it's on othe other side.  From then on.....a piece of cake.\nI'm no stranger to Thai food and Wild Thaiger is one of the best.
