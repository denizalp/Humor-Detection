I have a love-hate relationship with this Tony Roma's in particular because while I used to be a regular, I quit eating here about a year ago because every single time I hated my meal. Like 4 times out of the last 5. I have a firm \"three strikes you're out\" rule when it comes to restaurants and this location let me down so many times that I just quit going. The parking lot here is always empty so that should alert everyone to the fact that I'm not the only person who has abandoned Tony Roma's! \n\nFast forward to a year later. My husband gets his \"free birthday entree\" e-mail and begs me to go for all you can eat ribs night. I don't eat ribs, but he says Tony's has some of the best. Begrudgingly, I agreed to go with him. He ordered the ribs and I opted for the chicken spinach stack. In the past, this spinach stack has been abysmal. Tonight it was pretty good! The chicken breasts were juicy and well seasoned and the spinach stuffing on top was good. It tasted like a frozen and microwaved spinach dip but whatever, this is a chain restaurant and for chain food, it was okay. \n\nHubby said the ribs were really tasty and they were all you can eat. Our waiter encouraged him to eat more, not like some places where they try to shame you into stopping your reorders before you are full; though the kitchen DID pull the \"let's-take-a-super-long-time-to-bring-out-his-reorders-so-he-will-give-up\" but the joke was on them, we had all night to sit and wait!\n\nOne major disappointment is that they've taken away their Coke Zero. BOO! \n\nThe service was great too. So great that we asked to speak to the manager. This location is really cleaning up their act. I'll be sure to go back in a few weeks to give it another try. Here's hoping this visit wasn't just a fluke and Tony Roma's is turning itself around!
