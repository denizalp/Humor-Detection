This is my third trip in two weeks because the first trip I had the meatloaf entr√©e and now I'm addicted. I might need a 12 step program to break my habit! This place has a dive bar motif with really good food. I'm hoping to go through the menu but I need a few weeks (or months) to get sick of ordering the same thing over and over. I ordered a beer with my food and it comes in a nice cold glass, excellent!
