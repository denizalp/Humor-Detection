I am the literal definition of a carnivore, the kind that orders an extra steak or lambchop for dessert. Vegan or not, the meal I had last Friday was nothing short of amazing. The tartines were varied and savoury, the pierogi prepared two ways also distinct and worth going back for another plate of soon. Give it a shot, have a couple excellent cocktails and enjoy a well prepared meal in a fun space with some friends
