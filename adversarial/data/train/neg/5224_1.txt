If I can give them a 0 star I would, I am only giving a 1 star because the waiter was nice.\n\nCheesy decor, so dark and black, it was 5:30 after work, we were the only ones in there , and we waited sooooooooo long to get our food, we should have realize something when we walked in. What a mistake.....  the food was horrible, worst tacos ever!
