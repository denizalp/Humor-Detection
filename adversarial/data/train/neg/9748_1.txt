I started coming here after the dealer said I needed $600+ in repairs, and I called around for other estimates, and they were 40% cheaper. Of course, there are others who can do work for similar rates, but the deciding factor was that Rob, who is usually at the front desk, was apparently the only guy in town who could handle a phone call in a useful and professional way. I know thats a fairly small factor to make a decision on, but I don't regret it, since its been representative of how they've been to me since.\n\nAlso, if I bring the car in for an oil change or other regular maintenance, and ask for them to check some potential problem out, and it just turns out to be something trivial that takes a few seconds to fix, they don't use that as an excuse to charge a half-hour of shop time. Which I appreciate.
