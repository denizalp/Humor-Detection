Let me just say that their breakfast buffet is beyond delicious! There was an abundance of food that I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat. They had everything that I my family would make for breakfast and lunch. They had eggs, waffles, sausage, bacon, tacos, tacos dorados, Chile's rellenos, enchiladas, ceviche, fruit, hot chocolate, pan dulce, flan, arroz con leche, cereal, milk, juice, horchata, Jamaica, and agua de pepino... there was wayyy more food than I can remember! My family will be back!
