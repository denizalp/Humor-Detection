Just came back from my meal here.. I'm giving an extra star just because the service was good. I was very disappointed in just about every dish.\n\nFirst off, we received the calamari. It came even before the bread.. That seemed strange, but anyway it was ok. Nothing to write home about. I've had better ones for a third of the price.\n\nNext came the bread. Good crusty bread with a side of olive oil.\n\nNext we got the Milo's special. One was pretty good. Flavorful tzatziki with nicely fired zucchini. The other order was salted HEAVILY. It was barely edible.\n\nAfter that, we received the famous octopus. Everybody rants and raves about this octopus. It was chewy. I was so let down. I was expecting tender pieces of octopus.. Chewy.. Sad..\n\nLastly, we ordered two kinds of fish, however it didn't matter which you are wondering about.. Both were disgustingly DRY. It felt like I was eating sandpaper. A place known for its seafood, with a fish as it's logo.. I would expect they know how to make fish.. Overall horrible meal, good service. I will not be back.
