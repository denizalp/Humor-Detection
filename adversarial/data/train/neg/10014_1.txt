For cheapie pizza this is one of the best places in the city. They are small with a good selection. They add olive oil or parmesan cheese or spicy peppers on top for free. I think if you're stuck and need something quick, good and cheap this is a good option. No date night material but reliable food when in a rush and stuck.
