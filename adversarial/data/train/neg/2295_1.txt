Yet another phenomenal meal. Had the Dragon Eggz which were tangy as ever. Also tried the Turtle Island Crab, which is literally a deconstructed won ton. Just brilliant. And the perfect thing to have during the awful Phoenix summer!\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Temple of Fire, and they weren't joking. It would be nice if they wouldn't pound the chicken flat as a pancake, though! Cook the whole thing and cut it up, instead! Pounding a chicken flat makes it tough. \n\nThe service was stellar as always. Our server was cheerful, and on point.
