As I get older , more things begin to happen, case in point, I have allergies. After discovering this I was happy to be led to Tottori on Charleston. Not a swank complex but I have never had any problems here, very easy to get to, right off the interstate. This is not like going to the dentist, I like it when I come here. My physician is Thomas Chu and he always helps me with my current situation and when I leave I am always glad I went. These things are treatable but you have to talk to the right people and I have a great staff backing me up, thank you everyone at Tottori.
