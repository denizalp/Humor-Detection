The best Greek Food we have had in Las Vegas!  Just stopped in after seeing it in the parking lot across from Applebee's.  Glad we stopped!  Great food!  Fresh.  Pita is super light and fluffy.  Hummus tasted super fresh and light.  Gyro was great!  I had the gyro plate and my wife had the gyro sandwich.  Both were great I liked the sandwich a little better.  You can't go wrong!
