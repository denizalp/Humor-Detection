Very welcoming place. \n\nI did the 101 intro class; it cost just $25 for 1.5hr of instruction, bike set up and a 30-minute ride plus a free water bottle or reusable shopping bag. Making it a really good deal, the price also included your first real class after the 101 which they let you book in studio before anyone else so you are sure to get the date\/time you want - something that may become a future problem for people not buying the 20-class package which comes with early registration privileges. If you are an early riser the 530a\/6a usually have space open.\n\nI've not experienced all the instructors yet, but I liked the couple that I have already. The music is good and for the overwhelming majority of the time I really feel it helps me go where the instructor has intended. The classes here are quite different than the ones I've experienced at the gym I go to. These classes include a lot of out of saddle time, a lot of \"jumps\" and the use of 3lb dumbbells for delivering quite the bi\/tri\/shoulder burn.\n\nA few other smaller aspects of the studio earn it five stars. They rent shoes for just $3 and are willing to put the small charge on a card instead of just taking cash. They have a free water bottle refill station. They offer two shower areas as well as two bathrooms if you need to change or shower after an early morning class on your way to work. (The space is pretty small though so if you have any pre-ride prep you need to do get there a bit early.( I also love that you reserve the exact bike you want online in advance. I for example hate the ones over the air vents (#30) so I can be sure to avoid it.
