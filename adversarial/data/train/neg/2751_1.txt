I believe Very Fair Seafood Restaurant is a sister restaurant of Very Fair Chinese Restaurant. \n\nWe ordered a dinner combo for 4 to feed 5 adults and 1 kid.  We were full, but not stuffed, without ordering rice.  Therefore, the portion was good.  The vegetable dishes were well made.  The fish seemed to be made from a dead fish, not live fish, but the meat texture was still okay, meaning the fish was fresh anyway.  The fish was overcooked and under-seasoned.  I don't recall anything about the meat dish, so I supposed it was not very memorable.\n\n\nAs opposed to many reviewers, I found the food barely okay here.  Things just could be tastier, at least for dinner they were.  All the ingredients used seemed to be okay fresh, but nothing really stood out.  Maybe I should try the dim sum brunch one day to get a well-rounded opinion.\n\nOverall, this restaurant is good for regular family dinners.  The decor is definitely a notch better than the food.  The services are friendly and down to earth.
