My buddy and I stopped here for a small pizza to share at 2 am after a long night of drinking. It was a perfect amount of food before heading back to the hotel. \n\nThe was prepared perfectly and in just a matter of minutes too!!! It was delicious and the crust had good flavor as well. I would go back there again.
