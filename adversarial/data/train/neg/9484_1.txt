First trip to Vegas and we had to stop for a bite here. Food was awesome! Very tasty! The Bloody Mary looked and tasted fabulous! Portions were WAY too large to finish but overall we LOVED it! I didn't think the prices were any higher than some of the other places around here. Would definitely recommend! Especially the Motley Que sandwich! Yum!
