Triple A is a convenient name because they triple charged my credit card when the credit card machine wasn't working, which the drivers and other yelpers say is a really common problem. I disputed two of the three charges and they insist that there was no third payment. I'm looking at my account right now and, yup, there's the charge with no refund from a month ago. So they've had my money all this time and they're arguing with me because... ??? Stay away from Triple A unless you're ok with paying multiple times for one cab ride and\/or enjoy spending A LOT of time disputing charges.\n\nThat cab driver was nice though. I took the cab home from the airport and we spent an extra 10 or so minutes trying to get the credit card machine to work which was frustrating at the end of a long day of travelling. The CC machine was looking like it wasn't working and was saying that the transaction didn't go through. So I don't blame the driver. But wow, if a business triple charges me and then fights me on whether I should get refunded for 2\/3 charges, that is an enormous problem.\n\nUpdate: they ended up refunding the two extra charges. Phew! But save yourself the headache and only go with Triple A if you have cash. At the Phoenix Airport, I have just asked the cab coordinator to get me a different cab company if I didn't have cash and this has worked out just fine.
