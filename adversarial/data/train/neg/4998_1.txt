I feel like the other reviews are a bit unfair so far.  Especially as it seems most of them went during the first 2 weeks the place was open (usually not a good time to judge the quality of a new restaurant).  Personally, with the limited selection of tap beers in the town, this place is a gift.  Tons of micro brews and local suds - some that I haven't even heard of.\n\nLike piano music playing classic hits was nice- not crazy loud.\n\nService was just fine - very friendly.  We ordered a salad with chicken (way too much stuff in the salad) and the fried mushrooms (surprisingly delicious).\n\nOverall, suggest if you are looking for a place with a wide selection of craft\/local brews on tap, this place doesn't disappoint.
