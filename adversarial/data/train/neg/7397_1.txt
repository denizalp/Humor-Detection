I always shop this store, immediately welcomed in this store, stock levels of merchandise are well maintained and the store is neat, but this day and believe me I never use public restrooms, I was drinking so much water because of the heat I used the facilities. It was so digustingly filthy, I couldn't believe my eyes. I had to use the handicap because  the other 2 stalls were occupied, the toilet seat had black something on it and the floors were filthy! No towels to dry hands available, I couldn't wait to exit. I work at a retail store and our associates are expected to clean our restrooms daily, maybe Ross should implement that plan rather than subjecting your customers to this abuse.
