Good pizza, the quality of toppings used are worth going. Only issue i have is related to delivery. They have always arrived with the center of the pizza being completely soggy, as if it was undone completely (doughy). But it is the method for which the pizza is placed in the box and steam to death I guess. Out of all the pizzas I have ordered all over this country, this was a new one for me. I had spoke with a manager (Chris) there before and he was rude as all can be about it and very challenging. As a customer, if I pay you good money for quality and you fall short, then stand behind your product and make things right the next time. Leave out the confrontation or ridiculous compromises. Do as you say, deliver as you promise. \n\nI don't think I will keep my business with Metro going forward. Too many pizza options in Vegas to deal with bad attitudes.
