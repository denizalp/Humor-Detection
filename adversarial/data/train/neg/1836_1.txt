I found my experience truly displeasing. The service was extremely unprofessional. There were several workers hiding in the back, and only one employee helping customers. Not only did they not have the phone I wanted, they lied to me. I was told that I could come the next day and pick up my phone without a question asked. The next day they asked me several questions in order to access my father's account. We specifically asked them if there would be anything I had do the next day, and they told us we would not. They also simply turned on my phone and assumed that I had an iCloud rather than trying to help me transfer my data. Extremely unprofessional service.
