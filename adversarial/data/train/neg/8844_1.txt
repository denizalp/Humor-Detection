I had a scoop of the cookie monster and my friends had the cheesecake on a stick and a scoop of the green tea ice cream concoction that they have. The cookies and cream is a lot of fun because of its blue base, and the cheesecake on a stick was amazing. Very very sweet. The green tea ice cream didn't really taste anything like green tea-my friends compared the flavour to Chatime's regular milk tea in ice cream form. The staff here is super friendly and they seem really excited about the products they offer. They are more than willing to answer your questions and explain or recommend the menu items. This place is for all the sweet tooths out there!
