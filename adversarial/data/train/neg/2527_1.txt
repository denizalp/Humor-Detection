I love this location! The girl helping us was super sweet and knowledgable;it was great customer service. Amazing soups and I love their Berry 5 smoothie. Highly recommend because I am picky about soups and smoothies but this place has won my heart and tummy. The bread bowls are super good too although I'm not a huge fan of sour dough.
