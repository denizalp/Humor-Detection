Service was terrible from the second we got there. When they forgot two of our four drinks, and the tab was still $50, I think my group gave off the 'we're not rich' vibe..but from there we were ignored through the whole meal and we might have ordered more drinks. Wished I'd went someplace I knew was good rather than risk it.
