So, today I was personally contacted by the Dr. He called to check on how my husband's eyes were doing and also to apologize for our negative experience the last time we were in. I was really impressed how the Dr. handled this. This is obviously someone that takes great pride in their practice and wants to make sure all his clients\/patients are happy. That is the reason why we'll be back in the future and will recommend Eyes on Las Vegas to all our friends and family. \n\nI also want to mention the Dr. gave my husband some eye drops to try at home. He thought they might alleviate an issue my husband was having. My hubby tried them out that night and unfortunately had (what we think) a small reaction to them (it happens, no biggie). We called the next day to ask if there were some other eye drops we could try and they wanted my husband to stop in at his earliest convenience so the Dr. could personally take a look at my husband's eyes to make sure everything was ok. Seriously, that level of care is rare these days. We truly appreciated the Dr. taking the time out of his schedule to give him a quick check up and consult. He really does care.
