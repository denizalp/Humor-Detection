Store was really cute and there was a small table of toys to keep kids occupied while you shop. The kids clothes were very cute and well priced. They also sell new toys and body products. The only problem I had was the staff was kind of rude the day we went in. They didn't even say hi or ask if we needed help. They just stood at the front and talked to each other. This being a small shop I was just expecting a little better customer service. Maybe we will give it another shot but I'm not sure it was worth the drive.
