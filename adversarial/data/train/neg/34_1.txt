Well, good thing this place has good food! The service was terrible and that's coming from a fellow server. I don't remember his name but he was non existent! He had a weird accent, maybe southern,  that I swear is fake, it came and went each time he came around, so all of 3 times. Our whole table of 5 had empty cups and finally the manager came by and ended up serving our table to rest of the time. Thank goodness for him. I had a mahi sandwich and it was super good. I wouldn't go back because of the service alone.
