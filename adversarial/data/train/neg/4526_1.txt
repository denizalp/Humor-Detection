I really enjoyed my oxygen jet peel with Tatjana - it was my first time having this type of treatment and really enjoyed how refreshing and relaxing it was (it would especially be a great treat in the summer). It's feels like a cool stream of water that gently exfoliates your face (it's not icy as I've read in other reviews, but it is cool). My 45 min treatment included the following:\n- Cleanse and toner\n- Steam with a light mud mask and light extractions (bonus as I was not expecting this!)\n- Oxygen jet peel treatment itself; this was enjoyable and relaxing and Tatjana does a really good job of taking care of any small drips that are expected from the process as the nozzle gently sprays saline water \n- Mask and finishing serums and creams \nIn terms of results on my skin, I really enjoyed this more as a relaxing facial (I've had microderms, light and medium strength peels) so this treatment is a much gentler treatment meant for sensitive skin so I think this would especially benefit those skin types that can't use more intense alternatives. I also really enjoyed how they managed to make this treatment feel like a \"complete\" facial - I've had microderms in the past that were in and out in about 30 mins so I really loved the fact that I got to enjoy the relaxing part I enjoy about a traditional facial as well as a more technical treatment like the oxygen jet peel.\n\nI will definitely be adding this type of treatment to my rotation (especially in the summer!)
