I have used this company's services over a period of probably 5 or 7 years and have spent many thousands over that time in dry cleaning. While over that time the cleaning services have been decent with relatively good pricing.. it is inexcusable that this company employs such irresponsible and uncaring employees. A garment sent to a dry cleaner is a trust. Some of my garments are rather expensive or irreplaceable, hence why I send it to a dry cleaner.. that it be preserved for as long as possible. Over this time a couple of my garments have been lost.. one recovered after I was able to provide a very detailed description.. but what is inexcusable is that they continually insist on putting many of my garments through regular laundry.. which I could do at home if I wanted! The reason I don't is because certain pieces age and fade instantly. They did this frequently enough (even when I specified to them in person that it was ONLY dry cleaning) that I had them in bold capital letters write on my tickets DRY CLEANING ONLY. They sent me back my new shirts faded because of regular laundry, with a receipt with those same bold instructions, yet with charges for regular laundry. I don't know if the owner sees these reviews or perhaps he makes enough money that he really doesn't care.. but I am permanently taking my business elsewhere. If you want a business that will take care of your clothes without you needing to worry if it will be lost or damaged, look elsewhere.
