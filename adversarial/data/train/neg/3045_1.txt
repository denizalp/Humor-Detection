Anna (owner) is a big reason I continue to go to Akira. She truly cares about her customers and goes above and beyond to keep them happy. I usually sit at a regular table in the bar area. The sushi is always fresh and delicious. I highly recommended both the mushroom soup and house salad. The salad dressing is the closest thing to Benihana ginger dressing. You can't go wrong with any item on the menu. Patience is required sometimes due to being understaffed. Go check it out for yourself.
