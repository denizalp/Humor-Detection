This is the absolute worst place to drink in Boca Park. The service was fine, the waitresses and Hostess were very polite and friendly however, none of our cocktails had ANY drinkability. None of the beer taps were working and when we ask to see a wine list we were informed that their wife I was down and their ipads\/winelists we're connected to the internet so we could not be presented with one. I ordered a cocktail with a champagne floater which was absolutely terrible and to boot the champagne shot was flat! Decided to give the wine ago and asked for a Pinot Grigio and didn't realize I was being served the worst in the house. I couldn't even choke it down and left more than half of it behind. In totality we ordered four drinks but only one of them was consumed and our tab was still $50. The acoustic music was so-so. The singers really gave their all but were sub-par....however, at least they were singing 'songs everyone knows' which took the sting out of the Full Experience.... the cocktail lover in me wants to give this place the second try but, at the end of the day I don't really think the juice will be worth the squeeze....hard sell when you have so many stellar eateries in the area...PS- currently next door at Cheesecake Factory having a perfect martini, as per usual.
