Jim Chai Kee has been a main stay forever in Richmond Hill.  Nothing fancy, nothing pretentious, just good value noodles quick and simple.  They've opened other locations either directly or indirectly that are run by family members or former workers but this is the original location and it hasn't changed much after all these years and is still the best.\n\nIt's been a while since I've been here so when I saw some posts about Jim Chai Kee, decided to get myself some noodles.  Things haven't changed.  You walk into a simple cheap looking restaurant with pictures and posts around the walls, they ask how many people, you grab a seat, order, eat and pay up front... that's it.  As simple as it gets.\n\nI usually like variety with my noodles so I get the 3 combo noodle with 2 wontons, 2 fish ball patties, and some sliced beef over egg noodles.... I LOVE EGG NOODLES!!!  Noodles comes out in minutes.\n\nWontons are big and juicy, fish patties are homemade and sliced beef very tender.  Noodles are done perfectly, slightly chewy and the broth is old fashion wonton broth flavoured.  The chili oil is nice and spicy so make sure you put a dollop of it in your noodles if you are chili head like me:)  All for $7.00 plus tax!  Once you've finished, take your order form and pay at front.\n\nIf you are looking for high end service, pretentious attitude, look elsewhere.  Looking for no frills value and good HK style noodles?  Welcome home!
