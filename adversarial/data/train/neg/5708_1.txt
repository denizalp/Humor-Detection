Worst experience ever at a Big O Tires shop. I had an appointment for 2:00 pm and they didn't even get my car on the lifts until almost 3. After the car was finally lifted it took the technician 30 minutes just to drain the oil and add new oil to the vehicle. My tires weren't even rotated even though the paperwork claims they were. After my car was finally done it took them another 15-20 minutes to tell me my car was done!! I will never return to this location again!
