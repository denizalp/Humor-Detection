I came here for dinner at 8:30 on a Friday, and it was immediately clear that the place was transitioning from dinner-mode to bar-mode. The volume was loud, and the crowd was overflowing into the undifferentiated dinning area.\n\nWe were seated after only a short wait, and presented with their appetizing tapas menu. Our orders were varied and all were successful except the \"baked potato croquettes\" - four delicious but minuscule bites of fried potato heaven. It looked like they forgot to load half of the plate. The kitchen  was slow, but as compensation the apologetic waitress insisted on charging our dessert to the house - a surprisingly generous and professional move at a brand new restaurant.\n\nAnd speaking of dessert, have the bread pudding. It is out of this world. I don't usually go in for desserts, but this was unbelievable. Words won't do it justice - you have to try it yourself.\n\nMy only complaint (and it's a big one) is that our otherwise fantastic dinner was conducted in a loud and boisterous bar. By the middle of the meal conversation was difficult, and by the end it was impossible. Dandelion Market was definitely a better bar than restaurant at that hour. Maybe it's better earlier in the night?
