Don't stay here, rather sleep in your car. Every worker says something different, prices change from one worker to another. The place looks shady already, the parking lot is filth with empty bottles of alcohol laying outside with nobody to clean up. Overall sanitary and hygiene problem. From the overall looks of the whole place I didn't have such a fond outlook towards it, looks shady.
