New restaurant that just opened up. Usually very crowded and always a wait time. Their burgers are good. However, I got a salad the next time I went and it was pretty good. The garlic fries are an absolute must!! (99 cents more). \nI rated 3 stars because their service was really slow. 1 lady maintaining the bar and the bar area was pretty full. She was our waitress. We continually had to ask (whenever a waiter\/waitress came by) for this and that because they forgot it. Someone, I believe a manager, asked my husband if he wanted a refill on his drink, and he said yes. My husband waited about 10 minutes for it and we saw the guy twice before our waitress got it. \nFood is good, but the service definitely needs some improvement.
