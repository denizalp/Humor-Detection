I've gone to Charles Scott for various services on and off for twenty five years. For the last couple of years I've been getting my hair cut and colored there. Twelve weeks ago I got a Keratin Treatment and it left my hair looking and feeling too good to be true. The upcoming weeks proved that it was indeed, too good to be true. My hair started falling out excessively. I brought it up to my stylist around week 5 or 6 and she told me it was probably hormonal and just a coincidence with the timing. Since then I've lost about 60% of my hair and I decided I needed to find a solution on my own - or possibly be bald. When I went back again for color (and to see if I should even be coloring what is left of my hair), she dismissed my experience and findings and explained that since the product isn't applied to the roots, it couldn't possibly make the hair fall out at the root. My internet research has also showed that my red, itching, burning eyelids and fiercely itching \/ burning scalp are also common side effects of Keratin Treatments. \nMoral of the story: don't get this poison applied to your hair and if you do, don't expect Charles Scott to admit there are any side effects. They've insulted my intelligence and I'm not going back - ever.
