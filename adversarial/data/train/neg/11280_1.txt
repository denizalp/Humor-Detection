This location is great. Always clean. Staff is always friendly. The one complaint I have is, the cashier was complaint about her co-workers with the customer if front of me. I heard the whole conversation, and did not care for her complaining about her job in front of customers. Everyone has complaints about their job, but don't share them with customers.
