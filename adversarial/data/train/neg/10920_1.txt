I have had my hair cut at some of the higher end salons in Vegas. I came in here not expecting much but then I met Tay and she was the best! She listened to what I wanted and delivered!\n\nShe made me feel comfortable and offered a scalp cleanser that made my head feel so good!\n\nI'll be back. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a quality yet inexpensive haircut.
