I came here in October looking for a detail and wax. I paid $140 for wax, deluxe wash, interior detail and orbital paint sealant. The price isn't the problem, it's the service. \nFirst of all, if you pre pay you HAVE to book an appointment two days in advance-but you can't book on Saturdays. Saturdays is for walk ins only. I argued with the front desk girl and explained that didn't make sense to me. If I had not prepaid I could walk in and have the service done but if they already have my money I can't schedule an appointment on that day. The day I prepurchased I asked about scheduling and if there were any days I could not schedule appointments or time frames, the gal stated there were none. The gal at the front desk was not rude, in fact she was very nice and got me in touch with her manager. Frank was his name and he was not as nice, actually seemed frustrated to even speak with me but finally scheduled me on Saturday.\nFast forward to Saturday in late October, they wouldn't do the service because there was hard water on my car. They offered to take off the hard water but would charge me $80. EIGHTY DOLLARS for something household vinegar could remove. I said no and told them I would come back and rescheduled my visit.\nI came back, the following week in order to have the services done. I come in on time and the entire process took a solid 2 and a half hours- not too bad. They complained they saw water spots on my car again but there were none. They also missed spots on my car for the wax and I feel the overall price for service was NOT worth it. \nThey didn't even vacuum or dust anywhere inside my car...waste of $.
