Service was slow, food was forgettable. They also seemed to be out of a lot of things on the menu. My burger came out on soggy toast and basically fell apart in my hands, and my wife's \"brioche croque\" looked like it was on a hamburger bun. \n\nApparently they think adding an 'e' to the end of words like salad and soup makes them better. I don't know. \n\nAvoid this place for lunch and dinner.
