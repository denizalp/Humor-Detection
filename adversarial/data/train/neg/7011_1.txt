This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. The food is always consistent and very reasonably priced. The complimentary chips and salsa is always good. The chips are not greasy and the salsa is not too spicy, but flavorful. The menu items can be found at any typical Mexican restaurant. We always get the chicken or carnitas burrito served enchilada style. The meat is always very tasty and the rice and beans are prepared accordingly. Other items I have tried include, green chile pork and taquitos. Both are very good. \n\nThe restaurant is clean and the atmosphere very Southwest looking. The staff is always friendly and efficient. I started going to Frank & Fina's a few years ago when it was a smaller 15-ish table restaurant. They have since taken over the space next door and doubled the size of the dining room.  You have to assume that the quality and value that they have has generated a loyal following who have recommended it to others. I know I have recommended it to some friends who now dine here regularly as well.
