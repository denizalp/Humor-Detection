Bought my first car here (VW Eos 2009), Junior was our rep. The whole process from start to finish was great. I didn't feel pressured at all and Junior was very informative and transparent. I liked the fact that it was a small dealership and seems they really hand pick each car carefully and aren't just trying to sell anything to you just to make a buck. Since buying the car they have been helpful with all follow up questions we've had. When I go to buy a car here in the future I will definitely be going back and couldn't recommend this place more.
