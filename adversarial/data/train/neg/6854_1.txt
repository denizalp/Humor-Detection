This is my favourite Thai Street food location in ALL of Toronto. The prices are bomb, very inexpensive and the portions excellent. These guys know flavour - those red chilli's are wonderful! My favourite dish was definitely the Duck Wings. Friendly staff and quick service, on a nice street. Cocktails are unique with a Thai flare. Would recommend for any event, casual date or a cozy night with flavourful food.
