the venetian has certainly one of the nicest hotel rooms in the main strip.  this is more of a family oriented resort, and you'll see more families with kids than other resorts. \n\nshopping mall. check. \nrestaurants. check. breakfast at bouchon. sipping martinis at tao. check.\ngrand canal. check. \nblue man group. check.\n\nbut, there's no refrigerator in the room (you can ask for it though).  \nand pools were not as good as other resorts i had been to. \nfrom the pool at the venetian tower, you can watch the construction of a new palazzo tower, which is situated between the venetian and the wynn.  the \"garden\" pool at the venezia tower is smaller, feels more intimate (surrounded by buildings) and provides more spots for shades. \n\np.s. guggenheim museum is not worth your money or time. (the one in real venice in italy is though).
