This place is terrible. The two girls that work behind the counter have no idea what customer service is. I went here to get my propane tank filled and the girl said I had to come back in 30 min cause she couldn't leave the store unattended. I came back an hour later and she said \"her friend wasn't there yet\" for her shift so she still wouldn't fill my propane tank.  Now I refuse to even buy gas from this station and it's the closest one to my house
