Excellent food and enjoyable experience.  I thought the falafels were amongst the best I've had in the Burgh and the beef shawarma was excellent.  One thing to note which is a negative than can easily be turned into a positive is that they did not sell alcohol.  So if you go for a date or something, drop into the nearby state store or beer market to buy some beer\/wine.
