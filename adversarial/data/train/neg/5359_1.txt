If I were to sum this place up... \nI'd say: Inexpensive & Tasty. \nService is eh. Sushi is good for the price. I come here frequently. \nIntroduced quite the number of friends who are in town visiting- all love this place, and mostly rave about, \"how fun it is.\" I suppose there is something fun about watching your food travel on the revolving bar! \nA drawback however is having to wait for a particular roll because everyone sitting ahead of you in the rotation got first dibs and grabbed em' all up! For example, the Vegas rolls. (am I right?!) =)\n9 out of 10 times I've been seated immediately. For the most part I'd say they're generally pretty efficient about that. \nIt's fantastic to get your bill, only to realize after all that sushi, you've spent less than $10!
