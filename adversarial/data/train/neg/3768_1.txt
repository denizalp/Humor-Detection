Ordered a pizza and sub to-go (Keep in mind this was my first time here)  the place looks clean plenty of people in there eating lunch , I was in line waiting to pay and I seen the cook poke his nose and wipe it on his pants he continued to prepare more subs and pizza with out washing his hands.  I ask to speak with a manager (Andy) he ends up being the manager  and I was very respectful when I asked for a refund and gave him the reason.   Stay away from this place or at least just only eat there when Andy the nose picker is not working*** but from what I understand he's been there 3 years.
