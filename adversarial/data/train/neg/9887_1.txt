I went to Sonoran Spine on May 4 2018. I saw Katherine Looby PA. Katherine is a God send. She is amazing and knowledgeable. She went over every inch of my lumbar MRI and explained exactly what is causing my pain. She gave me multiple options and helped me come up with a conservative treatment plan. If even make the decision that surgery is my best option, I will ONLY go to Sonoran Spine for my surgical care.
