Place was great! Not familiar with traditional ramen, but loved the flavors ! Noodles you could tell are homemade. Broth was flavorful and just the perfect amount of broth inside for me. Pork belly inside my ramen was tender and delicious! They have Japanese beers like Asahi on tap which I love ! Can't wait to come back and the full menu!
