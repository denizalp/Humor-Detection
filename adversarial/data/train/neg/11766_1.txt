Under other circumstances, they probably would have gotten 5 stars. However, all the service people (maids, food service, valet) were all on strike. That meant that the restaurant and tea lounge were not open at all. The pool was not open. The breakfast buffet was ok, but again, because it was understaffed, lots of containers of food were empty (especially the fruit bowls and bread, croissants etc). They also did not refresh towels or soaps etc. They had a table by the elevator where you had to get your own towels. They did make the bed and take the trash, but that was it. \n\nI think they should have given some sort of discount during this time because when you go to a hotel, especially a really nice one, you expect certain things. \n\nDespite the strike and limited services, it was ok.
