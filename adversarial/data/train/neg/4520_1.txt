This is the worst Little Caesars I've ever been to, and I've eaten at Little Caesars all over Pennsylvania and Michigan! They must have their oven turned up too high, because the pizza is always doughy in the middle and burnt on the outside.  They must not trust their employees either, because randomly, they won't take cash, even exact change, only credit or debit cards. I've ordered from this place several times, hoping it'll get better, but no luck yet.
