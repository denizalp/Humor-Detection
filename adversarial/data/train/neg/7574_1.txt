Visited Pittsburgh for a birthday and anniversary. Chose this restaurant for our anniversary dinner! Our waitress deserves 10 stars! She was so nice- my husband ordered the steak - cooked to perfection! I ordered the scallops - SO salty! We had an amazing appetizer (pork belly and waffle 10+) and I had some wine, I was a little full so I was sure it was me. Our waitress immediately offered to get me something else (which I love it when they listen to you and don't waste your time with excuses) but I'm just not that person that sends food back unless it is uneatable! I asked her to just box it and thought I would try again the next day (love Leftovers). I love scallops - look how beautiful this dish is!! I wanted to love this! Tried it the next day and realized it was not table salt salty it was more Sea Salt really salty, couldn't eat it - would we go back YES had a great evening with amazing staff - I would address the issue before I order this again because I'm thinking it was a fluke - I want to love this dish -
