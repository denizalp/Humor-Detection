Very disappointed with the dine-in situation here. We've ordered pizzas to-go from here multiple times before and it was alright. Definitely nothing to write home about. So last night we decided to dine in with our 1.5 year old because we heard they had a play area for kids. Well this area is only good for older kids who can play arcade games. The little play structure they have is broken and pretty shoddy. The service was ridiculously slow. They apparently only had one cook in the kitchen. But they also had literally 4 tables to serve. That broke everything apparently. So it took them 50 minutes to get our order out. Add that to the 15 minutes it took the waitress to come take our orders. By which time we were all hungry and cranky. Other tables around us were also getting pretty upset, especially since the packers were playing in 30 minutes and people wanted to go back home. They did try to make up for it by giving us free soup and discounting the total amount as well. But overall this was a pretty pathetic experience. I don't think we will be returning here.
