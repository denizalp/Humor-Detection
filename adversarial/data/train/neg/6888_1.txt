Not quite like 'hot and juicy'.   Crawfish, clams, snow crab, shrimp cooked in garlic butter in a plastic bag.  Yummy until the garlic repeats on you all night long.   For some reason they had fresh oysters but they didn't have any fried oysters ?  Shrimp po boy was nothing to write about.  Place was clean and wait staff was nice.
