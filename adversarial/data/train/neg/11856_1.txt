Great service and GREAT NY style pizza!  This is my favorite pizza in Phoenix... and we all know there are lots of options!  If you liked Mama Mia's... well, I see the same awesome pizza chef behind the counter so it is still great pizza just a new name and new owners... Give this pizza a try and it will be your new favorite!!
