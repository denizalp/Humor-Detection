Have never been here before, but I've been craving some pad thai and a thai iced tea, so I called and put in an order for pickup on a Friday evening. Gal that took my order over the phone was nice. Food was done faster than she quoted. Sticker shock with the price...vegetable\/shrimp pad thai and a thai ice tea = $20? A little pricey in my opinion. A huge serving of food, but the pad thai itself wasn't even that good. It majorly lacked in flavor and there weren't that many vegetables. Noodles seemed a little dry and sticky. Could have used more sauce. Thai iced tea was only okay. \n\nWas not worth the money. Probably will not be back.
