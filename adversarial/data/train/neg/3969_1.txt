Thank goodness for Maha's. After spending lots of time at the hospital, I need a serious break from the same ol' same ol' every day. \nThis place has great service with friendly (and funny!) servers, and their food is hot and fresh! \nI have nothing bad to say about this place. Great pricing, large portions, and on overall very welcoming little restaurant.
