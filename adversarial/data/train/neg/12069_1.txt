Located between Wynn and Encore, this is one of my favorite clubs in Vegas. This club is less of a social scene, and more of an \"edgy\" club, as edgy as Vegas strip can get. But ladies can even wear flats and cool jeans, because it is a You will find here up and coming DJs and have a good time. The dance floor however is waaayyy too small, and you will find people dancing behind the tables and near the back bar too-- or wherever you can find space. Find a promoter to get you on a guest list which usually comes with free entry (before midnight) and a free drink ticket per girl. Boys will have to pay general admission price if they are not on a guest list. The free drink ticket, is for well drinks, simple cocktails, never very strong.
