I work nearby so have been here a few times for lunch\/coffee.\n\nPros:\n- Food is delicious!  \n- Odette quiche (butternut squash & kale) is to die for\n- Pistachio loaf is decadent\n- Overall decor is super quaint & outdoor patio is amazing\n\nCons\n- Pricey - Lunch can run you $14 if you get a combo,  A loaf is $4 (I only come here when I'm looking for a treat!  Can't afford to come here every day!)\n- They charge you $1 for tap water (for the plastic cup) if you take out;  Used to be free but I guess they got tired of giving out plastic cups\n- Service is \"indifferent\" - neither friendly nor rude...but definitely not welcoming
