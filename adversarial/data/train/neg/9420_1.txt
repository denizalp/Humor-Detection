Great little deli dine in martket.  I come here for a sandwhich or sub that's truly unique.  Yea you can hit up subway but ewwww!!!!  This place serves up some mouth watering examples of a proscuitto sub or eggplant parm that are STELLAR!!!  If you're a kitchen pro or a mad scientist their choice of ingredients in the market are inspiring for the next set of recipes!  Though the hours are a bit brief whenever you can catch this place open you'll be more than happy that you did.  Always a great suggestion for first timers and I'll definately be back for more!
