1st of all- $.50 PBR. Let me give you a minute to let that sink it.......got it? Good. We spent $12 on beer. Seriously. It was awesome.The people who work here are chill and pretty cool. We ordered 2 pizzas between 3 of us (I know, I know, we're such fatties). We got the hamburger pizza and the Viva Las Vegas. The hamburger pizza was weird. It tasted just like a hamburger, fries and all. (It even had ketchup!). We ordered it cuz the waiter recommended it. Needless to say, I won't order that again. The Viva Las Vegas though, was MUCH better. Granted, we ordered that later in the night when my taste buds were less discerning. The best thing of the night was the garlic knots. HOLY $h!T, they were amazing!! I ate 2 of them, and I wage a holy war against carbs. Yes, THAT GOOD. For a perfect night, order a couple of beers and garlic knots. You'll thank me.
