I don't typically write reviews but everything about the food tonight was terrible. We started with chips and salsa. The house made chips were dripping with grease and the salsa lacked flavor of any kind. I am fine with paying for chips and salsa, but I expect them to be above the complimentary chips you would get in other Mexican places, these did not come close to that expectation. For dinner, my wife got chicken fajitas. The chicken came uncut, just 4 pieces of chicken. She said there wasn't much flavor at all and had to ask the waitress for some salt. I got the chile relleno and it was the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten in my entire life. The only thing that it tasted like was grease and that was because it was soaked in it. It was pretty obvious that their fryer was nowhere near the temperature that it needed to be to cook the relleno and that just shows that the chefs took no pride in the food they served. It had been a while since my wife and I had been here and we wondered why that was. We now understand why it had been so long and why it will be a much, much longer time until we go back.
