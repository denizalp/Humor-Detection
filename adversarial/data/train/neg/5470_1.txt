I had the pleasure to stay here for a company trip and I would certainly come back on my own dime. Great accommodations, the rooms are clean and artfully decorated. Minimalist influence and mid century modern flair. The staff at the bar and The Grill are amazing and cheerful. I had breakfast at The Grill and could not have had a better start to my morning. Angelina, my waitress, was kind, sweet and very thoughtful. She ensured my order was hot and exactly as I asked. The was extremely helpful and ensured my coffee was hot and fresh. I never had to ask for a thing, she anticipated every request. Captain Burrell, the sous chef, was loud, fun and cheerful. I enjoyed speaking with him and he ensured the cook had my order ON POINT! The staff at The Grill was definitely the highlight of the trip and seal the Gold Spike as my favorite downtown Las Vegas hotel.
