This was a fun mall\/grocery store visit. I came looking for looseleaf green tea based on a tip from a Yelper. Found the tea in a smaand looked at other interesting items. They carry lots of imported foods and have a small but nice produce section. The strawberry packages were huge -and those berries looked delicious! It was an early Sunday afternoon and hardly anyone was there, so no lines. I wish the tea selection were larger.
