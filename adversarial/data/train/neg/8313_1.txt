We went here on Sunday and it was good food , but what was on the menu  compared to what was in my food was completely different. When I asked the  waiter he acted if I didn't know what I was talking about so I have to assume it is correct, just not listed on the menu . Which to me is a huge issue as what if your allergic to that food that has been added . \nThe hostess spent most of her time texting as the rest of the staff ran around trying to keep up with the rush of guest. Hopefully management can work on those things as I do not like when I see someone texting at work in front of customers! Especially if I have no water and your more than capable of doing it !
