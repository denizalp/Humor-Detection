I've been here a few times with my cat who always needs to be sedated because he's a tiger in a little body. The staff is very kind and accommodating. Dr. Brown went over everything with me when we were trying to figure out if my cat had pneumonia or asthma. She went over the options and told me the pros and cons. I didn't feel rushed and really felt that the staff cared. They even gave me a few samples to help with my cat taking meds. Thanks Piper Glen Animal Hospital for easing my anxiety.
