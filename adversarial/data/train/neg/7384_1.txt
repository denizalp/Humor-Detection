This place is lit fam.\nFirst, not many places do hot plates, and the ones that do, don't do it good.\nSo this is where this place takes the cake, or the hot plate.\n\nWhat I also love about this place is pretty much everything is made by them, even their ice creams.\n\nThe place is neat, cozy and cute. It has a more intimate vibe in contrast to demetre's or other upbeat dessert places.\n\nWe had Brownie hot plate with Earl gray ice cream and nuts. I was kinda weirded out when i heard about the flavour but the taste took me by surprise.\nTop it off with some hot tea and that sums up your perfect dessert experience for the night.
