A stockpile of every supplement under the sun? Yes.\n\nSuper-smart, helpful if quirky staff? You bet.\n\nBut also of note - a comprehensive collection of Gluten Free foodstuffs - bread mixes, pastas, fresh bread, frozen meals - curated very, very well. Take it from a gluten free chef nerd - they may not have quiiiite as much stuff as HHM but what they do have is the best of the best.
