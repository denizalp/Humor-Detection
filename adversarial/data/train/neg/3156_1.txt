Delicious BBQ, especially for a place in WI. This place is known for its ribs, and it deserves the praise it gets for them. There are some other hits, and some less than stellar items on the menu. \n\nWe got the half slab and jumbo 1\/2 chicken dinner to share, which was huge! Big portions, but the chicken was really dry. The ribs were amazing. We also ordered some beef brisket, which is a much smaller portion than the ribs and chicken. If you're not a fan of fatty brisket (like me) than you'll be quite happy with their brisket. No awkward moments of biting into a string of fat and trying to spit it out in front of your date. \n\nThe sides, overall, could be better. But lets be honest, you're not here for the sides. If you don't want to order any sides you'll save about a buck, but it's worth it to venture out and try them. The baked beans were iffy. I heard a lot of good things about them via Yelp, but ours were grey-ish and tasted off. The potato salad is definitely full fat and more mayo based. It's a nice and cool way to offset the kick of BBQ. The french fries are more run-of-the-mill than anything else here. We also tried the fried biscuits after seeing so many people rave about them. Maybe I had too high of expectations? They were good, they tasted a bit like carnival food, but they didn't garner a \"Oh my, I'd eat these every day if I could\" opinion like the ribs did.\n\nThe sauce here is unlike any other BBQ sauce I've ever had. It's a bit chunky and sweeter than usual but has a nice kick at the end. \n\nDefinitely go for the ribs. The brisket is good. Chicken could be better. The sides are hit or miss. We got take-out since the seating is limited. It's also pretty loud there, lots of people talking and loud music. I'd definitely recommend this place!
