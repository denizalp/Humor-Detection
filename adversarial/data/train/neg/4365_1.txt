From W & M Venter\n\n\nThe BREL team, especially Brendan and Melanie, make the impossible seem effortless. Relocating across the country is a difficult task, even if you plan months ahead. So we were beyond stressed out when we had to put our downtown Toronto town home on the market, pack up our lives, and fly to Vancouver in less than a week. \n\nChoosing a realtor is challenging. It's one of the most important business decisions we make. And let's be honest, it's often a blind decision because most realtors don't have lots of information on their websites! Fortunately, that isn't the case with the BREL Team. Their website reassured us that we were working with a full service agency with extensive experience and skills in marketing, staging, and everything that comes with selling a home in the competitive Toronto market.\n\nEven better, they exceeded our initial expectations! We met Brendan and Melanie at our very worst. Sleep deprived and surrounded with boxes. But they still managed to stage our home perfectly for marketing and viewings. We were amazed when we received an offer after only 3 days on the market. It was even over our asking price!\n\nThanks so much to everyone on the BREL Team for all your hard work. If you are looking for a realtor your search ends here. They are the best real estate agency in Toronto, no contest. We can't recommend them enough!
