Applebee's...what can I say? Like all franchises similar to Chili's they serve up your classic dishes and have a variety to choose from that will tickle many their fancy. This location is located in Boca Park...Summerlin so not only is it clean on the inside of the restaurant but also clean in the parking and neighborhood surroundings. The Car side to go is amazing! Another convenient way to get your food fast! It's your typical neighborhood bar\/grill, different dishes and so forth. Food is mediocre to delicious but I give it 4 stars for the great servers each time u go to this place.
