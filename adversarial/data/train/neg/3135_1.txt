Popeyes has good fried chicken. It is greasy, but kind of like most fried chicken is greasy. I am always surprised at the reviews that suggest this is (or should be) anything but the unhealthiest place to eat on earth. The chicken and the tenders are simply greasy goodness.\n\nThe problem here is that both Popeyes inc. and this location are a customer service train wreck.\n\nThere are extra charges for everything (sauces, refills, etc.) Good luck trying to get an extra napkin.\n\nWhen they don't have what you've ordered prepared, you will wait and wait. Instead of offering an extra sauce or fry, they tell you to move because you are in the way of others trying to order.
