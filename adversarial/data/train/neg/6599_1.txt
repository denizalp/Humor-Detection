The service was a bit slow. There were quite a few people eating when myself and my friend arrived and it took a very long time for someone to finally come take our order. The drinks we ordered were iced coffee and were not brought right away but about 5 minutes after ordering. The coffee was very good and very strong, perfect for Vegas hangover. I ordered a pork sandwich and it was so good. The meat was great and the bread was so light and fresh. I could tell they bake the bread on-site everyday. I really enjoyed the food here and would eat there again. The pho looked really good too from what I could see around me.
