Steve with Smart Security Systems gets Five Stars (I would give Ten if I could)! I purchased a new DVR for my current Q-See wired home security cameras and needed someone to install the new DVR and install views on all mobile devices. Steve answered the phone, scheduled me for the very next day, was ON time, had all the right tools (and knowledge), installed the new DVR and apps quickly and perfectly! Fair, Honest, Dependable and Smart! Steve is now a permanent contact on my phone :-). Thank You Smart Security Systems! We are happy to have our camera security system back in order.
