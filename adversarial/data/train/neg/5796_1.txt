Bad service and bad food. I try not to write bad reviews but this one I should let people know not to have any expectations. We had to wait for our egg sandwiches when in fact these made ones were sitting on the counter for 20 minutes. We asked if these are ours twice to the waitress and she said it's not and 20 minutes later she said it's ours, it's already got cold been sitting on for so long. The sandwich tasted so bad that I could only take a bite. So disappointing having a such a bad service especially location from codmopolitan.
