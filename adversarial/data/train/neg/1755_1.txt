I admit that I went in because I saw the sticker on the door \"people like us on yelp\":) \n\nI ordered hazelnut latte, very rich foam, although instead of hazelnut, it has a caramel taste to me, but i loved it.\nLove the cream flake cake, just to me the \"top\" part (whatever it called), should be crispy rather than chewy. Kinda disappointed, \n\nIn general a great place to spend some time with friends or just by yourself~ Added it in to one of my regular spots \n \nYelpper love it for a reason :)
