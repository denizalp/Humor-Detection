Customer service was blah. But food was good. Too bad the servers don't really know much about what they are serving. I enjoyed the food though. It does get very busy & the wait can be long. My best advice is too call ahead & see if there is a wait. Cool thing about this place is they do have dim sum to go!!!!!
