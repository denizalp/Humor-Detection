I wish I could give this place 0 stars because it's too crowded you won't be comfortable or have a nice time unless you are in a section and the security acts as if they are police I don't was put out for smoking and then the security try and I tell me I had to leave the whole property umm you are a security not police so he called the police on me this is not a way to be treated in vegas
