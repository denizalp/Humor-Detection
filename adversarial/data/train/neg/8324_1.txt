We've been to Joe's twice now and both times had a great experience. The servers are attentive and do a good job of clearing plates in between courses. Our server this time (Clayton) explained that they have no heat lamps so food is brought out as it comes up. Their menu reminds me of tapas, and is plated and priced that way, so food coming out at different times is logical. It does take a little longer for plates to come out, but after sitting at the bar in front of the kitchen it makes sense; EVERYTHING is fresh and made on the wood fired grill (plus they play awesome classics like The Big Lebowski to entertain you while you wait.) We have tried a good variety of menu items at this point; mushrooms, skirt steak, short ribs, veggies, Shishito peppers, Notorious B.I.G., Tartine, Strawberries and Oranges. I got the peppers and the steak twice because I enjoyed them so much. Everything is seasoned well, I loved the Romesco on the veggie plate. \n\nI think this spot caters mostly to industry people and to a late night crowd, which some people don't get, despite the name. It's frustrating when you get out of work late and the only food around is fast food. Joe's has great music, good food (which the price is fair for), and it's fun. Phoenix needs more places like this and honestly, I feel like the people who don't feel that way just don't understand it. I'm tired of just burgers and fries at bars, so thank you Joe's.
