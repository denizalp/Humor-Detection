Found this place on yelp - went and was sooo amazed. OMG the food was amazing - the people are outstanding, the ambiance was super cool - I loved this place!!! Fresh ingredients, food awakens your taste buds, just wonderful. Had the veggie crepe...comes with a little salad on the side that you eat with it...YUM\nNext time I am trying a sweet crepe. On my list as a new fav!!!
