Wow!  Coming from Arizona you have the belief you can't get good Mexican food anywhere else.  Don't be fooled by that thinking.  The food here is fantastic!\n\nStarting with the chips, salsa, and bean dip to the unbelievable fajitas.  You're most certainly will not be disappointed with a trip to Juan's!9010 W Flamingo Rd, Las Vegas
