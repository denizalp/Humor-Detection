This was definitely a HOOT!  We went for the Sunday SALSA brunch.  \nThis is the deal... you head in for 11, and the meal is 15 dollars flat.  \nIt looks like a nice south amercican place... bright colours... big sunken dance floor.  \nthey serve spicy rice, a spicy chicken with beans,... pasta, sausages, potatoes, eggs..... your basic breakfast stuff.  \nAgree with the review below... drinks are a little expensive.  \nSo, you do the eating thing.... then the instructor calls everyone out on the dance floor.  EVERYONE is there.. there were families, kids, old and young folks, and we go through some basic Salsa lessons.  This instructor was fantastic... he was so funny, and I think I really improved my Salsa moves.  Well, that's what my girlfriend said anyways.  I found this less intense and I had less anxiety about this then when doing actual dance lessons.  \nA live band comes on and we continue the Salsa lessons.  We went back for some water and sagria refills... and we stayed for about 3 hours in total.  \nFor the breakfast for both of us, 2 mojitos, and 1L of Sangria, with tip included, cost us 80 bucks (40 each).  \nSo... food was meh... drinks were meh... instructor and vibe was delightful.  I'd go back.  Yay!
