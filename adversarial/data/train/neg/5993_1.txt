Really friendly place and good food overall.\n\nI ordered the baked ziti and it was just how I like it.  I'm not a huge fan of any red sauce but they mix in a lot of cheeses which gives it more of a blended flavor.  Usually when I see \"baked\" and \"pasta\" I expect a soft, mushy mess, but the ziti had a lot of firmness to it which is what I want.\n\nI didn't get around to eating the garlic bread until an hour after I ordered and I was expecting a brick, but somehow it managed to say soft.  Nice bonus.\n\nI got a slice as well to try it out.  They serve thin pizza, but I'm more of a thick crust person, but it was good overall.  The crumbled sausage is just what I like.\n\nThe staff was friendly and they seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Nice place to take a family.
