I've been going here the past 5 years.  Never had any problem with the staff.  They've always been very friendly.  Ilya doesn't smile a whole lot but he does make you feel welcome and appreciates your business.  I welcome the fact he'll actually talk to you while he cuts your hair.  Having a mute barber is uncomfortable.  At first the cuts were great but it just seemed like with the amount of barbers that have come and gone the quality has kinda diminished. There is one other regular barber there that does a great job but I've forgot her name. She doesn't seem to work when I can make it in.  With that I'll say I'm happy when I sit in llyas chair, it's like the days of 5 years ago.  I could make an appt and make sure I always get him but when you don't have that luxury you tend to count on consistency.  That seems to have dropped off. I'm hoping for a rebound!
