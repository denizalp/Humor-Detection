Let me preface by saying I never write reviews, but I had such a good experience at this restaurant that I had to. My boyfriend and I were in town for the weekend and felt like sushi, and this was close and highly rated. We got there a little early to our reservation and were immediately seated. We ordered a few of the appetizers which were brought out in about five minutes (hot and freshly made, not like they had been sitting there or anything), and our rolls were brought out 5-10 minutes later. The food was great, and Juno (manager or head chef I assumed) was extremely entertaining. He not only sent us over some free samples, but he visited each table to make sure everything was satisfactory. He was cracking jokes the whole time, with the patrons and employees, which I found hilarious and really added to the overall experience. The waitresses were all very attentive and nice as well, each of them coming to check on us more than once. Ultimately, I can see why this place has such a high rating. I highly recommend you try this out if you're craving sushi and a good time, and I wish this place was in Denver :)
