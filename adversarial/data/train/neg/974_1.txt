service was so slow but the food is good!\n\ni like how they serve the salsa so you can pour it on your plate and add some hot in there!  the chips and salsa are good which is an absolute must in a mexican joint.\n\nthe manager kept flirting with our table and it was somewhat bothersome because we were all starving, not very talkative, and the service was so slow- please buddy just bring out our food!\n\ni ordered the mexican chicken pizza.  it comes with pickles, i prefer guacamole as the green on the mexican pizza but overall, i liked it.\n\ni would go back with hopes the service wasn't as slow and the manager wasn't as perverted.\n\nYah!
