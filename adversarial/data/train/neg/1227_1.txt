Top notch staff. I recently visited a few weeks ago to find the best dentist office I have visited. Everyone was very friendly, professional and helpful. The secretary at the front desk was wonderful and called me to say an earlier appointment opened up, so I went. After a brief chat with her, I met the hygienist. She took great care to be gentle on my teeth, and explained the cleaning procedure thoroughly and with a warm personality. At the end of my visit, another friendly face, the doctor, came in to chat about my dental needs and went over my xrays. Great office. Arrive in advance as parking is a bit hard to find in Dormont.
