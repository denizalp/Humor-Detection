We went there after meeting a representative from their office at the Queen Creek Farmers Market. I must say I should have known from the time I tried to make the appointment. They were non-responsive to phone calls and emails most of the time. In fact none of my emails I don't believe we're ever answered. Then when I met with the tax preparer it was a quick 5 minutes in and out type of situation. When I'd ask that if there was anything I was missing or he had any other deductions I may have failed to put down to please let me know. That never happened either. Upon completion of our taxes we went to pick them up and met with a lady there. When we ask questions of certain things on our taxes she had no idea and said you would have to ask the accountant. Well that would have been nice if we had an appointment with the accountant so all in all I guess I'm used to a little more personal service perhaps that day is gone but I will not be going back.
