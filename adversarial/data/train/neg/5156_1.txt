My wife and I ducked into this restaurant on a whim, and I am so glad we did. The concept is unique and refreshing, the food is amazing, the presentation impeccable, and the ambiance very cool. Our server, Abraham, obviously took pride in his work and was on point the entire meal. We received the perfect amount of attention--we did not want for anything, while at the same time never felt nuisanced or harrassed. He was also extremely informative and helpful, and his recommendations were fantastic.\n\nOver dinner we discussed how it's been awhile since we have been excited about a new restaurant  (and we eat out quite a bit....I just slack on the yelp reviews unless I REALLY like a place). This restaurant did just that and we look forward to returning to try as much as we can. Definitely check this place out!
