Hawthorn, I had a great stay thank you so much! The staff was so friendly and accommodating. The desk agents were so sweet. I showed up in tears due to first booking at the Extended stay next door. I couldn't stay there it was disgusting and I felt unsafe. I had to get out and quick. I had just flown in for the weekend and was with out a car so I lucked out by finding this place right next door. With my phone at 1% and I was with out a charger I was slightly freaking out. She got me checked in while I drank the delicious cucumber water I should of known then I was going to love my stay. Also in the lobby they have coffee and dog treats guessing they are a super dog friendly hotel while checking in she introduced me to a dog coming in from a potty break thought that was pretty sweet.  After getting me checked in she found a charger for me to borrow I told her I would sit in the lobby to charge not wanting to put her out by taking off with it but she insisted and \"take it to you room get comfortable\"   The room was a nice size. I guess its a North Carolina thing to get a mini kitchen in your room I wasn't expecting nor need a full dish washer shoot I've lived in houses with out not complaining because I would if it didn't have at least a mini fridge and microwave here you get a full size fridge. The breakfast was the best free breakfast I ever had at a hotel. Lots of choice from the standard make yourself waffles to the not so standard packaged hard boiled eggs. The breakfast attendant continued to cook and bring fresh items out like the bacon and eggs and it doesn't end till 10am! Thanks for thinking of us who like sleep! The location was prefect as well, I used Lyft to get around and it was right around $10 to get to everywhere I went, downtown and a few breweries really close by.  Thanks again Hawthorn if Im ever in Charlotte I will stay here!
