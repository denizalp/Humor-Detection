Wow! Dr. Gandhi and Nancy were simply wonderful. I've unfortunately had my fill of cavities (see what I did there), but I can honestly say that this was the easiest and most painless appointment I've ever had with a dentist. I needed to have a couple of cavities filled along with a cleaning, and I almost always shed a tear or two when I visit the dentist. However, Dr. Gandhi is very detail-oriented and gentle...I didn't even realize when I was getting the injections! The office is clean and the staff friendly. Definitely recommend this place.
