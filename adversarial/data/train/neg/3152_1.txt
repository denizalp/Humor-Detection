My 14 year old daughter and I had a wonderful time here. Jennifer was great with my daughter... mani\/pedi with designs. Took her time and was very caring and thoughtful. Nikki did my new, full set- pink and white. She did a fantastic job- Uber impressed with the quality of work. Very friendly and talkative. Highly recommend!
