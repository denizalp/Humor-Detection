I'm from out of town, and decided to try this place for breakfast. It was UNBELIEVABLY GOOD! The caramel iced coffee was seriously amazing. It was unlike any coffee drink I've had before. And the s'mores waffle was so darn yummy. I also found it cute all the servers were in their PJs. If I could, I would put this place in my pocket and bring it home with me to North Carolina!!!
