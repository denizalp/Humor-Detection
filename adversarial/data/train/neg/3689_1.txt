This place is out of this world! First off, the vibes and the feel of this place are instantly elegant and chic! From the pink roses to the beautiful chandelier, this place was definitely made for a romantic experience. Don't let the outside fool you! It looks like any other restaurant surrounding it. \n\nI ordered a raspberry lemon drop and my boyfriend ordered the bourbon mule. Let me just say, my martini was made with fresh muddled raspberries and tasted perfect. The equal parts alcohol and equal parts raspberries and pink sugar around the glass rim were on point. \n\nWe ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce and the chicken parmesan. Both were extremely delicious! I highly recommend both dishes. Each meal was enough food for 2 people. They didn't serve only Italian. The menu ranges from different cuts of meat and fish, cheeses, pastas and soups. \n\nDefinitely excited to come back to this local place! For being off the strip, fairly priced and one of the best meals I have had in a while this place is definitely going on the top of my list.
