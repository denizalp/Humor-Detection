Stopped in Barrio with a friend following a Browns game based on the recommendation of our hotel bartender.  Was fairly busy, but not packed.  Sat at the bar because as that seemed like the best seats to view the tvs.  Both bartenders that took care of us were very good.  We both ordered the build your own tacos.  Tacos were good and reasonably priced at $3 per. They arrived to us quickly and were hot.  They have a great selection of tap beer that ranges from $4-$6.  I didnt count the selections,  but seemed like at leat 25-30 taps plus another 30+ different bottled brews.  Would definitely eat here again.
