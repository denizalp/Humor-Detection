We have been thoroughly impressed with this restaurant for a while. We had a birthday party with a group of 18 people last week. Sheena was amazing to work with...from getting us set up ahead of time and The night of the event, everything was perfect! \nEveryone loved the food and it was timed perfectly without feeling rushed. Definitely check this place out and we especially love the Bolognese!!!
