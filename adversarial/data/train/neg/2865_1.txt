It's not every day that you see this many 5 star ratings on a single place, but Art of Flavors is the real deal. It is the best Gelato I have ever had. Desyree is outstanding. The Gelato is fantastic. She has all kinds of flavors from chicken wing to strawberry. The price is great. The location is a little shady, but she makes the inside of her shop come alive. I am from Salt Lake City and it is a must to stop at Art of Flavors when we are down there. if you are in Vegas for a while or just a quick trip, make sure this is one of your stops.
