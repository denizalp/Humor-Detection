The staff are very polite, courteous and check in was very quick. Unfortunately that is the only thing positive about our one night stay. The room is in need of updating, it smelled of stale ashtray, and the mattress is in desperate need of replacing - zero support and my wife and I kept meeting in the middle from the sagging of it. Yes, if you need a place to stay near the airport it's not far, but there are also a lot more choices. Had I paid 60$ for this room, I would say I got what I paid for. Paying double that, I expect more (like not waking up with a sore back)
