Soooooo glad to get an authentic taco place in Henderson. Usually I have to go all the way to north town! The place is really nice and upscaled compared to original taco shops, but the customers here are different and prominently white so I didn't expect an authentic and rustic looking taco place. Plus it wouldn't fit in the neighborhood it is in. Personally I love that the place is modern but the food is authentic. It's clean and a great place to go eat. Prices are a tiny bit higher than in the north but that was expected. Thankful that I can go 10 minutes down the street instead of half an hour across town. If only we had an authentic Mexican grocery store near so my mom can get all her needed ingredients she drives across town for. Get on it people!! Haha
