I've heard about this place for months now and finally had a chance to try it out. \nMy best friend and I went to dinner for a girls night, we loved the way the outside looked- nothing fancy, but clean. That generally bodes well.\nSo we get inside and are asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't, but were seated right away. \nOur server was Chip. \nChip was a FANTASTIC server, I've never had someone spend so much time explaining the menu, the specials, and made sure all my questions about the cuts of meat were answered. \nIt was half priced wine night, we split a bottle of moscato and it was delicious. \nMy friend ordered the filet with Caesar salad and fried potato bites, she was very pleased. \nI ordered the Delmonico with salad and fries. I was completely blown away! It was cooked perfectly medium and was so juicy and tender. \nNormally when I order steak out I use sauce and I used none for this steak. I am seriously impressed. \nWe shared the apple pie for dessert which was also delicious. \nThank you, Chip, for giving us a wonderful dining experience!
