Disability help center of Arizona is awesome. I had Attorney Dave represent me in my disability court case and I will say that he is one of the most professional, caring and knowledgeable Attorneys you can hire to fight for you in court. He was ready and prepared the day of court with all necessary papers, medical reports and Dr's notes needed. He handled the case great and had all the proper answers and response to any questions asked. I will definitely recommend him to anyone looking for legal representation in their disability court case. Extremely pleased with the level of professionalism and representation. Thank you Dave for representing me and handling my court case.
