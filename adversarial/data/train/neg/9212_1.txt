Take it from an Australian - these are tasty pies! The classic Beef 'n Beer is exactly what a pie should be. The Braised Beef Rib is delicious, and reminds me of the home-made pies available back home, with delicious gravy and big chunks of beef. Their dessert pies are also quite genius, with some classics (Banana Cream, Apple Crumble) as well as some inventive and interesting flavours such as the peanutbutter cup which is filled with tasty peanutbutter cream and topped with chocolate.\nThe pastry is flaky and delicious, well cooked, and holds its form beautifully (though the little pie pans are a welcome addition for those not accustomed to eating them by hand).\nEating in at the Dundas St W store is always a delight, and the take-home frozen option is perfect for when you just want to sit at home and do some good old fashioned pie binge-eating.
