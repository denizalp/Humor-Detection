I have stayed at this location at least 5 times in the last few years.  We choose this location because they are fantastic!  I love the room lay out with a living room area and bedroom area in most rooms.  They are super clean, and truly make our experience a great one!\n\nThey have a pool with hot tub.  My favorite thing here is the courtyard.  They have big comfy couches around fire pits.  It's so pretty and a great place for people to sit around, have a drink and socialize.  \n\nMy company host events here about two times a year and even from an event space perspective it's great!  They make sure we always have what we need, allow us to change up the menus or needs of room, and go out of their way to make things perfect!  When you check in they offer a bottle of water and in the evenings have cookies!  :-)  \n\nThe restaurant is pretty good too!  Their french toast is my favorite thing!  The bar is a busy place, it's pricey but it's a nice place to hang out and drinks are super good!\n\nLocated in old towne Scottsdale so everything is within walking distance. Love this little area, especially during spring!
