I can't believe how many years we've lived in Surprise and haven't tried Saigon Kitchen!  We had no experience with Vietnamese food and tried it on a whim. It was nothing like the images we had in our heads. This place is amazing! The food is very flavorful and there is something for everyone. Our 5 year old daughter loves it! If you're thinking about it, come. They are so nice and welcoming. We will be back again and again!
