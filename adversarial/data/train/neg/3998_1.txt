I have come to this specialty store that specializes mostly in competition firearms but it also is a CZ firearms dealer as well. The customer service that JJ Recaza and his team provide here is top notch which brings me back to this place over and over. The knowledge the employees have here is superb as well. JJ's team is not about selling, they are about relationships and getting their customers what they really need. \"Joe\" is also an expert and I have the pleasure speaking with him from\nTime to time. Visit this place and you will have a great experience such always do.
