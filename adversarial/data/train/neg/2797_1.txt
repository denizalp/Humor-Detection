First the bad...the amount of oil and butter used in the making of this order would make Paula Deen proud...yet.....\n\nThe food was delicious!! I ordered a small cheese pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and extra cheese...it was enough to feed 3.. Just have wet naps available...and I ordered 6 breaded wings with garlic sauce...there were at least 2 sticks of butter remaining in the container after the wings were gone..and yes, they were devoured!! So good!!! \n\nDelivery was pretty quick as well...
