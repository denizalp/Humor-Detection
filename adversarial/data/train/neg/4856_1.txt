Wow, I must say that I was very impressed. I walked all over the Vegas strip after riding on the High Roller trying to get to Caesars Palace. The quest to find this place (not to mention it causing me to be delayed in returning my rental then almost missing my flight) was worth all of the trouble. My brother and his wife recommended I try this place out, and I have to agree that it was a great find! Great service, the sammiches came out hella fast. I got the Hawaiian BBQ and it was super bomb.
