Absolutely loved this store!! Went the other week and we were greeted by owner Jennifer who gave us a new customer welcome bag, coupons, and we happened to be there on a Friday so we got an extra bag of dog treats. The owner was very knowledgeable about supplies, food, etc., and the prices are excellent! I wasn't sure what prices would be like since it's a locally owned shop, but honestly, I thought their prices were better than the chain stores and it was better quality. This will be our new local doggy need spot!! (By the way, the two terrible reviews written are WAY off base, in my opinion).
