went there about two weeks ago ordered the spring salad which came to the table luke warm two bites into it i cracked a tooth on a small rock in the salad. after which i contacted the manager \"james\" who was very  apologetic. continued my dining experience with a pork dish that was terrible more pork fat than pork. for the cost of the dinner there are better places in montreal this is alot of hype and food sucks. just nobody wants to tell you because it's not chic to say. by the way the tooth cost $500 usd to fix i still haven't heard from the owners. watch out for the warm salad.
