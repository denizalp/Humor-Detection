Love this wonderful gem. Everyone is so nice and very polite. Very clean and lots of room. I alway get something called NexGen nails they look amazing. Everywhere I go women ask me about them. You definitely need to try them, much better for your own nails than acrylic. \nI alway make sure I make an appointment.  They do book up real fast.  Thank you for making my hands and feet look beautiful. Whenever I have people in from out of town I take them in and they just love the experience they have there.  I even have a friend who lives in Scottsdale that comes over now and said she pays a lot less here for a better set of nails.
