Staying in downtown Phoenix and craving some sushi, we stopped in. We went right at 6pm on a Wednesday night and they were busy and already had a wait! They serve sushi with black rice which is a neat little fun distinction, but I honestly couldn't taste any difference from usual sushi rice. The OhMyGod roll is a definite must and was delicious! The staff are nice but they were like chickens running around with their heads cut off being so busy. It's a little noisy, but overall a great little place.
