Delicious food! I'd say even better than Barrington's, which is another notable French dining restaurant in Charlotte. Lumiere changes their menu every so often, which I think helps from keeping things repetitive. Also shows that the chef knows what he or she is doing! \n\nWe ordered the scallops, sea bass, chicken, tuna tartar and two types of oysters. they also served a complimentary lobster bisque with a cheese puff. Delicious!! For dessert, we had the chocolate torte and roasted peach. My favorites were the oysters, sea bass and chocolate torte. \n\nOur waiter was kind and friendly, definitely a great place for special occasions!
