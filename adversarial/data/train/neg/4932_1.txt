I've passed by this place many times. I decided to try it tonight since we were just next door at Reboot. Not a very warm welcome upon entering. We were served water but not offered any other beverages. Unless you know the owner\/chef, your order will be prepared last as was the case tonight as two individuals who arrived and ordered after us were served rapidly. A mediocre wonton soup and adequate fried rice took over 15 minutes to prepare in a nearly empty restaurant. The mushy small portion of Pad Thai arrived several minutes after the rice and soup although ordered at the same time. There's just too many other Asian restaurants in the area to justify tolerating this type of meal\/service. Instead I would recommend Thai Noodle House or Oasis Kitchen (Buffalo and Flamingo) it is not surprising that at 730pm on a Saturday night, this restaurant was nearly empty.
