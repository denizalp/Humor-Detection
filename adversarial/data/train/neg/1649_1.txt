I took my parents here for Mother's Day and we loved everything. The Chicken n' Waffles n' Watermelon, Mac n' Cheese, Mango Salad, and Ribs were some of the best I've ever had. We also had the brisket which was decent, but not at the same level as their other dishes. Make sure you save room for the Peach Cobbler and bring a friend to help finish it. Great place for dates, celebrations, or hanging out with friends. They also have one of the most impressive Bourbon selections I've seen.
