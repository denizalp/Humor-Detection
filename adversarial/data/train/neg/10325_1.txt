I've been having bad neck and shoulder pain for the last 3-4 days that just wouldn't go away. I called all around to see of I could get any appointment that was available because I just couldn't deal with the headaches any longer. The lovely front desk staff got me in right away and made my first time experience wonderful. Ginger was my massage therapist and she was such a delight. She was very attentive to my sore spots and my problem areas that were bothering me for days. She kept asking if the pressure was okay and how I was doing. I really liked that she took the time to ask how I came about with the pain and told me how I could keep the pain from coming back. She was such a pleasant person that we talked the whole time I laid there. I found out she was from Hawaii also and we laughed and talked even more. I definitely reccomend going here, and most definitely make an appointment with ginger. Definitely going back again
