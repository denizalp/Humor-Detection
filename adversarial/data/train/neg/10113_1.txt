I am a pizza snob.  I won't eat it unless it's gourmet and super amazing.  \n\nFor 2 years I heard that I must try Libretto, it's so good there's always line-ups.  So finally i did.\n\nDisappointment!\n\nI went with the waiters suggestion and got the duck and pear pizza.  The duck was dry and flavorless and I could barely taste the pear.  The only good part was the dough.. I'll admit that part was delicious.  Now if only the rest of it had been yummy I'd have been in pizza heaven.\n\nI would not go back.
