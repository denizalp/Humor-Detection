I had a coupon through my work for a $50 dollar off massage so I decided to make the drive to this location for a massage. Overall, my experience here was good. They have a small waiting room, but it is very comfortable and clean. Also, the customer service was very good- everyone was very nice and accommodating. \n\nI had an hour massage and the therapist was very nice and professional. She asked questions about pressure, temperature, etc., which I really appreciated since I have had several massage therapists who do not ask this question. \n\nMy complaint is the massage did nothing for me. I went in looking to release the tension in my neck and jaw and this did not happen. I prefer my massage to be therapeutic, rather then just relaxing, and I did not get those results from this. The massage was relaxing, but that was about it. \n\nOverall, my experience here was A-OK.
