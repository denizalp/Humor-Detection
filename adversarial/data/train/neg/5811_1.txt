Customer service is really sucks, no exchanges or store credit even if you are not satisfied with the shoes you bought even if you only used them once. Just go to other shoes stores instead like . Return policy is sucks. I rather pay few extra dollars knowing if you're not satisfied with the item you can at least exchanged it.
