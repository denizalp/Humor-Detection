Tow truck driver left me stranded!!!!  Roadside assistance sent this tow truck with the wrong destination address.  I immediately called and had it changed, but the driver refused to wait a couple of minutes until he got the change.  Left me stranded in 108 degree weather.\n\nWhen I talked to the owner of the towing company, he didn't understand the issue and before hanging up on me said, \"fuck you, bitch!\"
