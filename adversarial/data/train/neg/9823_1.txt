Kameron Kildea at Coldwell Banker is my realtor of choice! I have used him on two occasions to buy a home. His professionalism and willing to go the extra mile are great qualities in a realtor. He is not only an advocate during the 'looking' stage but also through the offer and closing stage. Most recently, after the purchase of my home, he has been a great resource for contacts for home improvement. I highly recommend Kameron.
