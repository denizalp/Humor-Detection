Hidden gem. Best hospitality in central Phoenix. Great food. Light fluffy coucous. Started with olives,  carrot and homemade pita appetizer. Spices just right, not over powering like most Moroccan restaurants. Fluffiest pitas ever. Hot mint tea. I had the vegetable couscous (today was potato, changes daily), wife had the lamb couscous. Both were delicious. Finished with baklava (a kind I've never seen before, made a great meal fantastic) and date shake, so good I'd make  a twenty mile detour to eat here. Small building so get there early or on a slow lunch day. My wife had another kind of pastry, which was so good she are it all, very unusual for her. Our host was Abdul. Very gracious, all the while giving fast friendly service, I recommend everyone try this place.
