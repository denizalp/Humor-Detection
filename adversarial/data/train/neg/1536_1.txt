We were in the area for a couple of doctor's appointments and were looking for a place for lunch. Not knowing what was around we rely on Yelp reviews to find this place and we were not disappointed.  The place is small and the service was friendly. And you know it is authentic when you walk in and the customer base is Chinese and the server greets you in Chinese...\nAnyway it was a great meal. We do live too far to come back frequently but we will be back.
