Walked in with high expectations, and certainly was not disappointed. Waiter was kind and attentive. Got the mushroom burger cooked medium. If you like your burger anything under or over medium well, just ask and they will do it. Burger was fantastic and would highly recommend. Also got beer braised buffalo wings, and loved them, but they were $8, which is kind of expensive, but not to bad. Definitely recommend it, and give it a solid 5 stars.
