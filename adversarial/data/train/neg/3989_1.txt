The best Indian in Scottsdale!  \nWe love this place and come here so often they have our order memorized - right down to the naan.  The owners are wonderful people and the staff are extremely courteous and friendly.  My son always orders the chicken Tikka Marsala which is says is the best he has ever eaten and I always get a vegan dish. I have tried the curry, Gobi Aloo and the Saag Aloo all amazing! In addition we love the garlic and plain naan!  This is a must try if you are craving good consistent Indian food!
