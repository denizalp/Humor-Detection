If I could give Allegiant 1\/2 a star I would. This airline is terrible. It is true that the fares are inexpensive, yes. It is also true that you get what you pay for. Lack of communication from the company about flight delays brought me to the airport 3 1\/2 hours prior to actually leaving. This was after Allegiant notified me of my initial 1 hour delay. I don't so much care about the delays, but please communicate that to your customer base. It was 2 hours after the scheduled --delayed--departure when finally an announcement came over the loudspeaker said \"We have just received word that your plane has departed from its last destination, and is headed your way.\" This meant we were in for another 1 1\/2 hours. You can't tell me that you didn't know about those delays when you sent the initial notification. Then my bag was delayed. It seemed never ending. But the plane was clean and the non- reclining seats were newly upholstered. That's all the positive.
