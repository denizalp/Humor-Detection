Gorgeous theatre I was thoroughly impressed by the outer and inner decor. A friend mentioned they had just redone the space and it's absolutely beautiful with great views regardless of where your sitting. Sound us incredible and there are multiple exits and entrances which mean your in and out quickly.\n\nThe cafe is surprisingly mid priced and there is service on the first and second floors which is great for intermission. \n\nOverall thoroughly enjoyed watching the lorax here!
