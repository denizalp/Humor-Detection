I was new to the area, & needed a touch up, after researching online, I chose to go to Glo Medspa.  It was my first visit but certainly won't be my last.  I can high recommend Charles, his attention to detail is wonderful.   He answered all my questions & also followed up to make sure I was satisfied.  My results are great, if you are thinking of touching up your lips, he is definitely the person to go to!
