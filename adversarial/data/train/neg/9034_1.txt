My girlfriend and I literally came here by accident one night not realizing that the old StonePepper's Grill that had previously been in this space had closed. We thought the menu looked expensive but were too tired to go elsewhere. I mention the prices specifically because this restaurant was charging prices in line with places like Il Pizzaiolo or Bistro 19 and delivering Olive Garden quality food and service. I ordered pizza and actually enjoyed it (no doubt the old wood-fired oven from StonePepper's has been put to good use). My girlfriend, however, ordered tortellini that she felt she could have cooked herself. She also ordered a glass of wine that didn't arrive until we had finished our meal. Our waiter was a nice guy but was either new on the job or lightly stoned: he never actually took a drink order, my girlfriend prompted him for the wine. Also, she was apparently supposed to get a salad with her tortellini but by the time we realized it we just didn't have the heart or energy left to bring it up. There is an Olive Garden 2 minutes up the road from here and a Bravo 2 minutes down the road and regardless of your feelings about those chains at least eating at the chains you can feel confident you will get what you pay for. There are plenty of far superior restaurants in the area at Pazzo's price point.
