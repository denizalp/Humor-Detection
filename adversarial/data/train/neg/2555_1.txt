We went for Saturday lunch buffet,food was delicious with many options, except that they don't have any shrimp\/fish items\n\nI felt that this place could be less noisy(TV sound) and more organized with regards to space and ambience\n\nThis is a must try place only for food,but not if u expect Ambience\/dining experience
