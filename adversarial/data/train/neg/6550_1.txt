We don't have an Arby's near us and it has been years since I've had their roast beef and horsey sauce. But we were in the area and we decided to stop in.   It is as good as I remember.   My son had the Reel big filet fish sandwich which he absolutely loved.  It had a lot of tartar sauce but it really was very good. The curly fries were just ok but I was happy to have something else to dip in the horsey sauce which I couldn't get enough of.   I was debating between 4 and 5 stars but my son pushed me over the edge to the 5 star rating.
