Very excited to get a new restaurant in the neighborhood, we stopped by on Day 1. Food was average at best - service was ok and we paid 145 bucks for 2 kids meals, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees priced at 25 each! We had no dessert and 1 drink priced at 12 bucks. A kids grilled cheese sandwich came out with crispy bacon and yellow tomatoes. I am all for healthy eating for the kids but it was too much. I wish them the best but was hoping for a better dining experience. The layout and ambience is nice.
