False advertising. Purchased room through Expedia. Room amenities called out for a game console but when I went down to get it they didn't know about it. I was having surgery so that was the only reason I got it at LA Quinta is for my son to have something to do while I was recovering. BEWARE! VERIFY FIRST!
