My husband and I stopped in here on a whim, and I'm seriously glad we did!! The staff greeted us as soon as we walked in and gave us a rundown of how everything worked, including the fact that all of their fro-yo is organic and they also had some vegan options to choose from (made with coconut milk). She also said that all of the fruit is fresh from West Side Market. Being someone who is trying to buy and eat more local and organic, I was immediately sold.\n\nThe yogurt itself is amazing. I got the pumpkin spice, vanilla, double Dutch chocolate, and vegan coconut. YUM!! I also added some strawberries, cookie dough, and the homemade organic whipped cream. Everything was very fresh. My hubby also enjoyed his vegan chai tea yogurt.\n\nIt is a little pricey, but that is pretty much expected given the quality of the ingredients. I think this will be a regular stop whenever we go to the Coventry area.
