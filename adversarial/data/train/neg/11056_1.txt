Ridiculous.  I never write Yelp reviews, but I felt the need to call this place out.  While I know that in Vegas everything is designed to suck money out of your wallet, this place takes it to an almost-creepy extreme.  As soon as our waiter appeared, I could immediately tell that the first priority was to up sell us on everything.  After being informed we would be charged charged for water(!), and also chips and salsa, we also discovered the entrees don't come with sides, those are also up sells.  Food was OK, but 3 out of 4 dishes were tiny, and I would compare the quality to something like On the Border (who can somehow manage to provide not only water but also chips and salsa for free!).  Most of the entrees were in the mid-$20 range, which normally isn't bad, but It seemed like every visit from our waiter turned into yet another hard sell.  Somehow 4 (tiny) kids quesadillas, an adult vegetable quesadilla, 3 small fish tacos, 1 lemonade and 1 soda wound up being 100 bucks??!  I don't mind paying the money if the food\/service is worth it, but in this case it definitely wasn't.
