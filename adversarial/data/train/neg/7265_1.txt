Great Place!  \n\nClean, friendly and perfect location if you need to stay in downtown Phoenix.  The staff at the front desk couldn't be any better, so helpful and on top of everything.  Doormen, valet and maid service was perfect.  If you need to go to the game its right across the street and there are some cool bars within 2 blocks of the hotel.  Found a gem of a sushi place close by and will yelp review that next!
