Bad sore throat and cold requires soup and this hit the spot. It's good to know that there are Vietnamese restaurants in greater Phoenix and this one is pretty authentic. The seating area is relatively small and there's limited atmosphere which goes along with a storefront in a strip mall. A starter of pork summer rolls rounded out a quick dinner. Although the soup was good and filled with white meat chicken and plenty of noodles, the broth could have been a bit richer.  All in all, if you have a craving for this type of food, it's a decent choice.
