Swensons is a must stop if you are in the Akron, Ohio area. Drive up burger joint with great burgers, milk shakes and fried delectables such as the \"potato teezers\" one of my favorites. Must get the Galley Boy it's a double cheese burger with there special sauce. Great service good drive in food and you wont be let down.
