I like this outlet there's a lot of food places in the same parking lot as the outlets, it's located on las Vegas Blvd between blue diamond and warm springs, the Nike out let is my favorite place to visit here I always tend to find good deals on shoes here. My daughter loves finding shoes here too. It's a fairly decent size outlet with tons of stores to choose from .
