Their seasonal taco salad was a joke, the chicken was all dried out and it was just clunky and difficult to eat, because they put whole tortilla chips in it which are difficult to manage in a salad (served on a plate). The flavour was nothing spectacular, and when combined with the dry tiny chicken cubes it was like a 4\/10. Other than that the other meals I saw at the table looked decent.The service was bad, they were too busy, but should have anticipated that.
