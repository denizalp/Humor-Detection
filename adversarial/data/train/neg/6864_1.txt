I love this place. My gf and I split 'The Big One' Burger, Fries, and Wings. Affordable and I get to make my burger the way I want it with the condiment bar (wagon)!\n\nVery cool that you can see the grill and I enjoy the laid-back atmosphere. Bar is optional and they do have the newer style coke machine which is a nice option if you drink soft drinks.\n\nThe wings are some of the best in the valley! Zipps are my favorite, so you get a gist of what type of wings I like. The ranch here is the real deal as well, which makes a difference. Not bottled or bagged ranch like many of the restaurants use.\n\nThe ONLY issue I have here is that the burgers are cooked WELL done. Xtra well my visit yesterday. BUT, still are great because of the charbroil flavor. I usually order my burgers rare to medium rare (don't have that option here), so I'd rather get a burger at Fuddruckers, but the fries are better here... and the wings and other sides are great options that separate OHW from other restaurants. We had fried zucchini and fried mushrooms as well because my gf's parents ordered them... Everything was more than satisfying and we all had a great dinner! Worth a shot for sure! The restaurant has been here (Phoenix Metro) long before many of us have!
