Went into the store and observed everyone else be greeted and assisted except for me. When I asked to try something on, the sales associate by the name of Hannah pointed to the dressing room. I asked her why I deserved the treatment, she didn't have an explanation nor did she apologize. Not even going to play the race card but it was obvious that I was ignored for some reason. So sad that people still have to receive this type of treatment in 2018. Really loved a jumpsuit that I was planning on wearing to Coachella but couldn't purchase it because I refuse to support businesses that employees that don't treat everyone equally.
