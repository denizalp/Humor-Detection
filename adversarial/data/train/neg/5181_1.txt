i would give this place zero star if i could. (typical raging yelper quote) i am not mad, because i got two buffet for free. i am just mad that i had to spend my dinner eating garbage they serve here when i could've had eaten else where, and be satisfied.\n\nokay, back to realism.  there are quiet bit of selection of food to choose from, and they could look deceivingly good.  but the taste is where my rage-review comes from.  imagine the most horrifying cafeteria food, or your nearby worst buffet food, combine them and you have mgm grand buffet. \n\ntheir rooms are nice , but this buffet needs to move out to elsewhere. \n\njesus, how do they maintain this buffet place?\n\ndinner $29.99 - lol, i won't even pay $4.99 to eat that crap again.
