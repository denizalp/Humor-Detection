Scott Holmes is not afraid to admit it but he is not only replicating Aaron Franklins but at times exceeding it. I have had both and what Little Miss BBQ is doing in Phoenix is teaching the rest of Az how to do BBQ, the best way, the central Texas way and now the Phoeneician way. The student is becoming the master. This is the best BBQ in the state, try the fatty brisket it will make you think of meat in whole different way. The sides are awesome, potato salad and jalape√±o grits. The pulled pork sandwich and house sauce are amazing. You can't go wrong, heed the wait as it will take an hour or two.
