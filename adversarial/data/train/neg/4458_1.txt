Thompson Toronto has a rooftop that's accessible only to guests staying at the hotel or those invited to private events held up there. I was invited to a few events last summer, where I got to check out the rooftop. It had a lovely view of the Toronto skyline, but it can get a little chilly in the evening. Nice place to hang out in the summertime.
