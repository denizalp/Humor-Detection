DO NOT BOOK AT the hotel..ALTHO WE CONFIRMED TWICE DURING THE DAY OF ARRIVAL WHEN WE ARRIVED THEY HAD NO ROOM FOR US...it was a horror show! Then made me walk 2 mi to Mandalay and had to wait for my bag from bell desk for an hour. What a waste of time! This happened to others checking in next to me also.\nthey typically OVERBOOK then shlep you  over to Mandalay Bay without so much as a nod..TUFF LUCK! If you want the hotel..GOOD LUCK! this is a scheme and a racket! Didn't offer any complimentary for the screw job..just ..TOUGH LUCK! Don't be sucked in! This is a huge rip-off...Stay any where else..you're better off..I didn't sign up for paying $500 for 2 nights at Mandalay Bay..GIVE ME A BREAK! It also bothers me they couldn't care less...NOT so much as a \"We're Sorry\" just tough luck.\nWHAT A JOKE! I just realized they are getting $200 more a night at the hotel for my room than what I booked it for in advance..this is TRULY a rip-off..so they give MY reserved room to a walk in for $200 more than I pd for it!  NOW I GET IT!\n\nRIP OFF     RIP OFF     RIP OFF      RIP OFF   RIP OFF    RIP OFF   RIP OFF   RIP OFF\n\nCAN YOU SAY BAIT AND SWITCH??????????????
