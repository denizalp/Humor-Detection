Overall the food was good and place looks great and clean.  We ordered Sisig Bangus and it was awesome!!!  Oxtail soup was too salty.  Monggo beans was okay.  The service was terrible.  Started good getting our order quick but it went downhill after that. We had to flagged them every time we need something.  Not a single time the server even check on us or ask us if we are okay.  This is my third time eating here and it went from great, good, to bad.
