I just had my very first prenatal massage with Joey and WOW was it amazing! They were able to fit me in for a same-day appointment (I called at 3 pm and scored a 7 pm massage!), which was awesome. \n\nJoey and Sue were both super professional and accommodating. Joey's firm hand was just what I needed to release the knots in my lower back and she was extremely knowledgable about the body and how the muscles all work together. I'll definitely be back-- likely in the next several weeks!
