Mood Restaurant is located in the boutique hotel, The Artisan.  The Artisan itself is a beautiful older hotel located off the Strip.  FYI--it is a valet only lot.  When walking inside be careful because it is very dark inside, almost medieval.  The bar and its ambiance are absolutely beautiful!  Bartenders were a little disorganized but nice.  \n\nWe came here for birthday drinks and a birthday dinner.  Our food server was fun and attentive.  From my point-of-view, our food was good but nothing memorable.  I think Todd enjoyed his diver scallops over risotto much more than I.  Of course, I ordered filet but, it was quite bland.  Luckily, it had a port wine reduction to give the meat some more flavor.  \n\nMood has an cute outdoor patio.  However, I'm not sure if you are allowed to dine out there or, if it is for drinks only?\n\nOverall, Mood is a beautiful restaurant inside of a beautiful hotel.  Not sure if I'll come back for dinner but, will come back for happy hour specials.
