Certainly a good Mexican restaurant. I wouldn't go so far to say that it's a great restaurant. \nWe came around 6pm on a Saturday and it was packed. I'm taking 20 tables and 2 servers. The Mesa arts center is across street and so this place fills up with show goers. If you just want dinner be sure to come at 7 after the audience has left- way more pleasant.
