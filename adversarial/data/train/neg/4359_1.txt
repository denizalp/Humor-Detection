Ahhhh, one of the many reasons I love the Venetian hotel: Noodles Asia. \n\nThe shrimp fried rice: excellent (so much that even though we were full - we decided to finish the plate). \n\nWonton Noodle Soup: Mouth-watering. The egg noodles and just the right amount of flavoring... completely over the top!!!\n\nBeef Chow Fun: Not my favorite, but still exteremly delicious!!\n\nMinus one star for the price. I understand it's Vegas and we should expect high prices, but rearlly? $45 for 3 meals... absurd!
