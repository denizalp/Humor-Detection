Our server Tiffany was super sweet! We stopped in for a snack, beverage and people watching on the patio today. We were a little worried at first since the one hostess was a bit snotty while seating us with our kids. She acted like were homeless people with infants, not well dressed with well behaved kiddos. But Tiffany made sure to make us feel welcome! Nachos were $18 for not much but it's Vegas and everything is expensive. My margarita was wonderful and hit the spot on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon in March !
