Go to Italian for all times I hang out with my friend J in the Southside. It's simple and quick and close and the menu is large enough to cut through most cravings. I get.\nThis location get super crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, Sunday brunch\/lunch because it's super close to all the Universities and a magnet for families and groups. \n\n The menu is your standard Italian and I personally like the service at this location over the North Hills Ross Park Mall version [home mall] where it's hit or miss. After you get past a possible wait it's smooth sailing, everybody pitches into the process from food running and clearing the table, refilling glasses and bringing bread. It's a machine. Awesome.\n\nMy favorite for this restaurant is the skinnylicious menu from drinks to salads and foods. I love the mix of asparagus as their go-to veggie and they even manage to sneak in a bunch of carbs in too whether some mashed potatoes [steak dish] or angel hair [shrimp-lemon with asparagus]. very good. PS: do chew your food and not engulf like I do... I completely understand how people can choke to death.\n\nOf course get some cheesecake to go. We bought the Pecan Truffle [and a couple extra ingredients] goodness and the White chocolate Macadamian Nut. [Yum]. Just a hint - these do NOT work when you're sipping Apple Martinis. NO.\n\nWill come again
