Very different style. Choices are endless when customizing your own pizza at 800 Degrees located inside the beautiful SLS Hotel! \n\nOven hot & fresh! I would recommend it as a quick lunch meal! \n\nPricey but can be split with 2 people and worth it!\n\nOnly thing I wish they had was different choices of cheese! \n\nGive it a shot
