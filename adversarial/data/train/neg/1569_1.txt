The food was phenomenal!! Hats off to the Chef!!! Our waiter did a superb. job!! I had the Big Dipper  Sandwich and my husband had the Lava Rock Shrimp TacosI. We can't wait to go back and try a new dish! Oh did I mention the Guy's Cheesecake Challenge,  S'mores Monte Cristo, and the Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae were over the top!! Our table shared the Guy-Italian Fondue Dippers, Righteous Rojo Rings and the best ever Sashimi Won-tacos and we can't wait to try the other two sharables on the menu!! Great time and superior Food!!
