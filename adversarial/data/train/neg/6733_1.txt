Record City is a heavy contender for best vinyl store in Las Vegas. Their selection far surpasses many shops I've visited over the years, and the awesome lady working the store during my visit made sure I felt at home and totally free to shop all morning. After well over an hour and a half of searching through all the great pressings AND deals I walked out with a selection that would have usually taken many stores and two months to piece together --- Hendrix live bootlegs, original Flying Burrito Brothers, CCR rarities, and much more. I will be back and if you haven't been - take my word, get down there and find yourself some fresh vinyl. \n\nNick
