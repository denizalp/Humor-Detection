Food was 4 stars review. \n\nThe reason I gave it a 3 was because we were a party of 12 with 4 separate checks and when we got our individual bills everyone filled them out and left a tip! I double checked mine and noticed that tip was included. I know that is common but I feel the restaurant\/server should tell us that! They almost got a 40% tip. Felt that was dishonest and slimy. Not cool in my books.
