This dentist is a crook. She insisted on working on a tooth that was not bothering my husband.  She then started to grind his teeth down for 2 crowns without my husbands consent. He told her to stop, he did not want the crowns on teeth that where not bothering him. We never went back. A year later we got an insurance statement where she billed for 2 crowns. He never had them. We are suing her, along with our insurance company for fraud. He was seen by a real dentist recently and told what a mess she made of his mouth! Don't risk it!
