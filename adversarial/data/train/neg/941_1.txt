Went to their newly renovated buffet two weeks back during week day lunchtime, i have to say the place looks very nice, clean and modern. I have never been there before renovation so i cant say if it was a big change. But it is definitely very nice and looks upscale.  \nThe super long line outside (seems like 30+ minute wait ) certainly makes the place look attractive too. Even us at the VIP line was waiting 10+ minutes.\n\nThe workers there are not the most friendly, just OK.  They have similar food to all the other feast buffets. The only good thing about the Asian section is they have BOBA and little horchata drinks! It is got to be the most unique choice i have seen at a Las Vegas buffet place, granted it was just powdered made but it tasted good and looked very nice! \n\nThe Asian food though especially the Mongolian beef, was very dry and EXTREMELY salty.  Do try the cold Soba noodles, those were good and an unique offering too.  \n\nTHey also had a wide selection of hummus, that's also worth a try. \nOther than that dessert options were very minimal,  good gelato and good soft serve too. \n\nYou can sign up for their players card and get discounted price, i think it was $8 or $9 for week day lunch. Honestly, the renovation made it look so nice, but the food quality is really only worth $8 and not the full price.
