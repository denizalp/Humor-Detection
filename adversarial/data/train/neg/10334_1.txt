I have traveled to multiple countries and across the USA & this was the worst experience I have ever had with a hotel.  The concierge checking us in couldn't find our reservation, because he kept spelling our name wrong.  Then got the manager out to tell us they basically gave our room away.  The hotel had a 4PM check-in policy, but it did not say anywhere (online, posted, or via our Expedia reservation) that failure to check in by 6PM would result in forfeiture of our room.  We were upset but not loud or rude in trying to question the manager on this.  It was a busy weekend (Caribana) and they obviously sold out (and presumably overbooked).  The manager could not or would not answer our questions and kept saying to just call Expedia.  We just drove 9+ hours from Boston.  This wasn't helpful.  The manager was Matthew Chung.  I can now say I will never book with Marriott again.  We luckily found a helpful staff at the Hilton around the corner.
