Ok. Here is our experience today. Went in with a Groupon I bought. The guy at the desk was nice but whizzed through the instructions. He turned off the sound effects thankfully saying that the loud sounds have been known to scare little ones a bit. I have a 4, 6,7 year old so that was nice of him to do ahead of time. As we entered it seemed fun at first, but then we realized the quoted 5-10 minute time to get through was starting to take way longer. There were giant fake spiders popping out in certain spots and hanging from parts of the ceiling which I thought were way tacky. And a spinning circle floor that was obviously made to confuse direction for the maze which was cool. But the problem is, when we realized we couldn't find our way out and I had one child who was so freaked out and screaming and another one needing to use the bathroom, there was no where to go. There was no call button to the front. So I called the number listed on line hoping to get someone to come and direct us out, but it was only an automated line with an answering service. I can only imagine how freaked out my kids would have been if the scary sound effects were on! It would have been like being in a bad dream. We finally escaped out an emergency exit door we found. Not fun at all.
