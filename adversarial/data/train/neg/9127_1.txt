I scheduled an appointment and was asked about my insurance at that time, over the phone.  Nothing was said about not accepting them.  When I arrived for my appointment, the store was stuffy and I had a general feeling of unease.  The person behind the counter told me they do not accept my primary insurance (which is through one of the largest insurance companies).  I said ok, but asked how much my secondary insurance would cover.  She said \"I have no way of knowing that.\"  I said ok, I'd like to cancel my appointment.  I asked her for the copy of my ID and insurance card that she had just made, and she sort of threw it at me.  Another lady came over who had apparently been listening and she started to explain my insurance benefits.  The insurance benefit was only $5 off the exam, so I decided to look elsewhere for at least a little better savings.  Bad experience and didn't even see the doctor!
