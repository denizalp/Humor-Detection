AVOID AT ALL COSTS! The old blond lady who I believe is the manager of this branch is a total jerk that talks super down on her employees right in front of clients and insult them!!! Plus she doesn't want to help at all most of all doesn't want to work. We arrived at 8:30 pm (they close at 9:00 pm) and she told us that they were closing so we don't have time to try any tuxedo, when I said we still had half an hour left she got angry and argued with me! I tried asking about the deal for free rental for the groom, and she said it was no longer available even if I showed her a coupon I had printed online expiring at the end of this month! They are just making false advertisements and don't want to help. Also they mix and match different brands and types to assembly a tuxedo, looks awkward. Don't rely on the pictures they're using to promote their stuff! There are TONS of tuxedo rental shops in Toronto, ANY other one is better! Run away far!
