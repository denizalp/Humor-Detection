Encanto park is one of my favorite parks in the valley. The ducks and the rides were so much fun for me when I was a little kid. We used to play hide-and-go seek all of the time in the huge play area. The train going around the play area and throughout the park is also a nice touch. When I have kids, I am excited to take them to Encanto park!
