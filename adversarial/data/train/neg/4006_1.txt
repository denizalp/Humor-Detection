Great spot at the Arboretum for a date night or dinner with friends. Low lights and cozy booths make it a comfortable atmosphere. Wine selection is good but the specialty cocktails are tasty. \n\n\nThe steaks are perfectly cooked and can be cut with a spoon. I recommend the wedge salad which can be split, any size filet and the Charleston statue shrimp and grits.
