Duffy's has been around for about 40 years in the Solon area although only about 1.5-year in their current store location between Office Max and Honeybaked Hams.\n\nI had gone to a competitor not more than 1\/2-mile away for the last 3 years until I got fed up with her fleecing (Village Flowers).  Last night, in 10 minutes, Duffy's customized an even more stunning arrangement for half the price that the other place would've charged.  But most importantly, my wife absolutely loved the arrangement!!\n\n(See picture of actual flowers I've uploaded.)\n\nThank you Duffy!  I've found my new florist!!
