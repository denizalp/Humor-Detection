Worst costumer service ever. They had the wrong tag for the coconut bread( the tag was for raisin bread, which was cheaper, and the picture looked exactly the same), and we noticed that when we were checking out. After checking the tag, the male cashier just took the wrong tag away and said \"I'm telling you this is not the raisin bread\" in a very rude manner.  We reminded them to pay more attention to the tags next time, and the female cashier told us they were always busy and often had no time to change the tags, like it was our fault that we couldn't distinguish between coconut and raisin bread. Throughout the conversations, neither of them said a single \"sorry\" to us. The bread and the cookies we bought taste just so so.
