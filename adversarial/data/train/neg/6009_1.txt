Kevin and his staff over at Tableside Gourmet provided an amazing dining experience for us. We held a retreat for 22 of our best managers and we hired Tableside Gourmet to cook for the team on site. Not only was Kevin a fun guy to talk to, but he delivered a fine dining experience second to none. Kevin put together 3 courses of culinary excellence, starting with an amazing bib lettuce salad w\/prosciutto followed by a 'melt in your mouth' surf and turf filet with prawns, then wrapped it all up with a mixed berry cobbler a la mode. It was a fantastic experience! One the management team will be talking about for years to come. Thank you Kevin, From the team at Bay Alarm.
