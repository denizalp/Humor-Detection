I have been visiting this location since 2002 when it first opened, and it is consistently delicious and affordable. I actually crave it at random. It's hands-down my favourite restaurant in the city.\n\nI recommend the chicken breast kabob - tender, juicy, and flavourful. A close second is the Tandoori chicken kabob. Portions are massive, and everything is made to perfection .\n\nDon't be put off by people's reviews of the service. There is no service - you basically order, pick it up when they call your number, and enjoy. Also, they cook in an open kitchen so leave your jacket in the car (if you came in one) - the delicious aroma sticks to your clothes for a long time.\n\nIf you are in doubt, go! You won't regret it.
