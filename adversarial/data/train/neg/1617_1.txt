Maybe I'm one of those lucky, unfortunates that didn't get the enjoyment from this restaurant like all the other Yelpers...\n\nThe service was decent... until it got busy.  The wait on food was horrendous. \n\nWe got the berry French toast.  It was super delicious, but just DRENCHED in that berry syrup, which made it soggy from the get-go.\n\nThe Ono wings were my fave.  They had good flavors, just wish there were more sauce on them or on the side (waitress was too busy, so we couldn't ask for more sauce).\n\nThe burger with the mushrooms... do not get it. They were the greasiest burger ever.  My fianc√© and I wanted to split the burger, I see what the chef was trying to do, he wanted to do us a favor and split it for us in the kitchen, but he didn't have to add more oil or grease or whatever it was then put it back on the grill insides down.  So when that happened, it dried out the meat and made everything else inedible. \n\nAnd they didn't have bottled water... the girl told me, \"our water is filtered though.\"  Ok, thanks... I'd hope so.
