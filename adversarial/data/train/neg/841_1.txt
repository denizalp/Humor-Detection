First time here and I am glad I came. \nPlace was packed for lunch. \nEverything looked great out of the kitchen and the food tasted as good as it looked. \n\nThe price was very reasonable, though some items were a bit small for a portion.   The taco's were tiny and only 2 mini ones for $8. \n\nThe mains were all great portions and we're very reasonable. \n\nFor taste they were spot on for the dishes I ordered. \n\nI will be back.
