When my parents are in town for holidays, I take full advantage. See, as a city dweller, I do not own a car. Like most city people. So when they visit, I use them and their vehicle to run errands; such as to the library to return a huge multitude of books. That's what took us to the squirrel hill neighborhood; and I can't wait to return to this place again and again.\n\nFirst and foremost, for a little pizza eatery and beer shop, it has some kickbutt pizza. We opted for the Sicilian style; but they also have regular, gluten free, Allergen friendly, and vegan options (pizza, pasta, and many other choice of items too).\n\nI picked up a single bottle of beer; though they offer 6 pack carry out beers too (mix your own or buy a non mixed 6 pack).\n\nI'll be back many times as long as I live in the neighborhood!
