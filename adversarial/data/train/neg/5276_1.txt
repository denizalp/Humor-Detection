It's standard Keg fare, doesn't disappoint and is pretty consistent. I would say that this location has a bit more of a pulse than some of the other ones I've been to and I enjoy the patio during the warmer weather. \n\nWhat I like a lot is well, is that if you walk-in they're not upset (like a lot of other restaurants) and are pretty accommodating, the space is pretty large and its right in the club district that the table turnover is pretty high, which is great so that you're not waiting too long to eat...
