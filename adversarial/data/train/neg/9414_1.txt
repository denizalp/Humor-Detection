Horrible Service, Manager was extremely arrogant and rude. No paying customer should be treated so poorly by the Manager of the restaurant. The food was greasy and overpriced. For a vegetarian restaurant, the food was anything but healthy. It should be illegal for them to borrow the name of Mount Wutai - they are a misrepresentation to the name and to authentic vegetarian Chinese cuisine.
