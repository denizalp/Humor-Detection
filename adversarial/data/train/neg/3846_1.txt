A year ago I bought my wife an anniversary ring at Schmitt Jewelers and we could not have been more pleased with every facet of our experience. Tim and Tom Schmitt guided us through every step of the process with personal care, expertise and professionalism. We believe the outstanding quality of service is not only the result of their knowledge about jewelry but also their deep family roots and investment in this city. Skip the impersonal chain jewelers and visit the Schmitts. You will be glad you did!
