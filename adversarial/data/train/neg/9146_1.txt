My name is Daryl.  I'm a patron at Jolie's.  I'm also a member of the local music community and the band I'm a member of (Two Night Stand) played in her place on a few occasions.  I have been there at noon, and late at night. I've never had a situation there.  I've had some odd looks, but guess what...you can get odd looks at any bar in any city in any country.   I can't speak on your experience LeRoy, and I wouldn't ever downplay it.  But, I know Charli personally and professionally. Neither she, Jolie nor her staff would ever tolerate rascist behavior.  I don't say what I heard, I'm telling you what I know.  In fact, I was going to go by there tonight and I'm definitely going to go now.  So far as grubbage goes, I've always liked what I've got...I have no prob asking for something if I want it.  If the service is slow...there's usually a reason, and if I don't feel like waiting, I'll ask another server for it...and it's always served without an attitude.   If it weren't true, I wouldn't be saying so.  LeRoy..don't know you, but I hope you give Jolie's another shot man.
