Bought my new Canada goose jacket here a couple of days ago , employees there are super help full while one was looking for my size downstairs 2 other employees asked if I was ok and needed help , with in 5\/6 mins , must of made this guy go up and down 5\/6 times looking for the styles and size I was looking at was in stock for me . Always with a smile . Great selection of brands, styles and service and if they served Champagne I'll would of give them 5 lol but only give 5 stars if the Company go's above and beyond for there customers .
