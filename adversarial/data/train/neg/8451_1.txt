I was turned onto Cornerstone Ranch from a real estate agent who helps you locate an apartment. I had already overlooked it because of their website and I was over 1000 miles away and couldn't check it out. Thank goodness the real estate agent set me up by connecting us. \n\nThe office seems hard to get a hold of sometimes by phone...just be persistent, it's worth it! The office staff is friendly, they know you by name and they are genuine!! (I dealt with Tyler, she's great!!) The maintenance man is amazingly friendly and great with animals. \n\nWe originally came here because we have a pit bull and no one else allows them. There are others with pit bulls and other big dogs: German Shepard, boxers, labs and bull dogs are the ones I've seen. Everyone keeps to themselves and no one seems to have dog conflicts. Not everyone here has a dog which surprised me, probably about half. You are allowed only two pets, too.\n\nNeighbors are kind, civil and not criminals! Great neighborhood, golf course near by, and there are always people walking dogs and jogging. Currently their is construction on Ocotillo rd so that's my only complaint.\n\nThe apartment we got is top floor, New paint, New carpet, New dishwasher because ours wasn't working well and they replaced it :-)\n\nThere is an open office where you can study, and print! :-) The pool seems nice, haven't gone in yet. There is a small fitness center, the free weights go to 30lbs or so. Has a last pull down, bow flex I think, bike, elliptical, tread mill, punching bag, etc\n\nWe come in the apartment and after 3 months it still smells new and clean! Nice patio that you can have a bbq on. They enforce rules of keeping the exterior clean, even on individual patios.\n\nI recommend this place to everyone, especially big dog owners.
