Disappointed as to price and quality doesn't match! Other then the view and the breakfast buffet that's worth the three stars. The room was very basic. Bathroom outdated. Lobby so underwhelming, the look of a one star hotel, worn, small, crowded. \nVisit their rooftop bar, stayed for a drink with the view. The hour that I was there, no other customer except for two ladies diners at one of the table. \nThis hotel really needs an upgrade!\nUntil they do, will not return.
