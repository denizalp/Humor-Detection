This is a great store with a lot of great options, however, the staff was not welcoming or friendly.  I had to go to the counter and ask if anyone could help me.  Three of them just looked at me.  Finally, one jumped up to offer and then was very helpful and cheery.  I have to admit, I won't consider purchasing through your store because I was not greeted.  I did not feel like a valued customer.  One of the company's core values that are hanging on the wall, says, \"give WOW service\".  It was not wowed.
