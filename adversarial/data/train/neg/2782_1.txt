Super Gross. I stopped here for lunch today and found a lovely surprise in my Black Bean Chicken Bowl:\n\n3 RANDOM PILLS! \n\nThey had been cooked with either the broccoli or rice (a black bean substitute) and had started to disintegrate so I couldn't tell what they where.\n\nThe GM wasn't there, but they gave me my money back. Lucky I didn't eat any. God knows how many other people where served rice\/broccoli from the same batch. Ugh.
