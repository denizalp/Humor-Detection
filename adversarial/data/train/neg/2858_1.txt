HORRIBLE.  Please do not ever do business with this company.  Anthony is the worst.  He is rude, belittles the customers, and he actually hung up on me.  I have never been treated like that by ANY customer service employee.  I cancelled, and they charged me a $75 cancellation fee!!!  Unbelievable.  Such a waste of time, money, and energy.  Please go with someone reputable.  I had First American prior and NEVER had any issues.
