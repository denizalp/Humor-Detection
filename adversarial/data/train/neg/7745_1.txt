This place was our late night go-to spot. When I say late night, I mean after 10. Usually good service and good food.  Last night the service was bad. The server was more focused on socializing with her coworkers than providing service.  Our food was cold, the bread was cold. The Sangria I ordered was so watered down it tasted like water with food coloring.
