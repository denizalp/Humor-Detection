After my car was totaled on 12\/23, I made a reservation so I could drive one of the vehicles I was considering to replace my car. Then I learned that if I wanted Progressive to pay for it, they should do the arranging for me. Dan realized I had already made a reservation and helped me get the car I wanted, and Andrew helped me trade it in for another model so I could try two vehicles. They made the whole process very simple and were kind and friendly at a trying time. I also am very impressed by how much they can accomplish in the tiniest space.
