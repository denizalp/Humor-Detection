I come to this place all the time, and they usually do an okay job. They over charge me for longer nails everytime I go, I pay more and more. She told me 40 then I told her ombre and the price went up to 70 dollars. So I said whatever she did my nails, they looked awful the ombre is awful, it looked like a nude color. I told them I didn't like it and they said sorry. No asked if I wanted it changed, or reimburse me after I spend 300 dollars a month at this place. Had to run to hard rock so they could fix it. Really thought urban nails was better than that, probably won't be coming back here\n\nPs. If you like having longer nails DO NOT come here they charge you up the ass
