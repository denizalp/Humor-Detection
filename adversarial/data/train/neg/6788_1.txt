This is my first review. Omakase (i.e. \"chef's choice\") is not recommended for everyone, but if you are in the mood for the best meal you will ever eat in your life, this place is for you. \n\nWent with a date, and had the 5 course tasting menu, with a couple of bottles of sake. Every bite of food was better than the last. I won't go into detail about our entire meal, but standouts included the steamed clam soup, with 5 different types of mushrooms, and the whole fried shrimp appetizer. (Don't be afraid, eat the head)\n\nItamae, Kurita-san, is a master of flavor and composition. 5-stars. I will be back... as often as my pocketbook allows.
