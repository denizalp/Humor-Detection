Never a disappointment whenever I come here. Well for this location per say. However, in general Pickle Barrel has so many choices for meals that range from juicy steaks, to pasta, to vegetarian options. The wait to be seated wasn't bad at all considering it was a Saturday evening (wait was about 10mins) and the atmosphere is very nice. The waitress that served us was very cool and made with our orders pretty quickly. \n\nFor the food, definitely trying the pasta my friend had (I think it was gnocchi with cream sauce and mushrooms which was awesome).
