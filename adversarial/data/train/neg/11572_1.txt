Another studio that accepts Passport to Prana!\n\nIt is a small studio but it has varieties of classes like Pilates Reformer, hatha, restorative, Iyengar and yin. They also offers massages, acupuncture, chinese medicine.\n\nWhen you walked in there are slippers if you do prefer to wear.\n\nI was there early for a restorative class on a Sunday afternoon.  The studio was quiet since it was a nice day out! There were only 5 of us in class. tons of props for use: blosters, blankets, blocks, chairs, straps, eye pillows, sand bags They even has free mat for use if you do forget your own mat.\n\nThe room is small but it was ok, since only 5 of us. The class was really relaxing and our teacher was really attentive and make sure we has all our props set up properly .. even offer me eye pillow and cover me with blankets\n\nThe change room has 1 shower and 1 washroom (there is also another a unisex bathroom). There are plenty of supplies: hair dryers, towels, female hygeneic  supplies, lockers.. (ps toilet paper is nice and soft, the best in any of the studios!!)\n\nThis is more than a yoga studio as it provided a lot of different services, I would say it is more like a wellness centre.\n\nThere are plenty of parking on the side street.
