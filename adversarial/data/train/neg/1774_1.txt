I decided to give this salon a shot despite the negative reviews on Yelp, and I absolutely regret it. The salon itself is decent; it is fairly clean, and it seems as though it was recently remodeled. However, their nail work is awful. I went in for a gel manicure, expecting it to last about two weeks. The day after I got my nails done, I noticed a chip on my thumb and the polish peeling in the corners of two nails. Within a week, 7\/10 nails had polish peeling and the shine was gone. The technician also did not clean up around my nails, and painted over my skin- I probably could have done the same work myself and saved $30. BELIEVE THE BAD REVIEWS AND DO NOT GO HERE!
