In an age where playing games with friends brings up thoughts of the iOS App Store, it's refreshing to sit down with friends and physically touch a game...  \n\nSnakes & Lattes often has a long waiting list to get a table on weekend evenings. I can't hold that against them, it's simply a sign of success. Thankfully, you can put your name on the list and walk down Bloor St. until they send you a text to let you know that a table is free. It's a very nice touch, as I'm not one to wait in line, especially in the winter. \n\nService is always very friendly. I love the way that someone will come and help each table find games that suit everyone's liking. The best part is having the rules of the games explained until all players understand how to play. I feel like I'm the slowest at catching onto new games, but they always do a great job of giving instructions.\n\nThere is a huge selection of games, from the familiar to the obscure. I've had fun playing all of the games that have been suggested to my table, as well as all of the games that we have randomly picked from the huge wall of games. $5 (plus tax and tip - the service definitely deserves a good tip!) allows you to stay in the caf√© and discover new games (and old favourites) for as long as you want.\n\nI have never tried any food or drinks from S&L, though their prices seem pretty standard for a place downtown.
