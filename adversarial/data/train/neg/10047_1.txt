Once we walked into this little breakfast nook, my companion felt she was transported to the \"Kinfolk\" style of Portland, Oregon!  I'm not an expert on crepes, but I really enjoyed my \"Jamaican Jerk Pork Sausage\"! It was bursting with flavors and beautifully plated! The portion was big for little ol' me, but probably perfect for a hungry adult person's breakfast. My companion's \"Second Time\" Nutella crepe was \"meh,\" too much sweet out-of-the-jar Nutella filling, in my opinion. Next time, we'll stick to their savory crepes instead!  The only negative point I have about this place, is the food did take a while to come to our table, but they compensated that with complimentary scones while we waited (perfect with our tea, btw), and of course we're hoping the time was spent to plate a perfect, artistic and delicious meal! Will definitely come back to this place to try more dishes!
