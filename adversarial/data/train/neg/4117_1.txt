This place is massive! We went Friday night at 6pm and the dinner crowd was quite thin. We were promptly seated and our drink orders came quickly and were soon ready to order. I chose the fish sandwich, my husband got the chicken stew with rice. Dinner was okay, the fish was a bit plain and wasn't seasoned at all which was the point of trying this resturant. My husband was satisfied with his food, however we agreed we won't be visiting again.
