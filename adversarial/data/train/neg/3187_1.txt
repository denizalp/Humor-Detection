Pros:  tempura was lightly covered and crisp, perfect for me.  Sashimi was fresh and a good value.  \n\nCons:  Dynamite could have had more scallop and was too spicy for me, others may love it for it's spiciest.  Would of liked a bigger Japanese beer selection .\n\nOverall a positive experience for a hole in the wall place.
