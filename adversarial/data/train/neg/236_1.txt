I don't ever go to the doctor because I can normally get rid of a cold by my self. Not this time. I came first thing on a Sunday and it took about an hour and 20 mins from getting to the office to leaving which is not to bad. All the staff was super nice and helpful. The doctor was also the same. Thanks
