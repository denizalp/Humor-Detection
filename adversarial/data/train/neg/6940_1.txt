I'm gonna preface this by saying I'm not a wing guy. Not a huge fan of B-Dubs. These wings were amazing though. I mostly got them for my wife to try cause she loves wings and each order comes with multiple flavors so I figured I'd try some garlic parm wings. They were spectacular. Great flavor, super juicy, and real good meat to bone ratio. I'll definitely be going back.
