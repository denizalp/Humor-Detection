We stopped by on Saturday and used the rental bows. They were very patient with us and walked us thru the range etiquette and we received a quick course on bow safety and usage. It was very reasonably priced ($8\/hr\/person plus a flat $15\/person bow rental) and we ended up having a lot of fun. I would highly recommend it.
