This is the place where I will remain. Nancy always does my nail and she is wonderful. She gets me time I walk in the door. They offer drinks as well. The other workers do my nails occasionally and they do good work as well, but I prefer Nancy.  She shaped my nails according to the size of my fingers. I will keep going to her as long as she continues her professionalism.
