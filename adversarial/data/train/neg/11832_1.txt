This review is for the Mimjim store on Des Pins, not Duluth. Terrible service. I popped in tonight to buy a simple 6-pack of beer. I noticed at the cash that the box looked really old and checked the expiry date, which was 8 months ago. I pointed this out to the clerk, he argued with me a little before admitting I was right. We went to try to find another 6-pack. All of them were older than 6 months. I asked for my money back and he gave it to me. Then he said he would bet me $100 that I couldn't find another brand of expired beer in the store. I said I didn't want to do that. He got aggressive and shouted at me that I don't know anything about beer. I asked to speak with the owner but he said he wouldn't tell me any more information and that I should never go back to the store. Surreal and stupid, don't waste your time here.
