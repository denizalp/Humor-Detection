I am not opposed to paying high end spa prices due to being on the strip but this is a total joke. $300 for two mani-pedis.. We wanted to upgrade to shellac on our toes and they wanted $65 EACH? Dream on! Especially when the salon isn't busy, isn't really that nice and you're not getting a \"spa\" experience whatsoever its just a regular nail salon. I was disgusted that the cuticle oil jar they were using on me literally had balls of dead skin and debris in it. And for the price - the \"massage\" on my pedicure wasn't a massage at all they just put lotion on and my manicure had no massage! Rip off.
