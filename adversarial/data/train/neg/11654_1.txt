Chuck answered our call for exactly what we needed for our new house\/new build. We needed window treatments asap that was nice but not pricey. Lowes quoted me $90 for install (not including the blinds). Chuck quoted me about $100 per window which was the blinds with wooden valance (see pic) and installation! The samples he brought were of nice quality and impressive. Totally like what I saw at Lowes.\nChuck came over as scheduled 2wks later on the appt day\/time. He got setup and finished my 14 windows before I knew it! I was putting up a curtain rod for the 6ft patio slider, I asked him for help on it and he didn't even hesitate to lend a hand. Such a great guy! Would I recommend him? Heck YEAH!\nProfessional, prompt, all around great guy.
