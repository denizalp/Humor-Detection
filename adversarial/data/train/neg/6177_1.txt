To add to the comment below, I decided to take my friend to Don't Tell Mama last night even after my bad experience with my friends. He had never really seen downtown, so we decided to hit up the bar once more in hopes of a great experience. (After all everyone has an off day). We ordered a few tequilas and put in a request for a song and tipped $5. It was the same pianist that was so vile to my friends and I... I guess he noticed me from my prior visit and instead of letting my friend get up and sing; he decided to get up on the mic once more and call my best friends a bitch I front of the entire bar. We ended up leaving again... It really baffles me that this local bar treats their locals this way. Before downtown became so corporate these tiny bars solely thrived off locals. Not only is the pianist at fault for such disgusting and juvenile behavior but so is the owner who is always there and allows such acts to occur. I would not encourage anyone to go to this bar or support any business that treats paying customers this way.
