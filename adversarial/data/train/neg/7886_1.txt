It is one of the better food places in this airport. While the food was good but not great, I would eat here again due to a lack of options. What was annoying was that I had to ask four different people until I finally got to pay. I think it is crucial at an airport, that when someone says they want to pay that you get them the check within five minutes. That actually is a long time. When I finally told my server that I have been waiting for a long time she asked when my plane boards as in trying to deflect from the issue. It is unimportant when my plane boards, I have plenty of things to do before I board. Mainly work, but hey maybe I'd like to go to the bathroom before my flight too, you telling me that 10 minutes 'til boarding is \"plenty of time\" really is kind of a dumb comment.
