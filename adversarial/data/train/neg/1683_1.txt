Since most of Calgary rolls up the sidewalks at 5pm, it's nice to have some late night options besides Denny's and A&W.  I've only ever gone late at night and there's pretty good food if you know what you are ordering.  The authentic Chinese stuff is quite good and they do have some unique dishes and dim sum late at night is awesome.  Not sure how good the western Chinese stuff is as I'll never order that stuff in a Chinese restaurant.
