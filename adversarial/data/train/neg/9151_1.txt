I have been going to this Fabulous Freddy's for almost 10 years now and I must say I am DONE with this place. The last few times I have been here it has been frustrating. \nI go here every 3 months to get an oil change and car wash. I also have been bringing the hubby's car and he said no more after this last visit. \nNOTE: I drive all the way from Mountains Edge to get my cars serviced and washed. \nI was just there (10\/6\/13) to get my routine oil change and wash and it took OVER 2 hours! And when I got there, there was no one in the oil bay and only a few cars in the car wash area. When I checked in for the oil change they estimated about an hour to complete oil and wash (inside and out). Which is acceptable.  Once the oil change was complete, they ran it over to the car wash side and it literally just sat in the cash wash bay for over an hour. I was so tired of waiting, I walked over to see what was going on and there were 5-7 car wash personnel just hanging out. One guy was sitting in the passenger seat of my car texting on his phone. They are typically teenagers working here, which I don't mind because they usually do a great job, but these ones were slacking. When they pulled my car out of the bay, NOTHING had been cleaned! I had to tell them to re-clean everything. This is the last straw for me. This similar situation has been happening the last 2 or 3 times I have been here. I am sad to have to write a bad review for them but I am finding a new place to go now.\nDespite the bad car wash experience, the oil\/lube people are always awesome! I just don't think its worth it for me to drive all the way to Summerlin anymore to wait over 2 hours for an oil change and car wash.  \n\nOverall, I give the cash wash side of this 0 stars and the oil lube 3 stars, which on average is about a 1.5 star.
