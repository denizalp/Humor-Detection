The employees are very rude. I mistakenly brought ups packages into the store and got it rudely pointed out to me by Mr. Beavis looking ass. These dudes are assholes. There's a UPS location right down the street that you should just go to instead. They're way nicer, it's probably cheaper, and they taped up all of my packages for me for free like 3 minutes before they closed and told me multiple times that it was like no problem.
