Had an amazing experience! The appointment set up was quick and simple, the building was very easy to find and the treatment was unique and relaxing. This was my first time getting my teeth whitened cosmetically and I really enjoyed it. Staff members were so nice and did a great job!! Very happy with my results! Definitely will be making another appointment very soon.
