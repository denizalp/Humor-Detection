Got my first tattoo at this place and couldn't have asked for a better experience. Everyone was very helpful and answered all my questions. Humpy did my tat and he did an awesome job. It came out better than I had imagined and the results blew me away. Next time your in Vegas and want a tattoo, this is the place to go. I'll be back soon for another one. Highly recommend.
