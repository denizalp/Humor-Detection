Looking at these reviews, I was a little nervous about going here today.  I got a gel pedicure, gel manicure and an eyebrow wax and everything went great.  I will definitely go back.  The service and quality of my nails is exactly what I would expect.  The salon is very clean and the workers professional and friendly.
