We went to Mina's for dinner tonight. We inquired about ladies night before we ordered drinks, food etc. Server said it was and was very helpful at first. Food was amazing and all the staff were great. \n\nOnly thing that really threw us off was once our bill came, the 20% off for ladies night was not applied. (Which in this case is quite significant since our bill was almost 100 dollars). Once we told our server she forgot the discount she acted very irritated and didn't apologize for forgetting, she said nothing at all. We weren't upset about her forgetting and we tried joking with her \" I'm glad we didn't forget about the discount, that's quite a big difference\". She seemed very inconvenienced, and honestly it just seemed really shady. If we didn't bring it up, she definitely wouldn't have corrected it. We are just very annoyed since we asked about the discount before even sitting then she \"forgot\", and no apologies, just an immediate change in attitude. \n\nBrought down what would have been an excellent experience.
