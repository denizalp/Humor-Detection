My husband who wears a tall size in shirts and jackets came into the Camelback location because of the large selection this store has. We were served by Christopher who was very professional and helpful and we were very happy with our purchases. He even was able to exchange an item previously purchased and the credit was applied to this sale. We will definitely be back to shop at this location again!
