Got a last minute appt with Paul for a massage this weekend.  First time I have seen him and it was an excellent massage.  I let him know about my tight shoulders and vigorous exercise routine.  He listened to what I wanted out of the massage and addressed those issues.  I asked for firm pressure and got it.  He was professional and gave a full body massage. I will definitely book him again.  So nice to get a more therapeutic massage rather than those that just rub around aimlessly with minimal pressure.
