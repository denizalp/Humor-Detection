The first day of fall and dinner outside on the patio in downtown Phoenix sounds perfect for Friday evening. I saw this place on Diner, Drive-in, and Dive show on the food network, and could not wait to try it. I knew I had to get the Dragon Eggs, which did not disappoint at all! I got them half steam\/fried! Yum! My guest and I decided to enjoy Ribs... oh boy! Ribs were tender and falling off the bones and so sweet with touch of spice. We finished off dinner with mango sticky rice...Everything was mouth watering and delicious.
