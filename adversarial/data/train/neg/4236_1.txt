Look out, there are a tonne of flies here.  They even close the cold food door on them trapping them with the food.  When you tell them, they ensure to give you the most \"I don't give a damn\" look.  Or maybe \"I just woke up and don't know where I am\" look.\n\nAt nights there is one lady at the till inside who does all the work and one that stands behind her who's job is to look at you and make comments of what's going on.  If you have issues, she adds to the issue by being the loud peanut gallery so you can feel more annoyed.  Great Service!
