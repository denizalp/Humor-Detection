I wish I could give this hotel 1\/2 a star. Maybe even take that measly little 1\/2 star and chip away at it a little for being overly generous. We stayed at the Quad when it was still IP. When a travel agent booked your trip and you didn't know what the rooms looked like. First off, hell no. This is not even bottom of the barrel. I think abandoned crack houses have seen better days. An abandoned crack house would be more comfortable and nicer. The rooms were horrible. The elevators (all 3 of them) were broken down. On one trip, I was 6 months pregnant and HANGRY. You know, that point where you are no longer hungry. You're just pissed off HANGRY. You'll eat a big piece of wood. We ate at a burger place. $20 later and feeling like shit. But it spared my poor husband from having me committed. To be fair, I have not stepped foot in it since it became the Quad. I had to walk past the construction, numerous times. The building looks the same but with a different name. Tear that mess down. When I go at the end of this month I will go in the Quad and update my review. The 1\/2 star is for the staff. Very friendly, hard working and nice. They are the D squad though. If you want scabies and hepatitis go for it. Otherwise spend more for better.
