This is the first and last time we will be staying here!!!  COCKROACHES EVERYWHERE!! YES, THE ROOMS ARE SOME WHAT NICE AND SPACIOUS BUT NOT IF YOUR LYING IN BED AND A COCKROACH COMES CRAWLING ON YOU.   There are plenty of places to stay in vegas and we stayed here because it was all that was available for the 4th of July.  The food in the cafe is pretty good but the workers are rude and need to keep their cursing and complaining about so many people calling in orders to themselves.
