Came here mid-afternoon on a Wednesday and they had a pretty big selection of bread. My friends and I decided to get a bunch of everything to share. \n\nI liked the neat decor and the fact that it has lots of window and a decent amount of sitting space for a bakery. It even has a patio for when the weather gets nicer. Service was nice although they seemed annoyed\/overwhelmed by our order size (we had 5 people in our party).\n\nThe breads were pretty decent. Lots of variety and interesting flavours. Surprisingly, out of all the unique ones we tried taro ended up being my favourite. It was pretty sweet and crunchy. Perfect for snacking. Some of the other ones had too much going on and I wasn't a fan of the cream cheese ones. \n\nWe also ordered quite a few drinks. Some tried the standard chatime drinks and it tasted the same as other locations. What disappointed me the most were their bake code speciality drinks. Personally, I got the milk tea espresso latte, which sounds super fancy but not really. It's an espresso because they made the tea with an espresso machine, which presotea has been doing all along. I wouldn't have mind that they did it in a similar fashion if the tea had been good but it just tasted watered down to me. Also, the latte part was just a milk foam put on top that you're supposed to mix in. It didn't really add anything to the drink except maybe make it look prettier. \n\nMight come back to try some of the cakes but definitely wouldn't bother with the drinks.
