Happy hour here did the job.  It wasn't anything amazing but our group was having trouble deciding.  We ordered rolled tacos, the sampler platter and chili cheese dip. The chili cheese dip was actually the highlight, made with green chilis and real cheese. Unfortunately their tableside guacamole and any of the seafood appetizers, like ceviche, are not included in happy hour prices.  We had six drinks total between the four of us, although my friend's fruit margarita didn't taste like it had any tequila.  For all the food and drinks we got away with only spending $40 for the four of us.
