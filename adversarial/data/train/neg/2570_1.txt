All you can eat vegan buffet on Sundays!!! Plus you get an entree option (some of which have dairy) and a tea or coffee. The buffet has amazing cakes and pies for desert - all vegan and probably 10 different types. Everything they have is delicious and the two of us usually share one entree and go all out on the buffet (it's way too much food if you like the buffet items).
