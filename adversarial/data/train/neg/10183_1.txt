My two stars is merely for the food as it is quite decent. The service is very slow and nonchalant. I usually order through ritual with my coworkers and they give us an estimate of when to expect the food to be ready. Normally, that is within half an hour and unlike other restaurants, Sushi Spring does not update you or warn you that the service is slower than normal. So when I arrived to pick up my order with my coworkers, we had to wait another 25 minutes (making the total wait time 45 minutes) to get our food.
