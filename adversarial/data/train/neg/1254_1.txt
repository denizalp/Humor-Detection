Very friendly service both times we ate there.  Food quality was great, very tasty and very well presented.  Very nice, modern, clean restaurant.  I would just mention that the portions are just way too big, I know Americans like to eat a lot but make some smaller dishes and charge a little less.  The price of eating out in Vegas now is just becoming crazy.
