Great cozy cabin atmosphere. The lobster bisque was thick and creamy with great flavor and large portions. I ordered the Filet ala carte with a loaded baked potato and my friend ordered Steak Christopher. Both steaks were cooked perfectly. And the sides were terrific.\nWe had a great bottle of wine and a yummy chocolate mouse dessert.\n\nThe service was terrific from the minute we walked in to the minute we left.
