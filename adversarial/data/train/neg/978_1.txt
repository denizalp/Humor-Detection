This place did a great job for my friend and I today. They weren't too welcoming but i mean, I came 10 minutes late into my appointment time so i understand they were a bit upset. However, when we first came in, the guy just escorted me right to the massage rooms. Lol but in a way, i don't mind. I mean, i came here to get a massage, not for a long talk. The atmosphere is very relaxing. I love it. My friend and i both got the deluxe. \n\nThe massage IS GREAT. I felt the knots actually being untangled. Like it was there, and after a few pressure massage, i felt it being released and slowly it was gone. Felt really good!!! Will be coming back. \n\nThe other problem i had(which is why it is 4\/5 stars) is that it didn't feel like it was 40 minutes. The masseur kept running out to accommodate their other customers that just walked in which took a bit of time out of the 40 minutes. And lastly, i wish they had more techniques. I like all their techniques right now though, just wish they did more massaging techniques to really pin down my lower back pain. \n\nHowever, i am happy with my decision on coming here. I will be coming back in like a week or two. \nTHIS PLACE IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE BALI FOOT SPA(please read my review there before going)!!! I would recommend this to anyone who seriously just wants to get a good massage.\nHopefully next time i come back, i can give a great 5\/5 reviews because i really like them!\nAnd at the end, they give u water and a cute little snack.
