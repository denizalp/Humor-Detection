I love this place! The burgers are awesome! You fill out a check card of everything and anything you could possibly want on a burger. We also got the basket of fries with cheese. I was pleasantly surprised when they served the fries with liquid nacho cheese. I prefer that to melted shredded cheese which I found is popular in other places around here. Highly recommended! The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because of how loud\/dark the bar area is and how rude they are about the TVs in the booths. All we did was turn ours off and we ended up getting a 5 minute lecture about breaking it. Besides that I will definitely be back.
