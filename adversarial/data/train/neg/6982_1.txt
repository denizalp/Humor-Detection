My original experience with the previous owners at Carpet VIP was less than favorable. After my review, I was contacted by Kelvie (New Office Manager) Kelvie was nice enough to reach out to me and explained that after new management their services have improved and was willing to refunded me the $100 that I originally paid and never received any proper services.  Mind you that my experience was over a year ago.  \nI have to rave about the prompt attention Kelvie gave to this matter, and its evident that they are still paying the price for bad management.  They are very interested in great customer service.  Next time I visit Vegas i will be looking forward to working with Carpet VIP and Kelvie.
