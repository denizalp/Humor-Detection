I stayed at Hotel Del Sol for one night as a park and fly package (4\/23\/18). The hotel followed through with everything promised from a clean room, breakfast, transportation to Sky Harbor airport, left my car in covered parking and was shuttled back to the hotel when I returned. All uneventful.\n\nI was very happy with my stay at Hotel del Sol for many reasons: great staff, the hotel is safe, clean, newly decorated, convenient, amazing price, comfort and ample covered parking. The added bonuses were the hotel amenities and in-room amenities.\n\nUpon arrival, I was greeted by Larry who also assisted me to my room, showed me how to use the TV and answered all my questions. I was very impressed with the room and slept well.\n\nI saw Larry again in the morning. What a lovely, honest, professional gentleman. Larry provided the comfortable transportation to the airport. He also helped with my luggage. When we arrived at the airport I thanked him for all his help and tipped him $10.00. He looked in his hand and saw a $100.00-dollar bill and said, \"Did you mean to give me this $100?\" I gasped and said OMG, I thought I gave you a $10! He handed back the $100 and I gave him the $10. All I had was $130 for my trip and thanks to Larry's honesty I did not arrive to my destination broke. I highly commend and thank Larry for his honesty. I also appreciate how special he makes the guests feel at this hotel.\n\nI do not understand the negative reviews!? My experience was great and my review is sincere. Makes me wonder, did I just come on a good night? Get the best room? Away from noise? Real lucky to have had Larry at the front desk? I did not have a single complaint. Therefore, I recommend Hotel Del Sol and Spa to anyone looking for a safe, clean, economical place to stay before and \/ or after your plan trip. It is a great value to have covered parking. If you are lucky, you will meet Larry. Without any hesitation, I will stay there for my next trip. Thanks for reading my review.
