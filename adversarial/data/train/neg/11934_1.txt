Best chipotle in the area. You can tell the management there really cares about quality and freshness of their food. Very consistently fresh which is more than I can say about most chipotles. The wait is usually a little long but that is inevitable being in Solon.  Anyone who complains about the staff being \"rude\" was probably being a pain in the butt.  I've had nothing but friendly experiences with the \"black female staff\" they're sweet as can be. These people get paid minimum wage. Honestly, what do you expect. Get off your phone, figure out what you want, and order your food. End rant.
