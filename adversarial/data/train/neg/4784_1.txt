Came here for the mussels and they did not disappoint. There is enough mussel variations to choose from to make its own sub menu.  And when you come Sunday through Wednesday they have an ayce special at the listed price so quite a find. Wish we had places like these in NYC. \n\nTheir list of beers is even longer than their regular menu plus lots of things to choose from aside from mussels as well. \n\nService was great and they even give you choices for the mayo.  And the broths are hearty - we had the frutti di mare and Genoese and that came with fries and sampling of bread. That was plenty. Nice environ located in what appears to be an old bank space so good for date or small group setting.
