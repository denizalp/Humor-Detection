Wow another great place to get chocolates. It was a scorcher of a day so just tried the ice cream. The setup is cozy. I tried the salted caramel which was very good and pistachio (have had much better). Picked up a chocolate offering as well so will update after having tried it. \nI think I will be back for ice cream if I am in the area.
