Just average.  It's cool that it is in the basement but they pack you in like sardines.  My wife and I felt like we were on top of the other tables.  We had the halibut ceviche, average. Escargot appetizer, ok. My wife had the salmon, average and I had the halibut checks, again average.  \n\nIf you want seafood, I suggest skipping this place and go somewhere else.
