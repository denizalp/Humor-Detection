Love the idea of real vegetarian food rather than fake duck and fake chicken.  They serve all my favourites - mushrooms, greens, soy and I'm not even vegetarian.  Vegetarian dim sum is not anything new but what's exceptional for this restaurant is it's the only kind of dim sum.  Most of the dishes we tried were very good - well made and presented.  Decor is bright and airy - lots of chandeliers and golden lotus - a lot of glitz for a Buddhist restaurant (owned by Cham Shan Temple).
