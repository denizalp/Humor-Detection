Well, I used to work here in '01. I always like to come back every now and then. The menu has expanded, the food is still awesome, and its my fav go-to sports bar. Margie was my bartender today and she kicks ass. I love the wings, and the sourdough jo burger. Yummm!!!! This place will never fail you. Lol
