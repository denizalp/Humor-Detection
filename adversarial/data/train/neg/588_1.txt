During our one night stay at the Monroeville Choice Inn, my partner and I looked for a restaurant that was close enough to walk.  We could see a sign for Max and Erma's across the street that looked easy to reach.  It wasn't.  With perseverance, we finally made it to the restaurant.  It is obviously a very popular spot for the surrounding motels and locals.  Business was brusque.  We waited about five minutes for a two-person table and five minutes later our server greeted us and took drink orders. The restaurant specializes in cheeseburgers and there were beautiful choices on page after page of the menu.  Being a little more health conscience, we went to the back page and ordered entrees from a special section of meals under 550 calories.  My partner ordered a sirloin and I selected Tuscan Chicken.  The sides were broccoli and asparagus.  Food arrived within 15 minutes.  The chicken was excellent, the vegetables were as good as any green steamed vegetable can be.  The steak had a nice flavor but was a little tough.  It was the first time in recent memory that a server at any restaurant did not ask my partner to cut into it to see if it was cooked to his satisfaction.  She did not check back at any point but did bring additional glasses of drink.  There was no offer for dessert but the first smile from the server came when the bill with a space for the tip was brought to the table. This particular outlet of the chain needs a major overhaul with fresh pain, new carpets, and renovated tables and booths.  Everything was OK, but I don't believe I would choose it if there were other options.\n\nOn a scale of five, Monroeville Max and Erma's receives:\n1\/2 star out of 1 for atmosphere\n1 star out of 2 for service\n1 1\/2 star out of 2 for food\n3 stars total
