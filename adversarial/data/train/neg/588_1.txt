Good size neighborhood bar, kind of dark, but welcoming. Yes, they do have wifi. Ask for the password.  From my seat at the bar I could see fourteen TV screens, all showing sports.  There are three pool tables, and eight dart boards. \n\nWaitresses are cute.  And OMG they have hard cider in tap!  \n\nI just stopped in for lunch and it wasn't loud music at all, just background music.  It was a Tuesday and the place was surprisingly well attended for a Tuesday lunch time.  Nice little place. I will go back.
