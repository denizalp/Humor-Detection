Terrible customer service.  Came in to the\ndrive thru on a Saturday to pick up a script for my daughter.  Was told my daughter's insurance isn't on file.  Had my wife call in and give insurance info.  They had me leave the line while she gave them the insurance info.  I politely left the drive thru line, even though nobody was behind me.  \"We can't have you clogging up the line\" he says.  Ok, so I return to the window, 3 minutes later, nobody ever came thru the drive thru in the entire 3 minutes.  Clogging disaster averted.  When the guy came to fill the script, it was a different guy, but both of them were together and I'm the only customer they're serving. New guy acts like he doesn't know anything about.  He's got a huge attitude about it too.  All of the completely out of left field.  I've been going there for 10 years.  Not anymore.  Read the other reviews, it's a pattern.
