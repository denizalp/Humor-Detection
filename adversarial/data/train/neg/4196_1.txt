Kipp just refinished my solid black walnut wood floors. I just purchased the house and the floors were in terrible shape from the previous owner. Kip is really knowledgeable and he invested in the latest refinishing equipment that minimizing dust while sanding and allows him to reuse the dust as filler. \n\nI had an issue with the poly coat not drying properly and it left a milky haze in a few spots. Kip immediately returned to inspect. Instead of sanding just the area of concern he re-sand the entire topcoat of the floor making sure we had a perfect finish. My floors look fantastic. \n\nI highly recommend Kip for any wood flooring needs.
