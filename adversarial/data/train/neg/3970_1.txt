Went to grab drinks and appetizers here before a Suns game, and really loved it. Great ambiance, and loved that they open the bar windows up on nice nights allowing for a breeze. Right in downtown close to US Airways Center, many other bars, and the metro link. The cheese plates are outstanding, and both the lunch and dinner menus offer both different and traditional meals. \n\nWill definitely be stopping by here anytime I'm in Phoenix.
