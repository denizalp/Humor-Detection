So glad I found Dr Gombert and his fine staff a few years ago. I'd been clinging to my decades-long dentist in southern California because he'd been so great, but it was becoming unworkable to commute for dental work. Found Dr Gombert and he's been just as great as my previous dentist. The entire staff is awesome, from reception to the hygienists. If you are looking for a new dentist - look no further, you've found your guy.
