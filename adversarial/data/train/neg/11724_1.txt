This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. Always leave full. Always perfectly fresh and perfectly seasoned food. Vegetables are so good there. I have been going there since the late 1990's. I have never had a bad experience there. The food is always excellent. It is a tad pricey for Vietnamese but not too bad considering they are the best in town. The menu is big. \nI have been there hundreds of times. The owner is very fiesty and she remembers everybody. She remembers people's orders after years of not visiting. When we go in there she just says ok usual for you right? and I'm like what's my usual and she tells me and I'm like yep. She also will give good advice on what to pick if you don't know the menu. Usually she will just tell you what to get just by looking at you. I get a kick out of it. She really loves her business.\nClientele is very diverse. it is a hole in the wall. but they pack people in and get them out the door with no trouble
