I've had my fair share of Mongolian grills being from CA and I thought this place wasn't too bad. Granted, it's the only one I've tried here in WI. \n\nSeating on a Friday night was plentiful, even though groups of people were coming in. The selections of protein were simple, but I wished they had shrimp. The vegetable selections were great. I liked the recipes above the sauces and tried one of them, which turned out to be deeeelicious. There's also little recipe cards at the start of the buffet line in case you don't know what to put in your bowl. \n\nIt wasn't bad for $14, so we'll likely find our way back here for dinner sometime.
