This review is for the back dining room. Why do I point that out? Because the vibe is completely different during dinner back there!\n\nWalked in with a group for a bachelorette party dinner, and thought for a second that we were severely overdressed for our reservation. The host walked us to the back and it was like a completely different scene! Dim lit, gorgeous decor, and the huge oversized pink booths, perfect for our bachelorette!\n\nThe menu was really fun, and we shared several items among the 5 of us including the thin crust pizzas, burger bites, mac and cheese lollipops and the arugula with steak salad. The steak was perfect, literally melted in my mouth...just as it should!\n\nA couple of things to note that really had me considering bringing this review down to 3 stars. We ordered one of their large 36 oz. \"Lollipop\" punch bowls. Our server came back and said they were out of the punch bowls, and asked if 5 individual glasses would be okay. Sure, no problem....however, instead of bringing us glasses like the rest of the martinis were served in, she brought plastic cups. Noooo, we are not at a frat party. Not to mention about 5 minutes later the table next to us received one of the large bowls. She also forgot the lollipops and candy to go with the drinks...thats the whole point, right?!\n\nSeveral other items they were also out of, and the drinks took forever to get! I saw only one bartender and he was trying to keep up with all of the parties. Ill cut him some slack because the dessert martinis we ordered were some of the BEST I've ever had. I HIGHLY recommend the Smores and the Almond Joy drink. I'm still dreaming of them!\n\n\nIf you have a party, I definitely recommending reserving one of the back tables. The front, casual dining area looked cute for brunch or lunch. Oh, and they have a bar inside the Paris that has a great HH.\n\nThanks, Sugar Factory, for a really fun dining experience!
