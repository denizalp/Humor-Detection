Wonderful cake Sonya. We loved it. Castle of cakes made our birthday cake for our first annual dinner and benefit and printed our logo on it. What I loved about her cake was it was rich, not too sweet and a real cake unlike the supermarket cakes that are more light a sponge. Thank-you. :) She delivered it on time with only a few days notice.
