I have been craving for a good hotdog for a long time now. And I didn't want just any hotdog. I heard about this place through Insta & been dying to go. \n\nFinally, after finding some free time. I decided to go & my family tagged along. We all tried a different hotdog, each were incredibly delicious!!! It definitely satisfied my overdue cravings. I had the Southern girl hotdog & I can't complain ! It has a nice kick at the end ! \n\nThe menu is a good size & easy to read. * They have Private Parking which makes it convenient. *Their place isn't too big, just enough space for everyone to feel relaxed. * It is very colorful inside with the music not being too loud. So you can carry a full conversation. * The staff is very friendly. \n\nDidn't get to try anything else but their hotdogs - JJ's was not a disappointment at all !! Check their place out if you are ever near the area !! (:
