We were looking for something for lunch on the strip and just wandered into Tom's.  We sat outside and were served promptly.  We ordered the nachos and buffalo chicken sliders and a few beers.  Fairly larger beer selection and the food was quite good.  The nachos were huge and more than enough for two people and the sliders were good too!  It was a pleasant surprise and a place I'd recommend if looking for lunch or dinner on the strip.
