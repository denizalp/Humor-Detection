My favorite go-to restaurant in Town Square and this area in general. I have literally never been disappointed with the menu and they keep it fresh with new additions seasonally while keeping the items you love the most. \n\nWhen it comes to the desserts, they are ALL delicious. I'm a brownie girl myself, but I recently my fianc√© and I tried the butter cake at the suggestion of our fantastic waitress Katrina. It. Was. Incredible. Wow, strawberry sauce, dense, moist butter cake with a fried-like border. Katrina's recommendations were on point from beginning to end. \n\nEAT HERE NOW.
