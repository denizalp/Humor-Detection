We found Phoenix Sliding Doors through searching the internet and after contacting 3-4 companies, Maurice at PSD was the low bid on installing some solar screens so we chose him.  We contacted him on a Friday, he set an appointment to come out and measure that Monday with a 3 hours window, he called us with 30 minute notice and said he would be there early and wanted to know if he could come early, which was great as I was home.  He measured and set up an installation appointment for that Thursday between 3pm and 6pm, he called with 30 minute notice again and said he could come early around 2:30, I told him I'd be home at 3 so go ahead and get started and I'll meet him when I get home.  By the time I got home at 3:15 he was done, the solar screens looked great and the function (darkening\/cooling our bedroom and master bathroom) was amazing.  I will be calling Maurice again to do more of our windows and would recommend his company for any of their services.  He not only shows up on time, he calls ahead, shows up early, and gets the job done quick and at the best price we could find.  Thanks Phoenix Sliding Doors!
