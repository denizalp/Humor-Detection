I had the Cajun chicken sandwich and fresh-cut fries for lunch today. Both were amazing. The chicken was tender and spiced just right and the fresh-cut fries were awesome. I love me some fresh-cut fries and they were cooked and seasoned perfectly. I also got a drink and my bill totaled $9.50. That's a sub, chips and drink at Subway for comparison's sake, so I didn't mind the price tag one bit. It's always nice to throw a mom-n-pop shop a little business and I'll be happy to again.\n\nMy only knock on the place was the grooves in the table collect some grime and they needed more attention. Dirt in the dining room can raise concerns about the kitchen, but it wasn't real bad so I wasn't too worried. Other than that, it was awesome.\n\nEDIT:\nJust a heads up: when you check in here, you're given a $1 coupon from Yelp to use here. They don't accept it and were mystified why it was offered. So, don't be expecting that $1 off anytime soon.\n\nAlso, they really need to use table clothes or to reseal the table tops as the grime in the creases is kind of nasty to eat on.
