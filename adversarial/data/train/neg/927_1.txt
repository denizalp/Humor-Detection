Breakfast.  Coffee was weak.. very weak.   Ordered an eggs, bacon and hashbrown breakfast that comes with silver dollar pancakes..    order eggs over medium and they arrived over easy..  very runny with a little of the whites still runny.  The hashbrowns were good but found a few pieces undercooked.  Bacon was spot on as was toast.  Pancakes were dry and flavorless..  could only taste syrup.  A better quality mix is needed.  Wait staff was fine..  no waiting for anything.  They were a bit too jovial around customers for my taste.  I want to be able to hear the people i am dining with... not the horseplay behind the counter.   We were seated close to the counter...   was saddened the owner declined to participate in fund-raising program for the high school a few blocks away considering it is a free program.  Community support is important and I'm a believer it will come back to you.  Will say the current ownership has improved the quality over the last one...  took me 6 years to return after that debacle.
