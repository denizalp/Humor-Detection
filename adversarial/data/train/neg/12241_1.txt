I ordered a new iced Carmel macchiato (a layered espresso beverage) and I have no idea what they gave me looked like a regular iced coffee and I asked the woman, \" is this a macchiato? It's supposed to be layered.\" She said, \" yes it's new...\" and I said, \" this isn't what the picture looked like...do they not train you to make new things?\" and she said \"no\" drink tasted like straight syrup and milk, no coffee.
