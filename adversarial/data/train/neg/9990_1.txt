Ehhh Its ok. I liked it before they remade it over. The deals were better before then too. The food court is still the same. And people in the kiosks are pushing stuff on you, that you clearly dont need. But as with everything look hard enough and you will find a deal hiding somewhere. Also if you dont want the food in the court. Good restaurants in the surrounding parking lot arent in short supply either.
