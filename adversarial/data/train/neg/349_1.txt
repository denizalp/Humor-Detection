I'm always skeptical about moving companies and them milking the clock or damaging stuff but the 2 guys that came over were great! They busted there tails wrapping the furniture and carrying it out. I was impressed with how fast they got everything packed up and unloaded. One of the guys told me how much time until the hr was up and said he would get it done before I got charged an extra hr. They finished with 4 minutes left. They were both very professional and friendly! I will definitely be using this company again!
