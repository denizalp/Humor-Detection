I very rarely go back to a place twice intentionally because I love to try new restaurants as much as possible, but I've been back here twice in one month. The first time I went was for my anniversary, and we were blown away. The appetizer was incredible, as we had whipped Gorgonzola with crostini's, apples, beets, radishes, and candied pecans. I tried their specialty meatloaf (which never leaves the menu), and it was one of the best dishes that I've had in Pittsburgh. When I returned earlier this week, I explained the menu to my family because it is farm-to-table inspired, and highly recommended the meatloaf. Our waiter said, \"If you try the meatloaf, you'll be back to try everything else\". This is so true! My entire family enjoyed their dishes tremendously on my second trip back. Their desserts are also amazing, so come hungry. You must try Avenue B!
