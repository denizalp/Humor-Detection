Rachel, the owner, is the most delightful and talented person you will ever meet. She has been beautifying my eyelashes and skin for over a year!  She is very accommodating to schedules and has even squeezed me in for last minute \"emergency\" appointments (much appreciated!). Please go see her, you will definitely not be disappointed! Thank you, Rachel, for always offering a warm welcome and exceeding my expectations!
