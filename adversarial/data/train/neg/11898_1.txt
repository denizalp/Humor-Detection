Bottom line, over priced for what you get.  \n\nThe spring rolls are very good and the Pho has a nice broth, but for what you are paying they really skimp on the meat and vegetables(which you are paying extra for).  Mostly broth and noodles.  Reminded me of my college days on the all ramen diet.\n\nThree stars for flavor and the very good spring rolls.
