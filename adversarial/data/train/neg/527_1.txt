Business trip for the week and the company set me up here. They had rooms avail and it was less than a mile from my office.\nA little hard to find this place, and I yelled at my GPS more than once, but when I called the hotel they helped guide me-and I was closer than I thought.\nMini suite room with kitchen, table, sofa, king sized bed, and flat screen TV.\nReally all the comforts of home, and the service from the staff was wonderful.\nThe mini suite shop is open 24 hours and has plenty of options for snacks, dinner, and beverages. They have breakfast and a welcome home dinner.\nIf you can get a room at a discount all the better, otherwise this place can be a tad spendy. Free Wi-Fi!
