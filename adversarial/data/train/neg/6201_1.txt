AVERAGE!!!  I honesty think it's the same people who used to own Cadillac Ranch.  Everything is the same interior...the patio may be nicer but that is about it.  We went on a Wednesday, waiting for an event to start at Blue Martini and decided to eat before we started to drink.  The food is not even average impressive and below boring.  I wished I was able to walk out but we were all seated and situated.  I had enough time while waiting for a server to read the reviews on YELP.  There were maybe about 15 customers in there and I was intrique my the bartender..not because she was awesome but she was a horrible bartender with little or no knowledge of service.  \n\nI can go on and on about this place, but I am not going to...I would just advise not to go if you want to have any kind of culinary experience because you won't get one.
