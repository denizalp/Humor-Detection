The food was gross ( amazing costumer service ) but the food was a complete miss got some carne asada nachos and it was the worst nachos I've ever tried, wrenched in chipotle sauce and not to mention the price, I don't really mind payng for pricey food if it's worth it but I would not even pay 5$ for those nachos again
