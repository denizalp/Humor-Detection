I love this place! It was a hidden gem in Baldwin St., and I'm glad I get to try it with my family. We tried chicken karaage, tonkotsu ramen, pork cutlet curry, chicken donbury, and the soft shell crab.\n\nService is also excellent, and the staff are very attentive. \n\n I work near this place and I probably will have my lunch here from now on.
