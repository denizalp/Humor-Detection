This is a great addition to the area, they have a fairly large selection of groceries, produce and various household products you may need when you're in a pinch.\n\nThe fruit and vegetable selection is decent, but they are often sold out of certain produce simply due to demand.  The meat selection is limited, but they do have a tiny bit of sea food.  Most of the sea food selection is frozen and note there is no butcher, sea food or deli dedicated areas.\n\nThe prices are basically the same as any other No Frils, but I find their fruits and vegetables to be a bit higher than others for some reason.  Also to note they don't take most major credit cards, which is beyond my comprehension.  I have no idea why a big chain would do this, but they might have some deal with PC cards exclusively.  Overall a good place to grab groceries on the run.
