I went here for a b'day dinner a few weeks ago and the food and service were impeccable!  The service may have been really good b\/c of our big group and the fact that we were sitting in the outdoor patio and had 1 server address all our needs (which they did very well).  I ordered the Salmon and it was delish - I'm not a big salmon fan, but I can eat it occassionally.  I do love seafood but I would say Salmon is my least favorite, but Spoon may have changed my mind!!!  It was so good, I can't even begin to desribe it's deliciousness...ok but let me try.  It was cooked to perfection, I had to tell the server \"well-done\" for the fish b\/c they ask you how you'd like it cooked...which I thought was odd for seafood.  But I told them that I like it flaky and tender and I'm only saying \"well-done\" b\/c I don't want it to be raw, but I don't want it dried out either.  They totally got what I was saying and it was cooked to perfection.\n\nI was a bit skeptical when they brought the dish out b\/c it looked tiny, but it sure filled me up.  Under the fish there were some green beans and some gnocchi.  Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!  \n\nFor a drink I got the Basil Gimlet - delish!  \n\nSure, when the check came it was a bit pricey, but every once in a while shouldn't you treat yourself to a great meal.  If you're looking for a treat, check out Spoon!
