Tried this parking company one time and will never do it again! The parking lot is run down and disgusting. The poorly maintained pavement ruins you bags. The vans were super slow on the way to the airport, and even slower on the way home. When we came back, we waited over 15 minutes for a van. We watched 5 Parking Spot vans pass, 3 Blue sky vans, and many others. We called twice,  and when the van finally showed up, there were so many people the van could not fit everyone. There are many better parking options. We will not use this one again.
