Excellent guacamole made table side. Their tequila mixes drinks are very unique and very delicious. It can get very crowded on the weekends and there's not much room to wait inside after the bar fills up but every time I have been there they get you seated within 20 minutes.  Wait staff is always great. They sent us home with a bag of chips and salsa to go once. Another time my boyfriend left his iPhone at the table and  the kept it for him until he got back to pick it up. Highly recommend this one
