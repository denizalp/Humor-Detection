My back tooth had a three-pronged root. The surrounding bones were decaying. My periodontist suggested I either do a root canal or have it pulled & implant a tooth. After considering all the costs, I decided to do a root canal and save my tooth. My regular dentist said he could not do the three-pronged root canal work. My periodontist recommended Dr. Shalev.\nWhen I first went to see him, my tooth was having an infection. He looked at x-ray and told me that he was not sure if the tooth could be saved. He suggested that we treat the infection first & decide what's next later. After spending 2 months of treatment & waiting for healing, he decided that root canal work could be done. I had a very bad experience from a root canal work 40 years ago. Dr. Shalev assured me that the technology has advanced in the past 40 years, and it won't be as painful as before. He delivered! My root canal work was not painful at all!! Not only that, the surrounding bones grew back to full level. My tooth is saved healthily.\nDr. Shalev is the BEST on my list. I highly recommend him to all unfortunate souls needing root canal work. His office staff is also very pleasant and courteous that makes the painful dental experience more tolerable.
