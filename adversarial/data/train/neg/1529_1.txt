This buffet lives up to its name!  We sat for 2 hours, eating enough crustaceans and other food to fill a small bay!  OK, I exaggerated, but its so worth the $38.\n\nMy hubby said the oysters were just OK; they were a little frozen from sitting in ice for awhile.  Avoid the fried food.  The dessert section is DAH BOMB!  Gelato, cheesecake, tarts, etc....I think I just turned into a diabetic.
