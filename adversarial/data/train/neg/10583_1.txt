Followed the star rating on this show and felt like it was a rip off.  Had a really hard time staying awake through this show.  Very, very old style.  Venue is old - sat at the tables stage side.  The only thing keeping me awake was the fact that the chair was so uncomfortable.  I've never actually enjoyed leaving a show to use the restroom until this one.  Even Peepshow was more entertaining.  Older crowd.
