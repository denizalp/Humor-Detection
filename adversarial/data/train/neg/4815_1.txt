I only recently started coming here, and I love the cultural \"food\" variety. Last time I was in I picked up rasmalais and gulab-jamuns (Indian sweets I can't get at other grocery stores). Yum! However, they are often out of stock of sale and popular items, so I recommend that you avoid shopping on weekends, and try to get there on weekdays when their stock is more plentiful.
