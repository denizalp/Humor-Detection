Very poor service. I'm fairly certain it's severely understaffed since the people working there were actually moving around well. Not the employees fault but it is what it is. \n\nFood is of quality but it's definitely not the first time I've been here and waited a significant amount of time for a meal or to be attended. Disappointed because the Rio is a solid hotel for the most part. Be cool if they used some of that 28 dollar per nite resort fee to handle this.
