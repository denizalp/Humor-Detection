This is a nice neighbourhood place, with tasty food, reasonable portions and prices.  Nothing fancy, but reliable and friendly.  Cuisine is Vietnamese with some Thai, Singapore and Malaysian dishes.  My favourite is the vermicelli with grilled pork, fried spring roll.  My son likes the pho.  My other son loves curry brisket beef with roti.
