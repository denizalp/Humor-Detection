Even though the Venetian is not a new hotel, it still feels somewhat new-ish and has been well-maintained. It has a timeless appearance and exudes elegance. And it does feel a bit like being in Italy with the shops and canal. \n\nBouchon is located here and it is well worth a visit for an upscale, delicious dinner :)
