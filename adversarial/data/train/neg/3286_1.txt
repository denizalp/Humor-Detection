Went during dinner time and had to make reservations. The waitress was really nice and always came to check in with us. Unfortunately, the food isn't all that good to need a reservation and the starter food tasted better than the entrees. I had the fried calamari and ahi tuna for starters and rib eye steak, jambalaya, and lobster ravioli for entrees. The jambalaya tasted different from any jambalaya I have ever tasted. It had a strong spice taste to it that I just ate 2 spoons and threw away the rest. The steak was juicy and tender, but the steak looked like a steak you get at like dennys or something. The lobster ravioli contain 3-4 pieces of mini bite sizes of lobster only and everything else was cheese despite being called lobster ravioli. Overall for the price and the food quality, I won't be returning to this restaurant. I would rather spend my money on something more fancy since the prices can compare.
