This theater is just frustrating to me which is why I rarely come here and would rather go to other theaters that are off the strip. First of all, this place is not easy to find and I probably would not have found it the first time I came here if it wasn't for the sign pointing me to the alley way. Then, when I did find it and went inside after purchasing my ticket, I was confused at the concession stand. Why is the popcorn in the display counter and the popper and it's not warm like other places. Don't get me wrong, the popcorn is okay, but I've had better, so it was just a disappointment. I didn't notice the place being overtly dirty, but it just didn't feel clean. The seats in the actual theater room were old, small, and uncomfortable! The place definitely needs an update. I was the only person seeing the movie I went to, and I felt kind of weird being alone in there which is not something I've ever felt at other theaters. I'd definitely rather go to a different movie theater than this one which is why I haven't been here in a while.
