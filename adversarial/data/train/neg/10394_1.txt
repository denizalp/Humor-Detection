One star for the dj, aside from that the waitress was sooo rude. We came here because a friend said the cocktails were good and that we would have a good time. We we were, until suddenly we felt very un welcomed. When we walked in they said we can stand by the bar. Ok, fine we were cool with that because we were not planning on being there too long. There was a table of a few people on the table  near the bar, and they invited us to sit at the end of the table. We were fine, enjoying the music and having our drink. The waitress came up, and asked that we leave. She said the tables were reserved and that we could not stand there by the bar. So we walked over to the other side of the bar to finish our drinks. Because they are very pricey and Lord knows I was going to let that go to waste. Waitress comes up to us again, and said we could not stand there. I asked her why and she could not answer. To be honest, I think it was a racial thing. She said we just couldn't be there. I was really upset and did not want to create a big deal. We just slammed our drinks and left. I would never go back. There were other people doing the same thing and she wasn't telling them anything. I am very disappointed.
