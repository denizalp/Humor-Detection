I come here a lot but lately I realized that that prize of there food is too expensive .the owner needs to lower the prices of the entrees. Pho soup is not that good, it's smaller and more expensive compare to PT noodles Vietnamese restaurant located at Litchfield. If you want us to come more often lower the prices thank you
