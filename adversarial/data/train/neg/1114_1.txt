I contracted these guys to take care of an expired registration ticket.  Tomorrow is my court date, first thing in the morning, and I cannot get in touch with them to help me take care of this! I am supposed to send them my copy of my new registration and a payment of $100.  I've called the number listed on their google website over and over again, and each time I call, they answer and then immediately hang up on me.\n\nMy emails are unanswered.  My calls are intentionally being ignored.  Legal matters aren't a game, and I am going through a MAJOR hassle because of this.  If you are looking to get a traffic ticket taken care of, I STRONGLY recommend looking elsewhere to avoid the panicky and frustration that I'm going through right now.
