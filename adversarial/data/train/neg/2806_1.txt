Good work, Jay-Z!\n\nI really hate most clubs in Las Vegas.  There's often way too many people, making it incredibly hot, impossible to move around, and generally a bad time.  This is an exception.  I went this past Friday night during a special grand opening party and was pleasantly surprised.  There are two levels.  The top level has all the VIP rooms.  There's also VIP seating on the edges.  The Jay-Z lounge is awesome.  You can play some pool but best of all there's a huge patio area that takes you right onto the strip.  It's an amazing location.\n\nThe centerpiece of the 40\/40 club is mulit-level couch seating (very comfortable) that faces perhaps the largest HD projection screen I've ever seen.  The 40\/40 doubles as a sports bar\/restaurant during the day with no cover charge.  I definitely plan to take in a game here sometime soon.  The lower level includes a good size dance area and more places to grab a drink.  The only drink I bought was a Bud Light for a surprisingly reasonable $5.  (this is the strip)\n\nThe 40\/40 is inside the Palazzo which hasn't even had it's official grand opening yet.  Go and enjoy yourself.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter going to 40\/40 on a night where the drinks were not free, and they let just anyone in, I was sadly disappointed.  15 bucks for a long island?  You've gotta be high.  Oh, and I can't pay with my card unless I rack up 30 bucks or more?  I'm outta here.  Three stars for you.  And that's for the location only.
