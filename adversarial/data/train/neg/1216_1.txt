I went to a happy hour at The Deuce Lounge last night.  The atmosphere is fun - open air, and it is where the high limit tables are at Aria.  For $10 to charity, I received a free skyy vodka drink (had it with ginger ale), and we had some appetizers.  They served Yellowtail Crunch (yellowtail cut up with cilantro and red chile on a cracker), Smoked Salmon with frisee salad and crostini (the salmon was thinner than paper), Tuna tartare with condiments and bread triangles, and beef carpaccio flatbread.  Considering how expensive this place is, I was thrilled to have these for my charitable donation.  I considered ordering another drink, but learned they were $18 each ($10 per beer) and refrained.\n\nThe one problem is that this private event was shared with an open space.  While that is normally okay, and my group has happy hours monthly at various lounges, restaurants, clubs and bars in town and on the strip, the manager(?) came by and told us guests that he was doing us a favor by giving us some free reserved tables and couches since this was \"last minute\" (we were supposed to be at Gold Lounge but I am not sure why there was a location change).  It made me feel unimportant.  I ended up watching NCAA Basketball on the big screens and leaving.\n\nSince I think I tried more than half their limited menu, and it is pricey and pretentious, I do not think I will be back.  Also note that the food comes from somewhere else and has to be brought in from mystery kitchen.  The bartenders were nice though!
