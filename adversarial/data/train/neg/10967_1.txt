We had recently lost our dog and the people that found him took him here after a few days of having him in their care (Thursday-Friday). When we went to go retrieve him (Saturday) they told us it would be a whopping 400$ to have him released without him getting neutered. Now my boyfriend had a moral dilemma about this and wanted him to have puppies one day. But the price was out of his reach and they wouldn't let him make payments towards the price. If we agreed to getting him neutered, however, the price dropped to 170$ AND we could make payments towards it (the price consisted of vaccine, microchip, neuter, license and inpounding).  I have no idea how this turns into 400 without the neutering. But we wanted our dog back so we chose the cheaper option. We just got him today (Monday) and found out he came back with FLEAS AND TICKS. Dogs after being neutered have to stay clean BUT how clean can this place be when they have fleas and ticks?! I've also been here to look for the same dog and these dogs are caged with their feces EVERYWHERE. I was almost not surprised he came home with these nasty bugs on him. And we can't even give him a bath for a while because of his surgery. What are we supposed to do now?! This place needs some serious changes!!
