I purchased a Groupon for carpet cleaning and had them also clean my sectional sofa. They did an outstanding job!  They showed up on time,  took the time to inquire about problem areas in the carpet (ie. pet stains) and got my sofa and carpet looking like new again.  I am very pleased and would highly recommend their services.
