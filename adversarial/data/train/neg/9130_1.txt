My go to cheap Chinese lunch spot on Harris Blvd.  The price is right.\n\nIts a great cheap lunch special($5-6 with eggroll) but sometimes the free tea tastes a little funky, so I don't drink it a lot of the time.  The chicken is real meat, the sauces aren't too salty and, there plenty of veggies with every dish.\n\nThat said, don't expect to be wowed by some 100% traditional Cantonese or Szechuan food.  This is Americanized Chinese and it gets the 4 stars because of food per $.
