I have gone here once before but did not feel particularly motivated to review it. I had the croque monsieur and it was tasty but I think I may have built the Bluebird Kitchen up in my mind that the sandwich just could not live up to the level I wanted it to be at. \n\nHowever today I went with one of my coworkers back to the Bluebird Kitchen and it I don't think either one of us could wait to review the sandwiches we had. I chose the Cuban sandwich because it is pretty much impossible for me to not eat one when it is an option. This Cuban sandwich was everything a lunch fantasy could be. Packed in between a buttery ciabatta roll, was layers of rosemary ham, pork belly, Swiss cheese, pickles and whole grain mustard. I eat quite a few Cuban sandwiches and this one has surpassed a good majority of any of the ones I have had in the past. \n\nThey also have delicious looking cakes and cookies. But I was too overwhelmed by the amount of pig I had committed to eating that I didn't think it was wise to add a macaron the size of my head on top of it. There are also daily specials which include a lot fresh soups and salad.
