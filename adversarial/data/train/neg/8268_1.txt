Went for date night. Our server Leslie was awesome, very attentive , she knew the drink and food menu very well. We tried the beets and goat cheese appetizer. Absolutely delicious. My man was in the mood for sliders, good choice. You only get 3 but you are able to add on extras for $5 each. Well worth it. The atmosphere is dark lighting, tv screens, relaxing. Would definitely go again. \n\nThe seating is several very long tables. You will be sitting with other people next to you unless you sit at the bar or they have individual barrel tables with stools to sit at. We sat at one of those. Would sit there again. Enjoyed it.
