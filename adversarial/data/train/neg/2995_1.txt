Z-Best has quite good food. The ribs weren't pulled fresh out of a smoker, they were cut and sitting in sauce, but they were very tender, tasty, and the sauce is excellent. The chicken was perfect, smoky, moist, delicious. The sides also impressed me, the macaroni and cheese  was excellent with apparently a mix of several types of cheese, rich and flavorful, and the biggest surprise was the cabbage. I'm not a big fan of cabbage in general, but wow, you HAVE to try the cabbage here, sweet, delicate, buttery, and the perfect complement to bbq. Plus you don't have to feel as guilty eating ribs if you have some relatively healthy cabbage in the same meal!\nThe negatives: Parking can be bad; you don't want to try during a Penguins game. And at off hour you might walk in to find the counter staff asleep in front of the TV.
