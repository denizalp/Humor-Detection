Low key day spa with excellent yoga classes! I haven't used the actual spa, so I can't comment on that.  The overall facility is clean, well staffed, with a relaxing atmosphere.  There is a small assortment of yoga and spa gear in the lobby to shop or kill time while waiting for a class. The yoga classroom is just the right size for a small-medium sized class.  It can get a little crowded for the more popular classes, but it still feels welcoming.  The room is not kept in the usual air conditioned deep freeze (which I appreciate), so your muscles can remain warm and loose.  I don't really enjoy the extreme heat of Bikram, so this is a nice compromise.  I don't know how this will fair during the Phoenician summers, but for now I am enjoying.\nCheck it out!
