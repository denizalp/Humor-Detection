My hubby & I stopped in after seeing a movie at Silver City. I read some reviews online, but based on product & what i saw, that's what drew me in.\n\nThe burgers were seasoned well, fit to the bun like they belonged together. The bun didn't fall apart and they didn't kill my burger with too much sauce or too little toppings. It was made just right!\n\nI ordered a side of poutine with mine, which was a $3.19 up-charge. I wasn't too crazy about the gravy, but the fries (i ordered an extra side!) were perfection! I don't like my poutine drowning in gravy & cheese to the point where my fries get soggy.\n\nThey offer almost every Pepsi & Coca-Cola product in their coolers. \n\nThere are a variety of fresh toppings to choose from for your burger. Simple menu & the name says it all!\n\nCan't wait to go back and crossing my fingers we get a location (very much needed!) in Markham!
