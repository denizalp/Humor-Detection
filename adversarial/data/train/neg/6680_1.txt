I recently had my old ugly plaster pool resurfaced by this company and they did a fabulous job. They made it look brand new and came in quite a bit less than the other two quotes I had. I found them on Yelp but asked around too and turns out Checker Pool Supply and Blue Marlin Pool service also recommend them. I also double checked with the contractors office and they had no complaints. .Work was done quickly and done very well, and it's a family run business which is nice.
