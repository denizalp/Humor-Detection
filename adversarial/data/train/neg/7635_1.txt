Food: 5 stars\nService: hit or miss\nValue: 4 stars\n\nWe tried both lunch and dinner at RM Seafood. It is owned by Rick Moonen, a celebrity chef who was in the Top Chef: Las Vegas competition.\n\nFor lunch, we used a Restaurant.com coupon ($10 off when purchased $20 or more) and we ordered a Catfish Sloppy Joe with sliced pickles, peppers and onions, and french fries ($15) and a Adam's Fish Sandwich with wedge fries ($16). Hubby also tried a glass of peach cocktail ($12). Hubby liked his Catfish Sloppy Joe very much. The rich sweet and spicy sauce was pretty tasty and unique. Compared to his, my fish sandwich was on the light side. The fish was perfectly cooked, crispy on the batter and juicy inside. I liked it! The waitress service was friendly and attentive. \n\nFor dinner, we had their prix fixe dinner, which included a glass of champagne, a fresh oyster for a starter ($3.75), a choice of Fuji apple salad ($15) or Rick's white clam chowder ($12) for appetizer, a choice of RM Style \"Cioppino\" ($36, calamarata pasta, mussels, clams, king crab, shrimp, and seasonal fish) or pan roasted free range chicken ($25) for main course, and 4 flavors of ice cream and sorbet served blind ($4.50). The total value of the dinner for two was over $115, but we got a great deal from Travel Zoo for only $89 (tax and gratuity were not included). The food was excellent, especially the Cioppino! The plate was filled with fresh delicious seafood and I love the bold yummy spicy flavors!\n\nThe food at RM Seafood was tasty and great, but the service at night was not so good. Our waiter was friendly and nice at the beginning, but after the starter, his attitude changed dramatically. We had a hard time finding him during our dinner, and when he served, his face was not pleasant. Even though he knew that we had a flight to catch and promised us he would keep an eye out for our food, our main course came late and we had to wait another 30 minutes for our ice cream. The timing of the food was horrible. Our waiter didn't even apologize for our wait! Total disappointment. \n\nOverall I really love their food. But for service, it is really a hit or miss.
