These are some of the best darn shortbread cookies I've ever had! These buttery pieces of goodness are crisp and crumble perfectly in my mouth. Flavours range from classic shortbread to orange chocolate. I've gifted these numerous times because they're delicious and adorable! So far they've been a hit with everyone that has tried them.\n\nThey're around $2 a pop, which does add up. You can get a slight discount with their boxed sets or buying in bulk. I can justify the purchase based on quality and the fact that these are cheaper than other treats out, like macaroons and cupcakes, which I usually opt for. \n\nThe people who work here are so warm and inviting. I've been offered a free cookie each time I've come. They box everything carefully and the packaging is so quaint. I'm a chocaholic, but don't worry if you're not. These are light enough not to overwhelm the palate. Try the dutch chocolate, chocolate crunch, or mint chocolate. They usually have about 12 different flavours each day so there's plenty of options to choose from. Check out the rest of the shop for other goodies as they also sell loose leaf tea, honey, maple syrup, jams and more.
