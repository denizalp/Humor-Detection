Katsu was the first AYCE Sushi place I tried when I moved to Toronto and as a result, my feelings about this place have changed a lot over time.\n\nOn a positive note, I would say that the sushi is good and fresh. The service is generally fast and the staff is friendly.\n\nIn comparison to other sushi places I've gone to I would say that their rolls have WAY too much rice in them. Their overall lunch selection is very bare bones and they don't have many specialty rolls on their AYCE menu (lunch or dinner).
