These guys are so nice and friendly!  I've already recommended them to a friend, and I'd be in all the time if they were closer to home, but as is, worth a trek. :)  I've called them with last minute requests a few times and they've always tried their best to accommodate me.\n\nI tried their lashes first, and she was so gentle I fell asleep almost immediately.  The lashes turned out well too.  Better than the previous place I went where the lashes fell off pretty quickly.  One note if you have sensitive eyes - I had a bit of a reaction to their lash glue where my eyes turned red.  When they found out they told me I should have come in right away and they would have fixed it.  They have a sensitive glue option, so if you are concerned your eyes might be sensitive, be sure to ask for that!
