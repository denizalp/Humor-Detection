A new Thai restaurant close to home!  I just had Pin Kaow last night so when I noticed this new place near my great dentist, I thought a taste comparison was in order. This place smells fresh and new. Contemporary decor, soft Thai music playing, friendly wait staff. Apparently, the owners have owned and sold other Thai restaurants around town.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Laab salad and the Som Tum with Grilled Shrimp. Both were excellent, and I definitely preferred their green papaya salad to the one served at Pin Kaow.\n\nThey have a Prix Fixe Lunch menu AND they deliver!\n\nI'll be back!
