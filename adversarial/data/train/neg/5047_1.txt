Sweet Basil has been here forever, but their cafe is a relatively (I know, it's probably been more than 2 years, but I don't get out for lunch much) new addition.  It is delightful.  The food was uniformly good.  I got quiche with broccoli salad, and it was fantastic.  My wife got the tarragon chicken salad sandwich, and said it was great.  She also got a cup of tortilla chicken soup (of the day), and man was it good.  I love being able to support local.  Will definitely return!
