Best customer service ive gotten at an Einsteins in the valley! The employee who took my order was a friendly young man who was polite and actually looked at me when I placed my order. The gentleman at the register called me by name, was extremely pleasant and offered $1 off my coffee for using my own commuter cup. I am SO glad I did not let my bad experiences at other Einstein's in the valley keep me from trying this one. I'll go back again, especially since it is so close to my office.
