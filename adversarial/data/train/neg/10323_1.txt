I have to agree with Keewi. This place is way too expensive for what you get. I absolutely adore Greek food, so I was excited to try some of their more unsual menu items. However, I was extremely disappointed in the tiropita. Not only was it TINY (just two small little triangles), it was $8. The eggplant mezze that I also had was more substantial and also around $8. I was scared to order more after seeing how small the tiropita was. Also, I sat out on the terrace and found that the table was very dirty. As it was kind of cold, perhaps other people weren't dining outdoors and it had been collecting dust all day. Nonetheless, that left me with a bad impression. The service was very good, however. I also enjoyed the Greek wine that I had. I might return here but definitely just for a quick snack. Way too pricey to try to eat a whole meal here.
