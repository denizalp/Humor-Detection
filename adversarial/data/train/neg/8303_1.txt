Our office has enjoyed team lunch from Liyuen on two occasions, and the food is delish! We really enjouy the jalapeno wings and shrimp fried rice combo. The egg fu young won rave reviews as well. Will definitely return. This is a take-out, cash only, walk up to a barred window establishment in a not great area, but worth the trip for lunch!
