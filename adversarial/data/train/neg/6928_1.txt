What a great little gem!  Don't be fooled when you walk in--it's very small and European.  The barista was extremely nice and informative about their specialty breakfast sandwich (TMC).  The sandwich was delicious and the coffee was great.  Quick service.  Would definitely return on my next trip to Montreal.
