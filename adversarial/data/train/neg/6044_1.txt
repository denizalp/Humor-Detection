Get ready to pay inflated Scottsdale prices for this little hole in the wall place. It's clean, friendly service and portion sizes are big. You can also choose your spice levels from 1-7. But, the food is mediocre at best and it's expensive. Paid $51.91 for 3 people for lunch with one appetizer to share and no drinks. I'm only used to paying these prices at upscale restaurants not at a place where you walk up to order. \nPho had bland broth. The pad Thai had good flavor but the beef was really tough...almost like beef jerky. Panang curry was just okay. The 4 spring rolls with lettuce and mint was $9.95. Wow! I'm used to seeing it for $3-4 at other Phoenix restaurants and $7 at the Tea Light Cafe (Scottsdale). I would pass.
