So let's be clear that this is NOT A RESTAURANT. It is more like back in your school days when you stood in line telling your lunch lady if you wanted the Jamaican patty or pizza. Not many options , $5 for a cold biscuit (reading the menu I thought it was a warm delicious biscuit), small coffee is another $5 orange juice $5, water $4. Came on a Monday and it's 30 min in line to order then another 25 min for then to prep your food. They yell out your name when its ready and you stand there shoulder to shoulder with other people waiting(after standing in line just to order ). I guess you can say I felt like a hen in a chicken coop.  \n\nOn a better note right out side of the chicken coop they have nice art work, unique chairs and table sitting, good music playing, and the huge chandelier great for a few pictures. The $9 egg cheese bacon sandwich was good but again small if you have a big appetite.\n\nWay to be happier about being here is that if your in a group have one or two people in the Starbucks line getting better coffee and a side like banana bread and have someone else in the line at egg slut.
