This place was great!! The drinks were good and the chef's special appetizer with shrimp and basil was fantastic! We had the burger, which was delicious, the veal steak, and the paperedelle.  My husband raved about the burger, the veal was perfectly seasoned and tender with something like fried mashed potatoes (very interesting and good) and a chimichurri sauce, our daughter had the paperedelle and this was also amazing ( I am definitely going to attempt this at home). Everything was outstanding, including the service.  At the end, the chef gave us, on the house, the best churros I have ever had! I definitely recommend this place.
