I love the salsa; plenty of garlic and no green chilies. I pick up to-go containers all the time, and it  gets hotter and tastier the longer is sits in the fridge. \n\nThis is the kind of Mexican place where everything is fried. There's no windows, so if you go at a peak time, you're going to smell when you leave. It is dive-ish, but it's family run and they are really nice folks. \n\nEverything is good, especially the albondigas soup. Get a combo with whatever you want, as the rice and beans are top-notch.
