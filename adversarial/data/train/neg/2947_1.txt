We were looking for an authentic Chinese place and were excited to try this place, especially because good Asian places are scarce in Scottsdale. Unfortunately the food tasted like one of your run-of-the-mill Americanized Chinese food, and honestly Panda Express or Pei Wei's food is more flavorful. Service was great still, and it is fair for takeout.
