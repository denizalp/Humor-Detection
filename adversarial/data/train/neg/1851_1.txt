This store is a little bit out of my way but I am willing to drive here due to the clean store and fact that the shelves are always stocked with what I need. I typically go mid afternoon. There is a decent grocery crowd but I am able to maneuver the isles without issue because there is minimal in isle floor stands. They seem to always keep fresh foods in the produce and meat departments which is a big plus when you want to try to eat healthy. The staff is friendly and always willing to help me if I need to find a particular item. Overall great store, keep it up!
