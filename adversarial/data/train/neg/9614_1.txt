Look, if you're looking for super fresh, tasty and healthy ingredients this is about as good as it gets!\n\nI always get a lil' burrito with either the spicy steak or barbacoa. Both of them are equally good. \n\nMy wife and I eat here 3+ times a week regularly and we love it! So glad these guys opened up just a block away from us. We are customers for life!
