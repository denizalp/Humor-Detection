Yummy bite-sized donuts.  They are indeed small and disappear in no time.  The cool thing is that they make the donuts with their counter-top donut fryer on the spot so you know they're fresh.\n\nAs for flavor, they're all lightly flavored due to their small size.  They're best eaten within an hour or so but the bacon one ideally right away cause the bacon crumbs will get cold.  \n\nI liked the cookies'n cream and the lemon meringue.  The boxes are for six or ten.
