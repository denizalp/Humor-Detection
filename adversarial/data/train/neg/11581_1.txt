Wow! Worst service ever. So RUDE!!! I ordered lunch here & the girl that took my order had the worst attitude in the world. Every time I asked a question about a dish, she would let out a sigh and her voice was so condescending! I've never had this type of treatment while ordering takeout. \n\nMy boyfriend went to pick up the food when he got home, everything was greasy and tasted like fish sauce. Look I don't mind fish sauce to enhance the flavors but let's not pour a gallon on each dish and call it a day. Thai food is suppose to be flavorful not salty and fishy tasting. We could not even finish our curry & pad thai. Yuck!\n\n I think I'm in a go back to ordering from Thai House down the street where the customer service is 1000 times more friendlier & food not so greasy and salty. Sorry but I'm taking my business and hard earned cash somewhere else much more deserving.
