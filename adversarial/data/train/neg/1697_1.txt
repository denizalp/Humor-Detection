Just visited the Cravings buffet on a Saturday. The build your own pasta bar and the unlimited beer and wine however was the show-stopper at this place. The pasta was very very good. Other than that, I honestly am not a huge buffet person. Something with quality drops off when food is sold in limit-less quantities. My friend had an insatiable craving for crab, so that's what brought us to a buffet at all. She thoroughly enjoyed it, but that was pretty much all she ate. I had a few of the other offerings like the Mexican food and the Asian food, and they were both just ok. The baked deserts including cookies were just average, and all 3 of us in my party agreed to that. What I did like was the gelato and sorbet machine. At least that made my walk to the dessert area worthy.\n\nOh yes, forgot to mention, the seating staff was excellent and very professional! \n\nYelp Yourself!
