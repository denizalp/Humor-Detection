I came in an hour before close and wanted to order a sandwich. They were pretty much sold out of all flavors of bread except for some different wheats. But the girls were all very helpful and kind while I chose my sandwich and ask about soups. The sandwich was made fresh and delivered to me within two minutes of ordering. \n\nI got light wheat, mayo, turkey, provolone, cheddar and lettuce. The give a generous helping of the meat! A nice meal for a reasonable price. You MUST try their oatmeal chocolate chip cookie!
