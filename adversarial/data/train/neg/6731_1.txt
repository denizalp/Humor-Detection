Highly overrated, if you ask me. Sorry, Guy Fieri. \n\nI live in the area and have gone to the Dor Stop several times. Not once have I figured out what all the fuss was about. The food is fine, but really nothing special.  The wait is entirely too long for the quality of the food. The staff is not particularly friendly. It's very loud and crowded as well.  \n\nAnd why hasn't anyone mentioned the religious propaganda all over the restaurant? There are several signs about God and faith, which is an instant turn-off for me. \n\nIf I could rate in half stars, I would give it a 2 1\/2. But since I can't, I lean more toward 2 stars than 3.
