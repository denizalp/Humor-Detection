i ordered matcha hot tea and muffin. they are good. not too sweet muffin.  but one thing that bothered me is the customer service. the barista doesn't seem friendly to me and doesn't smile to me. I didn't do anything and being polite and waiting for the order. He prepared a coffee latte for me but I didn't order it.  it was a wrong order.  he asked me again kinda aggressive what did I order exactly then he gave me a werid look.\n\nSpace is nice and cozy and modern but limited space. I had to sit on awkward tall chair.
