Warm welcome and excellent customer service! Large serving sizes so you will definitely have enough for left overs. The food is delicious! We tried the pulled pork, rib tips, Mac n cheese, potato salad & corn muffin tops. All of it is excellent but the mac n cheese is our favorite! You get to choose\/self serve your own sauce. Choose between sweet\/zesty, original or spicy. The dining attire really set the whole ambience of homemade & family BBQ. Happy, full customers. We will be back!
