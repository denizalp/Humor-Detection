I had high hopes for this shop... Close to the house and very convenient. However, the first time I went to get a cut I had to wait a while which was perfectly fine and the cut was good. I asked for SAMs card so I could come back with an appointment without having to wait so long. Called to make an appointment a few weeks later no answer and left a voicemail. No call back. Went in the next day SAM was there but I decided not to wait and got a cut from SCOTT. Same thing good cut, asked for the card and told him about the SAM thing like an inside joke(I wasn't miss pleased with SAM in anyway btw just assumed he didn't need my business), and said I'll be calling to make an appointment in a couple of weeks. I called a few days ago to set up an appointment with SCOTT for Saturday at 11:00. SCOTT said great I'll be here until 12:00. Guess what? Surprise!!! SCOTT wasn't there.... I WILL NOT BE RETURNING NOR WILL I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE. PS the cut I get is $18 and I always give $40.
