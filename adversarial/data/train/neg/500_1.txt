This was my first time coming here and I think i was smart by coming for Sunday brunch. I got here around 11am and there was so line at all. \n\nI got the chicken and waffles with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. Though the chicken and waffles were good, the poached eggs were overcooked and the hollandaise sauce def wasn't the best I've had. But I will say that the side of potatoes were pretty darn good. \n\nI also got the white chooclate macadamia nut cheesecake and I love cheesecake, so I was def a fan. \n\nThe service was really good tho! My waitress was really nice, friendly and attentive!
