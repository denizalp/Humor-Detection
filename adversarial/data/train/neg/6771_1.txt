Shout out to Psalm and Tiffany who did an amazing job on my hair.  I don't do hair, at all. I needed major help since I was going to a ball where photos would be taken.  I had originally planned on going to the blow dry bar but they were fully booked along with several other places I called.  My hair ended up more unique and cool so I am glad I ended up coming here any way.  The girls did an amazing job, yes it was a project and it took awhile but it was well worth the results. Thanks girls you rock!
