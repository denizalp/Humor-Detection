Pros - a lot of good lighting, quick service, open floor plan, a ton of food\n\nCons - taste, blaring club music, menu has too many items and isn't clear on what is included, price (mainly due to the food not being great), hot as hell \n\nThere's just sooooo many great breakfast places and this just isn't one of them. Big menu could be a pro if you have a large group with different tastes....but don't expect the best breakfast food ever.
