Steven has been a very great help with our taxes and always stays current monthly with the updates he sends out.  We read every issue.  Since 2002, both Steven and Leslie have made filing tax returns much easier.  Their Tax Prep documents always have kept us ahead of change.  Recently I reveiwed the tax implecations of starting a new business venture and the impact of the approaching RMD's on my 401K, annuities, and IRA's.  Steven always is  \"on top\" of his game...  as usual.  Recommend Steven and Leslie's services highly.  We appreciate the long standing professional support they have consistently delivered.
