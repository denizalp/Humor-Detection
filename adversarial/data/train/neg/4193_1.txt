I visited this particular Macys yesterday evening. Prior to going I called the store to confirm if a particular item was there the sales person on the phone informed me the computer identified the item I was looking for was in the store and if it could not be found once I got there there was one located in their storage facility where they get their merchandise and they would be able to ship it to me and return the original item that I received damaged from online. I took the 40 minute trip to the store. Upon arriving and going to the women's coat department as the item to be replaced was a Michael Kor's womens coat, the coat was no where to be found which is okay considering I was told there was one available in their storage facility. The real problem was there was no sales associate to be found at ANY of the floors service desks. I went back to the lower level and went to 2 more desks until I found an actual person. The same lady I talked to on the phone who informed me she wasn't in that area so she could not help me I asked her if she could call someone who could help me bc there were no employees to be found. After shovelling through papers and telling me she should have never picked up that shift for the day and trying to get ahold of someone to help me without success she got a hold of a Manger who was supposed to send someone to that department to help me. After gong all the way back to the second floor where the coats are located there was no one to be found. How does anyone ever buy anything in this store if there is no employees?! After searching another 5 minutes I found 2 employees complaining about how awful the store was I'd have to agree. At that point I just returned the item and left. I will never buy anything from macys again.
