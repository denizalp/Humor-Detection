I liked this place... it is owned by the same person that owns sauce, bloom and the green house...   I love the dining room... they have nice loungy couches that make it a private dinner... i can not complain about my meal (or the meals of my dinner mates)... none of us knew what to get so we asked the server what her favorites were... we ended up getting 3 of the 5... we had the scallops, ravioli and some sort of meat... all of them i would get again... check it out... it has not been opened long
