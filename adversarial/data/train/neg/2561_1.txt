First thing first, this restaurant is an imposter. It's not the same as the big chain in Hong Kong with the same Chinese name.  Similar menu, but the quality is not even close.\n\nService is simply terrible, if there's any service at all. It was a typical busy Sunday morning. Not overwhelmingly busy. The girl at the front just didn't feel like to answer your questions when you ask her. You can clearly tell she thinks you're stupid asking questions and she is very annoyed. The way she talks back to us just make us feel like she just wanted us out of there. \n\nWe order some hot food along with some dessert and smoothies to go. It would take them 15 minutes to get the hot food ready. So we would like to get our smoothies first. Makes sense.  However, she insist we need to get all the food, hot and frozen, all together at once because she said it is \"one order\".  It would've taken them less than 5 minutes to make 2 identical smoothies. It feels like she was doing it deliberately because we asked too many questions. And they didn't wait until the hot food was ready or almost ready to make our drinks. That means, by the time all the food was ready after 15 minutes, our smoothies were already melted half way. \n\nThe hot food and dessert didn't impress us.  It was ok at best. The mango smoothie was just terrible. It was already melted half way when we got them. And totally melted to a liquid after another 10 minutes on that hot day. It also taste like rotten mango especially once the ice melted. So bad we just threw them away. I just had a mango smoothie a day earlier in another place and it tasted very fresh. Not like this. \n\nThe service fails me big time. The food is not good. Why go back?
