The donuts are regular flavors. Everything special comes from the frosting and toppings. A LOT of frosting. If you're not into frosting, get a regular glazed donut. I got a Jesus, which was probably my favorite, but I ended up scraping half of the frosting off. The birthday cake donut was just a chocolate donut with sub par frosting. I scraped all the frosting off of that one. Did I mention there's a lot of frosting? Donuts are pricey at $2 each but they're about twice the size of a donut from other places.
