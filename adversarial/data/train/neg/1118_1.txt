I was very dissatisfied with Nee House\nMy wife ordered chicken pan fried noodles last week for take out and was charged $13.02.  This week I ordered the exact same thing but asked for the sauce on the side. They charged me $16.28, My wife called them thinking maybe there was an error,  The owner informed her that there was a $2 charge for having the sauce on the side. We we're charged $3.26 more not $2. To top things off all you get is sauce, chicken, bean sprouts and onions. Needless to say, we will not be going back. Unfortunately, we we're regulars at Silver Dragon but they closed down. The only reason we ordered from Nee House was because of it's close proximity to our residence. We'll be sure to take our business elsewhere.
