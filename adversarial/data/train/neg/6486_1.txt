I think this place needs to be treated more as a museum than a retail store.\n\nI came here looking for a few new floor lamps for my sweet new pad.  I had no idea of the caliber of this place - just that it seemed to be a Phoenix staple that I have driven by a zillion time.  I thought it was a normal lamp store.  Nope. \n\nThis is a high class, fancy pants lamp store!! I didn't see anything for under $200 (even the teeny little ones) and there were huge chandeliers that went all the way up to $17,000.  \n\nThe lights they had were beautiful, unique and in a wide range of styles from funky modern to antique.  The service was sub-par and I was only greeted after wandering the store in awe for 20 minutes.
