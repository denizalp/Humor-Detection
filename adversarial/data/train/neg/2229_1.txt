Excellent service and good food.  They offer unique flavor combinations- (like adding chocolate shavings to their tomato salad).  The scallops were amazing.  They have a nice dessert selection too.  The cookies were gigantic and tasty- although the chocolate-coconut-oatmeal cookie wasn't as good as it sounded on the menu.  The peanut butter and the chocolate chips were home runs though.  Great place!
