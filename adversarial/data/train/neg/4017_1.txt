I signed up for the rental on line and became a member for easier service. We have used Budget Rent A Car for years.  We were supposed to get a Ford Explorer at the Sky Harbor Budget Rent A Car in Phoenix.  When we got there, there was no Ford Explorer, but something called a Traverse, which I was not familiar with.  I asked, if there was anything else and we were offered an Expedition at $100.00 more. He seemed determined to up sell us something. We declined and said we would take the Traverse.  He then said okay we could have the Expedition because they did not have the Ford Explorer for no extra charge.  We said okay.  I answered a few more questions and declined everything and said I would pay the extra for bringing it back empty.\nThe whole thing happened very fast and was rather confusing.  We received the contract which was folded in an envelope and made the mistake of not reading it.  On the contract it said we would be charged an extra $29 a day for the Expedition.  When I got home from vacation, I read it as I did not understand  why we were being charged so much money.  I called customer service to have the charge removed. They refunded 50% of it.  The main reason, I am writing this review, is because we were lied to by the service person working there.  I do not want to do business with a company that lies to you.  I will not be using Budget again.  Make sure you read your contract, if they upgrade you to another car.
