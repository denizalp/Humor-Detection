It was a little hard to find at first but once I got there I was whisked into a series of wonderful therapeutic relaxing treatments. I started with a Dead Sea sat soak. After that I felt the stuff I was coughing up with allergies start to loosen which was great. Then I had a wonderful massage by James. He was very thorough and professional and really opened up my neck and shoulders. Then I did the bio mat ion session. I fell asleep I was so relaxed! Very glad I found this place. Only negative side is that it's a bit far for me to drive here but might just be worth it!
