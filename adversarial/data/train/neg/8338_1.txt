The absolutely best comic book store I've ever been to. They have great stock, a lot of their books come with boards and bags. Well organized, great discounts and the staff is friendly. Love the owner and his family, they're friendly and remember people even though they're super busy. They have a big Free Comic Book Day event every May. Locally owned and operated, support the little guys!
