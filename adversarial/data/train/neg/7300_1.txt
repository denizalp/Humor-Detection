First time at Moosehead Grill today and got a to-go order.  Grilled chicken sandwich with blackened bacon was fab.  Also, tomato basil soup was divine.  Customer service was great as well.  The place doesn't look like much from the outside or inside, but give it a chance.  You won't be sorry.  I have found that the dumpiest looking places can have the best food and nicest people.  Price vs. food was a good value.  $10 even - includes entr√©e, side item, drink and even tax.  Big enough portions that you could make another meal out of if you're not an enormous eater.  \n\nAngela
