No more waffles just ice cream, cookies, tea and coffee only.\n\nSo many ppl came for the waffles and left with disappointments cause they don't sell it anymore. \n\nI had their half ice cream sandwich with Milo ice cream. The Milo ice cream wasn't smooth enough and the chocolate cookie was so sweet.\n\nThe menu for the cookie is not the greatest with visibility cause the light grey words and yellow background blends. \n\nI like how they have a water booth at the front s
