Me and my boyfriend came here with a groupon (all you can eat and drink-alcohol- for $40). For this price, we rate the overall restaurant a 4 star. I had read some of the other reviews before going and I was just a little worried with how our experience would go but for the price, we figured we could give it a shot. \n\nWhen we first arrived, we were not very impressed- the ladies at the front were not the nicest and certainly not welcoming (almost felt unwelcome) so I was kinda worried we were going to have a bad experience. However, Abba took us to our seats and she was very nice. Our server was Phoung: she was INCREDIBLE! We were so impressed with her service, we NEVER ran out of drinks and she was so attentive. \n\n The food is not bad, especially for a buffet but that's what you have to realize, it's a buffet (quantity vs. quality), I have definitely had worse for buffets. I would probably give the food 3.5 stars overall (but the mexican food was pretty good-especially the quesadillas) and they have a pretty good selection. For the price we paid, we really just couldn't complain, but I don't think I would pay $70 to go there again. If i was going to spend that kind of money, I would probably pay more and try one of the higher end buffets I've heard about.
