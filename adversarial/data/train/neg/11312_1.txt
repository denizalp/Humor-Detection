The beef noodle soup is authentic and tastes pretty good. And you can customize your noodle by choosing the shape and thickness of the hand pulled noodle. I also tried some of their appetizers and really enjoyed them. The servers are nice and the food came fast. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to get a taste of authentic Lanzhou noodle:)
