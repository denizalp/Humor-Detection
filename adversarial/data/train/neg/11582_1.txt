What great customer service. Job well done. Comfortable waiting area with tv and drinks. Repair was a perfect 10\/10 stars. My only gripe is that I noticed over spray. I just would have wished someone would have done a quality check prior to delivering car back to customer. Needless to say, called them back up and rectified a solution. Just annoying \/ inconvenience to have to take vehicle back into shop when could have been avoided. Overall, would come back to the shop for body repair. Just minor detail that was missed.
