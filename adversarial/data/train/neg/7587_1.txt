Every once in a while I have the privilege of being blown away by an awesome shopping experience. Emerald Computers did just that. I am a very demanding customer, and my expectations were surpassed by this experience. This company is beyond awesome. \n      Jason is the owner. Very knowledgeable. Very courteous. I went to office max and Best Buy. Everything I was interested in they'd need to order. Plus they were not experts. Not even a mediocre level of computer knowledge. I spoke to Jason while I was at Office Max. Told him what I needed, drove there, and he built me the computer right then and there. High end graphics card, SSD everything I needed, and his prices blow away the corporate retail stores that are just not computer focused or savvy. I will never buy a computer again from anyone other than Emerald Computers. Plus, if I have any questions Jason is a quick tech support call away. Good luck calling Best Buy for support after you walk out of there with anything.
