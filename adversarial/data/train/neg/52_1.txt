Service was ok.  Don't know what it was.   Food wasn't that good.  Everything seemed prepared ahead.  The wagyu beef was stuck to the plate like it was in the fridge for a while.  Soups were salty.  Actually everything was a bit on the salty side.  Some of the meats were overlooked.  Tuna tartare was actually tuna sashimi.  I don't mind spending a chunk of money but I do expect something good.  Presentation was really good so it fooled you.
