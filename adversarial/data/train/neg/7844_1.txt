I've been coming to this spot for a while now and when the guys at Pristine took over, it's been my barber spot ever since. I've tried plenty of barbers in AZ since moving and there has not been a single spot that's been as good as Pristine. The owner is awesome and there is not a single bad barber there. Everyone knows what they're doing and they make sure you're looking the best you can. They also sell different pomades and gels like Suavecito and Johnny B Goode. The atmosphere is great and everyone in the shop is really friendly. They have some cool decorations in there too and like 4 T.V.s playing movies and shows. 5 stars all the way.
