My husband put cash for online delivery order. Saids  confirmed. Pizza Hut said wait is 15 minutes. We waited a whole hour. Then my husband called and they said we tried to call you to say we need credit card payment not cash, but your phone is disconnected. My husband gives him his credit card number.  Checked our phone. Our phone was not disconnected and we called are other phone to make sure it worked. Our phone sure worked. They lied to us. Said it would take 45 minutes.  We waited a hour and a half.  Never apologized.  Will go somewhere else.
