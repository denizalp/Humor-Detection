I accidentally stumbled across this store... I didn't know they were there on Bell Road. \n\nI own a 7' long Columbian Red Tail Boa... and he is hungry! \n\nSo I stopped in to pick up a \"frozen\" treat (rat) for his dinner. They had a really good selection of sizes... MUCH MORE than Petco (and I won't even mention PetSmart). \n\nThe girl working at the store (Brandi) was very helpful! \n\nThey had a good selection of snakes for sale... mostly Ball and Burmese Pythons and Red Tail Boas. There were a few small Albinos.\n\nThey had other \"exotics\".... turtles, tarantulas, etc.\n\nI will definitely be back for my snakes dietary needs!
