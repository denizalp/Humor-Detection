I see some bad bad reviews & to those people I say please don't go back you are crowding my favorite place to eat in the valley!! Some people just expect this 5 star service, but it's a deli not a restaurant! They are very busy!! If you want the best sometimes you have to wait!\nEverything is good you can't go wrong! And always very consistent for the last 20+ years I've been going there.\nHaters stay away!
