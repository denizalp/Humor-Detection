After having issues with my non stationary door shutting all by itself, I put in a call before my 2 year install warranty was up. It's done this since the beginning. We had Terry, a supervisor come out, after 1 attempt to fix the issue and when it wasn't, terry came to see what was going on. He then told us the door needed to be reset and would order more trim in the mean time. After a couple weeks, Cooper came out and totally reset the door. I have to be honest, I never thought our doors would work as nice as it does now. It ALWAYS felt like it was grinding when we tried to lock the door, and if you didn't give it an extra push, it wouldn't fully engage the lock. So not only is locking it super easy, the door swing is completely gone, on both sides of the French doors. I couldn't be more excited to really experience the true quality of Pella. The minor changes have totally affected our door, making it feel like the true quality it is. We now have to wait about a month for the siding to be ordered and installed. Pella sent in the wrong siding. I'm happy to wait as I feel like my true issues have been resolved. Thanks Pella!
