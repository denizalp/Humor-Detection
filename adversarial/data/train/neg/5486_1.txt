This buffet back in the days was the bomb of buffets with the long lines. The food is the most important thing aside from service and this was the most disappointing buffet that I went to. The prime rib and the Kobe beef were really dry and hard, like it had been sitting out for awhile! The crab was very watery with no crab flavor. I tried the cod thinking that it would be great but it had dried out on the buffet line and maybe sat for too long. It became plastic like and was inedible. Everything seemed to have been sitting there for awhile and it was only 7:00. There was an array of pasta, all hard and dried out! Please save your money and go elsewhere. This was so disappointing. If you don't believe me, go try it for yourself!
