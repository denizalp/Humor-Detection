Came in an ordered 3 different types of sushi 6pc, while we decided on our main course. We ordered a Malaysian Thai curry with a couple of bowls of rice.\n\nThe sushi came out within 1 minute... Odd... Some pieces were stuck together. Whatever we move on. **Edited: I believe the sushi is freshly made to order.**\n\nThe Malaysian Thai curry comes it within 3 minutes! Wth at least pretend to cook it... **Edited: as per the response below, the chicken is fried and added to a pre made sauce. I'm not a fan of this practice and a good curry would be made to order.**\n\nThrew it on our small table for 2 while we were just starting to eat the sushi. Very annoyed.\n\nI never expect good service from Chinese restaurants, and this was on the same page.\n\nFood was ok - the Malaysian curry is supposed to be spicy but wasn't at all, more sweet than anything.\n\nLarge menu, lot of choices between Chinese and Thai. But I guess everything is premade to accommodate such a large menu.
