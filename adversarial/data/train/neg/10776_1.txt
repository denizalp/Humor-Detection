I've been driving by this place the last couple of years and finally decided to try it given my love for small biz. Unfortunately, my husband and I were disappointed. We decided to try the La Mexican, and I was really hoping the chirzo was going to give it extra flare. When we opened the box it looked like we got sausage. I didn't see chirzo or ground beef, and the toppings were pretty bare. Most importantly, the crust tasted frozen. The one shiny thing about the food were the wings, they were cooked perfectly. Strangely, they were really small. Wish I could say I would go back, but I'm the only one in the family that has an itch for wings and I don't get them often.
