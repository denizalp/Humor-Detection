I had been here before and thought it would be fun to take a big group for my birthday.  BIG MISTAKE!!!!  It was the worse experience I've ever had.  \n\nI had called a week before to make a reservation for 12, because their website said they recommend reservations for 12 or more.  However, I talked to the manager and she said, they wouldn't be taking reservations because that weekend because of March madness and her suggestion was to come an hour early and put my name on a list.  So, I did just that, however, I was told by the hostess that she couldn't hold a table for me or seat me until all of my party is there.  Wish the manager would have told me that when I called.  No communication between management and staff and that's why they get poor ratings.  \n\nBasically, if you're going to have a large party in your group, call ahead of time and get details of reservations, seating requirements, etc. before you arrive.  \n\nIt was a frustrating experience and I won't go there again with a large party.
