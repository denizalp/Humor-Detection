The layout and lighting of this store is more open and brighter than some of the other Smith's and grocery stores in general throughout Vegas.\n\nTheir prices are better than the couple other grocers in our area, which offers a very limited selection for grocery purchases.\n\nThis location's staff is pretty friendly and helpful when we have questions or can't find something.\n\nTheir deli has a habit of advertising food specials, then never having the food available. The ads work so well I start craving the food pictured, run over to buy it only to be told, \"we don't have that\".
