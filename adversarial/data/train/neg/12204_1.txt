Kaya is a Big Burrito joint and aims to hit the Caribbean in both atmosphere and flavor profile. I would say it succeeds moderately well in both departments. \n\nWe had a number of dishes and drinks so I think we got a decent cross section of their offering. \n\nWe both started with the Pisco Sour (we can't say no to egg white froth!) and gave the jerk wings and the curried cauliflower a shot as apps. \n\nThe wings were spicy in a good way, but not spectacular. In fact, they tasted like regular old wings with jerk sauce poured over them. They were, however, plated on a creamy herb sauce that was quite excellent. \n\nThe cauliflower was good, and had an interesting sauce and pistachios that actually gave it a new angle. \n\nThe main dishes were oxtail (from the Trinidad special menu) as well as the famous rainbow salad with flank steak. \n\nAlthough the oxtail was very good, the portion size was tiny and not commensurate with the $15 price tag. \n\nThe salad, however, was something to write home about! Hot damn, that was the best salad \"as-a-meal\" I've ever had! It was colorful with a dozen different ingredients, well dressed and perfectly cooked flank steak chunks. I would honestly go back for this salad alone. \n\nWe sat at the bar, and service was decent, despite the busy night. All in all a good experience!
