Stopped in by chance decided to try it out. Well for starters the menu is simple looked like some tasty  appetizers as well as dinner and the wine looked tasty. The dinner looked pricy for the place since I have never been there before so we just stuck with the appetizers. They turned out perfectly. Some of The wine I have not tried prior to going there. \nWell two thumbs up well done the appetizers were perfect and the wine recommendation fit it perfectly. \nGreat place casual easy going laid back great place it made a nice impression to my date as well as myself. Definitely going back will have to try out the dinner next time.
