So awesome!! I love this place!  The people are so friendly and care about their customers!  I requested a special roll not on the menu.  The chef went above and beyond to make me happy!!  They even said they were going to put it on the menu!  The chef made a great roll for me.  Place looks nice and prices are great!!!  I moved to the other side of Vegas so it is farther away but I will make the trip!!
