Completely underwhelmed by their food offerings.  The waitress was very kind and executed her duties with grace.  That said,  the grinder sandwich was a major step down from Subway.  I paid $30 for a sandwich and a beer and ended up having to go somewhere else to satisfy my hunger.  Looks like they have a nice selection of wine but the food offerings were mediocre at best.
