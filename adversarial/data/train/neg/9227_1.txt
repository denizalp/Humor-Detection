Saw random reviews in yelp so I decided to check them out. I came in starting off as one of those quiet curious and careful not to look like a dummy type of people and right away like two or three guys from the back counter yelled hello. Not bad. Crept to one of the shelves and like a waiter at a restaurant one of them came up to me and asked which type of pistol I had (I was staring at the holsters) I told them I had a glock 19 and they said these are the glock holsters section and a particular they had he preferred and why. Not bad, not bad. Went to the actual area with the firearms and another one asked me if it was my first time in the shop. I said yeah I saw your reviews and figured why not as I live in the other side of the city, in which he said \"Well thank you and welcome to our shop\" and told the other employees that it was my first time in the shop. \"Did...you just put me on blast?\" In which the man replied \"yeah. I wanna to let them know any purchase you get, you also get a shirt for stopping by\" Not bad- who am I kidding, hell yeah!. In which the rest of them basically showed me how everything works they're honest opinion of the firearms, pros, cons, and basically all the info you want to know without trying to intimidate you. They even offer layaway. And they're very close the Clark County shooting complex. I give five stars to the few good men at Spartan arms, even tho I haven't purchased a actual firearm....yet. But I do plan too..once I research what I want next :)
