Not bad. It wasn't busy at all, even for 1pm on a Friday. Needed a new tire and this place was the overall cheapest. Friendly service rep. Would recommend this place. Reason I went here is because the Big O near my house wanted $30 more... this place was cheaper for the same kind of tire and job needed.
