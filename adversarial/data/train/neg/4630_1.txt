This place is HORRIBLE!!  The service is the worst I've ever seen.  The waiter and some chick sat in the corner practically making out while we sat patiently waiting for drink refills and our food.  Did I mention that we were the only customers in the whole place???  The food was BLAH!  They overcharged us (I suppose that's what happens when you have an empty restaurant and rent to pay)!  Not for me!
