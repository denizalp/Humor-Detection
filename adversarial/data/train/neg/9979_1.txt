I decided to try this place since its so close to my work. I don't have much experience with Hawaiian food so I wasn't sure what to order, I ordered the chicken Kahtsu with macaroni. It was crispy, and I enjoyed the sauce it came with. The portions are pretty big, staff I'm assuming the owners were very friendly. I'd go back... I did pass it by looking for it, It's pretty small inside but it's clean and well kept.
