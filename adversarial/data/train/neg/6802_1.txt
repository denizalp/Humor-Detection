I've been a subscriber of Fresh City's fruit and veggie bags for a few years now and have never been happier with the produce and service. At first, my partner and I began with biweekly deliveries for both the fear of not being able to finish everything as well as the love for grocery shopping at local businesses. Over time, we grew (and continue to grow) to enjoy incorporating fresh produce into all of our meals and eat more fresh food now than ever.\n\nThat swell of hope quickly followed by disappointment when the door of the empty fridge is swung open hardly comes around anymore. Every week, we look forward to receiving a new bounty, which now conveniently includes dairy and pantry items. During especially busy times, the additional tub of yogourt, litre of milk, and dozen eggs really saves us a lot of time. \n\nBeing introduced to new produce once in a while has also really opened the door to interesting conversations with friends, neighbours, and co-workers (who we often share our culinary creations with). Before Fresh City delivered them to us, a number of delicious produce including Jerusalem artichokes, tomatillos, spaghetti squash, and garlic scapes sat on my \"to try\" list for years. Between Fresh City's accompanying recipes and internet searches, dishes that come from our kitchen are more inspired than ever. \n\nThank you and keep up the great work, Fresh City Farms!
