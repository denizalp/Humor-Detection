My girlfriend and I came for breakfast and were seated promptly.  It took a while for the waitress to come over with waters, but it was busy and she had tables with food coming out.  Once she did come over, she was extremely nice and asked if we wanted anything to drink.  We got some coffees and ordered a donut to share.  They have 3 types (glazed, sprinkles and cinnamon-sugar) and we got the glazed donut.  It was delicious and well worth it.  For breakfast we ordered the corned beef hash which was pretty good, although I wish the potatoes were a little burnt.  My girlfriend got eggs morney, which she enjoyed.  When the waitress brought our check she also found a coupon for a free donut and coffee which we appreciated greatly.  Altogether, the food was good (and there were plenty of menu items that I wanted to try) and at a great price (nice food to dollar ratio in both quantity and quality).  The servers were friendly and thoughtful and we will be returning again.
