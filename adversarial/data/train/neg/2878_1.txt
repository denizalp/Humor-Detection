Giving it up to my guy Thom. I've been coming here for about four months after a long and arduous search for someone to fade and style me up right. Came in on a whim on a day they were taking appointments only and he took me right in and low and behold he did exactly what I was asking for and exceeded every thing I was expecting. Low key and chill dude and expertly skilled at his craft and leaves you feeling like a million bucks. all the guys here are awesome dudes and it's never a dull moment in the shop. It's a guys shop for sure but professional for families and kids.
