My daughter and I took a walk on a cold winter night and ramen was just the ticket we needed to help warm us up.  She went with the Morris while I opted for the spicy.  Overall, I felt both of our dishes were well prepared, noodles perfect cooked and portions sizes generous.  The spicy had the right amount of spice to light up your taste buds without taking over and masking the flavors of the other ingredients.  The Morris was very rich and perhaps the broth a little too fatty for my liking. The space is somewhat spartan-like (wooden crates for chairs) yet still comes off as cozy.  Service was friendly and helpful.\nOne suggestion I would have is regarding the fabric blinds in the front window.  Due to their size, I feel that others could get an impression that it is still under construction or not open (as they are hard to see through).  Just food for thought.
