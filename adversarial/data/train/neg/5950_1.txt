NEVER again! Just stood outIn n the cold with my two kids waiting for embassy suites shuttle and hotel kept saying driver would be there any minute. Then manager was very rude, would not pay for taxi and basically said sorry but  tough luck for us. Second time this has happened! Plus the rooms are shoddy and noisy and breakfast is weak. Never again!!!
