One of the worse Valentine's Day service my friend and I received tonight at this location. The waiter was sweet and friendly but kinda ignored us towards the end of are meal. \n\nAre waiter Never brought are check to pay for the meal she kept talking to her employees when her customers were more important then we were oh wait it gets better. \n\nWe been there since 6:30 already finished are meal table was cleared waiting on are to go desert Even though we ordered it to go she brought it out as we were to dine in. \n\n   Even though are waiter kept us waiting we were one of the last few people out a little after 8 during closing time if your waiter and staff is not going to respond to customers request then why bother working for a busy establishments that focus on people interaction \n\nDon't bother visiting this location I plan to have a talk with the corporate office because there no reason why a customer should not be ignored until an hours or so later.
