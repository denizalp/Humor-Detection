When you see Panda Wok from the outside you think \"Am I sure I want to eat here? Am I going to get sick from this place? It looks a little sketchy.\" At least that was what I was thinking when my friend and I decided we needed sushi ASAP. Don't let the outside fool you! When you walk in it is super elaborately decorated and beautiful! The sushi was delicious. It's not the best you'll have around here, but it is up to par. The sushi chef is a very friendly and remembered that my friend and I loved salmon and would hook it up every time we came back!
