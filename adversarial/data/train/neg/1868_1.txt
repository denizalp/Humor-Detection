If I could add 0 stars, I would. This place is super disrespectful to people who have never been to a dim sum place. As we walked in, no on the acknowledged  us, so we had to wait until someone actually noticed us. The waitresses are on their phones, some of them are just snorting up the boogers while waiting for the customers to ask for service. But we got seated, at a table that was not properly set, they did not tell us the \"specials\" so we had to figure it out on our own. They literally said that we got 5 mins left to order for the special of the day, which we did not have a clue was! They did not give us a full menu, nor did they offer us drinks\/tea. They did not speak to us respectfully, rather they seemed that they just wanted to end the conversation. So in short, I got fed up, left storming out of that place. Luckily, they had an Asian legend restaurant a street away. \n\nThat place is terrible with service and they honestly don't seem to care one bit. Cheap food, cheap service.
