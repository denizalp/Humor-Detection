I love love love this place :-) when Im sick I crave their chicken mazto ball and noodle soup :-) their bagels are great and you gotta pick up a black and white cookie while your there :-) i love their friendly New Yorker attitudes too. It does get busy here but i think its worth it. Try going during the week if you dont like real large crowds. Another thing is they have a $10 min to use your credit or debit card. I actaully came in at $9 and was going to add more to my bill since i didn't have cash on me but the girl smiled and said it was ok. I know it doesn't sound like much but i have been in places where they did make me buy extra when i was a dollar off, these small things don't go un-noticed with me :-)
