HORRIBLE!!! I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE 1:20 AM AND HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN CALLED FOR TRIAGE AND I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THE WAITING ROOM AT THIS POINT. I WENT TO THE FRONT DESK TO GET SOME INFO, THE GENTELMAN CALLS TO THE BACK THEN TELLS ME THE NURSE WILL FIND MY CHART AND CALL ME BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE... FIND??!! Clearly I'm here because I'm in pain and I do understand first come first served but to completely miss a chart and leave a patient waiting longer than needed is absolutely crazy! Even when I get called back and the nurses and doctors are as nice as they can be, it still will not change the fact that my chart was forgotten, had I not went to the front to check, I would still be sitting in that waiting room in excruciating pain. If I could give no stars I would. Sad because this is the first negative review I've written smh.
