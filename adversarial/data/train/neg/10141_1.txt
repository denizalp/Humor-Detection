Drinks were awesome! Very well balanced cocktails.  Tried 5 cocktails all were delicious. The service however was not 4 stars. After we all asked for individual checks, someone in our party did not tip. After the server picked up his check and noticed he didn't tip, she brought it back to him letting him know that she would leave it there in case he wanted to leave a tip. We all thought this was very rude. I understand the frustration when someone doesn't leave a tip but that was unnecessary. Other than that the place was great. Would definitely come back because it's hard to find a place that makes really great drinks!
