Love the food here; it's very fresh and crisp. Great pricing but not too many food options. Green curry beef and Spicy green bean beef was so flavourful and nicely prepared, meaning perfectly cooked and it wasn't too spicy\/hot. Pad Thai was nice and once it was a bit on the sweeter side. My favorite soup is Hot and Sour soup and their version has a really nice taste but its missing few ingredients like black stringy mushroom and the egg.
