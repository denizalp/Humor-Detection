Took my Chevy cavalier there for a check engine light and a light I wasn't too sure of what it meant.  Those two things are pretty much asking to be taken advantage of, but they didn't.  They were very respectful and it was finished with in a couple of hours of dropping it off.  I will be using them for everything incoming my car now, they have earned my trust and as paranoid as I can be at times that can be difficult.
