So where do I begin with this place. Back around thanksgiving of 2015 I had an accident outside of Phoenix. Truth is, I was terrified that my car was never going to be the same, and I had little faith that any body shop could do the work that I wanted. However, I found select auto body and couldn't believe their reviews! Due to this I chose select auto body over all the Honda certified places. Let me tell you that I still believe this to be one of the best decisions I ever made. Every person at Select, especially Bud, were so kind, understanding, and helpful throughout this entire stressful situation. I was constantly traveling during the repair but did not have to worry at any moment about my vehicle. Bud would personally call me and update me on how my car was going. Every time I called, I was received in a friendly and helpful manner. Once I got to Phoenix there were some unexpected problems and the car couldn't be delivered to me in the time they had estimated. I unfortunately was there very temporary (to pick up my cAr and nothing else) and probably wasn't the best customer to deal with. But, Bud and select did everything in their power to deliver me, my car, as fast as possible. The impressive part was that they did not cut any corners. Bud, assured me that when the car was complete and done correctly it would be delivered. And it sure was. Now I write this review 8 months after and my baby has preformed like it always has. Select Auto Body is now held in my highest regards. If anyone is in need of a dependable body shop that is honest, detailed, and will get the job done right, call select auto body.
