These dudes are the best!! I was looking for a tattoo shop near our hotel because we were in Vegas for my birthday. By the hands of fate I came across this shop and I knew we had to check it out. I mean it was only right that my girls and I see what all the fuss was about, after all we call ourselves the wolf pack. So after reading the reviews and emailing the shop telling them about us..the rest was history. We came in soon after arriving in Vegas and everyone in the shop was super nice and welcoming. The shop was very clean and the prices were great. I have already recommended them to a few people and would recommend them to anyone in the Vegas area. Danny did all 3 of my tattoos and I plan on going back for some others. Keep up the great work you guys!!!! \n\n*Baaad Girl*
