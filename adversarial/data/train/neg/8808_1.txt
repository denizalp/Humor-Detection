Overall this restaurant was quite mediocre. \n\nThe fried mozzarella and calamari were delicious. For my entr√©e, I had the Spaghetti al Pescetore which I would not recommend. It lacked flavour and the tomato sauce was nothing special. I tried my boyfriend's  Pappardelle con Fungi which I also didn't like.\n\nWe were in a group of over 20 people and the service was very good. Our server was quick and accurate.
