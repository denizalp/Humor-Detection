While I have visited before and the service\/food was good... things have gone downhill. I went with a group last weekend. We were told 45 minutes to get a table while we saw several tables open and waiting to be cleaned. We waited at the bar and I literally stared at the bartender for 20 minutes without any luck. Finally a friend spoke up and tried to get her attention. She finally comes over and says \"did you just holler at me?\" Well after 20 minutes of not acknowledging our presence we had to. Then he had to mention that I was waiting and first in line. I asked for a house glass of wine and she served me a $10 glass. The manager then comes over and tells my friend, THE CUSTOMER, to apologize to the waitress for 'hollering' at her. The bartender was horrible. The service was the worst I have received in a long time. Will not be back ever again. What a huge disapointment.
