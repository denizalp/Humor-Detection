This restaurant would be right at home at Red Rock or even on the strip.  The decor is classy, the atmosphere lively,  and the food and cocktails on point.  There were a few hiccups with tonight being the first time they offered a happy hour but it was worked out.  \n\nI started off with an Angry Cucumber and, once the question of if we could order food before 5 was worked out (yes you can), I ordered the short rib flat bread and onion rings.  It did take a little bit for them to come out which I will attribute to the fitst HH thing.  I  ordered an Esmeralda while waiting and my food came out shortly thereafter.   \n\nAt first I was a little sad the flat bread didn't seem to have much short rib but the flavour was there.   The onion rings could have done with a little less batter but they were good, and the dip was great. Service was good, so no complaints there.\n\nI will have to add Hawthorn to my regular rotation.
