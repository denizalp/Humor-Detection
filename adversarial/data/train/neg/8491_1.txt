I would say it's one of the best non-franchise pizza places out there. A 3Star rating because of the way my order was billed. I called and asked for a pizza special. Ordered 2 pizzas along with a Philly and 10 hot wings. Immediately I called back because I realized it was too much food for just 2 people; plus it totaled $49! So I asked for a \"special\" that included hot wings along with a pizza hoping to save some money. To my surprise, upon delivery I realized the girl had billed all items a la carte. My total was $43! A bit more than I expected to pay, all because nothing was combined into a \"deal\" price!\nDelivery was 1:10 mins. But she did quote accurately so that was ok. Will probably order again; I will just make sure this time if don't over pay!
