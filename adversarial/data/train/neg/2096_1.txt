I've been to two Cirque shows in the past, and honestly was a little bored by them. I always totally respected the artistic and acrobatic side of their shows, I just couldn't help but leave a little underwhelmed. Not this time...\n\nBecause this is an actual Cirque theater, and not a traveling tent - they can pull off many more stage changes and video screens - and just put an all around better show.\n\nPlus, the Beatles factor was was amazing! The music was awesome, the visual tricks were hypnotizing, and the acrobatics were awe inspiring. I love the Beatles, but think that any music can really help with spicing things up. I think a Led Zeppelin or Jimi show would also be crazy good.\n\nEasily the best Cirque du Soleil I've ever seen. 5 stars!
