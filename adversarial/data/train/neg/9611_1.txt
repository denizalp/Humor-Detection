YUMMY!!!  My husband and I had a delicious lunch today on the patio.  We shared a salad and 2 pizzas.  The owner Bill had us try this pizza that was AMAZING!  The salad was yummy too :)  \n\nWe will definitely be coming back again!  A hidden gem right off of Scottsdale Rd and Shea\n\nLOVED THIS PLACE!!!
