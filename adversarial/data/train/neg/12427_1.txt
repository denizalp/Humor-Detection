My children love this place and are not afraid of the dentist. They have a friendly staff, comfortable waiting room, kid's movies and an adjacent playroom. They are easy schedule with and are located by the Biltmore, so you can get whatever you need to eat or shop for. It is also right next to the 51 Freeway. We have been coming here for about 7 years.
