I have never been to a bottle shop before but I was impressed by the variety of beer and wine they have, as well as having a selection of beers on tap. My favourite thing about this place though was that they give you samples of whatever you wanted to order, if it's on tap. This is great because I would have the option to have a full glass or pick something else if I realized I didn't actually like it. I was impressed.
