I would like to give them four stars but unless you pay careful attention to your order there is a very good chance they will screw it up.  I don't get a good vibe from the staff either, I have yet to have real bad service but I get the impression they don't really care.  That's fast food.....\n\nI only go back for a few reasons.  The quality of food is slightly better than McDonald's and BK, my son loves it AND you can substitute chili for fries.
