We ordered here a couple times for lunch. The signature burger is delicious. I've tried the sig. burger with chili once and egg on another occasion. The chili rivals fatburgers chili and is very tasty. My coworkers always order the milkshakes and look tasty. We have been ordering hotdogs and sliders on tuesdays for the past 3 weeks now, for there special.\n\nI removed a star, cuz on 2 different cases. 2 coworkers received the wrong order. 1 case was wrong size burger and 2 it was missing something.
