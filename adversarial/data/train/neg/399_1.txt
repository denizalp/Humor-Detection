I stayed at this hotel with a couple of friends for a convention that we were attending. Initial reaction walking to the room was that it looked pretty standard for a hotel room.  We did find find an apple core on the floor, one light switch didn't work, the knob for a lamp kept falling off, and you could see rings all over on the table counter in the bathroom.  That wasn't thrilling, but  there could have been worse things.  If you wanted anything for breakfast, you had to buy it, and they did have a nice little coffee shop on the first floor.  It was pretty busy in the mornings as I a lot of people who were attending the convention needed their daily cup of joe.  A plus to staying here is that it's right by the beltline so it's easy to get around the city.
