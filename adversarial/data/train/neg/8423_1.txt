BUYER BEWARE!!! Once I received car, he ignored all calls, text, etc. He said $3000 worth of items were installed on car and when we received they didn't word. His exact response is \" I just take pictures of the items in the car, I don't actually check everything to see if it works\". When your dealing with an out of state dealer that ships cars, you really are hoping everything is what is should be from description! I would NEVER purchase from again if I had the chance to do over!
