I'm from Cali so we don't get to shoot to many Rifles. They were pretty slammed with people when we got there but the staff was quick. The Customer service was great! Our range officer was Jeremy and that guy was also extremely helpful.\n We got the Machine Gun II package. Guns were awesome but the MP5 jammed a few times, no big deal. Overall we were in and out really didn't have to wait long. This place is dope thanks guys.
