The most disappointing visit ever. It is always busy & today was no different. We waited, we're seated & pleasantly greeted by Claire who began our service with a smile. It went downhill quickly from there. We had to make multiple requests for replacement dip and our appetizer was completely forgotten (Claire did apologize & comp the table-side guacamole). It was made (AFTER our dinner was served) & was very bland. No offer was made for enhancements. Our chip bowl was crumbs & was never replaced. No one came to check on us. We quickly were out of napkins & were using the beverage napkins. While we were still eating we were offered to-go boxes & plates were removed- WHILE WE WERE STILL EATING!!  We have been here when it was busier but this visit we were made to feel like \"Hurry. Finish. Don't let the door hit you in the a**.\"  I wasn't even able to utilize my Yelp offer. Wow. Still good food but wow is all I can say about the lapse of service overall
