This is, by far the most amazing botanical gardens I have ever been to. The flowers are incredible, the landscapes are so complex and interesting, and the Japanese garden is amazing in the fall with all of the lanterns. If you are planning a trip to Montreal, make sure this is a stop on your way and hopefully you'll be here in the fall for the lanterns. Bringing a picnic lunch and a book to read can be the best decision of your vacation.
