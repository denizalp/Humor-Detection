Basically mainland Asia version of Deer Garden - more selection but more expensive. Very casual, fast Asian foods. Bright with several seatings, good for students that want to drop by for a quick lunch. Fast service: only took about 10 mins from picking ingredients to getting your food! \n\nYou get to pick your own ingredients where they make it into a hotpot stew for you. You just grab what you want into the bowl and bring it up to the counter, remember to put noodles into your bowl too! When you bring it up, they basically just add the soup and boil it for you. \n\n$8.99\/lb choose your own soup (signature spicy soup). Very yummy, 4 levels of spicy - got regular and it was pretty weak. Overall, it was surprisingly really good (RECOMMEND)\n\n$4.50 whole lemon black (NOT RECOMMENDED)\n\/green tea - pretty good but wouldn't recommend paying for this (cost: lemon $0.5 + tea $0.25, that's a 600% markup but I guess that's all foods )\n\n4 stars for the food, relatively pricey for what you're getting so 3 stars.\n\n***Debit\/Cash Only***
