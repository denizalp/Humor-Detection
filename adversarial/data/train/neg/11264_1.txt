This place can be a bit of a uprise when ordering anything from your usual to a newer menu item. In my experiences visiting this location, the quality of service and food vary based on the time of your visit. For example the Guac which is usually tolerable at best was bursting with flavour on my recent visit. The staff where willing to do my order and hold on to it while I ran down the street to grab my self a drink at booster juice, and it wasn't soggy when I returned, the way it has been in the past.
