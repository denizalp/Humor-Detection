After hearing so much about Firehouse Subs, I knew I had to give it a try. I invited a friend of mine to join me for lunch and she confirmed that she, too, had heard only great things about it.\n\nNow, I'm a huge fan of a good sub sandwich. It takes a lot for me to get tired of eating sandwiches. I was raised on delicious Jersey subs, so it's basically a part of who I am.\n\nTo keep an unexceptional story short, both myself and my friend were sadly disappointed by the Firehouse Sub experience. The food was not nearly as good as we had come to hope based on what everyone was saying.\n\nI ordered the Cheese Steak Combo (medium) and my friend ordered the Engineer sandwich (also medium). We split the chips and drink included with the combo, but our total still came to just shy of $30 before tip.\n\nIt's not that the food was bad. It's just that, with truly outstanding options like Capriotti's and Which Wich so close by, you leave Firehouse Subs with the sense that just paid a little too much for a characterless, undersized sandwich.\n\nYou get way more food for your money at Capriotti's and Which Wich. You also get better tasting food, in my opinion. Ambiance is comparable between the three. Service at Firehouse Subs was just-ok (whereas service at Capriotti's is outstanding).\n\nAgain - there was nothing WRONG with Firehouse Subs. I just don't think I prefer them when other, subjectively \"better\", options are so close by. I probably won't bother returning, but neither would I turn anyone away.
