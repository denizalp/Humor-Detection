Specifically requested a quiet room but was put in front of a major roadway overlooking a parking lot which was called a \"mountain view\" room. There were some mountains way far out in the background, totally misleading. Then woken up two different times by housekeeping hanging in hallway chatting. They offered to move my room for an additional fee. Really? I wouldn't accept more charges for what should have been appropriately accommodated in the first place. At 5:30am I was woken up by the people packing up in the adjacent room. I was unaware I had an adjacent room? No rest whatsoever. The restaurant staff was very nice, but that's it. I didn't like it here, will never come back.
