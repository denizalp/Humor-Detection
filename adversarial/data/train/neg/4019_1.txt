Came in too Pizza Rev Tuesday and was attended by Sierra. Her customer service is Awesome! Made both of our pizzas fast and on point. She made us feel comfortable and made eye contact as we choose our toppings. It must of been at the end of the day because she was on it making sure all her other tasks where done. While we sat to dine in ,she made a couple other pizzas, cleaned her work station \/counters and cleaned both womens and mens bathrooms. We must of been there a total of 45min. Shes a great example of great customer service and trustworthy employee. Thank you Sierra!!!\nFreddy n Leah
