Convinced in my coupons left on door with makeshift crossed off and remade expirations. Coupons save you about $2. Food was varied from very good to mediocre. Seating at the bar seems to be the way to go to guarantee staff attention and the people there seemed like they were having a lot of fun interacting with the guests. Messed up my sushi order but they were nice enough to comp the sushi. Standard sushi prices. Good raw quail egg. Probably won't be back.
