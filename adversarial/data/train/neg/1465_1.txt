Duffys is located a couple blocks down from where I live so I have given this place more then a few chances and have been disappointed time and time again. Not only does the kitchen close erratically (when it says it's open until 2 everyday)but I have  also ordered the same salad 3 times and each time have been given a different variation. The staff never make an attempt to engage or show any excitement to make experience pleasurable. It's a shame because a good dive bar with a late night menu is just what this area needs.
