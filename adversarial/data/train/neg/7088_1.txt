This cozy little store doesn't always have the produce selection of an outdoor market, but what it lacks in produce selection it makes up for in dry goods and convenience. It's open long hours 7 days a week and carries dairy products, eggs, dry goods, produce and has a small cafe. \n\nAlso the local bread here is amazing and ridiculously cheap for the quality.
