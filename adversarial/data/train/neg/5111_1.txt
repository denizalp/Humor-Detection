It's a shame that this place is not better. As a vegan working in the area this should be my go-to lunch destination. The food is decent, but not anything that I could not make at home. The good-vibes, hippy-type atmosphere is marred by the hostility I have experienced there each time I have tried to support this restaurant. During my last attempt I witnessed one of the servers being berated by the person in charge. \nThe original Gratitude Cafe in San Francisco makes this place look pretty sad.
