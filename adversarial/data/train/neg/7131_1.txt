This place is super cute. They have all manner of sundays, shakes, malts and desserts. They also have French press coffee. I went for coffee and dessert after a dinner out with friends and was pleasantly surprised. It's quaint and cute and perfect for coffee and dessert or taking kids for a surprise treat.
