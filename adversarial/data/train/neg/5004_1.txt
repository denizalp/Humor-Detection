I had a good first experience at Di Luxe. I purchased the Groupon for a min-pedi and free drink for a friend and I. We had an easy time setting up an appointment and they had plenty of availability. The place was a little hard to find, since it is in a \"business like\" building on the 2nd floor. I like that the salon was quiet and was not overcrowded like most salons. My nail artist was really nice and the main-pedi turned out really nice! If you want a more relaxing, laid back, non crowded nail salon experience, I would try Di Luxe!
