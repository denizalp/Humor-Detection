I have been going to Chino Bandidos for years now. Have my order down. (7Q\/7B- blk beans - jfr) So when I go and pick up food for me and the hubby I get my slip write my order and up to the counter with in minutes. Never change our selection because we love it. We always get food to go. We even go out of our way every so often, as we are on the opposite side of town. My husband usually eats his in one sitting and for me it's like 2-3 meals if I share with the hubby or not. Before today I would give them 5 stars. \n\nIt's been a few months since we have gotten food from here but I was in the area and decided to get some. I order the usual. Drive an hour to get home and I'm excited to dive in.  it wasn't jade red chicken (#7) my usual. So disappointing. And on top of it the jerk fried rice was greasy and didn't have the usual kick to it. \n\nI usually don't write reviews but so disappointed in the over an hour anticipation of having the regs only to be rejected . I gave them a 4 stars because this has been the first bad experience I have had and I'm hoping this was just a one time thing. I'm willing to keep hope but if this is going to be the new pattern I won't be going out of my way anymore.
