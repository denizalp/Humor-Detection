I was in line for 20min and when I got to the front the cashier told me he was closed.  I went to another line and waited 30min just to be told that register wasn't open anymore.  I started waiting in lines at about 11:30 pm.  I didn't get out of there until 12:40am.  I was the last customer out of the store.  I told both of the managers there what happened and Austin the co-manager said \"Don't worry\", \"I will get to the bottom of it\"  I told him that doesn't help me.  He said nothing more.\n\nOf course when I went to my car the other items from other stores had already melted.  (I usually shop 2-3 stores when I go shopping).\n\nBottom line-  PLEASE DON'T SHOP HERE.  BAD MANAGEMENT+FILTHY CUSTOMERS ON DRUGS = PURE CHAOS WITH NO ORGANIZATION WHAT-SO-EVER.\n\nWhen I returned home my husband told me that this is the worst Walmart in Phoenix with the most incidents (police arrests) averaging 11 per day.  Go to the Walmart on 35th Ave and Bethany Home.  It's worth going the extra 2 miles.
