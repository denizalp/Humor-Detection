Played this course today, course was in ok shape.  There is no sand in bunkers, but I guess if you don't it into them you shouldn't have to worry. There was no ranger on course at time s there was 3 foursomes on same hole led to 6 hour round.  If they are going to allow this slow pace make the cart girl work all day only saw her once on front side.  I do not recommend this course.
