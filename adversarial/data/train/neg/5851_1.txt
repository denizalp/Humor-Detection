So maybe the name doesn't fit the face...but Local Breeze is a wonderful, independently owned, affordable establishment that is most deserving of having many a bridal shower thrown there.  In fact, I recently co-hosted a lovely bridal shower there myself!\n\nThe other bridesmaids and I knew that we wanted an adorable, shabby chic place to hold a Saturday lunchtime shower for 15 of our vegan bride's nearest and dearest.  After chatting with the manager, it seemed that this was going to be easy peasy.  He was completely flexible - we could either use the entire weekend brunch menu or he would type up a limited menu of selections for our guests.  There was no minimum charge either way which is a stellar bonus considering so many cute, bridal shower-y places in Phoenix require you to spend a certain amount.  Local Breeze also has several vegan dishes on the menu (phew!) but we decided not to limit the entire menu to veggie\/vegan options.\n\nThe manager pre-printed personalized menus for our guests featuring 4  brunch entree options that were $10 or less (talk about a bridal shower on a budget)!\nWe ended up choosing:\nBananas Foster French Toast\nFire Island Eggs\nChopped Salad \nVeggie Island \n\nWe also pre-ordered carafes of their white sangria so our ladies could get into the groove directly upon arrival.  The food was plentiful and received lots of props!  While our waitress seemed a little hungover from partying the night before, the outdoor setting was perfect for our shower and our bride was as happy as a vegan clam!
