Based on the reviews and the atmosphere, I was hoping for more then what we got.  The menu has an abundance of items to chose from.  To me seemed kind of overwhelming.  Two of our chairs had broken centers.  Two of us had to sit in holes since there were no other chairs to swap out.  Foodas the noise.  It was so loud from the crowd that was at the bar, carried over into the dinning room.  We had to talk very loud to almost a soft yell to hear each other.  Food however, was great...a little pricy for me, but very good.  This was my first and only visit...hopefully my next will be better.
