Went in to get my phone exchanged. Waited in line like everyone else. Finally every was helped but me. The guy to the left in front finishes with his customer I know I'm next. Tells me to hold on while he goes and checks people in. Spends over 10 minutes talking to a girl tbat lost all her text messages on her phone. That just came in the door. I ended up being help by the guy to my right that finished up with his customer while he was still talking to the girls. Was almost late picking up my son from school
