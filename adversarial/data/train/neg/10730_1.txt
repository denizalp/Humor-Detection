Tried this place for takeout. The food was delicious and menu selection was hearty. Prices are a bit higher than other Chinese restaurants but considering they probably pay a steep rent for the Summerlin location, it's understandable.\n\nThe host was extremely helpful when we picked up our order. The added hospitality was a nice touch. \n\nWill be back for sure in the future!
