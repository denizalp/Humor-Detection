Went to Beerbistro for a nice dinner with the guys, and was not disappointed. Food was awesome, beer menu was nuts (though they could use some Beau's). After we ate, the host asked us to move to the lounge area so that they could sit more people at the table, and gave us a round of drinks as a thanks. Great spot.
