A really neat coffee house in the Riverdale area.  It's right across the hills, so offers a scenic view of Toronto and don valley without the hustle and bustle of the inner city.  Lots of specialty drinks and they'll do designs on the foam with them to give that personal touch.  They have dozens of treats and serve sandwiches as well until they run out.\n\nFree wifi and plenty of space to sit, read the paper, catch up on emails or what not on a weekend morning.  It has a mom and pop, cozy feel to it that you don't get a starbucks or second cup.  More importantly the drip coffee is actually GOOD!
