Lovely place, classic and cozy.\nJazz music as background.. Great.\nThe waitress was nice, smiley and fast.\nThe food was  not that great... I took Mac and cheese, good but nothing special.\nThe crepe is good, tasty and well cooked with tasty cheese.\nThe sweet crepe was great, huge and filled with ice cream, loved it.\nThe place could be pricey, but totally worth it.
