Was there on Sunday, December 17th with some girlfriends. I had high expectations, but the food was lacking (both in volume and taste). First... when HALF of your menu is unavailable you should notify your guests upon seating them. It wasn't until after our server brought us drinks that she told us that ALL of the tacos were off the menu and that the preztel bites were out and ALL appetizers that had some form of meat had been switched with what was available. Second... as I had to switch my order last minute (I wanted tacos), I settled on the bruschetta. It was eh. Very bread heavy and was barely room temperature when arrived and cold by the time I finished. \n\nOne last thing... It was cold on Sunday (we were there around 7 p.m.) and they had the sliding glass doors open. This made for a VERY uncomfortable dinner... we were ALL freezing.
