This place is great. \nI was was visiting Charlotte for a business purpose while find this place in Yelp. Thought let's  try.  \n\nI ordered Lamb Shank and rice. It was the most delicious shank I have ever tried. \n\n Khalidon was very respectful and friendly person. He served the foods very nicely. \n\nI wish to go again and again.
