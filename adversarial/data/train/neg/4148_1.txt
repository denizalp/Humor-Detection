Overall was truly disappointed by this experience......was there with a large group....and it took over 3 1\/2 hrs to eat and get our check .Apparently our party according to management(Brian) was just too large to handle. \nMy food( the sushi\/sashimi combo) was just OK ....nothing to get excited about. \nI will never come back here .....and would encourage all of you to look for a better place to spend your money.
