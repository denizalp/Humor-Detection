What an amazing show!  I love the Beatles and have been wanting to see this show since I heard about it.  Luckily, a friend was coming in town so I had an excuse to do the touristy thing and see it.  The visual effects were insane.  I wish I still did drugs cause this show would be a trip!  The skating part was pretty rad and the surround sound on the seats was killer.  My friend was in a wheelchair and they were able to move a chair out and give her her own little surround sound speakers.  Pretty neato.  I'd like to see this show again.  There was so much going on that I'm sure it'd be like seeing a whole other show the 2nd time.
