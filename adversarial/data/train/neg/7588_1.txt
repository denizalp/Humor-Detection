Dr. Daccache is by far the best! He's honestly just a funny person he makes you feel at easy. Not to mention his gentle touch with injections, and his assistant Diana was my fave she was super nice, made me feel very comfortable if anything ask for her! And the view of his practice was spectacular I over saw the city before and after my wisdom extraction. Over all my first time removing my wisdom teeth experience was pretty darn awesome. Thanx for everything Doc you're the best hope I was too much of a hassle!
