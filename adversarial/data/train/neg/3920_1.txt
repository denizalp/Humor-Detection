Just moved to Arizona from WA state and have came to this restaurant 4 times and been served drinks. One of the male servers there even remembers our order. Today we came in and were turned down service and told that both of our Washington State IDs are fake. Then we pulled out a second form of ID And she again told us that is was fake. So  we said will you please call then and confirm that they are both valid WA state drivers licenses. And she told us no because she was in part of a meeting. WTF. So we walked out pissed. Very disappointed because we loved this restaurant but we will never be returning after being treated with such disrespect. Some black lady who claimed to be the GM.
