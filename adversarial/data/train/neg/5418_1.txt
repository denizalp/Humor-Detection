I ordered a cheesesteak and cheesesteak fries at 10:44am, and they were delivered at 12:46pm. The cheesesteak was cold and instead of cheesesteak fries, they brought me a side of fries and a Dixie cup of cheese. The receipt on the bag says cheese fries when my receipt from grubhub clearly says cheesesteak fries.\n\nThe one in the Biltmore was my first positive cheese steak experience outside of PA, but this location is a total disappointment.
