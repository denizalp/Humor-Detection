Updating on another fantastic experience.  Had a few old fillings redone by Dr. Leon Banchik yesterday.  I was a bit worried because they were on the larger side, but even after being so incredibly numb my teeth feel great! Thanks again Dr. Banchik\n\n\n\nI can't believe I am just now writing these dentist a review.  I have been a patient since 2013, and go to this location but have also gone to their newly opened office.  Dr. Banchik is the most amazing dentist.  I was so scared coming in but both him and his wife have made me feel like family coming to this office.  The staff remembers me by name and explains everything to me.  Not only is the office beautiful but they spend so much time addressing all my concerns and fears!  If you are looking for a private family who cares more about you than your pocket book, this is the place!
