This is a FANTASTIC bakery. \nI got my wedding cake, cake pops, macaroons, and cannoli's! \n\nThe overall experience was fantastic. From the private tasting, to the design of the cake. Everything was so easy and in the end we got exactly what we wanted.\n\nTheir cake is AMAZING. Strawberry champagne cake will change your life.\nIn addition to great cake, all their pastries are great too! \n\nOverall the guests raved over how beautiful\/delicious our cake was. \nVery reasonably priced compared to a lot of other bakeries in town! \n\nSo, so happy with everything!
