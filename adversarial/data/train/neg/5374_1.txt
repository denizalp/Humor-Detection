I read a review a while back on here and thought the next time I need a clean up I will give them a try. The girl reviewing Mona was right!! She is EXCELLENT!!   The thread she uses is organic & you can't even feel it!  Who would have thought that thread could make a difference.  My brows looked fuller than they ever have!  They are located close to where I live which makes it so convenient. I will definitely be going back to Fabulous Eyebrow to see Mona. I've already told a couple friends! :)
