Cute little ice cream shop. The lady behind the counter was super friendly & we got to meet a lovely couple visiting from Ontario. My little boy took a while to order but there was none of the 'tude you often get when that happens. She was more than happy to let him take his time (there wasn't anyone waiting). His ice cream was good & my caramel sundae was awesome. I want to try a banana split or one of the Nathan's hotdogs next time.
