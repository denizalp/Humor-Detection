When we came there were only 4 gelato flavors which I didn't mind. I got the butter pecan and the tiramisu flavor and they were overly sweet and had a weird consistency. Also got a caramel macchiato with an extra shot of espresso and it was so weak I had to get another shot and I'm not a big coffee drinker.
