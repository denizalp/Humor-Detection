Finally remembered to try this place ! Such a cute little cafe with a variety of choices on the menu . I had the California Eggs Benedict with the hollandaise sauce on the side .. so so so good ! I could eat this entree every morning ! If your in the area you should definitely give it a try . You won't be disappointed !
