Lunch here was great. I loved little touches like the chocolate covered strawberries and the strawberry tarts. They had a delicious carrot soup! Pesto mashed potatoes, yum!\n\nAll in all, Vegas buffets don't do Asian food well.. but the Bellagio was great overall and I'd definitely come back in the future.
