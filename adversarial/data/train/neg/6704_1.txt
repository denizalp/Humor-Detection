I came back for the second time and they changed the menu. For the pick 3 you can only pick the items that are already cooked whereas before you can pick the fish and now you will have to pay more to get it. They said it's because it takes too long for customers to wait. The sides are still good but I wish they offer main entree that are cook in front of you like grill chicken similar to Green Proteins.
