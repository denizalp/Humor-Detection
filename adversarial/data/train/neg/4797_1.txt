We wound up here unexpectedly when we found out the crepe place in the same center is closed on Mondays.  Wanting real table service instead of ordering at the counter at Wildflower, we spied the Cove as we were walking back to our cars.  At 12:30 on a Monday, it was virtually empty.  \n\nThe menu looked good enough with plenty to choose from.  Both my friend and I wanted salads.  She ordered the calamari and I chose the Asian Chicken.  Her calamari was slathered with breading, and my chicken was dry to the bone.  We both agreed that we should have gone to Wildflower where the salads are always reliably fresh and tasty.\n\nOur server was actually very nice and gracious. But for me, it's a combination of food, ambiance and service that make a restaurant rate above a 2-star, and the food and ambiance at the Cove didn't cut it for me.
