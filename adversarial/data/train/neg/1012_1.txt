So this was one of the cleanest Subways I've ever been to. Cleanliness means a lot to me when I'm eating and sleeping, and this place surpassed the mark. There was a decent line when we walked in. However, the service was quick (we were on our way to a Pens game) and friendly for the most part. The woman who rang up our orders was not the friendliest, but you find this almost everywhere. When I need a quick, fresh meal before a game, I'll be sure to return to this Subway.
