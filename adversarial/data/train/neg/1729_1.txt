DO NOT EAT HERE!   They have the WORST food!  Absolutely disgusting!  The quality is worse than the nastiest of dive bar food!!!  The only reason I have ordered from here more than once is because it is close to the office and the office orders for meetings and delivery is cheap.  I've tried a grilled salmon salad and the salmon was so over cooked it was as tough as beef jerky and seemed like it was reheated from the day before.   I ordered a chicken salad sandwich one time and it is supposed to come with pickles, but it had no pickles so the next time I ordered it I added in the comment section, \"Please do not forget the pickles\" and they charged me .75 cents for the pickles that it is supposed to come with.  The chicken in the chicken salad is cubed processed meat and I got horribly sick after eating it.  I refused to eat here ever again!!!!  The OWNER IS THE RUDEST PERSON I have ever come encounter with! The employees have commented how RUDE the owner is. The only reason this place is still in business is because they deliver to the surrounding businesses.
