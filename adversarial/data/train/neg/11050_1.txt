I also gotta add that John came out late that night and mentioned he had an appointment with another customer at 6 the next morning. He sacrificed his time with his family and his sanity (we all need sleep after a long day) to make sure we were taken care of. He was concerned that we wouldn't have a working A\/C for that night and just got it done.\n\nAlso, I'm not a veteran, but like him I respect them. He mentioned that on Memorial Day he offered discounted services to veterans. John and everyone at Arizona's Dukes of Air are simply amazing.
