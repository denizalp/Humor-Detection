Iced options barely exist here. I ordered a chai, got a non dairy milk, and after about ten minutes it came out to me. It was watered down almond milk. Luckily their prices are reasonable but I will not be returning. My boyfriend got the sweet mango green tea. It was not sweet, and it was also watery. They should refuse to serve iced teas then if they are melted ice. I had been waiting to try this place for months, but now i regret my desire.
