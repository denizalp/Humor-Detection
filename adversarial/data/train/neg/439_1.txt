My fiance and I decided to try this restaurant out during the food fights foodie week. We arrived about 20 minutes to early before they started doing the foodie menu. The manager was so nice and let us get the menu anyways when we said we came for foodie week. They had a 3-course menu for $15.00 that include one appetizer, an entree and a dessert. \n\nTo start I  ordered the strawberry margarita and wow was it good. The tequila was strong enough where it enhanced the flavor but did not overtake it. \n\nFor appetizers we got the Mexican Street Corn and Escabeche. The Escabeche was a pickled vegetable dish and it was very good. The winner was definitely the corn though. It was rich and creamy with the perfect hint of spicy. \n\nFor entree I decided on the Enchiladas. They were stuffed with chicken and smothered in a Verde sauce with a side of loaded Mexican rice. The Verde sauce was so good and the chicken inside was very moist. Overall it was an excellent dish. \n\nLastly was dessert. There were two option Caramel Flan and the Chocolate Taco. We each ordered one so we could try both. The Chocolate Taco is very creative and fun but the Flan was so rich an delicious. \n\nI am giving this restaurant 5 stars not just because the food was excellent but also so service was as well. At one point my fiance asked for extra hot sauce and the manager went to the back and whipped up a custom salsa. You cannot beat that service! We will absolutely be back.
