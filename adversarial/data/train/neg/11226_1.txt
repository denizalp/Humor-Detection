This has been my GO-TO station since I moved back to the Phoenix area. Always been satisfied with prices, service, and cleanliness of the station. Always felt safe when I've been filling my car.  Well, NOT anymore.  \n\nA couple weeks ago I was hit up by a guy wanting $$ for gas. \"Can you spare some money? I don't have enough and I need gas.\"  So . . . I just thought it was a guy down on his luck. Not the usual sort I meet when I am pumping gas. But, hey, OK, I get it. But that little nagging last line \"thanks Ma'am\" made me wonder. But I brushed it aside. It was the middle of the day and, yes, I was definitely older and I could spare a dollar or two.\n\nWell, then yesterday I stopped for a fill-up again. Yep, you guessed it! Another guy . . . not the same one asked for gas money so he could get home. Well now, twice in broad daylight in a short period of time appears to me to be the beginnings of a pattern. A rather uncomfortable one. This is Tempe, not downtown Chicago, or San Francisco. \n\nBoth were guys in their 20s. Neither looked homeless, but neither were in tuxedos either. I want to feel safe where I get gas, or shop, or dine. There are lots of choices. And so, even though this station was convenient . . . I shall take my business elsewhere.\n\nAlways be aware of your surroundings and be cautious. Most folks out there mean no harm; but there are occasionally the ones that do.
