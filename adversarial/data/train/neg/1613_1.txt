So far so good. The busses are always on time.  This is something that should automatically gain any trans portion place a good rating.  They also offer more direct routes to places like Toronto,  I have only taken the Mega bus to and from Toronto but I have no complaints.  When I return home from Toronto to Pittsburgh I am usually early.  I did have a conversation with one of the drivers though who stated that Megabus requires their drivers to drive 5 hours straight with no break and that they don't get paid overtime.\" I wish I had had some words of comfort for her.  For a passenger riding megabus is a picnic, but for a driver it may be a nightmare.
