Great experience here! Just got a fabulous haircut at Maya's. \nI've been traumatized since my last haircut (last year) from Chang Dynasty (I cried), so I've been very iffy about every single hair salon. I'm glad I tried out Maya after contemplating for MONTHS. I definitely recommend this place!!\nI forgot to ask my hair dresser for her name, but if I recall correctly, she has a stylish, short, brown hairdo. She might also even be Japanese. As well, she speaks perfect English.\nThanks Maya Hair Salon!
