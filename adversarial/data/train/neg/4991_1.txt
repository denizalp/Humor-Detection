I've been getting food here for 12+ years, and I've rarely been disappointed. Maybe once or twice in what must be several hundred meals. Inexpensive and generous portions, Great Wall is actually great. They have some of the best takeaway General Tso tofu I've ever had, with only a couple of exceptions. \n\nIf only they delivered!
