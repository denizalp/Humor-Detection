Best haircut and color of my life. Love this place. The students are so welcoming, polite and courteous. The teachers are amazing, they strive to make clients as happy as possible.  I came here after being frustrated with either sub par work from other stylists or the ridiculous prices some salons charge. I'm not ok with $60 for haircut and $200-300 for color. \n\nThe scalp massage is amazing and I love how honest they are with you. If you ask for something that cannot be done, they tell you the reasons why it will not be possible, unlike other salons that will say yes we can do it and you come out looking like rainbow bright.  I would recommend asking for a phase 2 student as opposed to a phase 1 student, phase 1 students seem to be very lost and nervous about what they are doing.
