Came here on a Saturday. Service was decent but not very good at handling our complaints. We ordered two entrees, 1 turkey dinner and 1 beef brisket dinner. The turkey came out mildly warm with a pretty decent amount of meat. The brisket however, came with fairly cold, and with the meat amount for a 5 year old. I do not enjoy paying $13.99 for 5, 5-inch prices of brisket. When this was brought up to our waitress, she just said, \"Well you ordered the dinner, that's what you get.\" Not very helpful at all. I will never return to this location again. Way over priced for sub-par food.
