I had been waiting for this place to open.  So I'm trying to watch my figure these days, but I still wanted to try a something.  So today was Monday.  They had ground beef taco's for $1.00 Perfect!  I was going to just get 1 but I decided to get 2.  So while I was waiting for my order, I went over to the salsa bar.  I don't care for the carrots they have, they seem to be soggy, or not raw and marinated.  I like mine raw and marinated.  The Jalapeno's were ok, but......after I put that hot salsa on my taco, (Yes I choose the hot one) Jalapeno's weren't needed!  These taco's were so good!  The meat was seasoned to perfection.  I pushed the other 2 sauces to the side!  But let me tell ya'll!  My mouth was burning for the next 20 min.  It was hot while I was eating it, but once I was done, it seemed like it was getting hotter! and hotter!  I was whistling inward to try and cool off my mouth!  I was drinking ice cold water to try and cool down my mouth!  Even though it was that hot, it was really good!  I would choose that sauce again.
