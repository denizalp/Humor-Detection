I can't speak for the actual physical therapist because I have only dealt with them professionally for credentialing. The credentialing staff in provider enrollment that they have are very immature and unprofessional. They would always call with an attitude for information, and if they didn't like the answer they would hang up. Then, call back and if they got the same person they would just keep hanging up on them. They would make insults calling our Staff stupid, worhtless etc. I mean every time they would call no matter how professional and composed we stayed and whether they got the information they were needing or not it was like they had nothing better to do then act like children prank calling our dept. it was unbelievable. This happened at least twice a month the whole 2 yrs I worked there so it wasn't just a bad day\/week for them it was constant.
