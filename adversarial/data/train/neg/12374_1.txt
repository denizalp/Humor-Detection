The food here is usually fantastic.  The portions are huge and the wait staff is friendly.  You can plan to be waiting a good long while for your food but most the time it's worth it.  I had the special which was an asparagus and goat cheese omelette that was very good but my bagel was burnt, and I was surprised she even served it to me. Today was a mess, but I would definitely come again.
