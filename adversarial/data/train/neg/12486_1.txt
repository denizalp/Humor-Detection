I spent this past weekend in Cleveland with some friends, and we booked a couple rooms at the Aloft downtown. It's a pretty neat and stylish boutique hotel for a good price. It's located just beyond West 9th and is only a few blocks from West 6th as well as the stadium.\n\nThe hotel itself had a cool, modern flair to it and a nice bar that was open until last call. There was a DJ pumping out your favorite radio pop tunes. I'm not sure what his name was, but we'll call him DJ Spotify, which even though the music was a little blah, was doing his best to get a party going on the first floor. It was a good way to grab a quick drink before heading out and a good way to end the night.\n\nThe rooms themselves were pretty nice but nothing special. They were pretty plain for a boutique hotel, but they had an awesome view of the lake, and the great mudpile, which is currently construction in the Flats. \n\nGive Cleveland a few years, and I'm willing to bet the Aloft will be right in the center of a new, hip neighborhood. As it is right now, I'd definitely stay there again on pricing and convenience alone.
