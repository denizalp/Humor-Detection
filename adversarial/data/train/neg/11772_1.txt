Wide variety to seke,the from, experienced staff to assist, especially Mike. Also friendly kind staff such as Auburn and young med student from Hawaii, exceptional people skills. Then there is the nice manager  is a very kind man, genuinly helpful and attentive. \nThe only drawback is the staff in the Contractor or Vendor side of the store, the women that work there are impolite, harsh, impatient, and flat out just antagonistic.*check out the sign on the desk, it puts everything in perspective.  The sign on the desk in the office reads as follows \"MY FACE HURTS FROM PRETENDING TO LIKE YOU\" \nThe manager was quick to defend the offensive sign and  by saying that the impolite employees in wholesale area have a lot of stress from having to deal with contractors.\n\nSo there you have it folks, manager defends and supports the hostile behavior, nice store with extensive selection, but you are hereby for warned about the staff in the wholesale section.\n\n\nHappy shopping.
