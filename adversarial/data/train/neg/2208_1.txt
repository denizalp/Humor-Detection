We did the Mad Hatter room and were underwhelmed. There wasn't much in the way of surprises and the room was pretty much just figuring out the numbers to unlock a ton padlocks, which with 10 people wasn't very fun since only 1 person can unlock a lock. There was only one puzzle to figure out at a time so most people just sat there and watched others figure out the puzzles. You had to figure out a puzzle to get the numbers for the lock that would give you clues for the next lock. There was no multitasking puzzles. I've done 4 other escape the rooms (not this location) and this particular room was not my favorite. The staff was amazing and super friendly. We got the room through Groupon so the price was worth it. I would be ok going back since they have a bunch of different rooms but I would not do the Mad Hatter room again. At the end they offered a \"replay\" where we could pay another room right away for $20 a person which was nice but we didn't end up staying.
