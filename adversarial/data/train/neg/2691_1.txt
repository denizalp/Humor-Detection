Decent portions for the price, and deliciously sweet and tangy sauce! Most of the reviews on here indicate the sauce is very polarizing, but I found it delicious. The pulled pork sandwich was not bad, but when I added the sauce, I thought that the sandwich became excellent. Slightly spicy, smoky, sweet, tangy-- a little bit of everything! Very pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe ribs were pretty solid as well. Not \"fall off the bone\" by any means-- I don't think they necessarily stand up to most places in Memphis, St. Louis, KC, or Phil's out in San Diego, but for Madison-- they are the best I've found. Good for a barbecue fix for sure.\n\nAs for the sides, as many have noted, the portions are laughably tiny. I think I got 1\/2 cup of baked beans as my side. They tasted really good, but were gone in four bites. The hot sugar biscuits are great. Little funnel cakes is essentially what they are. \n\nOverall, for Madison, I was really pleased. Tasty pulled pork and ribs, excellent sauce, divey BBQ ambience, and reasonable prices. I'll be back when my next BBQ craving hits.
