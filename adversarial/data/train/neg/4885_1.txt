Surprised this joint has low reviews, maybe this is due to the fact that they just opened.  I liked everything about it.  The service was excellent, the food decent, the craft beer selection was great, best of all I liked the atmosphere.  We went with the French Fry Burger and the Good Egg Burger.   Two sides - mac n cheese and onion rings.  Good stuff, we liked it and had a great time.
