My husband called on my behalf but we had the phone on speaker so I heard the entire conversation. We inquired his services to notarize a dental related document -this is an important detail. \nHe charges $40 for travel and $5 per signature. We asked if we could go to his location to omit the travel charges but he said he has no office. \nThe reason for the one star is when my husband said thank you I'll shop around he said \"I guess you can use your teeth on it!\" must be some kind of dental joke. \n‚ÄçI don't know haha! \nI'm sure his services are great for busy people that need him to come to them but I didn't think the last comment was necessary.
