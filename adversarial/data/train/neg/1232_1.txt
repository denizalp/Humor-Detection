Great little pizza place in 7th Street market. I visited with my son after going to Imaginon across the street. I ordered the lunch special of a personal pepperoni pizza and drink for $8, I also checked in on Yelp and received a free order of their garlic knots.  The pizza took a little bit to come out (they are very busy during the lunch hour), but it was worth the wait.  The staff was friendly and helpful. Pizza was delicious. Definitely a new go-to for lunch when I'm in the area.
