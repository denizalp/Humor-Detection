Being a simple man from southern New Jersey, I had never been to the Big Apple. Much to my delight I found Tom's Urban connected to the New York New York Casino. After 37 mimosas and some scrumptious to taster strudels, my belly had fallen in love with our gorgeous waitress Maggie. I long for her. She is the ying to my yang. The macaroni to my cheese. I highly recommend the tuna sandwich.
