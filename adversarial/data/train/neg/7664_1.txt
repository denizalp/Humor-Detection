I have been to this restaurant on 3 different occasions with my bday 9\/23 being the most recent and I must say every time I've had nothing but top notch service and meals. My guest who accompanied me was even delighted by the different entrees and how flavorful everything was. The dishes were fresh and tasted just as I imagined. I usually eat Indian food once a week in Decatur, GA. Now this is my new home away from home. Its in the casino but once you walk in you forget about the outside setting. The lighting is just right for an intimate or family setting. The beverages were very crisp. They aim to please. I've had no complaints not once. I HIGHLY recommend this place. Top 4 on my list of favorites in Vegas. Love the Chicken Tikka Masala, samosa, the roasted wings, the prawns and Kabobs. Those are just my repeats.
