I came here with a few coworkers for lunch, and was very impressed.\nWe were seated on the second floor which was spacious and had an amazing atmosphere.\n\nThe dining space reminded me of a combination old west and a medieval festival in Europe. You can see old horse carriage wheels hung on the walls, some wooden barrels, and a knight armor in the corner. Pretty cool! \n\nFor lunch, I had a parmesan chicken salad sandwich which used a French croissant instead of bread. It was amazing and very fresh. Also their French fries were delicious with very crispy batter! \n\nI can wait to be back here on a Friday or Saturday night, I heard the first floor is a pub-type bar, and the second floor turns into a club with live DJ. \n\nI will keep you posted!
