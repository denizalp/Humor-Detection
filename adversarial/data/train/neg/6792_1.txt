Stephanie was great! The body warp was an excellent experience! It does very much work and helped me a lot! The body wrap sessions are 50 min long, Stephanie applied diffused oil topically to any area of concern for pain and discomfort. The oils and the heat work very well! The result was awesome! I highly recommend seeing Stephanie! I play tennis a lot it was very helpful to me.
