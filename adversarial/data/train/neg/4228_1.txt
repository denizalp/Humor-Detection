It was a nice restaurant. The food was good, but compared to their sister store Globe, it falls short. My boyfriend and I came here during Valentine's Day, and I understand how busy they would be on that day, but there really was no privacy in the restaurant. All the tables and chairs were really close together, and just getting up to go to the ladies restroom was hard having to squeeze between tables\/chairs. It was a little hard to enjoy the food when all I could hear were the conversations from the tables next to us. The service was ok, taking to account how busy they were. When I have the chance I'd love to go back and try it and hopefully I'll give it a 5 star!
