This place left me feeling nauseous for hours afterwards. I hadn't been here in well over a year and was craving Mexican food so I decided to give this place another try. The salsa was horrible and chips tasted cheap. Nope, still not good. The beans, rice and shredded beef tacos were so gross I literally forced myself to eat one taco then got up and left. Absolutely disgusting food I'm at a complete mind boggle wondering how this place got good reviews. Worst Mexican place in the east valley in my opinion. Very bland, bad tasting food. Yuck!
