Hatters was that bar you went to when you were 16 with a shitty fake ID. Although they're far more stringent on carding now, the crowd is mostly younger except for the regulars and out of towners. I'm still a regular because I pass by to visit the staff for lunch or on \"off\" nights. Today for example, $8 lunch special for in-house cream of mushroom soup (holy crap it was good) and a steak burger with salad & fries. They also made an epically delicious pulled pork sandwich last time I came for lunch.  All in all, it's definitely a bar for the younger crowd, but a great place to grab lunch or stop by on a dead night
