Loved this place!! Great service and great vegan food! We had the crown and Cesar cocktails, followed by quinoa onion rings, green poutine and mushroom burger!\nBoth cocktails were different but nothing great but just some good cocktails! Green poutine was a good portion size and it came with veggies on the top (as the name suggests). Mushroom burger was good too but the best thing was quinoa onion rings. Also if you like hot\/spicy their hot sauce is great. Our food was little bland (for my taste) but the hot sauce improved the taste!\nOverall I will give 5 star due to the quick service and good food! Will try the bowls during next visit
