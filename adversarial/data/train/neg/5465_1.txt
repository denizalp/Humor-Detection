Just had to give a shout out to our favorite restaurant in Summit county. We've never had a bad meal in the many years we've eaten here. Husbands favorites are the ya-ya soup, shrimp etouffe, and eggplant parmesan with their homemade bolganese sauce. I love the Navejo tacos with seafood, any of the catches of the day, and their bread pudding. Everything is always fresh and homemade. No prepackaged, frozen  junk ever.
