Nice ambiance, great fresh quality sushi. We ordered the snow crab california rolls, eel roll, and spicy crunchy tuna (dont remember their fancy names at the moment), ribeye  skewers, and jasmine rice. Our waiter was nice and had good recomendations. Our tab was about $100 for lunch but amazing sushi. Would def recomend and wish they had one in my area. Pictures were posted earlier this week ;)
