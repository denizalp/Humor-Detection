Juan's flaming fajitas is a must when I'm in Las Vegas! Honest to God my absolute favorite Mexican place in this planet! The first time my boyfriend and I went to Las Vegas I checked out their reviews and had to try them out. Ever since then we have made it a point to always stop there anytime we are in Nevada. Their service is excellent, everyone is so friendly and you get greeted at the door! Food is top notch, authentic Mexican! I've had their breakfast and dinner, even their fried ice cream is a must. It sounds funny but even their chips and dip, their soups and bean dip which were all complimentary when we went were amazing. I have nothing bad to say about this place other than I wish it were closer to Boston! Keep up the great work at Juans!
