As Firkins go his one stands out in decor and servers.  Much more upbeat and lots of natural light.  We ordered some menu classics..he Firkin Burger which was a success and the bangers and mash or the Brats and mash here.  The Brats came out like warm which was disappointing .  Beans were dried out and it was like the food had been sitting around a little too long.  Local place is a great add though,hoping over time the food service just gets better
