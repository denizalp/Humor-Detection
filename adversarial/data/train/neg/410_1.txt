I've been living here for 4 years. Can't beat the mid Scottsdale location. Easy access to the beautiful green belt. Walking distance to beautiful lakes. Feels very safe, relatively little crime. The neighbors are friendly. Maintenance is awesome and responsive. Francisco is an awesome member of the maintenance team. Overall I would definitely recommend living here.
