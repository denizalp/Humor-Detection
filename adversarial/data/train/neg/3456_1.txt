Yow, this place is good.  Like many who have posted here, I am a connoisseur.  When ordering ribs I always hedge my bet with some brisket, or something, in case the ribs aren't \"fall-off-the-bone\" (which is the only way I like them).  Here, I did that, but it surely wasn't necessary.  Ribs were great, and my \"hedge\" - a brisket sandwich that came in a combo with a 1\/3 slab of ribs - was awesome, too.  2 small suggestions I would make for Jon would be: (1) have @ least 2 (maybe 3) varieties of sauce, on the \"tanginess\" scale; and (2) serve everything with pickles - nothing goes wit bbq better than a little pickle either with, or between, bites!
