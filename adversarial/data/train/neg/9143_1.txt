This place does the most beautifully plated street\n food ever! We have been here twice and were just blown away by the food! We are kinda spoiled having El Senior so close by, so I was skeptical about El Taco Macho. \nUnlike some Yelpers, we have not experienced any trouble getting drinks. They do flavored Margaritas specials and they are big and yummy. \nBoth the food and service here are top notch. Complimentary warm tortilla chips with salsa & pickled veggies are all you can eat! We've had tacos,burritos, quesadillas, guacamole, fajitas and every single dish is authentic and beautiful and delish! And, they make their tortillas from scratch!!\nDo not be fooled by the fact that it is in a strip mall! The decor is really kinda cool and upscale and the booths are wide enough for at least 3 people on each side. We are really happy to have this little gem.
