Wow, I mean it's the best bar on mill by a long shot..  Always a party and definitely brings in the hottest ASU crowd.  Bouncers at the door are always super nice.  There is usually a line when I go but it moves super fast. Now that the nice weather is here I will definitely be putting in some facetime on there outdoor patio.  Especially if they put that gorgeous Kryzlin on that outside bar.  Thanks El Hefe for bringing the fun.
