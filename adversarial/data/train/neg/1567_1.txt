An amazing show on every level possible!!  The lady love and I watched the show for New Years and we sat on the upper level which was neat to be able to watch the performers fly in from the sides of the sky.  \n\nThe audio in that space was superb, really just music coming at you from every direction.  The choreo was so fun and on point to the music.  From bunji jumping, to break dancing, roller blading to traditional lyrical...it's has it all.  I would watch the show again...only exception is if Michael Jackson's Cirque comes around sooner than later....cuz you know it's all about MJ.\n\nA must see, even if you don't go out drinking and partying for one night, this experience will be kept in your memory bank for some time to come...
