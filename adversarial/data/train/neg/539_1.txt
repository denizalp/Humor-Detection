The ambience is fun and the look is colorful and appealing.\n\nI bought the boutique Voir card and am now a regular.\n\nSome of the scones are fantastic; Apricot Cream cheese, Raisin Pecan, yum! Some of their danishes are great too but I find there berry-themed bakery is lacklustre. \n\nI've tried the tea service as well and while bonafide it's not my cup of tea; I'm more of a traditionalist.\n\nThe big failing is not having a washroom.
