The best Ethiopian FOOD in NC!!!!!!! \n\nMy God I truly am addicted to this place thank God the price is very reasonable. I recommend everything but my #1 is Derek Tips (Dry beef Tibs) with Gomen and Aybe (cabbage and home made cottage cheese). Warning  this is super addictive but like I said the price complements my budget.
