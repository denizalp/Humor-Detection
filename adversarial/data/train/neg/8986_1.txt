My absolute favorite Thai in Las Vegas.  \n\nThe Pad Thai at Archi's is excellent.  It almost has a buttery quality to it.  This is one of the spots I always take friends or out of towners and they are always pleasantly surprised.  \n\nYou will be happy at any of the three Archi's locations.  The Ft. Apache and South Rainbow locations are newer and nicely decorated.  The original spot on Jones and Flamingo is tiny and old but tasty as ever.  \n\nLunch specials are great.  I usually teeter between my favorites, the spicy basil beef, and the pad thai.  Other delicious items on the menu: papaya salad, spicy eggplant, mango with sicky rice, thai iced coffee.\n\nThey offer brown rice - always a nice option.  \n\nPrices are right, food is delicious.  Archi's is a 5 star Thai experience.
