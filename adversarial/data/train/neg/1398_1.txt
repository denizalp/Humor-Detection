I went to allure today for a gel mani and got a manicurist named Vy! She was excellent! She paid great attention to shape & cuticles! Perfect, even application where no flaws showed even with a light color that I chose! Very nice and attentive. Will definitely be back. Prices were excellent for such a great experience. 25 for gel + 5 for mani. Very happy!
