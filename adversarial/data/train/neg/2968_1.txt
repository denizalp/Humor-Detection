I just moved myself from a 3-story house to my house, mostly by myself, but with the help of Skinny Wimp Moving Company out of Tempe, Arizona.  They were fantastic.  Connor coordinated it, and Eric and Noel executed it like 2 well-oiled machines (but really great guys).  I'd recommend them in a heartbeat.  110 percent satisfied with their professionalism, rates, and top notch, knowledgeable men who know what they're doing.  They were prepared to wrap, box, carted everything up a flight of stairs, unloaded everything at my new home to my satisfaction, and cleaned up as they went along.  As far as moving (which I've now done 21 times in my life), it was a Great Experience.  #bringon22 #nothingcanholdmeback #HEsgotmyback
