Best meal EVER!\n\nMade reservations two days before -\nWe are super laid back so happily offered to take a ten pm time at the bar (we prefer bar).  When we arrived they said we could have a table if we wanted, so definitely later at night there's lots of walk in room. \n\nWe had two chalkboard specials and two menu items - torched foie gras (5\/5), lamb tartare with no cilantro (5\/5), asparagus (4\/5) and lobster spaghetti (5\/5).  We each had two glasses of wine recommended by the server, and I appreciated although he selected them they were $13\/glass, very reasonable. We still chose to sit at the bar and had a great time.  The food was the right amount, which the server had also helped us with by letting us know when I asked at initial ordering that we need not order more.\nDefinitely a must go!
