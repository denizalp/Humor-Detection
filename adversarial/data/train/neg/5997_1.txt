You pay exorbitant fees here for the convenience of their frequent airport shuttles. This would be fine if you didn't have to take the rude behavior of the people running the shuttles with it. The bus drivers I have encountered have all been fine, but the process to get people onto shuttles is confused and uncoordinated at best. After being sent down to the far end of the line, they cut off boarding for that shuttle right in front of me. When she sent me back down the platform where I had come from, lugging all my baggage, I asked, \"For sure this time?\" And she responded with \"you can always take a cab\". If I was going to take a cab, I would save a bunch of money by not using this location. She then yelled at me for cutting people off in line, even though as the first one denied boarding on the earlier shuttle, I should by all rights have been first on the next one.
