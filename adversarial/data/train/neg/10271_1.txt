I can't say enough nice things about this restaurant! We sat outside under the string lights on a perfect night in Phoenix and it was an incredible experience. The service was attentive, polite, and quick, which truly made a huge difference. The food was great as well and came out in a timely manner. They have extensive alcohol options as well with wine, beer, and cocktails. Centrally located and easy to find! Highly recommend!
