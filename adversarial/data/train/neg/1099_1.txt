I'll just pile on and say this place rocks. Beautiful space, super-knowledgeable and friendly librarians, big honkin' selection of good books, old and new. Plenty of places to sit and read, and you can even carry your coffee around to the various rooms on the first floor. It's just a top-notch library.\n\nI especially enjoy taking advantage of their non-circulating titles -- the ones you have to read in the library, or sometimes right in the room from whence they came. There's something truly ceremonious about sitting down and reading in this glorious branch, and you will feel most welcome.
