Finally decided to try this place out since I had a wicked craving for some jar doo wings.  Figured that maybe this place is pretty good since it's been around for so long.  How do I know they've been around forever?  Well, the phone number on their sign doesn't have the area code.  Then I walked in and that was another confirmation.  Felt like I walked in there through a time machine, but not necessarily in a bad way. Anywho, I just ordered for take-out and ordered some jar doo wings and one of their specials (E) which which was an OCD's nightmare as the sauces were all on top of the dishes.  Yes, I'm one of those \"weirdos\" that don't like their food getting all mixed up.  \n\nJar Doo Wings - Was a little disappointed as I've gotten so used to jar too wings that have been marinated in more soya sauce.  The wings looked like regular wings that was quite bland.  The only burst of flavour was from the drizzled lemon from the lemon wedge.  Maybe I was given the wrong order?  Who knows.  Either way, it still could've been much better.  3\/5.\n\nChicken Fried Rice - Was your typical chicken fried rice.  What I liked about it was that the chunks of chicken was pretty generous.  Flavour was alright so I'd probably order it again. 4\/5.\n\nChicken Balls - I know chicken balls aren't exactly a \"staple\" Chinese dish but I love this shit.  And to be quite honest, these were one of the best ones I've had simply because the ratio of chicken to batter was great.  For once, I had more chicken than dough.  Only con is that the chicken was a little on the dry side.  Now, if they had actually served the sweet and sour sauce on the side, then that would've been much better.  Also the sauce lacked a lot of flavour.  4\/5.\n\nSweet & Sour Sparerib - The sauce was nice but other than that, it was also quite bland.  Was a little too overcooked to my liking so it was a little tough to chew on.  2.5\/5.
