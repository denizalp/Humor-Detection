I love coming to Madhouse for little coffee dates or before school went I attended high school in the area. The drinks and atmosphere deserve 5 stars, but the older man behind the counter in the back room that just sits there and lets the girls in front do everything is very rude and unprofessional, hence the reason for one star lost. The other members of their staff are always friendly and easy to chat with!
