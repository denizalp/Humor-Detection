Awful experiences at this place. Staff is rude and doctors are impersonal. These practitioners seem to want a lot of pointless follow up appointments. Wait times at this office are unpredictable and they now require a debit card linked to your account so if your insurance denies coverage over something they can automatically charge you. The only good thing about this facility is they have the capability to do certain labs and testing on site which saves you a visit somewhere else.
