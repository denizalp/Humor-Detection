Stayed here for a convention. The check in service is quick, however, the front desk clerk certainly did not go out of her way to acknowledge our difficulties with their room reservation service. Experienced a minor issue with their reservation and billing system that we brought to their attention. You would think, they would discover the problem before the customer?\nEven though we requested a room on a higher floor (as we are from a small prairie town), she placed us on the sixth floor. What about the other 20+ floors?\nThe room is clean but nothing special. Room service and cleaning is excellent.\nThere are over 11,000 hotel rooms in downtown T.O. - You certainly can do better for service at the same price than the Hilton Toronto.
