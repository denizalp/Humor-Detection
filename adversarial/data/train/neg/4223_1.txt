My grandparents and I had a nice evening here. We lucked out and got to see a wonderful pianist and guitarist sing and perform! Apparently they do that every Friday night from 7:30-9:30pm. It truly made the night for us. The food was a little slow to come out and it took a while for us to get our check, but staff were still friendly. All of our food was authentic and delicious! I will say I think the tables are a little close together because before the musicians came, I could hear all the conversations around us way too easily. Would recommend this place on a Friday night for sure though!
