This place was alright, definitely a bar restaurant though. I had a burger and tater tots. It was good but nothing to write home about. The burger is fairly priced considering it includes toppings. Really it seems like a boxed angus burger from Harris Teeter, not the cheap kind but certainly not what I expected from a place referred to as the place to go for a burger. The service was great, the only time a waitress wasn't stopping by was the odd time after I was asked twice if I was ready and before I was ready, but it could have been just because I was hungry. I would go here again, especially for a quick bite but not because I wanted a great burger. A burger built well with good toppings for a fair price is what I found.
