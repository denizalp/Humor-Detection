My husband forgot to get his dry cleaning done before Thanksgiving and then I forgot to get it out early the day before.   I called Norge and she accepted the items a little later in the day and had them done by 5!  She remembered who I was when I came back and had it all ready.  I truly appreciate the customer service and the clothes look great.
