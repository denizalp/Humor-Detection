Just randomly discovered this place one night after parking on the street. \n\nHave a ton of great flavors which all seem to be great. Had Cookie Monster which was amazing. I mean how can you go wrong with cookie dough and Oreo!\n\nAlso they serve ice cream in Chinese takeout boxes with a fortune cookie. \n\nOrdered a small (one scoop) which was the perfect size because of how rich the ice cream was.
