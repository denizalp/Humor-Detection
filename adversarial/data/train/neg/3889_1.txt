Unfortunately, my favorite aesthetician, Caroline, left to move on to bigger and better things. I saw a few different people for brow waxes in the past few months, finally returning to Par Exsalonce to see Deanna this week. I absolutely loved her! I am trying to grow my brows into a new fuller shape, and she completely listened to my concerns. I left with beautifully groomed brows not too thin, not too thick. She paid very close attention to detail and I couldn't be more pleased. I couldn't recommend her more! I will be seeing her from now on.\nI also love Par Exsalonce's online booking feature that allows me to see my last appointment date and book the same service with one click.
