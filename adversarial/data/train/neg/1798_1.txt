This is a great hotel to enjoy Las Vegas in. The pools aren't as fun as Caesar's, but then no one's are, and I originally found it distressing there was no pool bar at the suites' tower's pool, until I realized this meant I could BYO. The rooms are plush and fancified, the staff is polite, and they have a Bouchon, which means I have to love them (even if Bouchon's oatmeal has lost its \"best in the world\" stars from me).
