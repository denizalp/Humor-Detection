Had the French Dip with mashed potatoes. My girlfriend had the McAllister's Club with chicken tortilla soup. \n\nFrench dip was pretty good but the potatoes and gravy was so so. The potatoes tasted like instant and the gravy was more of a southern style poultry gravy that used too my flour. \n\nMy girlfriend enjoyed her sandwich but picked at the soup. It had a pile of green onion on top and she's not a fan. \n\nThe restaurant was clean. Food came in a reasonable time. Staff was reasonably friendly.
