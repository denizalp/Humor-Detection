Be prepared to wait an hour after your appointment time before you get in. They will tell you the reason they are running so far behind is because so many other patients before you get there late, pushing everyone back. So why don't you make that person wait, not the person that gets there 20 minutes before their scheduled appt time?? By the way this happened on several occasions not just once, so they are always running behind. Also, everyone in the waiting room was complaining about waiting so long. \n\nAlso, had an appointment scheduled on March 9th 2016 for my daughter for the allergist, scheduled weeks in advance for 8:15am. On March 9th at 7:35am I received a call from Valley ENT telling me there were no doctors in the office today and wanted to reschedule my appointment! \n\nI bet if I cancelled 40 minutes before my appointment I'd be charged a cancellation fee! How about letting me know before I take time off work and get the kids up early, how about some common courtesy for your patients! \n\nOffice staff is rude as well. We continued going here because we liked Dr. Richardson, but this is the final straw. We will go somewhere else from now on and I suggest you do the same.
