I took my cat here on a Sunday morning because she clearly was doing poorly and I didn't want to wait until Monday. We barely had to wait before they took her back to evaluate her and give her oxygen. I only waited a few minutes before the vet came out to tell me what I already knew: that I could choose to do tests and treatments, or that I could choose to say goodbye. I chose the latter. They could not have been more kind or sensitive. They gave me all the time I needed to say goodbye. They even gave me a little ceramic thing with her pawprint and name. They took care of my pet and of me and I am very grateful. \n\nThe facility itself is large and clean. The staff, like I said, are kind and considerate. I was there for a sad thing but I think they do their work extraordinarily well.
