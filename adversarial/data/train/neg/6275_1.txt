I had a bad experience at a dentist claiming to be \"gentle\" a few years again and I was apprehensive about going back to a dentist. I called the office to make an appointment and was immediately surprised at how friendly and humorous the receptionist, April, was . I made an appointment for the very next day, a Saturday no less which blew my mind. My previous dentist's hours required me to go in at 7am on work-days to get anything done.\n\nI showed up for my appointment the next day. The office is extremely professional in appearance. April knew who I was when I walked in without ever having never seen me before which really impressed me. I was done with my new patient forms and in a dentists chair in no time. I met with Dr. Liu and I think he is very sharp and friendly. Unlike other dentists I've been to this was a very friendly and personal interaction. \n\nThe hygienist Alicia was just as friendly and easy to talk to as Dr. Liu. She cleaned my teeth and shockingly it wasn't uncomfortable at all even though I've missed a few cleanings.\n\nI am legitimately excited to have such a wonderful dentists office to go to and will be recommending this practice to all of my friends and to any Yelper reading this review.
