Cute little restaurant with a large menu. Standard pricing on sushi rolls, lots of different premium rolls as well. Being only myself I had one roll (fried spicy tuna) and it tasted good and was larger than expected, which was great for me. Their Udon was good as well. I tried their deep fried bacon (spicy bacon tempura) because of all the Yelp hype and I didn't like it. I'm more of a crispy bacon instead of chewy bacon surrounded by crispy. The maple soy reduction was definitely an unique touch though. It's worth checking out!
