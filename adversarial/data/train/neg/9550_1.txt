I went here for lunch and sat at the bar. They have a lunch special menu but decided to look at the regular menu and ordered the grilled octopus and tzatziki. I've been here before and loved these two dishes. I wanted a nice glass of chardonnay preferably \nGreek. I tasted a few different wines and was not impressed at all. Maybe because they were Greek? Maybe I am too picky? I even tried a sauvignon blanc and it was awful. Anyhow I settled for a glass of whatever white and it was okay. The tzatziki wasn't bad but it tasted like I was eating pure sour cream. It was still tasty though. The octopus was still fabulous, so tender and loved the capers. The bartender let me try their bloody mary mix and it tasted pretty tangy and spicy...love love love! Full of flavor and definitely not plain jane out of the bottle mix. Now what kinda bothered me was the female bartender juicing limes and lemons at the huge juicing machine. Helloooo??? I want a peaceful quiet lunch and your prices aren't cheap people!!! That machine is loud and here she is grinding away with the limes like a little squirrel. Then these two guys sit further down the bar and order $30 shots of tequila \"chilled\" WHATTTT???!!!! The bartender goes and shakes the tequila up like it's from the gutter. I cringed. It's sipping tequila and you just ruined it. Please tell them!! Anyhow, then comes the young lady bartender with a big grey dirty looking cart with wheels on it and there is a huge load of ice in it. She proceeds to put the ice in the cooler. I'm assuming this ice is for customers drinks??? Ewwww.....This cart may have been clean but it looked all dirty with black marks in it.  You charge all that money for your food. You should have more class!! Also when I asked the bartender how to get to the Forum Shops, he didn't even give me a straight answer. A big ignore....thanks for helping me!
