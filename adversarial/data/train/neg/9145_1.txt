First visit to this delightful little gem in Henderson! Food was delicious and such a unique menu. So many wonderful sounding choices we will definitely be back. Jaimie the owner took great care of us. Even bringing out samples of some extra things to try. My husbands club sandwich was the best he ever had! Chef Matt comes out to each table to make sure your meal is to your liking. Great service and delicious food! Two enthusiastic thumbs up!
