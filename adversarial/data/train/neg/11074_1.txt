Laura was incredible. I bought my house and was delayed in getting it rekeyed. I finally got around to it and she was recommended by my realtor. She came out a few hours after I called and was quick and efficient in changing every lock and making sure I was safe in my home. She took extra measures she didn't have to for my benefit and I am incredibly grateful! \n\nLaura the Lock Lady is an absolute gem in a world that I didn't know much about. And it's nice to see powerhouse women who excel in a male dominated field! Keep on rockin on, Lock Lady!
