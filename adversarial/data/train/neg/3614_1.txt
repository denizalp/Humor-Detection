Do not rent from this company.  My flight was to arrive at 11:30 PM so prior to renting I called to ask & was told that would not be a problem.  When I arrived at the counter 1) they had NO CARS (including for several other customers) 2) they said rental agreements are automatically cancelled each MN.  They did promptly refund my prepaid rental fee.
