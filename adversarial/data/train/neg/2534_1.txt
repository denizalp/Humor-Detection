Fantastic hole-in-the-wall comic book shop. A local small place for comic book readers and collectors alike. It may be small but well organized; DC section on the left, Image, Dark Horse, IDW in the middle and Marvel on the right. They have most new issues--of not all of them--as soon they are release and they have various amount of back issues. If you are into variant covers, they have a few and a limited amount of them.
