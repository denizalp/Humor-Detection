Wonderful. I ate the bbq salmon fillet and my hubbie had the 12 oz filet mignon. The asparagus was just ok, so ask for a side of horseradish sauce to liven it up. We ended our meal with the chocolate lava cake. If I at all posssible, I would just come for that dessert alone. The service was perfect.
