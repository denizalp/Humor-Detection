We've ordered (delivery) a few times now and am super happy. I always try to get something different, but my kids swear by the Al Douglas (7yr old super picky!) and the Lou Holtz. On top of that they have the best tomato soup I think I've ever had from a restaurant.  My only real complaint is that they have no on-line order option but that's just me being spoiled.
