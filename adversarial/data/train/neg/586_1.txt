Cons\nThe wait. We waited for one hour to be seated and there were only three groups ahead of us. There are very few tables; three booths and a couple of tables for 2. The wait for their chicken waffle is at least 20 minutes but it's more like a 30 minute wait. So, the brunch here is a 3 hour affair. Be ready to wait. \n\nThe extras. Beware that any addition will be an extra 0.50 to have a little sauce and $2 to make it hot! This is what is added to the chicken and waffle. \n\n\nPros\nThe portions. They will be big enough even for those who eat a lot. The majority of the tables had a take out bag by the end of their meals. \n\nThe taste. The food is pretty good. The chicken waffle was crispy on the outside and still tender and moist on the inside. It also wasn't overtly salty but still well-seasoned. The burger with bacon was a tad saltier but if you have a green side, it would be perfect. The chips option though is very good and crispy. The macaroni and cheese option was the least of my favourites. There is also a huge garlic bread that comes with it. \n\nI would come eat here again if there isn't a wait.
