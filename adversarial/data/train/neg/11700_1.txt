Came for a after dinner treat with the BF and cousin based on the positive reviews. \n\nI ordered a hot almond milk tea (tiny surcharge for hot over iced) with boba. It was a pretty solid hot milk tea and their boba had a good chew and sweetness to it. The BF wanted a shave ice and grabbed the mixed fruit which had mangoes, watermelon, kiwi, strawberry, bananas in it,  topped with condense milk and we added a scoop of ice cream. This was okay, it was plentiful but I think next time some red bean would be good with it to add some richness and texture. Prices are reasonable here for what you get.\n\nIt's casual counter service, but they are pretty friendly here.\n\nThere's wifi, k-pop on the TV and usually I like to think of cafes a place to stay a while but their seats are just typical wood seats. Not uncomfortable right off, but not something I want to sit on and do some work either. \n\nI'd come back again for a drink.
