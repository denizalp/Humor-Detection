Seriously, don't waste your money donating to the one-armed bandits (slot machines). Take your quarters and go to the Pinball Hall Of Fame. Believe me, you will thank me! This is a place that will bring out the inner child in everyone.\n\nWe had an adventure finding the place. Of course the day that we decide to venture out in the rental car, Vegas has torrential downpours...just our luck. Pinball Hall Of Fame was a fun (and inexpensive) place to go. The games range in cost from $0.25 - $1.00 and you get typically 3 rounds for cost. If your looking for something to do and get tired of the Strip, venture over and give this place a whirl!
