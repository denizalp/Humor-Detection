The atmosphere of the restaurant is great. Comfortable and spacious enough to not feel on top of other tables dining. However, our waitress took our drink then food orders and both times had to come back to verify the orders...usually about 10 min later. When she came back to verify our food order she was 100% wrong. Good thing she came back to verify!! We were never checked on once food was delivered so we had to go ask another staff member for a special request. Because of the idea of the restaurant, it's expected to be small portions and big prices. The sea bass was way over done and extremely dry. And the bison steak was cold. Cocktails were delicious. I would not go back to this place on account of the poorly cooked food and poor service.
