Half of ANY drink and a great little $5 food menu late at night! I got the gyro sliders and herb fries...yum. It turned out they gave the wrong receipt out and someone unknowingly paid for our food...oops. Good for us, bad for them. Which brings me to my next point. This is the third time I've been here and the service is always spotty; thus the 3 stars. If you don't order right away, don't plan on ordering for awhile because they will run off and ignore you. I don't know about gambling, but you can do that there...as anywhere in Vegas I guess lol. And they have lots of couches, but I usually sit at the bar.
