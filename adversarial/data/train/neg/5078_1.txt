Got the job done!\n\nWent in for a Quickie wash and was pleasantly surprised. The wash was fast and my car looked very clean. They tape removed my magnets, and taped the back windshield wiper which I thought was a nice touch! And they have free vacuums which is a bonus! \n\nIt was pretty packed for a Sunday afternoon, so the employees were a little rushed with the customer service but people kept pulling in so I think for the speed and price they can look over that. Overall my car was clean and vacuumed and for that price I can't ask for anything more!
