Went with my momma today for lunch. It's a great place for soup noodles & it even comes with a drink. My momma and I got HK Style Milk Tea but there are tons of options to choose from. The portion size for the noodles is pretty huge. You can practically share one between two people. Quality of the food is really good. And he price is decent. $9.75 (plus tax) for a big bowl of soup noodles and a drink. Would totally come back. ^_^
