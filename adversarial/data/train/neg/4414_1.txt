Love this place. If you want great service no interruptions, this is the place to stay. Enjoyed dancing all night at the mix lounge. If you want to dance till you can't anymore this is the place to go to. The mix lounge is in the hotel. It closes until 4am. It's great. The only thing I disliked about my room was that it was to dark, so if your curtains were closed you totally felt like you were in a dungeon.
