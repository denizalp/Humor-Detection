Read the reviews for this place and thought I should try it at least once while I was in Vegas...\nMy friend got the Cat-5 Hurricane with an extra shot of 151 but he got it in the sports bottle instead of the ridiculous yardstick. Thank goodness he didn't because it tasted horrible. The 151 was mostly on the bottom, he drank all of it but he was barely buzzed, but then he's done 151 shots alone and was fine.\nThe 1 star is for the disgusting slushie. The cheap juice mixture with the alcohol was so nasty. I got sick from it and I only had a few sips. I'll stick to a nice bar where I can sit and enjoy a nice premium lychee martini. My friend didn't bother getting a refill because he didn't like it either.
