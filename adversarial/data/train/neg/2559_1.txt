Great place to eat. So far I've been here twice. Most recent was for my anniversary. The staff is so nice and welcoming. The food is great. They start you off with homemade cheese with crackers. The shrimp cocktail appetizer is amazing and the steak is some of the best I've ever had. You have to try the cheese fried potatoes they are unlike anything you've ever had. I  would highly recommend!
