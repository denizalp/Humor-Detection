I absolutely looooooove this place! The drinks are so good and a pretty decent price, my favorite is the strawberry daiquiri the yardstick is a perfect size ($18) , although it doesn't taste very strong by the time you finish it you will be feeling the buzz! if you keep the cup and take it on your next visit you get the refill a couple bucks cheaper, also for a $1 you can add an extra shot. I visit this place every time I am in Vegas, I cannot wait to check out the one in NOLA.
