We ate here for Valentines day and we're really looking forward to their traditional menu.  Unfortunately they had a completely different menu than they usually have so it was a little bit of a let down. \n\nWe ordered duck and also the lobster (they only had two options). While the duck was very good, I was not a fan of the lobster at all. \n\nThe quinoa soup was great and the mushroom seviche was very good too.  I just wish we knew about the fixed menu for V-Day\n\nThere food is almost Always really good, I just wasn't super impressed with it this time.  Especially not at 40.00 per person
