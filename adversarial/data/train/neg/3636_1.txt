We had dinner at the Arrogant Butcher last night, and it was just amazing! The food alone was worth the trip, but the service was over the top. I'm telling you, I've never had such great service both from our waiter and manager. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and very clean. If I had to say one bad thing about this place, I'd say they will never be able to top last nights dining experience.
