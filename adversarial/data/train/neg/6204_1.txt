The whole concept of cosmetic fillers and Med Spas can feel a little shi shi, the private purview of size 4 trophy wives married to billionaires. Well, Glo Medspa is so tasteful, low key, calm and private, and Charles so amicable, that the experience is very comfortable. I'm a middle-aged, average looking married woman who just wants a few natural looking tune-ups and I'm pretty shy and nervous in salon settings. I've been twice now and even though I live in another state, I plan to keep returning. Great owner, great service.
