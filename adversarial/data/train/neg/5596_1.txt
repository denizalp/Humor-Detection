Caveat Emptor! Took my car here because the tire place wanted me to have my car looked at by a mechanic after thinking my new tires were bad. I was told it was my differential & would cost $2200 to repair. Priced the repair through the dealer who quoted me $1600. Ended up taking it to the dealer & after further inspection found that it wasn't even my differential, it was a wheel bearing that I was able to repair for $300!! Always get a second, even 3rd opinion & better yet take your car to the dealer and save yourself the money & grief!! Glad i didn't get hosed for a very expensive repair that didn't even need done.
