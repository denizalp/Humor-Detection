While the staff here is fantastic and have always treated me really well, I must say two things that leave me feeling screwed here.\n\nOne, no lights inside the units so you cannot access them after dark. And if you have a large unit like I do, you need floodlights to work in the unit in the dark.\n\nTwo - the corporate office who makes pricing decisions is way the hell over the top.  I just got a notice in the mail of a 20% increase OVERNIGHT. From one month to the next, my price is going up over 30 dollars per month.  I don't know how the laws allow this kind of extreme price gouging.  I have stayed here because of the staff, but EVERY SINGLE COMPETITOR within 20 square miles is cheaper than this location for every size unit.  This location is great, the people are nice, but at some point IT GETS RIDICULOUS to completely screw people over from one month to the next, ESPECIALLY CLIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN WITH THE COMPANY FOR A DECADE.\n\nI'm tired of this kind of business behavior and will be taking my storage needs elsewhere.  I feel really bad because Patty and the crew here are great, but they work for a totally unethical company.  You cannot charge the kind of prices you do and have ZERO ELECTRICAL ABILITY IN THE UNIT SO YOU CANNOT SEE INSIDE IT IN THE DARK.\n\nMaybe someone at corporate will read my review and do a little number crunching and realize what bad publicity this is - not only my review, but a number of others who have similar complaints.  Greed is rampant at Extra Space.
