Where do I even begin? From the moment the ladies and I walked into this location, we were excitedly greeted by Jason B. His enthusiasm to take our order and make sure we were well taken care of was suburb. The interior was super clean and well lit. The other workers who handed us our food was just as equally outgoing. Jason even went above and Beyond to walk us out our food to our table. A+ for everything!
