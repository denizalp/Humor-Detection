First time here! We were seated right away, the place was pretty busy for a Sunday evening. Waitress came quick to take our drink order, upon her return with drinks, we ordered  Bo-bo platter. It consisted of egg rolls, beef skewers, fried shrimp, chicken wing and pork ribs. \nMain course came out quickly and it was steaming hot and fresh. One order of BBQ pork fried rice and an order of beef lo mein. I always ask for sweet n sour sauce and hot mustard, hot mustard was exceptional. \nWaitress came back several times, if she was unavailable anyone walking by would ask if we needed anything. \nPlates were so full of food that we are taking half of it home. \nOnly complaint is that there was a birthday party here and the kids keep blowing horns. After a while it became annoying while trying to have a conversation at the table. Was not Wongs fault, just the parents of the birthday party.
