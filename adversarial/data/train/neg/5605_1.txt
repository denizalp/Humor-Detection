Very good and we even ordered our dinner as take out! Three of us ordered a ten taco package. At first, I did not think it would be enough; however, I was full after eating 3 tacos. The carne Asada and chorizo with potato was fantastic! Note: the menu on yelp is not an updated menu. Also, the pico is spicy (one of my friends does not like spicy things).  Would have been 5 stars if we got rice and beans with this which I thought was supposed to come with the dinner.\n\nGreat food.
