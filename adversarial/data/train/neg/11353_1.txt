When we go to Vegas, we make sure to come at least once to Boca, it surely has authentic Brazilian food! Service sometimes might be a bit slow but we noticed a big improvement over the times we have come, besides it's all fresh food made to order, so it's all good and worth the wait. \nPlate portion sizes are great, I can easily split with hubby but we usually order 2 to take leftovers, yummy! The salgados (pastries) are soooo good, it's making me hungry just thinking about them. We usually order their delicious pasteis, cheese, chicken and cheese and doce de leite and the coxinha which is amazing. As for plates, we love the picanha, and the chicken parmigiana plates. Pizzas are awesome, especially the authentic chicken and catupiry cheese, and margherita pizza! \nNever tried the feijoada but my mom says it's very well made, and she's a Brazilian cuisine expert! Give Boca do Brasil a try and you won't regret it! I only wish we lived closer!!
