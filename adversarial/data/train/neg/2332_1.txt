I liked this musical very much.  The price was fair and the seating was great.  This is more a satire then a true love story.  Great music selection and the lady's definitely show off their skills.  The narrator was very funny and kept the crowd engaged.  The clientele was a mostly baby boomers.  \nI would recommend this show.
