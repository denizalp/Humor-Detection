Went here on Saturday after a really hard work out. I was STARVING! I got a double cheeseburger, fries, and butter pecan milkshake. It was all DELICIOUS! Still one of my favorite burgers in Akron. And can I just say that the guys who run around and serve everyone are awesome. I could not do that job.
