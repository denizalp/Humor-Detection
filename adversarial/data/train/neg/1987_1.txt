Just wanted to try a new place to eat as I was visiting PA with a friend. The atmosphere was very relaxing and laid back. The bathrooms were very clean. The chips and queso, especially the white cheese, were amazing. The chips alone have a very sweet\/salty taste. We had a nice waiter, Ben who seemed to really know the menu and what they had to offer. Honestly the only con I can give is the curbside appeal. The restaurant sits in between houses and just not normally what you would picture as a restaurant. With that said, once you walk through the door, everything changes! Overall just a very laid back and enjoyable place to eat!
