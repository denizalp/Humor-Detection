Very Satisfied! Recently used them for my wedding. Purchased the non-alcoholic package and brought our own beer, wine, spirits. The two bartenders were very professional AND fun! They had a great time but knew when to cut off the guests that went a bit overboard :) The pricing was competitive. The customer service was great leading up to event as well with prompt email and phone communication. Only word of caution is they don't provide drinking water before event starts so bring extra!
