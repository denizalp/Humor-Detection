I went to Tender last Sunday, and it was a wonderful meal! First off, this is a very typical steakhouse. They have filet mignon.. and lyonnaise potatoes.. the usual stuff. The decor is typical of a steakhouse. \n\nTo start I had one of the special a caprese salad, with heirloom tomatoes it was delicious. Absolutely perfect tomatoes and the cheese was perfectly seasoned. Loved it. My mom had a Caesar salad, she also enjoyed it. For dinner I had the small filet, it was good, I've had better, but nothing to really complain about, cooked to my liking of medium rare. The lyonnaise potatoes were ok, the wild mushrooms were delicious! We both loved those! My mom had a lobster tail, which they gladly removed from the shell for her. She said it was a little bit bland though. \n\nWe had a MyVegas comp, so $150 certificate. Our meal came to $149 before tax. So really not bad price wise. I would have paid full price for my meal no problem. In comparison, we did go to Stripsteak at Mandalay the next night, our prix fix meal was more than this... a full meal off the menu at Stripsteak would of probably been close to $300 so it was a great value at Tender!\n\nOverall a great meal, great ambiance, great service. We had 2 or 3 servers waiting on us, all very attentive. I would suggest sitting in the back room, we sat there it was nice, away from the casino. I would say if you are staying at Luxor or nearby it's a great steakhouse and worth the money. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here though.
