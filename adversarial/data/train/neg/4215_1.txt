Had a very good lunch. The fingers are very good and big.  I'd say the three piece meal would be enough for most. They have a nice selection of spin sauces and dips. I enjoyed the Teriyaki and the Cajun with the southwest ranch sauce. The meal comes with a fries, drink, and garlic toast. I'll be back and recommend it to anyone who like wing and fingers.
