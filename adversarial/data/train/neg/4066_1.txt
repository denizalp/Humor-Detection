My husband and I stayed here for Dodger Spring Training. There were a few main issues I have with the hotel:\n\n-The website says that they have an \"Airport Shuttle,\" however it is NOT complimentary and must be prescheduled. We took an Uber and it was half the price of what the car service said their service would be\n-I booked a room that said upon check in a could select a King or Two doubles, they told me upon check in that they did not have any King beds, however the hotel seemed far from being completely booked\n-The room was average and everything seemed faded, the cleanliness of the room was not stellar\n\nPositives:\n\n-Great gym\n-Great bar\n- Walking distance to fun restaurants and night life\n-Starbucks\/coffee caf√© in hotel
