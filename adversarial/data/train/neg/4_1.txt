Incompetent Staff!!! According to the sales representative at men's wearhouse, \"people's arms are usually different lengths\" so that's the reason my $400 suit I got on promotion from my wedding had one arm shorter than the other. This was said to me AFTER the 1st time I had them fix their horrible tailoring. 2x I drove all the way down there and back to find that their tailors have no idea what they are doing. Absolutely ridiculous. I will NEVER shop there again. I had them give me a new suit off the rack and a refund for their horrible unprofessional job and will go elsewhere to get a professional to tailor my suit. The ONLY reason I chose to get a suit there was because it was a promotional free deal from choosing them for my wedding. They are totally incompetent. Save your time and frustration and SHOP ELSEWHERE.
