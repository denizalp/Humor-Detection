Took the Wife and Kids along to Counts, We parked across the road and walked in off the street a short distance, The staff were at the front driveway, guiding people in the right direction, Everyone was friendly and it was free to get in, nice selection of cars and bikes on display, a little bit too close together to see properly though. Worth the short drive from the Strip.
