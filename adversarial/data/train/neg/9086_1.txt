We thoroughly enjoyed Battista's. From the atmosphere, to the food, to the adorable gentleman playing the accordion, it is a fun, reasonably priced unique experience off the craziness of the strip. \nWe loved the eggplant parmigiana and lasagna, both in generous servings, and the included bread and soup were tasty as well. The did I mention the included wine? The cappuccino was so amazing, we almost went back later for another cup! We will definitely be returning to Battista's on our next Vegas trip.
