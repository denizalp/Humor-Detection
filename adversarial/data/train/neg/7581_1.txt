I love this place. It's quiet and tucked away, and it has so much personality! From the cool wooden tables, to the floor seating in the back, to the HUGE variety of teas, I was sold from the start. I've had 2 breakfast burritos from this place and they were both delicious (beef bacon, potatoes, and eggs). I am a meat-eater, but they appear to have several vegetarian options as well. If you need something special, I do know they make everything to order so I am sure you can customize. They also sell a few staples of groceries in case you live nearby and are in desperate need of nutella or flour. \n\nAnother really cool feature of Algebra is the game collection. You can sit on pillows in the back area and play games if you have some time to kill. They also keep a book exchange library on the front right wall. I have traded 2 or 3 books out already and I love that they do this!
