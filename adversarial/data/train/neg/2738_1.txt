I've been going to TOTS now for five or more years with a group of friends. We usually go on Friday nights and the owner is always there to greet us with a smile. The entire staff is friendly and they make a point of letting us know they're glad we are there. \n\nExcellent food, very fair prices, and family owned. Hard to beat this place.
