The venue is awesome just like their other location in Scottsdale. Mostly everyone is pretty friendly but I had a bad experience with one particular server. \n\nI ordered a beer which I didn't like and wasn't going to say anything, however another server noticed my face after I took a sip and immedietley offered to switch it out for me. I accepted and told her I wanted the summer shandy...the L name one. So she said the L name and the server, Sarah, who was rude came and told it's an IPA. Being a beer novice, I said ok. Well it wasn't what I wanted but I kept it because I ordered it. \n\nLater Sarah comes back to see if we need anything, and my BF says she didn't like this beer. She responds well she ordered it, we told her it was an IPA I was here. Seriously? I'm wasn't arguing with her, I told her I would keep it.\n\nThen when it came time to pay, my bill was charged to someone else in our group. I tell her and she asked for my card, even though I had already gave it to her to open the tab. I tell her I want to pay cash, and she said the bf said I wanted to pay with a card. I said no cash...and she still questioned me. \n\nFinally, since we were done playing she asked us to move to the lounge area. I didn't understand it since it was a Tuesday night and there were TONS of open Bays! \n\nMostly it was misunderstandings. But I really dislike when servers question what the customer is asking for.
