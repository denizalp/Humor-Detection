Las Vegas Collision Center really took care of me! My ex caused damage to my front bumper and refused to pay the costs to fix it fully. Patrick offered to polish and buff the area at no charge. It looks great especially great for free. I have a lot going on in my personal life and family concerns I'm dealing with right now. This really brightened up my day. Of course it's always nice to save money but it's the random acts of kindness that really make a difference. Not only did Las Vegas Collision Center do excellent work on my car but they went the extra mile in customer service.
