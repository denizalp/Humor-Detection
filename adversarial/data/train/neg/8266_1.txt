Good options to choose from the \"skinnylicious\" menu and the salads\/foods are under like 590 calories. I got the factory salad with no bacon and it was very good. The other salads that are listed in menu are around 1000 calories for just a salad. Can't imagine how much calories is in the rest of the menu. :0
