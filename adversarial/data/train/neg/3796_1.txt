visually when you walk by uts quite appealing.  everything looks fresh and the sandwhiches and oaninis look like something youd like to order.  however taste wise my coworker and i found it to be mediocre and bland.  doesnt hit the spot in terms of quality.  i have been here a few times and although it makes me want to like it and try it again its just decent and not abything remotely special.  unfortunately.
