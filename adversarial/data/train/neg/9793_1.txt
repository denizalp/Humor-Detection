This store is adorable.  I love the little talking chicken that welcomes you to Goat Feathers when you walk in the door.  It's just so kitschy.  I grew up in the Midwest, so this place makes me feel like home - lots of homemade tchotchkes and useless junk.  Just like my parents' house in good ol' Missouri.  \n\nSometimes things are really overpriced, but it's always fun to look anyway.
