I've eaten here only once, on a terribly hungover day when I could not bear to walk any farther away from home.\n\nIt was good. It's clean and slick looking, with dark tables and nice lighting, so that stands out as different from your average pho joint. The pho was good enough. I recall it as being on the high end of pho prices, so still pretty inexpensive. \n\nThe service was definitely lacking - inattentive that may have moved right into neglectful, which is sort of amazing considering how little I require from pho service. I was there mid afternoon, so perhaps they were just doing other things. That doesn't excuse neglectful service, but it might explain it.
