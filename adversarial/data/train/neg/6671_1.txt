First of all, I can't attest to the hotel part of the resort, only the casino, so if you're looking for a review of the accommodations, keep scrolling down.\n\nI never spent more than five minutes in the old Imperial Palace. It was tacky, it was dingy, and in a city with a bunch of other options, I never considered spending my money on their casino floor.\n\nMake no mistake, The Quad isn't a finished product. Some of it is thrown together, and the Dealertainers are still there in all their tacky glory, but what exists is a marked, MARKED improvement over the Imperial Palace. $5 blackjack is prevalent, even in the biggest times for business, and the poker room features cheap tournaments that are structured pretty well. I wish the cashier wasn't all the way on the other side of the casino from most of the table games, but for what it is, a low-limit casino in an area of Vegas where the limits can be sky-high, it works and works pretty well.
