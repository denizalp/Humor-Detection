Usually I really enjoy subway, but my last visit wasn't ideal. My preferred sandwich is a veggie and cheese with extra cheese and add avocado. The young man working there the other evening grabbed the package of avocado and there visibly wasn't enough for 2 scoops, probably not enough for one scoop, so he took the spreader and got what he could from the edges and put it on my sandwhich which resulted in a very thin layer with several inches uncovered. I should have said something but didn't as the charge for avocado on a footlong is $1.50. This sandwhich was just under $9 and had little flavor as I don't add sauces or oil\/vinegar since the avocado usually add the creaminess, flavor and moisture to the bread. I think I'm done with this subway.
