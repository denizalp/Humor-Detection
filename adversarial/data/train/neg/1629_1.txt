We eat at Courtneypark's Osmows often so we thought this Heartland one would be good too.\n\nUnfortunately their chicken isn't as chopped up or well-cooked as Courtneypark's. We found at least a handful bone fragments in each of our Chicken on the Rocks, so be careful! It seems they're a bit stingy on the white sauce too.\n\nWill continue to go to Courtneypark location, but this is the last time we visit the Heartland one.
