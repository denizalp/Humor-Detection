Went to Lucki Thai because of great reviews on Yelp.  It's a small, clean restaurant next to a large, interesting Filipino Seafood Market.  Service was excellent and very, very friendly.  Prices were very, very reasonable  Everything we ordered was wonderful, artfully presented and huge!   We were in Las Vegas for only four days but went back a second time because we liked the little restaurant so much.  We had fried soft shell crab with fried rice and also the soft shell crab appetizer.  Both were excellent.  We also ordered the beef salad, chicken Panang curry, Prik beef, chicken satay appetizer, shrimp tempura appetizer, and papaya salad (huge!).   For dessert we had the sweet sticky rice with sliced mango swimming in a coconut sauce.  We ordered level 7-8 for spicy dishes which was not too hot, just right.   We had a lot left over that we just couldn't finish - I recommend that you order just one or two plates to share and then order more if you are still hungry.
