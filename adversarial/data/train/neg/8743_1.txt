I've gone here for Happy Hour twice with my coworkers on Thursday afternoons\/early evenings. The setting is super-comfortable and is a great place to unwind with a glass of wine or beer (which is half price during happy hour! great deal). \n\nI highly recommend the apple and honey bruschetta. It was heavenly!\n\nThey were playing Frank Sinatra and other \"older\" music at a low volume both times I was there. It was nice and relaxing.
