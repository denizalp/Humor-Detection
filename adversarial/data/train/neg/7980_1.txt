Food was Good. I ordered the fried chicken cutlet bento. It came in a bowl. Sliced Fried chicken deliciously seasoned. It came with seasoned rice, tofu, picked radish? And broccoli and a half egg. I wasnt a fan of the pickled Radish. It tasted artificial to me. But everything else was worth the 9.50. I also tried the Tea Boiled egg $1. It was good. No need for salt. \nWhen coming here be wary, its more of a college student joint. Not alot of space for big group. Space is limited especially lunch hours. They're food and teas are delicious though. Definitely worth a try. \n\nA tip: their little eats are not a meal. Just so you know. The G2. Grilled chicken cutlet is literally just the chicken cutlet in a bag. So if you want a meal order the Bentos.
