Love the people at this location. Always super friendly and helpful and we live right around the corner from here. However, whenever we order steak here we NEVER get the right cook of the steak. Today was my husbands birthday and we did a curbside order and normally I don't complain but the steak was well done instead of medium rare like we both ordered. Really hope they can get that part down because we really like this location but I am pretty disappointed today.
