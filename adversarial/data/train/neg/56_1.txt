Red Curry is Thai-mazing!\n\nBack for more ....ordered Khao Soi (Norther Thai curry noodle) spicy which was delicious but not enough curry, didn't care for the wontons on top, I prefer it when's done w the extras to add, owner said they will customize. The red curry shrimp was delectable w the bamboo shoots done perfectly...Savory!
