I'm only giving a 4 because the fries were pretty plain and not worth eating in my opinion.\n\nThe soft shell crab sandwich though is a completely different story! It was perfectly fried and so full of flavor. I am not sure if it was the time of the year or what but the crab was super sweet and juicy.
