I purchased a slightly used bass guitar from Milano Music through a third party website (reverb).   Milano's communication and shipping were excellent, and the item was accurately represented.   When I discovered a couple buzzing issues, Milano was willing to work with me to resolve them.  When I decided the bass was not right for me, they issued a prompt refund upon its return.    I recommend them!
