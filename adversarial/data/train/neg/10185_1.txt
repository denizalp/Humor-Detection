Went to Harley Red Rock to get a gift card for my son who lives in Singapore, so it's important that he can use\nThis out of the country! Major disappointment! They could not sell me one since they had not yet updated their software so I was directed to Harley on Las Vegas Blvd , across from the Welcome to Las Vegas Sign . It took quite awhile to record my order, since they had just downloaded their new software. Luckily I had exactly $50. 00 in cash on me because they WILL NOT TAKE CREDIT CARDS INCLUDING DEBIT CARDS, ONLY CASH FOR GIFT CARDS! Apparently they don't accept debit cards for any reason. This is very inconvenient , I usually only have a little money on me so this is an imposition to me' I not only spent 2 hrs out of my day chasing around but had to go way out of my area to get this card for my son!! I think the Credit Card companies have a clause in their contract with the vendor that prohibits the vendor from demanding cash and refuse to sell you an item with your credit and\/or debit card. I'm going to check on that . In the meantime I would quit patronizing them but they have almost a monopoly on the motorcycle business here in Vegas. Being Christmas is just around the corner and gift cards are a big item, I would think they would be all set to serve the public, NOT!
