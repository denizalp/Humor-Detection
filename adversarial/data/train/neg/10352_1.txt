Customer service is great here and the food is amazing. I had re margarita pizza and the crust melts in your mouth and has a little crisp burntness to it which tastes pretty good. I also had their small Greek salad and oh my was it big and the top was full of tasty veggies and also arugula. The rest of the salad was iceberg lettuce. The atmosphere is nice. The wait is long for the pizza but they make it infront of your which is nice. If you are getting just a salad or a \"small bite\" there is a separate line for you which is nice.
