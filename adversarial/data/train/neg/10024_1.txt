first time at this place and absolutely loved it! my husband and i were visiting from Buffalo, NY and had a late night burrito craving. we saw this place was close by and had some good reviews so we came to check it out. i liked how everything was set up where you could pick all your toppings as you go. kind of like a chipotle. also liked that they fry the burrito on both sides to keep it together and give it an extra crunch! \n\nif you're from Buffalo, it's very similar to one of our hometown favorites -- Lloyd Taco Factory. overall exactly what we were in the mood for!\n\nGET YOU SOME BURRITOS
