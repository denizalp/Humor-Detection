Great sushi and spring rolls! \n\nI ate here 8 nights in a row while I was in town for work. Every night I would order the sushi to go, and eat it back at my hotel room. It tastes great even 2-3 hours after it was made. \n\nI tried over half of the special $9.25 8 piece rolls. All were amazing. \n\nThe soy paper sprint rolls are my favorite especially the Avocado roll! \n\nThey also usually have a roll on special for the entire week.
