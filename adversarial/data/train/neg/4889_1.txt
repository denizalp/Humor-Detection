Persistence pays off. I was initially contacted by this company over the holidays and while my first reaction was to avoid the perceived intrusion, I finally got to chat with them when my scheduled permitted.  I listened intently while the rep explained what they were about and what they could do for me. \nResponse was super quick and a courtesy call was placed to me a few minutes before Chris showed up at my door. After his first inspection, Chris broke down the jargon of an efficient heat pump and explained in layman's terms to the uninitiated (me) as to what I should be striving for as a potential customer.\nDragging my proverbial heels, I was reluctant at the get-go, but Chris painstakingly drew me a pros and cons scenario and explained everything thoroughly. Options were put forward and an economical forecast was planned out. There was no pressure at any time, just some honest and down-to-earth advice.\nAfter reaching a consensus, Chris completed his work and assured me that I was in good hands. Being new to all of this, Chris schooled me on the ins-and outs of novice maintenance and for that I am grateful. Always professional and courteous, Chris embodied all that customer service is...and should be about. \n\nThank you Chris and Rescue One Air.
