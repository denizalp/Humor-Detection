The chicken is great and juicy and the sauce is tasty -but greasy-. Best portuguese chicken I've tasted in Montreal. The fries used to be amazing before they renovated but now they are just ok. I think they started skimping on the spices with the fries and sadly their fries were better than their chicken for comfort food, imho.\n\nPlain salad and rice. The sandwiches are just the chicken in a bun. Nothing fancy.\n\nThe pastries and bread aren't worth it, to be honest.\n\nTIP:\nThe seating is limited and is that of a Deli. If you aren't planing on eating in, I recommend ordering ahead of time via phone. You do NOT want to be stuck in one of the busy long line on a weekend. You have your own much shorter line if you order by phone.
