Finally! After drooling over everyone else's review I was able to stop by here after dinner at Lebowskis with Kelly C. \n\nI got the chocolate sea salt, which is cream based and ah-mazing. I would probably go here every day if it was always in the same place. Towards the end I was a complete mess and covered in chocolate, but it was well worth it. \n\nA must go and only $2.50 for awesomeness!
