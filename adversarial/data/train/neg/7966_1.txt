This is the best Indian restaurant around. I have been to every Indian restaurant in town. I used to go to Indian Paradise and Guru Palace regularly, then I started going here. This is the only Indian restaurant in Phoenix that uses real lamb, not BEEF (check the texture at other places next time). The flavor is incredible. Most importantly the owners are great people. I have become very good friends with them the past year. I bring all my friends there and they are well taken care of. This is my favorite place to eat. I recommend the Lamb Saag, Lamb Boti Masala, and Lamb Vindaloo with Paneer Naan. Hope to see all of you guys there. You will not be dissapointed.
