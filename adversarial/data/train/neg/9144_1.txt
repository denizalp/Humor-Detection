I've come here a handful of times in the past 10months, I still always worry about having a bad experience because of all the bad reviews on here but I think this place has really turned itself around. Jessica no longer works here but I've gotten both Kevin and Becky since then and every time I come here they've done a consistent and excellent job. Everyone has been really friendly, Becky does an amazing job on the foot massage, she even convinced me to do a basic manicure and I never let anyone get a good look at my hands because my several nails are pretty bad, she cleaned them all up and made sure I was comfortable the entire time. Even just looking. Around and watching everyone's mannerisms, and how they interact with other customers, all the employees seem very happy and nice. Everything is vey light and open feeling, not complicated and they do a good job.
