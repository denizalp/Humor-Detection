This was our second visit to try out the sandwich (only served on Thursdays and Fridays) and a big table of teenagers snagged all the sandwiches just as we sat down.  Gah!\n\nDisappointed, we ordered our usual pho with rare beef and bun bo hue.  What I love about this little joint is that they serve up pretty decent bun bo hue that is actually spicy.  The broth for both pho and bun bo hue are clean, beefy and unadulterated.  Condiments are served up fresh with a smile.\n\nThe service can be slow as this tiny (20 seater) restaurant is served by one lady who serves the hall and mans the counter (presumably the owner).  \n\nBoth our first and second visit was good and the location and quality of the food makes VD a go to pho place in Durham region for me.  Sorry Pho Metro, you've lost out by dumbing-down your food in the Ajax location.\n\nDefinitely will be back to try out more stuff here!
