Now that was a fantastic hot dog and like it's name suggests it was mighty tasty!  I stopped here for a Polish Dog while I waited for my nothing bundt cake to bake. This hot dog was out of this world! If you like all the fixins just order it Chicago style and don't you dare ruin this beautiful delight with ketchup. Blasphemy!
