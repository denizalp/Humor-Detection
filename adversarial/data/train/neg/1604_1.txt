As her name states Ms Con.  She is very deceptive and misleading. Stay away from this con artist. Find an alternative attorney to represent your case or self help center is very resourceful & many other options to consider. She's a very weak communicator and does not have the ability to get matters resolved (why get it resolved? Not in her best financial interest as its passive income for this pathatic attorney). Lousy attorney at best to have an your side , unless you're trying to get defeated in court.  I do not recommend her to my friends or family at all ! Besides being extremely rude she lacks empathy, she knows it's a one-time gig , go for the throat! I paid her  $27,000 for my child custody case in a one year period. I'm in  financial ruin and have to file bankruptcy. The cherry to top it off, Karen Connolly put a lien against my house(100% prime evil ) Thanks a lot!  Finally,   I received an email from the attorney demanding me to remove my YELP  review otherwise she will SUE me for defamation. Positively the truth will prevail. God knows how many other clients you've taken down this unfortunate route. Your unethical practices will be revealed. As I'm writing this YELP review I'm bringing awareness to this situation and releasing the shenanigans. CASE CLOSED
