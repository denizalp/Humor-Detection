The prices here are pretty pricey but most of the selection is rare vintage pieces so it's understandable. I didn't even buy anything but I had to rate this place so high for their selection and customer service. Most high end type boutiques try to snob you and give you attitude or not even acknowledge you in the store which turns me off the store. But the customer service here was the complete opposite. I was greeted first thing at the door and just chopped up with the dude behind the counter like we were old friends. Made me feel very welcome opposed to other shops I've been to. Definitely gonna come back here next time I'm in Vegas hopefully with more money.
