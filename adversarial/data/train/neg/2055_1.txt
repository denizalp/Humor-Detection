I went here with my dad and boyfriend. Each of us tried a different burger. They were all good,  but we were not asked how we wanted them cooked. It was a little well done for our taste. Also,  although our fries came out in a bag, they were not hot. \nThe potato skins were a good appetizer, but there could have been a bit more potato left on them. \nOur server was great and checked on us many times throughout our visit. He always made sure we had enough to drink and everything we needed. \nIt is a bit pricey for the quality of food,  but that's Vegas.\n\nUpdate: The manager is very accommodating and the service is great. They check their reviews, respond,  and try to make up for any issues you had during your visit.
