Anniversary dinner at Hank's atmosphere was old school Vegas elegance loved it. Food...we had crab cocktail to start ice cold lump crab with 2 delicious dipping sauces. Followed by steak house salad it was a chopped salad if you like blue cheese you will love it. Ice cold salad crunchy bacon,avocado,white French dressing it was good but I will not order again because it is impossible to pick out the blue cheese in a chopped salad :) main coarse we had prime rib king and queens cut. we both ordered medium well. king was more medium rare we had to send it back mine which was much thinner and was perfect. Chris was our server very pleasant informative. The reasons I could not give five stars had to request a water refill, had to return prime rib, sides were sent out wrong. We both ordered potatoes and they tried to give us creamed spinach lol,computers went down when it was time to pay our bill so we had to wait a bit but that stuff happens. Surprise happy anniversary strawberries were a nice touch. All in all we enjoyed our anniversary diviner at Hank's and we look forward to coming back.
