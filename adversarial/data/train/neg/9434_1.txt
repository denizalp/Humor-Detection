The Broadway Palm is back as The Palms Theatre and I am so glad!  Mesa needs this theatre in our community bringing musical and concerts to our residents.\n\nI took a group of ladies opening night of Menopause the Musical and we laughed till we cried.  The performers are stellar, the food was excellent and the staff is back to the quality of the staff from before.\n\nWelcome back to Mesa and thank you to the Prather family for trusting in our community enough to bring The Palms back for our entertainment!
