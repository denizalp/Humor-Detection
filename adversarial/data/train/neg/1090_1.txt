Very Slow, the girl on service is nice, but really slow, getting a coffee refill was nearly impossible.\n\nThis place is a good rest stop when visiting Agincourt Mall, but after watching a 20\/20 show last night about how filthy restaurants are it was a bad place to go.\nThe menu's were sticky, my girlfriends coffee cup had a stain on it (I think it was a stain?)\n\nThe plate I had was ok, $9.50 for a ramekin filled with scrambled eggs and some meat, along with toast, home fries, and the saddest salad I ever saw (a piles of shredded iceburg topped with 4 tomato slice).\n\nThey do make a good Philly Cheese, but one time I ordered it, the meat was rare (red!! ewww) so I haven't had it again. \n\nAs I mentioned, the place is a good rest stop while shopping, other than that, avaoid it.
