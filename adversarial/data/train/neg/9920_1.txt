I am going to have to agree with Jordi, this experience was very sub-par.  The place was dead and our service sucked.  My whiskey drink was the best part of the entire experience.  I ordered the Caesar Salad with chicken.  It was pretty bland for a Caesar but the croutons were good I guess.   I tried some of the pizza and while liking the Dough (I Love Bread) the pizza toppings and sauce were not that great.  I might come back and give this place a try again just because there are always those days.  But there are so many awesome places to eat in this area why bother.  I like trying new places better than places I did not like twice.
