After having the worst experience at CareNow located at the 6125 West Tropicana Avenue Las Vegas 89103... this place pulled me out of the woods their stuff was amazing Josie sign in I had double eye infection so she was very kind to help me out and read numbers to me so I could fill out my paperwork Josie went out of her way to help me out....she was a true professional, she was amazing and courteous..... I owe this lady a world of gratitude the staff was extremely professional the doctor was amazing prescribed the medication I needed and I was able to get to the pharmacy just in the nick of time to get the drops that I needed for my eyes and now they're healing well and I can see again without severe pain
