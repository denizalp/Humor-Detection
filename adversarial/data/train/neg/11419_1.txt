Not bad of a place for the entire family. There are no drinking bars, stores, or gambling in this resort. You have to drive or take a taxi to get to those kind of places. It is about a ten minute drive away from the strip. Those were the reasons why I gave this place three stars. I came here since my parents wanted to go here. If you have kids and you still want to go to Vegas, this place is definitely safe for the kids.\n\nThe swimming pool area is like going to a neighborhood community pool in the mid-morning time I went. Meaning there were a lot of kids.\n\nThe fitness area is separated into two areas: a strength room and cardio room. The strength room is small. If you see more than two people working out in here, I would probably come back until one of them leaves.\n\nThe staff are friendly and understanding. Average response time when we needed something in our room was about 10 minutes. Longest wait was 20 minutes.\n\nLastly, our room is nice and clean. There is a kitchenette was at least kitchenware for six people. Two HDTVs, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. Spacious indeed. There is a pullout bed sofa.
