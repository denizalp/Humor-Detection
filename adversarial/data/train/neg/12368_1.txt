Amazing service!!  Here's why:\n\nI had an appointment scheduled for an oil change at Advanced Auto out on Shea & Sahuaro today.  I requested the cheaper oil and had a $15.99 coupon.  They told me my 2012 Chrysler 200 had an engine made by Mercedes, which their computer was showing I needed the more expensive oil change which was nearly $100.  I explained that I had never gone for the more expensive oil and have had no problems.  He said they had to use only oil their computer tells them to use.  \n\nI chucked them the deuces  and peaced out.  Drove up the road to Jiffy Lube on Shea and was greeted with awesome service.  I even pulled a coupon from their website which expired 12\/31\/13 yet they said they will take any coupon expired or not, for anyone.  It took about 15 minutes and there is a little waiting area with coffee and water.  The shop is pretty small but extremely well run from what I saw today!
