This was our 4th visit, all within the last 2 months.  The first 3 were good, but not this visit.  Overall, this is a good choice for good food at an affordable price.  The staff is good and hard working.  Our opinion changed during our last visit Friday night.\n\nMy wife and I arrived Friday around 6:30 and were told there was a wait, which was to be expected.  The hostess informed us that there was a table being held for a reservation and if they did not show-up we could have their table in 15 mins., if they did show-up it would then be about 40 mins.  We decided to wait.\n\nWithin 10 minutes the reservation party arrived, the hostess informed us and then said we were next.  Over the next 25 minutes we saw 3 different parties seated, finally when the 4th party was being shown their table we asked about us.  The hostess told me that we were a party of 2 and that the other parties were larger and were being seated at tables of 4.  \n\nTo make matters worse, there was a group in the bar area celebrating a birthday, difficult to estimate but we thought there was 12 or so.  They were given 3 tables that seated 4 each as well as the 2 larger tables ( seating for 8 or 10 each ? ).  As you could imagine, most of the time these people were up and mingling.  In fact the 2 larger tables were being used for the food, with no one even sitting at them.\n\nConsidering all the other options available, I cannot imagine ever going back.
