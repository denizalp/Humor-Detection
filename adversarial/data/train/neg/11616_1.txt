Another go-to for authentic Mexican food with that mid-west flair. Don't pass this place up. Bomb. Shared a small carne asada fries and three tacos (al pastor, thin salted steak and barbacoa) with the girlfriens. Everything was delicious. Joe the chef even hooked me up with a sour cream + chipotle mix that I coined, \"Allan's sauce\" that I used to spread on the tacos.
