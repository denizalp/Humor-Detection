Came here because of all the great reviews that it got from the fellow yelpers. My boyfriend and I were craving crepes for awhile and didn't want to spend 18 bucks on a fancy crepe place so we came here. I was very surprised how delicious they were! I got the savory crepe with turkey and everything in it and my boyfriend got the deli crepe. The savory crepe is huge and can be shared. The deli crepe wasn't as good, and didn't think that it would be cold. I'm not sure if I would get that again. I will come back and try the waffle sandwich and if my tummy has room, a dessert one as well as. Love the interior and the staff is friendly. Btw, they have a stamp card too, so make sure you ask for one!! :)
