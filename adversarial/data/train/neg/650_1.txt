Spoon is back! \n\nI quit going to Spoon at least a year ago. The space had gotten really tired, and the menu no longer had the feeling of excitement that it had when it first opened.  So I was interested but not optimistic about returning after learning that they had redecorated and hired a new executive chef. \n\nWe came in on Sunday and discovered a new restaurant.  The layout is pretty much the same, but the tables are new, the lighting is new, everything feels fresh.  The menu is totally different--yay--and everything was so interesting we decided to just start out with small plates.  \n\nWe had a smoked blue fish plate, an outstanding crepe stuffed with cauliflower tikki masala, a seafood cazuala, and korean fried chicken.  All fantastic.  My favorite, though, was the side of turnips with a maple sauce and peppers.  So awesome.  We tried two desserts and both were off the charts good. \n\nI've been back 3 times.  Add the fish entre and steak for visits 2 & 3.  Both great.  Definitely an ATF in Pittsburgh.  One minor request--dim the lights just a little!  Too bright!\n\n------
