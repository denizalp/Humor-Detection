I'm not from Charlotte, so when looking for Tex Mex, a friend highly recommended Paco's. I've been there three times and have always had an excellent experience. It has a good clientele, great food, great drinks and great prices. It also has a warm, pleasant atmosphere. I can't wait to get back down to Charlotte!
