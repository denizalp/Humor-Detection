This place is fantastic. I come here for lunch and for less than $10 I get sandwhich\/panini (I love the chicken avocado and the chipotle chicken best), a side (usually kettle chips but the coleslaw was good too), and a drink. The gluten free bread is good too. It's a bit small but most are and at least here they still load it up with meat
