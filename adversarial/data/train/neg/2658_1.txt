My husband and I checked in on Saturday afternoon celebrating our part 2 of our honeymoon and we usually stay at Southpoint and sometimes here we decided to stay at Silverton I love love love the beds they're extremely comfortable I don't have any complaints except for the employees here do not speak they're rude they don't say hello good morning when they're passing you by in the hallway unlike Southpoint... the only ones that I did notice that will speak were the cocktail waitresses I guess coming back from Cabo San Lucas all of the employees housekeepers spoke said good morning it was a different feeling and I come to Las Vegas to celebrate and this treatment we get this is so unacceptable maybe they'll do better next time or maybe we'll start staying more at Southpoint...on top of that they took my gold card and told me that they had to give me a silver card my players card...
