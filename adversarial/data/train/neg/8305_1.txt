This Subway is awful!  Customer service is so-so.  Not very friendly or accommodating.  Ordered a bunch of footlong subs for a party and wanted the sides on the side.  Was told they had no plastic containers or even a baggie to put them in.  I actually had to go to the Safeway, buy some plastic baggies and hand them to the sandwich maker.  How sad!  Also, the amount of meats and tuna that were put on them was slim at best.  I didn't expect tons of meat or tuna, but at least a little substance, so you don't just eat bread and lettuce.  Honestly, I'll be taking my business to Jersey Mike's.  At least their sandwiches are hearty for the same price.
