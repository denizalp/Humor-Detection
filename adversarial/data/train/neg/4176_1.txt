This is such a cute little desert place. I ordered the earl grey ice cream on waffle with fresh mixed fruits and chocolate sauce. It was only $8plus tax which is a reasonable price. I loved the early grey ice cream, it tasted amazing and wasn't too sweet. This is a great desert place to go with friends and chat amongst some desert! The only problem is that there is limited seating, so sometimes you have to wait but other than that, it's great!
