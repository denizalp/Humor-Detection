This place is fantastic.  Plaza Midwood is becoming the hot spot for Charlotte foodies.  I am not vegetarian but quality of the food was second to none.  \n   Set in a cozy Garden-House type atmosphere this place will change the way most people look at vegetarian food.  We loved the Mason jar lighting and the herbs and ferns growing from the wall.  \n  We were there very late, I think we walked in at 10pm, and they were gracious enough to let us eat.  We had the OM burger and the veggie filled Chicken and Dumplings.  The burger was incredible and the Dumplings were very good. \n  This place is has joined the list my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.
