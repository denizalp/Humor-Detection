Been coming here for months now. Look and pick what they had. But just yesterday they changed the whole thing. There's menus and now you can build your own poke bowl! I like that they make things to order now but because of that it takes longer to get the food. It used to be ask, pack, pay, go. I don't know if I like this new set up and new thing. And it didn't look like they had exactly what they used to have on display before. They took things out...
