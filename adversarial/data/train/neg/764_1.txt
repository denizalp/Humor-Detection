After eating here for the past 5 years, sometimes multiple times per trip, last nights dinner beat them all. Recent menu changes were welcome, as well as seeing the old favorites still rockin' the menu.\n\nWhat made this trip so special though was eating dinner at the bar and having Megan take care of us. Not only was she a fantastic Bartender but she knew the menu backwards and forwards.\n\nThis place gets busy, so don't miss an opportunity to experience the full menu at the bar and maybe Megan will make your dinner all the more special.
