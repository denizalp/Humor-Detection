It's on Bland st for a reason.  Cool atmosphere. Good drink selection. Mediocre overpriced food.  Chips were too hard.  Tacos had weird flavors and tough, fatty beef.  Black beans were very salty.\n\nI had the asada taco and the korean bbq taco.  The beef was flavorless, tough and chewy, and I had multiple pieces that were just straight up fat. The asada taco was essentially meat on top of american coleslaw that was not as good as what you get at most fast food restaurants.  The Korean taco was clearly the same beef but with a sickeningly sweet bbq sauce (no korean aspect to it that I could see) over huge slices of onions.  It was $10 for these crappy tacos.\n\nWe got the queso because of the free app coupon. It was fine but worth about$2, not the $7 we were charged before reminding the waitress about the coupon we had.\n\nService was friendly but very slow.\n\nMy friend and I both had to use the restroom afterwards.
