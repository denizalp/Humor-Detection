Went here with my parents, who are sometimes hard to please when it comes to finding something they are comfortable eating.  The menu is large enough where one should be able to find something they like.  The chicken and sweet potato waffles were great.  There are daily specials, which we took advantage of including a family style dinner that included sides and salads.  \n\nOur server was fantastic, very attentive and kind.  This would be a great place for happy hour and even family events.  Definitely will be returning!
