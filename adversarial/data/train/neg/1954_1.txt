I would give this place 5 stars a year ago. I started going to this place more than 6 years ago and they were the best Mediterranean food you could find with huge portions and an amazing salad that accompanied each order. \n\nNow, every time I go back, I realize that the prices have gone up while the portions have become smaller. The food quality is still very good though.\n\nThe Lemonana is a drink to try.\n\nFree onsite parking is available.
