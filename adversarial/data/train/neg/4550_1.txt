This was my first time experiencing Fabulous Freddie. I always stopped by in the evening but this was daytime, and immediately after I pulled up, a young woman asked if I would like her to pump the gas. I looked for a sign that she worked for the company, gave her a $10 bill (just in case), then waited for the other shoe to drop. While she was gone, another young woman appeared and asked if I needed help, then a guy showed up and started pressing all over my windshield before declaring it fine and asking if I needed any services. Then another guy showed up asking if I needed gas. Then the original woman returned and gave me a receipt and then pumped the gas. Whew! I felt like I was receiving 1950's style service! It was great. Now that I know they have a membership card, a detailing service that gives you a discount on gas, and other things, I'll be back- in the daytime!
