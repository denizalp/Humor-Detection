I've had Johnny Rockets three times in my lifetime. Once in San Fransisco when I was in the 6th grade, in Queens NY back in 2009 (when it was still open), and then again recently at this location.\n\nI must say it is one of the best places to get a strawberry milkshake. So good.\n#fatkid\n\nKeep up making tasty strawberry shakes.
