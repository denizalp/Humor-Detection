This sushi bar is my absolute favorite! I will literally drive from Prescott (about a two hour drive) just to eat here. The atmosphere is very mellow; love the '80s jams! I also love how everyone is greeted as they enter the restaurant.\n\nI've never had a roll I haven't liked here. I have to admit, I haven't tried much else of their menu other than sushi. But from what I've tasted, everything here is delicious. And their tempura rolls are always delicious without being oily. They're very accommodating here as well. I once went in when I was pregnant and they made some very good recommendations based on my restricted diet. Keep up the great work Tokyo Lobby!
