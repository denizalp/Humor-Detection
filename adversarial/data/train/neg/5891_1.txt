Had a great experience everyone was very helpful. Got some good insights on some beautiful loops around the Grand Canyon and Sedona Arizona.\n\nBike was in excellent shape good tires had no issues. Received some cell phone numbers just in case which added to the experience.\n\nIf you're renting out to Las Vegas this is the place to do it.\n\nThanks guys!
