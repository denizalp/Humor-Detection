We used to live in Belize, and miss both the food and hospitality of the Belizean people. Elvira's food brought back fond memories. The dishes were well prepared, presented nicely, and served by a friendly staff. We enjoyed a wonderful conversation with the owner, including stories of his childhood growing up in Corozal, in northern Belize. Make sure you try the fish panades. If you're there for breakfast try the fried jacks drizzled with honey. We'll be back for more.
