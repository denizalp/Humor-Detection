The food was amazing, and it sure shows the wait for brunch when we walked up was a little over an hour. Tons to do on the street to keep busy. The menu totally hits the spot for brunch for sure. And I took a peak at their lunch\/dinner looks good too. Food was made fresh at order, and I feasted with my friends. I ordered the steak and eggs; came win potatoes and veggies, was made perfect medium rare but my plate forgot the sauce. It was still good! Friend ordered chicken pot pie was made to order and was hot out the oven delivered she loved it. The hummus egg bowl was also ordered at the table was delicious. It would of been 5 stars but the place was hot like no AC upstairs, waited a little over an hour for the food to come but kept busy with conversation and drinks. Still would return for sure the food was awesome.
