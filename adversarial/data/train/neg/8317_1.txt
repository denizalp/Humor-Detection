I had a Pangoa bowl and a Green smoothie and omg I fell in love with it! I love the service in this location better. The staff were very friendly, fast, and accommodating to my preferences. This is a good place to have a quick bite for those on the go! Fast , fresh and healthy! My new go to place for lunch!
