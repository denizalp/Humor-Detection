Response to Morris. \n\nIt was a year later with regards to having the exterior painted right is due to the interior had still not been completed.   When you hire less than ameture painters on the corner of Arizona and W. Fairview St. what do you expect?  Not to mention the high turnover in managers did cause the delay for you to finish everything.   The very last man you hired did say he agreed there were significant issues with the painting and you complained more than I did.  \n\nWhen I'm told the walls will be painted two coats, I EXPECT two Coates.   Seems to be a theme.   I read prior yelps.\n\n I found out you were trying to sell your business to one of the men you fired.   Your business is failing because you are tired and the quality of your work  is tired.  I read your \"everybody is against me \" response... where I come from you don't make excuses, you fix the problem as if you are an adult. \n\nBtw... when you CASH THE CUSTOMER'S $11,000 CHECK... THE CUSTOMER IS RIGHT!!!!
