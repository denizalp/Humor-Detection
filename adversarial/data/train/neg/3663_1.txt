Nice people working but you spend so much time getting fitted then needed alterations when picked up. I think they are overpriced on tuxedo rentals and I didn't receive the message it was ready for pick up until two hours after I had picked up! Again very nice workers but here's the kicker- instead of leaving the $20 deposit required we paid in full. Showed up for pick up and we're told \"taxes had changed and there was a balance due of NINETEEN CENTS!!!!!\" Really? First of all, we paid in full already, second of all you couldn't pick up that amount??? The person next to me did the same and was charged THIRTEEN CENTS! That is very petty business practice!
