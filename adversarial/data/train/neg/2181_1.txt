Found these guys on Angies List..have only used them for 2 weeks. I originally called them to clean my filters and then hired them for a month of weekly cleanings. So far, so good!! Paul is very friendly, knowledgeable and always answers or returns calls promptly. We have used many pool companies in the LV area. I just wish I would have found Royal Blue years ago!!
