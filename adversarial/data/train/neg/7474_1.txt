Went to the airport to pick up my rental car which I pre-paid online called them and let them know I was going to be a little bit late he said no problem or use a Bank of America Visa card with a debit and charge capability they won't except this for payment they told me I should've read the terms and conditions of using a visa with a debit capability told run it for $5000 as a charge to secure it it's against their policy they told me to call customer service in the morning they're closed so I'm at the airport from nine at night till seven in the morning waiting for customer service so I asked for a refund it's $150 cancellation fee
