This Passport Canada is located in the strange little mall that needs to go under renovation. It seems like only all the business buildings and the people coming to get passports keep this place going. \n\nThere is underground parking, but seems a little sketchy. The best entrance is around the back. \n\nI actually came here 2 days in a row. The first time there was no line up in the initial screening and only a few people ahead of me. It was around 1pm  I waited, but my number didn't come up in time and I had to leave for an appointment. \n\nThe next day I came around 11am. There was a line up this time at the first screening. They checked my documents that I had everything and gave me a number. I waited. I estimated like last time, about 15 mins per number. But it took longer. Agents went out to lunch! About 1.5 hours later I got all my stuff done. I was just doing a simple passport application for my child. \n\nComing here expedites the passport application process, as it's done on premises. They estimated arrival in 2 weeks, but I got it in 1 week. Going to another location like College St etc, they will need to send it out to these guys and can take longer.
