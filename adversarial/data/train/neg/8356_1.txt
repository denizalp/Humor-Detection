I had high expectations for this place, but left feeling disappointed. The place itself is small and cute and it seems to be more of a take out spot.  The quality of sushi is terrible, but I should have expected that considering the price. I ordered the hakkaidon and my husband ordered the deluxe chirashi. My bowl came with salmon roe, uni and botan ebi and looked deceivingly delicious. Everything had an old fishy and bitter taste to it that I couldn't finish it. I absolutely LOVE uni and ebi, but these were of the worst quality I've ever had. This bowl was $12.99 and I should have known that it was too good to be true. My husband's chirashi was just as bad. I tried some of his salmon and scallop and I had to give it back to him. This is a place if you want cheap sushi that tastes cheap. Thinking about my experience makes me nauseous that I don't think I will be back.
