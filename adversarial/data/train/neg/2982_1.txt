Believe me this place is outstanding with great ambiance and the hospitality is top notch. Our server(sorry forgot the name) recommended the standouts of chica and they all were truly amazing.\nMy wife ordered a ice coffee and he customized it as per our choice which doesn't happen anywhere at a place like this. \nWe gotta give it for their drinks, chipotle chicken omelette 5* for this alone, Hash and eggs.\nThey have unique combination of sweet corn pancakes and I think it is the house special. \nA great Sunday brunch for us in Vegas and I recommend this place to everyone staying anywhere in the strip.
