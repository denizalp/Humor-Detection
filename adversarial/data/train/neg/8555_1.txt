Visited during CES and was so amazed by how fast the baristas were able to serve customers - I seriously have never seen lines at Starbucks that long in my whole life.\n\nGiven how many people were waiting in line, I was pleasantly surprised at how fast I received my order.\n\nThere was a bit of confusion at the pick up counter area but it was simply because there were so many people in such a small spot. \n\nI agree with another reviewer - this location for sure has the coolest Starbucks sign I have ever seen!
