I'm not a Golfer and only go to a Driving Range when friends ask, this place however is quite awesome! Its a ton of fun and the service is great. If you can make it in the mornings then the prices are much better and the place is a bit more quite, great for families. I recommend staying away at night thou! Yes its a bit more pricey at night but thats not the real turn off, its so insanely busy that your only option is to wait at the bar while having a drink or two before a lane opens, which I guess is not a bad way to start your night at TopGolf.
