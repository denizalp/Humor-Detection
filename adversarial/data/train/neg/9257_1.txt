Great little gem.  Husband and wife owned sushi spot.  Prices are so reasonable, excellent place for lunch.  Sometimes I have been here and was the only person in the restaurant, but don't let that fool you, the fish is fresh.  My favorite is the jalape√±o tuna sashimi.  Only downside is they don't serve alcohol, but that doesn't bother me.  Check out the Japanese bakery just a few doors down if you want to continue the feast.
