Absolute worst tropical smoothie in town. I don't know who owns this place but they need to read their reviews and make some changes. Im surprised this place isn't out of business already. EVERY experience here is horrible. Costumer service, HORRIBLE. You will be the only one in the drive through and it takes 5-10 minutes for someone to acknowledge you. Another 15 minutes to get your smoothie. The convince of a drive through is meaningless if it takes 20 minutes per car. This place isn't worth it. Find another location.  Service is a joke.
