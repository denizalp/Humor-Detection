I am not sure if I caught this on a bad day but I have to say that my experience puts Wok of Fame as one of the bottom of the barrel paces to get Chinese food.  I went on a Friday for lunch which you would think would be pretty busy seeing as there are a lot of businesses in the area.  I was quite excited as I hadn't been to a Chinese buffet in quite a while.  Although the selection of actual Chinese food isn't as extensive as some places there is much more selection combines with all the other choices.  At the hot table most of the plates were almost empty but none the less there was enough to fill my plate.  What little food that was left was super hot and seemed fresh.  My second round I approached the wok station.  I filled my plate with the raw ingredients then passed them to the chef.  Al though I chose the sauce my plate seemed a bit tasteless.  My noodles were way over cooked, my veggies under cooked and my meat was rubbery.  I barely made it through half the plate and left the rest for garbage.  My third visit to the buffet brought me to the sushi.  Oh how I was excited for sushi.  I grabbed multiple pieces of various different kinds of sushi.  My first choices was the chicken maki roll.  Well ive had my fair share of sushi and the chicken that they used was chicken salad as you would put in a sandwich.  It was horrible.  The rest of the sushi was super hard as it seemed like it had been sitting out for quite a while.  Another epic fail.  So I resulted to salad and of course most of the lettuce was brown and wilted but was able to find enough to fill my plate.  I really hope that I caught Wok of Fame on a bad day because if they keep this up they will scare away all customers.
