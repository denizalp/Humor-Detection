There is no such thing as sandwich artist. Give it up, Subway! They are students who barely know how to make a sandwich.\n\nOwners don't hire enough people during rush hour, everything is a rush, which effects quality of food\/sandwiches. \n\nThe food is sometimes fresh, and I recently noticed some of their toppings are frozen (tomatoes, cucumbers to name a few), even ones they put on your sandwiches! During my last visit, they put frozen slices of cucumber in my sandwich.\n\nOwners do not care anymore. \n\nMediocre food, Mediocre store, convenient location.
