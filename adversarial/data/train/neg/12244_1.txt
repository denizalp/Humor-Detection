I had an Hydrotherapy session for the first time some time ago and it was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had.\nSo relaxing, different and much better than any other therapy or relaxation experience I had in the past.\nMy body was totally relaxed and pampered, my mind flew to a different world...\n\nI would definitely recommend it to everybody :)\nI also got one of the MARGOA's Hammock, they are totally awesome !
