Blue Dog RV is by far the finest RV dealer in Las Vegas. If you want a no pressure sales experience with an honest and respectful young man ask for Nelson. He took care of me all thru my sales process and beyond. He's the best. After the sale you'll find a dealership that stands behind their products and their customer. Tim in the service department stepped up and went above and beyond for me when I found myself in a tough spot and I will not forget what he did to assist me. Thanks Nelson and Tim.... you guys have earned a friend and a customer for years to come.
