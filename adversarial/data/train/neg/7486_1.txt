This location just opened today and they were giving away free car washes to test run their system. It's a pretty good car wash and it's self serve. I received the full service that washes the undercarriage and gives you a hot wax at the end of the wash. \nThe experience is pretty cool. As you're going through the wash, you get to enjoy a light show with blue, green and red lights. The system is pretty loud so if you have young children who might scare easily, you may want to give them some headphones before you go through the wash. At the end, there are free vaccums you can use to vaccum out your car. \nOverall it was a good wash experience.
