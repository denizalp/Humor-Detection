I love going here to play pool and having a couple of drinks. I have never had an issue and the drinks are really good. Whenever I want to go out and have a good time, I suggest Mill Cue Club. My fiance and I had our first date here and have been coming back every since.\n\nI love going on Sundays because it is only $4.00\/hr all day to play pool. It is usually not that busy either. If it is, I still have not had to wait too long for a table. The drink specials are really good too. I kind of have an obsession with one of the pictures on the wall too. Random I know but I always take the table that is next to that picture.\n\nI do try to avoid it on Friday and Saturday nights though because it gets so packed that you can't move.
