(4.5 Stars) My husband and I are lucky enough that our jobs take us to many of the fine dining restaurants on the Strip and this food quality is on par with them. We decided to try the vegan options (Impossible burger and Moussaka). The Impossible burger was amazing! The Moussaka had delicate pieces in between that made the dish. They also have some handmade (non-alcohol) drinks that are quite tasty! The service was friendly and prompt. Personally, I'd rebrand it (atmosphere, logo, etc.) a bit and I'd think it could push more notoriety, word of mouth, and traffic. Nonetheless, if you want a fine dining meal quality at a good price and friendly smile, great place!
