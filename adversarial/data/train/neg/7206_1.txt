Sorry but I'm about done with Goodwills in the greater Charlotte area. No sales, no clearance, usually not that clean, most of the time there are very long lines for the checkouts, the stores are small and the items are crammed on the shelves, and they're items are overpriced and rising!! That definitely applied to this location.
