Both this location and the location on Durango are  the only people I'll trust with my eyebrows! Everyone at the Durango location is great, but I live closer to this one and recently discovered it. I've been here a couple times so far and have always been happy with my eyebrows. The entire place is nice and clean, which is always a plus. And I highly recommend the brow gel they sell here. They actually listen to exactly what you want and do it, as opposed to just doing what they want or think would look good :)
