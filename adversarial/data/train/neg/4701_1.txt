Wanted my fist real sushi experience to be good sushi. So here it is, they are wonderful! I had the oasis roll which was not bad and my friend had the Las Vegas roll which was breaded and just so good! Although I wasn't a complete fan of my option, the cook was kind enough to offer us a free Harumi sushi roll per he made an extra. It was very good. He also advised that if I didn't like the cucumber; which I think was soaked in a type of vinegar-that I have the option of asking for a soy wrapping. I will definitely return to this place again. They were so nice and helpful. Service was just great.
