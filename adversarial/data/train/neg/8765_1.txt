This restaurant is a sister restaurant to the famous Ding Tai Fung at First Markham Place. In comparison, I prefer Xiao Long Bao because it is more spacious and the impression is that it is cleaner.\n\nFood wise, I would recommend the classic xiao long bao itself. The food is definitely comparable to Ding Tai Fung. Xia long bao portion is decent and all has soup inside the bun. Next thing I would recommend is Beef Noodle Soup (BNS). BNS noodle is thick and texture is firm. I personally prefer thicker and firm noodles because it has fewer chance of being soggy. \n\nLast dish I would recommend is \"Long Chao Shou\", which is spicy dry wonton. The specialty of this food is that it has the spicy touch to the wonton that we normally eat. Definitely worth a try.
