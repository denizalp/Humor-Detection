I went with a friend last week and I ordered the fish cevice in the hopes of something fresh and bursting with lime and maybe a little spicy... I was a bit disappointed as it seemed more salty than fragrant. My friend had the fish stew and that was very well balanced. Also I ordered the cevice as an appetizer and found it gigantic. I would have liked to get half of it for half the price that would have been perfect.
