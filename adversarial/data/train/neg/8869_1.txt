Dr. Ismael is an excellent cardiologist. He is multiple board certified in cardiology, nuclear medicine and internal medicine. I have not felt rushed while talking to him and he seems very thorough, always asking if I have any questions. All of his staff has been very nice during my visits. Sienna Cardiology also does most of their tests in-house (Treadmill, echogram, nuclear stress test). \n\nThe reason I am giving 4 stars is 2 of my 3 appt's I was seen more than 30 mintures past my scheduled time. Dr Ismael did have an emergency for one of them but just seemed very busy on the first visit. I highly recommend him for his expertise in everything to do with the heart.
