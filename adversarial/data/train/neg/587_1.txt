Stopped here on 9\/28 for a wedding rehearsal dinner.\n\nOur party had the upstairs dining room to ourselves, which was lovely. I loved the atmosphere of this place. It definitely have the vintage-feel and is very casual and romantic.\n\nOur wedding party chose the chicken marsala with green beans and red potatoes, as well as a beef stir fry and a pasta with their homemade red sauce.\n\nI caught a great glimpse of the downstairs dining area when we walked in; I fell in love with it. Dim lights, chandeliers adorning the bar that were made of glass bottles, and every employee had a shining smile on their face.\n\nI will definitely be back to try the bar-side instead of the private-party side :)
