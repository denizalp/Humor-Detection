I won't waste time repeating everything everyone else has already said.  It's all true.  If I didn't live in a place where there is only one other choice of airline for most destinations, I'd never fly Allegiant again. BTW- if you choose a rental car with your tickets, be aware, there are a lot of hidden\/excess costs in that.  In Vegas, we were charged 30% more than the original price for taxes, fees, etc.
