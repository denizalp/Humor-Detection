As if I thought the BofA was bad in the same parking lot!  This place is a joke!  Not only do I have to walk through a cloud of smoke from their employees outside smoking, but the service is third world!\n\nNSF fees from fraudulent transactions and they refuse to refund!  Well, I guess no more Wells Fargo account!  I swear this bank could care less about its members!  Stay away!  Stay far away!
