Mirage buffet.  \nWe ate here on a Tuesday on a 2 for 1 coupon, $32.  Got the coupon from playing an iPhone game, myVEGAS.   As far as buffets go, this is my favorite.  Food is varied and has more of the assortment I like (Texan, more beef less Asian,fish crapola).  Food was also very good.  You get drinks with your meal...like beer, wine.\n\nWe showed up again for breakfast on a Saturday.  2 for 1 coupon again but on the weekends, they serve brunch.  $39 with the coupon.  Breakfast was good. Hard to go for crab legs at 9 in the morning though.  Brunch is basically all the foods they serve during the day plus breakfast and a higher price.\n\nWe'll eat here again but not on a weekend.
