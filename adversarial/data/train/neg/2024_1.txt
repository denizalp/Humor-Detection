I enjoyed my 4 night stay at this hotel.  We were treated well during the check-in process and it felt like a nice home-away-from-home.  While it was extremely cold outside, it was nice and warm inside.  The room was big and we had a decent view of downtown Montreal.  The location was great since one could walk to most of the downtown attractions and very close to Old Montreal.  \n\nI would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Montreal.
