Sweet god, the burnt almond torte. I live out of town now and still dream about it (and I make trips there anytime I'm home and in Shadyside). Gah! It's that good. Nothing compares (you KNOW it's going to be good when the box weighs about 5 pounds). I haven't tried the travel version with pastry cream instead of custard, but trust me, the custard is worth it. The cookies are excellent, too -- particularly the butter cookies and hamentashens -- as are the cupcakes, but the almond torte is a must.
