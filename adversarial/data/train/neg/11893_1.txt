I usually try to stop by here every time I am in Vegas. This joint is located in  Mandalay Bay across the way from the House of Blues. I love coming to RM Seafood for some pretty decent dishes along with very good service.\n\nIn particular, I love the burger and the 16 flavor frozen dessert guessing game. I have not come here for the upstairs dinner, so I cannot comment on that. The sushi is okay, in comparison to other restaurants in the area...not the be all end all of sushi.
