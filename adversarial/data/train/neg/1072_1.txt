I've given this place multiple chances and each have come up short. The service is always slow, even when the place isn't busy. The servers are friendly and their pajama uniforms are fun, but it doesn't make up for lack of service and sub par food. The food is overpriced in my opinion, and either too seasoned or totally bland. After many attempts to get a timely, good meal here, I have given up.
