I like this gas station come here all the time, but was taken aback tonight with the attitude I got from asking a simple question. Richard had no right to talk down to me. If I'm asking the question obviously I don't know the answer that doesn't mean I'm stupid and I shouldn't be talked to in that way.... Especially at a gas station! I will continue to shop here but have had the glass shattered about the people that work here.
