When we were not able to get our dog into the first Vet we had scheduled with- after taking off work it was important for us to try to get her in somewhere. We were not able to get in the other place we checked so when we passed by Camelback Animal Hospital and decided to call to try to get in. We believe it was one of those things that really fell like it was meant to be.\n\nThe minute we called, they told us they could work us in. There was a slight gap between patients and we were able to drive right over that minute. They worked us in almost immediately and were so nice in doing so as the front desk girl was great and caring! After being taken back to the room, we first met with Miguel. He was fantastic! He was caring and helpful in gathering all the information he could about what we thought might be wrong with our dog. He was extremely gentle with our finicky dog and was sensitive to our all natural, non-pharmaceutical preferences and suggested a few natural remedies for our concerns. When our dog normally has to be muzzled, Miguel decided against it so not to give her more anxiety and fear.\n\nDr. Cruz was just as gentle and sweet. He really took the time to hear out all of our concerns and all of our observances. Even the stuff we thought they wouldn't care about, the details, he listened to intently. The plan of action he gave us was not only fairly priced, but he so graciously gave us a route that we could try, sensitive to budget.\n\nEven though we got in last minute the exam was regular price and priced competitively with other vets in the area. We were so impressed and plan on making the drive over to see Dr. Cruz in the future, even though we are moving to Avondale soon. We loved Dr. Druz, but the most important part- our dog, Sophi loved Dr. Cruz!
