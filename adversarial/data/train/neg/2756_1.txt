While driving around the area, I noticed a sign for The Bake House saying that they are distributors for the Cheesecake Factory.  I have always wanted to try some of their famous cheese cakes but never wanted to go all the way to Buffalo to indulge in it.  What to do to?  Go to The Bake House of course!\n\nLocated in an industrial area, The Bake House is a wholesaler that is now open to the public.  They supply Cheesecake Factory cakes to restaurants in the area as well as Dream Factory cupcakes, daily baked in store macaroons and some other specialty baked goods.  This review is for the cheesecakes only.\n\nThe Cheesecake Factory cakes come in 6 inch, and 10 inches sizes as well as a mixed flavoured combination cake. \n\nYou can only buy whole cakes and not individual slices.  The cakes are shipped and stored frozen in a freezer so just keep then there till you need to thaw it out.  The 6 inch cakes are not pre-cut so you have thaw the entire cake at once.  The 10 inch and mixed selection cakes are pre-cut and individually wrapped so they can be removed and thawed individually.  Do note, the slices are not the size of the restaurant slices but more of the traditional sized slices which is a good thing:)\n\nIf you never had a Cheesecake Factory cheesecake then I definitely would recommend the \"Grand Selections\" which is 2 slices each of the most popular flavours (White Chocolate Raspberry, Chocolate Mousse, Snickers Bar Chunks and Strawberry topped Original).\n\nI am very curious to come back some and try some of the other flavours as well as the cupcakes and in-store baked macaroons.  The owners of the store are very pleasant to deal with and talk to. \n\nSo sorry Buffalo, NY.. but I think I'll be visiting you a lot less these days...found another way to get my Cheesecake Factory fix!
