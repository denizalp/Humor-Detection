I was recommended by my good friend. It was delicious, healthy and beautiful food. Make sure to make a reservation - and keep in mind that this place opens for dinner. Order the specials because it is tasty and you cannot go wrong with what is recommended for the day. I had lamb, and another dish with pomegranate. It was well made and it looks like something that's made for a special person :) good food, happy stomach! \n\n+good for taking your teacher out for thank you!
