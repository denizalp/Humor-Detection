Delicious. Love This Place. I go there when I want to spend a little bit more and want something other man my $1 pasta at home. I would give it 4 stars for the portion size; because they could add a little bit more to some portions (Pasta in particular) I always eat it up and ask for a little more bread to fill completely up before I get dessert for my second stomach ^_^ Great Place!
