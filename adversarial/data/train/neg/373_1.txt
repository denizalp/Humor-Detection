The food was delicious! We had the mac and cheese for an appetizer and we were blown away with how yummy it was! I had the French toast of the day which was strawberry cream and it was huge! My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito and he finished all of it! The food was amazing the reason I rated it a four was because we were literally forgotten about by our server. I ordered a drink and it never came until I had to ask another server about it. Good customer service is what makes the best dining experience and I just wasn't as happy with the experience as I could have been if we had actually had attention paid to us
