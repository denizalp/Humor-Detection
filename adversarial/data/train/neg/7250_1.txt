I am writing a review trying to reach out to the manager to ask what kind of moscato you guys serve. I was in there a few weeks ago with my friends and we ordered a 75.00 dollar bottle of moscato and the server had told us it is the only one you have. I am curious to know the name. Best moscato I've ever had!
