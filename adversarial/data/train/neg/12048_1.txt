Lively music, great atmosphere & food was as good as expected, had a delicious Caesar Salad with a crunchy cheese cracker topping starter. Crisp and fresh. James had Chili with jalape√±o Cornbread muffin that he would not share! I'm guessing it was delicious!\n\nI will never know...\n\nWe both had the 10oz flat iron steak with delicious fire roasted smokey veggies and fries... Not sure exactly why the veggies were used as a bed for the fries.... But it was all yum.\n\nMy steak was cooked to perfection at my melt in my mouth juicy tasty Med Well. \n\nJames' steak suffered an accidental overdose of seasoning that was pretty salty... \n\nI did have a slight fake cough when I tried a bite of his steak since I though mine was super yum and he was not very impressed with his seasoning... There was a very clear unfortunate difference between the 2 steaks that should have only differed by the amount of cooking time...\n\nAll around about what I expected the dining experience to be.\n\nGreat atmosphere, vibrant and we'd certainly be back for more...\n\nOne thing that did annoy me was the discrepancy between the online menu regarding a special offer that apparently was different as described and then the Store manager arguing his point regardless of what the online menu said...\n\nIt's one glass of wine... Not like we're trying to get a free rib eye dinner, seriously, just come the stupid glass of wine....
