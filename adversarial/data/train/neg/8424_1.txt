Wouldn't recommend CORE. Had surgery on foot and calf from Dr Jeppesen. Front desk and surgical scheduling  staff were fantastic. The Dr and his PA are rude and unattentive. Dr's manner was always demeaning and dismissive after surgery. Dr didn't address concerns or care well. All visits were short and hurried. Dr always acted as if he had somewhere else to be. Unfortunately I had an fall 6 weeks post surgery. Dr never xrayed or ulrasounded leg muscle that I was obviously re-injured only did visual. The area of leg injured is within 2 inches of calf surgery location and still  has bulge. It is still difficult to bend that leg and walk any amount if distance. I've also had to call and leave multiple  messages for PA - Catherine to request and ankle splint, that Dr recommended. She returned one call, but never received splint nor return call of where to pickup splint in over a month. Has been 4 1\/2 months since surgery and foot and leg are at about 60% per physical therapist. Will NOT be returning to this Dr or facility.
