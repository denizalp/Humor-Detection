I had my car cleaned and ate lunch.  My car was cleaned well however it was missing the cover to the charging unit in the center console when I was retuned to me.  I did not notice this until later in the day and called.  A younger girl answered my call and told me she would get a manager.  Then she returned to take a message and assured me someone would get back to me that evening or the next morning.  I have yet to receive a call.  I am now left with trying to replace this part for myself.  I asked the girl for the car vacuum debris to be gone through to see if it got sucked up in there- and she said she couldn't make any promises.  So- my loss I suppose- but I don't enjoy now having to replace the part myself, and having paid them to lose a car part.  Additionally- my lunch was OK- it has been better before and my fries were lukewarm\/cold.  All said and done I spent about $35 for lunch, a clean car, and now a missing part.
