Our go-to-dim sum resto in Scarb. Seriously the cheapest and most decent dim sum places are in Scarb. You get your not so fancy Chinese restaurant at reasonable prices and the food is decent quality. This place goes by size for their pricing but is on the lower end compared to other places. I think $2.10 for a small, $2.40 for a medium and $2.70 for a large so you can easily get 10 dishes for 2 people for about $30 depending on what you order. I like how they don't have the pushing carts because the food is fresher and they come out all at once. Parking lot is always full since they share it with other restaurants\/services so make sure you come earlier for lunch kr dinner.
