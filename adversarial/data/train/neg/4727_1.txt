This stuff is terrible. I tried their blueberry and strawberry yogurt parfait and the blueberries had gone bad. Lovely. Tried their southwest veggie salad which promises chopped hearts of romaine (in reality- iceberg which has zero nutritional value) Monterey Jack cheese(which was completely missing from my salad) and chopped red onion (which is huge chunks of white onion). If that weren't bad enough, the salad dressing tastes like cold condensed Campbell's tomato soup. F*^%!+% disgusting.
