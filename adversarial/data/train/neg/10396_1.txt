Scott is passionate about leather. He is very knowledgeable and thorough. He takes the the time to explain everything he is going to do so you know what to expect. For our chair, he restored the leather and also changed the color. He took the time while we were there to blend a custom color and made sure we were happy with it. We are so pleased with his work that we are actually having another chair done. Thank you Scott!
