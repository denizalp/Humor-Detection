I had the worst mozzarella sticks of my life at Road Side pub. $10+tax for 8 tiny flavour less bread crumbs. Road side pub clearly buys the cheapest no name mozzarella sticks from a grocery store and jacks the price way up.\n\nAnd the savages brought salsa as dipping sauce instead of marinara or ranch! Truly abhorrent.
