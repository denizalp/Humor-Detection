First time coming here. I have been on a fish taco kick lately and noticed they served them so decided to try them out. I read some bad reviews so was skeptical but came anyway and I'm glad I did. I went through the drive-thru, service was quick, the woman who took my order and handed me my food was very pleasant and nice, the rice and beans portions were perfect. The tacos tasted fantastic. The only thing I'd change would be the size of the fish, it was on the small side or maybe add in a third taco, but other than that this place is great. Armando's will become a regular lunch stop for me!
