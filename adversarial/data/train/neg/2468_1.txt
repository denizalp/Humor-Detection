Pizza is a subjective thing. What I like you might not. For me, an important distinction in good pizza is the quality and taste of the dough. And while East Coast Pizza isn't the best I've ever had, it is very good and I'm glad it's nearby. They've got some creative toppings to offer, too, though I usually stick with a plain cheese pizza because I enjoy the crust so much. \n\nThey also make a very good Greek salad. \n\nPeople who work there are friendly and pleasant and I often see the owner, too. When ownership cares enough to be there, the experience and the product is usually much better. \n\nI'm a regular customer and I certainly recommend East Coast Pizza.
