I stumbled across this place after shopping at Trader Joe's.  I took home a turkey panini, a piece of cheese cake and 2 spinach puff pastries.  Loved every bite!  The panini was enough for 2 people.  It came with a delicious salad and was very good.  The puff pastries were nice and so was the cheese cake.  I want to go there for breakfast.  Great place!
