Staff was friendly and attentive. I ordered the oysters which where pretty good. My fried tasted crispy but my sliders were overcooked as where my friends chicken he ordered. It was absurdly loud with all the men cheering and shouting each time some character ran to the other side of the field on their TV show. It's really hot here in Phoenix so apparently the uniform here is very heat driven. Had an ok time but they should turn down the TV or just turn it off. It makes the other customers go crazy.
