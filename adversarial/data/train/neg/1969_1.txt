This is the only dentist place I would go to in Las Vegas! Being from out of town, I checked Dr. Poremba out based on a co-worker's recommendation. They get you in in a timely manner, the front staff is always very friendly and professional, the atmosphere is very calm and pleasing and Dr. Poremba is very knowledgeable. I always felt taken care of and he is very gentle but thorough with his work. I've never had a better dentist and have recommended this place to other new co-workers and they all love it!
