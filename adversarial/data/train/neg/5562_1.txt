I purchased a Groupon for this company knowing that my vents were in need of a good cleaning.  Bill and Steve arrived on time.  They were both extremely thorough going over my system and pointing out several things like mold.  They went a step further and figured out how and why i had mold in my system.  I had a clog in my AC condensation line which was causing water to leak and pool and my line wasn't draining properly.  Steve went over all my options on correcting the issue.  I did purchase additional services to sanitize the system.  They both worked quickly and were professional.  I would recommend this company and would hire them again.
