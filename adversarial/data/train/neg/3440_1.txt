Friendly staff, good food and a great happy hour in an awesome modern atmosphere. I've been coming here from about a year and every time I do the food is great. They take classics Mexican cuisine and put a modern twist on it to make it fresh and pleasing.  Plus the chef visits the tables to insure everything was great tasting.
