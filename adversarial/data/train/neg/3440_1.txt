Great breakfast spot!! We aren't usually on this side of town but since we were, we wanted to take advantage of a finding local spot (thanks to Yelp). This one did not disappoint. \n\nCozy, family atmosphere. Not too crowded - about 1\/2 the tables wwre full at 10:30 on a Friday. Reasonable prices especially for the amnt of food you get. We both coyld only finish half of our meals.  Our server was friendly & very attentive. \n\nI had the Spicy Tortilla. Amazing! My husband had the Huevos Rancheros. Equally amazing!   The Southwest Chicken Fried Steak looked wonderful and that is what I'm getting my nxt visit. Yes, we will be back! I highly recommend this place for breakfast!!
