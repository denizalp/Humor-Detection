Having been here for the $10 lunch buffet and dinner the impression I got was it's just okay. There's so many reviews on this place already I'm not sure what to write about that hasn't been said before. The parking here is nice and large, which is good since it can get super crowded. Inside you might have to wait a while for a table on busy dinner nights, but lunch is pretty fast seating.\n\nThe lunch buffet is satisfying and cheap. Since this is so close to where I work a lot of us end up here for a quick sushi fix. They seem to change around a few menu items every day for lunch so you won't be too bored if you come often.\n\nThe dinner rush is a totally different atmosphere than the daytime. Walked in to booming music, chefs and waiters cheering on sake bombs, pounding on tables, and people trying to be loud enough to have a conversation at their tables. I guess I've gotten old because it wasn't very appealing to me, I prefer sushi in a more toned down environment. The rolls themselves were cheap and some flavor combinations turned out pretty good. There seems to be a lot of fried rolls drenched in mayo and sriracha though. The food seemed to come out in a timely manner even though the place was crowded that night, and we even got some free rolls and dessert!\n\nWell this place's sushi isn't the best but it's convenient for me and cheap. The service is friendly and fast so when I just need a quick bite I think I'll head to Ru San's, but for a nice night out I think I'll pass.
