I have very difficult hair therefore I hate getting my haircut.  I was on a vacation in Vegas and stumbled upon this place and made a last minute day of appointment.   Trevor was amazing! I told him I wanted to keep my hair long but let him do what he thought was best.  I love my new hair cut and am so bummed I don't live close by to go again.
