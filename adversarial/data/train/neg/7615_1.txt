Decided to give this place a second chance despite our disappointing first impressions. Boy, are we glad we did. The menu seems to have been entirely revamped and the restaurant has come a long way albeit in a short while. I had the lamb and my friend had the ribs. They were done exactly how we wanted it and the portions were very generous. Service, like our previous visit, was very friendly and quick. The prices are a bit overpriced. Nonetheless, we'll probably be making it back again.
