Love my Salad and Go!  Great selection of food, fast service, friendly staff.  I go at least once per week, and I think I maybe once had a problem with my order which they quickly fixed.  New items added to the menu which are nice.  And the craziest part, they're working on lowering their already very reasonable prices.  A company that actually cares about their customers, nice!
