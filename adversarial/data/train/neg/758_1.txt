It's possible that this is the WORST carl's Jr in their system. They hire punk foul mouth kids with no sense of professionalism. \n\nTheir drive through window is the worst because their speaker doesn't work nor does the person who listens to the order listen to what you say. You'll end up repeating yourself multiple times and only getting the wrong order.\n\nWe went into complain after going through the drive-through and the manager said it's not his fault that his employee swore at us because they got frustrated.\n\nI wrote to  Carl's Jr. corporate about this and I have yet to get a response. This shows that it's beyond this location and actually extends to Carl's Jr. corporate office as well. \n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid this at all costs
