After a busy month of relocating from out-of-state in my third trimester of pregnancy, I scheduled an appointment with Paradise Valley OB-Gyn. I was a little uncomfortable that the earliest appointment they could schedule me was 3 weeks-out, but felt relieved that I found a doctor as I was already 33 weeks along in my pregnancy.\n\nFast forward 3 weeks, I am now 36 weeks along in my pregnancy, and arrive for my appointment with Paradise Valley OB-Gyn. While filling-out my new patient paper work, the staff advised me that they could no longer see me because they have not obtained my medical records. They tried to pass the buck on my old insurance carrier, Kaiser, but it was very clear that Paradise Valley had trying to submit the medical records request while I was in the waiting area. Had they done their due diligence, the records would have been obtained in a timely manner and\/or notified me of anything that could delay my service.\n\nAfter some back-and-forth with the staff, they advised me that I was now too far along in my pregnancy and they would no longer attend me at their practice. They gave me a little pat-on-the back and sent me on my way.\n\nTheir inefficiencies and non-transparency cost me a month of lost time in finding a doctor who could prepare me for delivery. Now, at a time when I should be seen on a weekly basis, have no OB Gyn, and have been left searching for a provider all due to their lack of organization.\n\nThank you, Paradise Valley OB Gyn, for leaving a 36 week pregnant woman without care.
