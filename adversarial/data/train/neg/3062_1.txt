I have been to many dealerships in my life (51 yrs)  and I went into Berge Mazda with the same expectations. That I would be followed around and pestered and get annoyed with the sales staff. But, holy Crap, what happened? I was greeted by Cyndy, she introduced herself and pointed out where each model of the Mazda CX line were located and then she backed off. Right then I was like, HUH? Hahaha that's it ? That's when I felt like ok, this isn't so bad here. I asked to see a certain CX9 that I found online and longer story short. She explained everything in the vehicle, explained the difference In other competitors models, explained warranty and financing and didn't once make me feel pressured or annoyed. After deciding to buy that one vehicle I found, it was the fastest, smoothest and easiest vehicle transaction I have ever had. They got me to my price and monthly payment that I was super happy with, every aspect of this transaction was so easy. \n  Look for Cyndy, and I promise you will be treated like you should be. I just can't say enough about how perfect this experience was. \nThank you Cyndy and the finance crew and Berge Mazda. I highly recommend this dealership. \nAnd the CX9? AMAZING.......
