4.5\n\nPros:\nVery well done Korean cuisine\nFriendly service\n\nCons:\nNo steamed ribs available (very minor issue)\n\nThis place is a hidden gem and I have Yelp to thank for me finding it.  Jung Soo Ne is an excellent Korean restaurant that should be on every Korean cuisine's lovers list. Honestly, if they had any rendition of steamed beef ribs (my go to order at Korean restaurants), it would easily have been a 5.  \n\nThis place has a very homey feel to it.  It's a very comfortable setting to have a meal in.  As you can see from my picture of the interior, they probably have kept those street light fixtures from the previous business.  It stands out a little bit and is something you notice throughout your meal.\n\nWe ordered the gamjatang, galbitang and a seafood noodle.  Each order comes with 6 very well prepared side dishes.  I only wished the kimchi was cut into smaller pieces as they don;t give you any scissors to do so yourself.  The food comes out boiling hot as you can see from my pics.  They are very well made.  I loved the broth in my galbitang and the beef was basically fall off the bone tender.  The gamjatang was great as well, I felt there was a bit of sweetness to the soup.  It wasn't my all time favourite, but it was definitely up there.  The noodle soup was also very good.  The broth is very rich and they give you a ton of noodles.  The portion of seafood is also very good for the price you're paying.\n\nService here was very good throughout our visit.  English is definitely not their first language but they did a great job and were very friendly.  They were very accommodating to any needs we had for our little one as well.  \n\nThis is already now one of my go to Korean restaurants in the area.  I will definitely be back and I recommend this place to everyone who loves Korean cuisine.
