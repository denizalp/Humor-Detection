I'll freely admit that my interest in this place was piqued due to the various ads around Venetian featuring a most-interesting-man-in-the-world lookalike holding a cat.  Well played, marketers.\n\nThe Dorsey has become my favorite lazy afternoon destination on the Strip. In fact, since I've never actually been here in the evening, I have no idea how crowded or loud it gets later on....I've only ever seen this place about 30% full.\n\nAs others have noted, it's a gorgeous space that somehow feels very separate from the casino floor just outside...especially in the library area, which, on a Sunday afternoon, feels like your own private first class airport lounge, complete with cozy leather couches & chairs, steam-and-LED fireplace and an eclectic assortment of books.  This is the kind of place you go after you've had too many consecutive late nights and just want to chill in a beautiful room with some amazing cocktails. You might even fall asleep.\n\nThe house penicillin is first-rate, and the Japanese whisky-and-chocolate-bitters Harajuku is dark and mysterious.  The last time I was here, my group of four ordered the $90 Green Street, a vodka\/lime\/cucumber\/apple\/mint punch bowl served in a gigantic copper flamingo.  It's a tremendously refreshing, perfect-for-a-summer-afternoon libation that didn't run out until each of us had sipped our way through three servings.  Not a terrible deal for the equivalent of nine drinks!\n\nMany others have noted the slow service.  I've actually *appreciated* the lazy pace of the service here in the afternoons, since my group is usually deep in conversation or exploring the surrounding bookshelves of bizarre literature.  But when the pace picks up in the evenings, the pace of the service should as well....and it sounds like that's not happening.  But until I experience it for myself, The Dorsey is still five.
