Their food is bar none.. A bit pricey but so worth it especially if you miss the east coast experience.. Irene a lovely woman from Greece was exceptionally sweet and courteous and in my opinion should be a waitress..not a busperson.. The same can not be said for Debra our waitress ..she was non-professional, short and at times right out rude. Otherwise I can only say.. This place is a gem.. Go and try it!!!
