What is wrong with this company? I provided my address to them three times. They have elected to turn my outstanding balance of $9.70 over to collection. They have never billed me to my correct address or tried to call me. It appears they had me mixed up with someone else. If they can't use the address I provided what does this tell you about other services they provide. I am told to keep calling back.
