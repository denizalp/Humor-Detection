As someone who is obsessed with make up when I heard The Makeup Shack was coming to Las Vegas I was ecstatic. The location is out of the way for me, but it was definitely worth going to. When I walked in I was greeted by a very welcoming staff. Everyone in the store was quick to ask if I needed help finding anything. I have been needing to get KoKo lashes and was super excited when I heard The Makeup Shack carried this brand. I looked around the store trying to find them, but unfortunately I was told they no longer carried KoKo lashes. The girl helping me showed me a dupe lash that was really similar to the style I liked. I love that the store carries brands that Sephora and Ulta don't carry, so I was able to try out new products I haven't been able to get before. The lash section of this store is insane. They have so many lashes ranging from $1-around $20. I'm really excited to try them out! They also sell mirrors and ring lights. If you are a make up lover, it's definitely worth going to!
