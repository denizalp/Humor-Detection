You know it is very hard to find a auto dealer who actually does what he says he will do.  I just traded in a car and bought a new one from Daniel at LVAS and he has done for me every item he said he would take care of for me on the new car.  they got me a good interest rate also.  You know I think they are very honest, I never said that before about a car dealer!\nGo see Daniel if you are looking for a car . No high pressure sales here!!
