Sprague Drug is a tiny little pharmacy that I frequent quite often.  It is right across the street from my office, so whenever life throws me a curveball (such as a new pair of shoes giving me blisters, or I have run out of bus passes, or I absolutely without question, need a diet Orange Crush, and it is 4 p.m.), it is easy and convenient to just pop across the street.\n\nIt does not have the selection of pharmacy items like the big pharmacy's, such as Shoppers or Super Drug Market, but for a small store, I have never walked out empty handed, if I entered the store to solve any type of \"pharmacy related problem\", like the ones listed above.    \n\nWhat I think is kinda cool about this little place is that they have a number of inexpensive gifts as well, such as $10 - $20 water fountains, and even some logo'ed hockey swag as two random examples.  there are a few shelves of random, varied gifts.  At Christmas, I bought my room mate a $4.99 sea monkey aquarium as a stocking stuffer.  Let me just clarify that I am not cheap -- it WAS a stocking stuffer, and one that made her squeal with joy!  Bad news folks... haven't seen sea monkeys in there for awhile for those of you in the market.  however, again, a random example of what I saw when I was picking up my Diet Orange Crush.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood, check it out.  It has a little bit of everything.
