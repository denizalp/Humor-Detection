Decided to visit Musee McCord on a Wednesday night when its free between 5-9pm which I'm glad I did cause when I visited there was only 3 exhibits open- Inuit Clothing exhibit, Montreal exhibit and a Grace Kelly exhibit. I just visited the Inuit and Montreal exhibits as I did not want to pay the extra charge for the Grace Kelly exhibit as I had no interest in her. The other two exhibits are good and quite interesting but I wouldn't allocate more than an hr to visit these small exhibits.\nOverall it is a fairly well done museum but as it had a whole level closed when I was there, I'm glad I did not pay the admission price.
