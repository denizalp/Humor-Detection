Came with my wife for the second time, the first time was great 4\/5 cuz of the lack of heat in winter time.\n\n2nd time we came in, the waiter told us they have a table ready for us but \"they did not hire enough waiters so we are short and will take 30mins to just take our orders\". \n\nGiven we are from Richmond hill we chose to stay, they are still using portable heaters...come on guys it's winter time lets invest in heaters. Terrible decor and seating arrangements. I feel like they got the wallpaper from Canadian tire and got their 14yr old cousin to apply to save on labour because parts are falling off. They also have the ice crusher next to a bunch of tables which is so loud that people stop conversations because it is too loud. \n\nThe food is great but that's it. You have to wait a long time for your food while your freezing inside the restaurant and look at poor decor...
