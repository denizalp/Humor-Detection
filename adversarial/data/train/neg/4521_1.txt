Eric Choo was a big help to me when I went into Audio Express. I told him what my budget was and he walked me around the store, He laid out all of my options in order to find the best sound system for my car. Against all odds, he had it installed the same day because he knew I had limited time with my crazy work schedule. I absolutely love the results of my new sound system. I would definitely recommend Eric to anyone looking for their next system. Thank you Eric!    CHAZ JESSICA, & CADE.
