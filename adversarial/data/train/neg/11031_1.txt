11:30 on Thursday through Saturday...that's when you should visit the Cellar Lounge. Billy Ray Charles and the Boys from the parking lot will play 45 min- 1hr sets till the sun rises...laid back atmosphere, unpretentious and just plain home. Fun, friendly people and great blues\/r&b band with cheap drinks and no cover. What are you waiting for?!
