I remember going to this place when it was Spicy Pickle.  We didn't know it changed to a taco shop, but decided to give it a try.  Ordered a Las Vegas burrito.  It is your standard \"California burrito\" at most other locations.  The burrito was good, pretty much what I expected.  A big burrito filled with meat, fries, cheese, and pico.  Prices are reasonable and portions are filling.  You get good value for your money.  Only complaint was it took a while to get our food.  The lunch rush is pretty brutal and the kitchen isn't really able to handle a lunch rush.  I'd recommend coming early or late and avoiding the lunch rush.
