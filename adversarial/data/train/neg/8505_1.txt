Horrrible!!! I am 7 months pregnant and my doctor is Rebecca Tyhre. Very disorganized office. Every time I would go in for my appointment Dr.Tyree always would rush out because one of her patients was in delivery. Do not go here please save your time and your money and go somewhere where they care about their patients. The workers are also very rude seems like they hate their job they should just go work somewhere else. They actually told me I couldn't return to there office anymore which was a big favor... Thank you. It was because my yelp review I gave them so they discharged me as a patient.
