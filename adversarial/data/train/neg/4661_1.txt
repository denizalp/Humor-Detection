This place has THE BEST BUN RIEU in Vegas, Henderson and North Las Vegas.  I have tried Bun Rieu at Pho Kim Long, Pho Little Saigon, Pho So 8, Pho So 1, and Pho Mai Lan and all were nothing but dissapointing.  It also has the most refreshing Durian smoothie ever.  They use real durian and condense milk, not powder and sugar.  Jenni Pho Grill has nice decor and clear glass wall kitchen so you could see kitchen staff in action.  Travis - our waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  Unlike other Vietnamese and Asian restaurants in Vegas, Jenni's restroom is clean.  We will definitely go back to try other dishes on the menu.
