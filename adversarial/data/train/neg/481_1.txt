My wife and, I visited here and loved it! Since they we're known for their Fried Chicken thats what we ordered. Huge prtions and, ate it all! Never had anything better. Went back the night before we left to do it again. Just as good. Also, there Corn side dish, wedge Salad and, signature cobbler was at the top of my suggestion also. Add a bottle of wine and, this place is a nice secret in the Venetion facility. \"Man do they kick out the chicken here!!!\"
