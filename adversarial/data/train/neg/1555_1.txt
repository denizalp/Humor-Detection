Stacy is an extremely talented hairdresser. \n\nI've been using her services for over 10 years. The first time she colored and cut my hair I could tell she was a perfectionist at her craft. She has cut, balayaged, highlighted and colored my hair. She's also given it beautiful length with extensions. \n\n5 reasons I recommend Stacy:\n\n1. She gives a relaxing shampoo.\n\n2. She re-creates color and cut ideas well.\n\n3. Her haircuts lay naturally beautiful.\n\n4. She gives a gorgeous blow-dry style.\n\n5. She's honest.
