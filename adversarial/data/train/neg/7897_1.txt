Decided to give this place a try. It's right around the corner of my house. Went in to eat and watch some football with my husband and two of our kids. There was a \"please wait to be seated\" sign. We sat there for a good 5-10 min. With the bartender talking to one of the patrons. Not one acknowledgment, or a \"be right with you\" . Big disappointment. My family really likes to support local businesses.
