Very delicious place. The Prix Fixe Menu is a good deal! I tried their pork chop dish and between that and the appetizer, this was way too much food for me (perfect for the boys though). We were here for a birthday dinner and they give a free small cake to the birthday person as well. It was a nice touch. Service was excellent.
