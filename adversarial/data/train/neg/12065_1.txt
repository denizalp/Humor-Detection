If you need a realtor, go with Sandy! She was so helpful in assisting us with our move from CA to Las Vegas. In the beginning we had no idea what area we wanted to relocate to we just knew we needed good schools for our kids. Sandy met with us over several days and drove us all over the Las Vegas valley. From Henderson to Northwest Las Vegas showing us many different areas without any hesitation. Now that we're here in Summerlin we are so thankful that we had Sandy to guide us and make our transition a smooth one! I will always refer her to anyone needing a realtor here in Vegas!
