This was a startling discovery for me. Dozens and dozens of bookcases, neatly arranged by genre, as well as a musical instrument and electronic media store, all under one roof. Add tons of ethnic and vintage jewelry, and thousands of knickknacks artfully arranged among the shelves. \nI can see myself spending a fortune here. Will come back again and again, because it smells clean and the staff is polite.
