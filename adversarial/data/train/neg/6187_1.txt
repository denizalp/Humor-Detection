It's pretty close to the convention center inside Mandalay Bay. They serve really nice dishes - we had the vegetarian taco dish and a short rib burrito special that were both awesome. The cookies and milk dessert we had was unbelievable - $6 for 6 large, delicious chocolate cookies and a cup of silky ice cream....honestly could've been twice the price and still be a good deal.
