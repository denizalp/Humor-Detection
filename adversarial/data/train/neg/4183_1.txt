Date night with the hubby at Rock of Ages was a huge success. Didn't think it would compare to some of the other shows we've seen but it was just as good if not better! We go to bed early so I was concerned about getting sleepy mid show but I could have rocked out all night long. My husband and I are 17 years apart, yet we both knew all of the songs in the show. Plenty of laughs throughout the show. No seat is a bad seat! Have fun!!!
