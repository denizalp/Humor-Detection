I cant understand why people even write negative reviews about this place. Yes, the wait is long but that is why you plan accordingly. Yes, the food is nothing special but it's still worth buying. \n\nEven if you don't don't golf, this is a fun activity. Not for serious golfers, however. This is a great change of pace from standing around a bar or club. After your done with your play time, they have an awesome game room to continue the drunken shenanigans. \n\nI never pass up a chance to go here. It is too much fun!
