Service was friendly and prompt. Location is great and the decor is fun.\n\nUnfortunately the food was sub-par and oversalted.  I had the carnitas and had to send them back to the kitchen exchange for chicken fajitas because they were so salty I couldn't stomach choking down a whole plate. The chicken fajitas were ok but rather dry. I had a strawberry frozen magarita that tasted soley like cheap tequila.\n\nI've been previously and the food was solid. So maybe the kitchen was having a bad noght.
