Normally I would have great reviews about this place but today I brought my car in to get my 10,000 mile service check and every single person I talked too was belittling me, blowing me off or acting irritated with me!! I have thousands of dollars invested in this car, you would think they could atleast fake a good attitude. I'll be honest, after today, I'll drive the extra 20 miles to a different Toyota dealership. This is your job.. I did not make you apply for your position. Therefore, treating someone with respect because they're a customer would be awesome for future reference.
