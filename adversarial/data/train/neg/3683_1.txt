If youre in the mood for waffles or a crepe then this is the place. I came from America, and wanted to try this place out because of many recommendations. I ordered the Shortcake crepe and Green Tea latte. Both were great, the latte could have been a little sweeter though. There is very limited seating in here. I had to move a table over due to more people coming in for then to do a table merge. Service is great, and the atmosphere is very relaxing.
