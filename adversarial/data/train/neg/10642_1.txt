I stumbled on the Well spa via Groupon while in Vegas.  We had stayed at the Platinum before but never gone to the spa.  This time we were at Paris and it was a quick walk away, right behind Bally's.  The spa looked to be recently renovated.  Everything was super clean, new and stylish.  The relaxation room was really nice with treats, a good beverage selection, and nice nooks with drapes for privacy.  \n\nAnother nice treat was the free use of the Platinum's pool.  It's a quiet, smaller pool but very nice.  It's a good relaxing break from some of Vegas' crazier pool scenes.\n\nThe massage itself was great!  I had Ellen.  She took the time to ask about the temperature of the room, the bed, and about my pressure preferences.  \n\nGreat experience overall!  I'll be back the next time I'm in town!
