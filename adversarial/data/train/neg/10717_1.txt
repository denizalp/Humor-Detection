This is probably my fourth or fifth time seeing his show, I LOVE this show!  It is good magic, very funny and great for all ages.  This is coming from someone who doesn't normally like magic and I have seen Copperfield.  I consider this one of the gems in my little town!  I try to take all my friends and family to this show, its a must see!
