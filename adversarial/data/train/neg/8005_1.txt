I'm not a huge snowboarder. I sort of know my good stuff from my crap stuff (like going from my Sport Mart board to my Endeavor), but I mostly go to the Source for the sneakers.\n\nThat being said, they sell everything a wee boarder needs to be cool. Which probably infects the sales staff because they can be pretty uppity. The street clothes, snowboarding outerwear, accessories...it's all expensive. BUT they do have an annual Warehouse Sale which I highly recommend. The prices are more reasonable - not eBay reasonable, but if you're looking for something specific that you can't find online, you should try there. The sneakers get mad cheap at the Warehouse sale, too. \n\nAs for shoes, they are the only store I know of so far that sells Supras, and they carry a decent Nike SB line.
