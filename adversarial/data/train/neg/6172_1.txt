Yes, there is a surprise $1.50 fuel surcharge. bleh! I would have appreciated knowing that ahead of time. Also, if you go to the website and print out the coupon, you can park for $6.50 per day. \n\nBefore my outbound flight, I arrived at the lot early because I really didn't want to suffer from slow service. I needn't have worried, parking was easy, and the shuttle was ready to take me when I got out of the car.  The drive was fast, as they are close to the airport.\n\nI was worried about getting swindled out of my coupon somehow, but back in PHX, arriving at the blue diamond at 11:55 PM, I didn't really care anymore due to general travel fatigue. Still, I had my parking tickets and my coupon in-hand.  All the other parking shuttles whizzed by me and another person for several minutes, so I called the phone number listed on the ticket, telling the guy that I had been waiting. He apologized and said he would send someone right over.  About ten seconds later, our shuttle arrived. \n\nThe driver was apologetic with some kind of reasonable excuse, and we were quickly delivered to the lot. I was impressed that the driver, after placing my bags in my car for me, actually waited until my car started before getting back in the shuttle. \n\nI pulled up to the window, not really feeling like I had any fight in me after a 5 hr flight full of screaming toddlers, but I gave the coupon a try. It worked!  Yeah, there was a $1.50 surcharge. Fine. My car was safe after being there for a week. No hassles!
