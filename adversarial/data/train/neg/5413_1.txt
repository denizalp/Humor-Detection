Headed back home to Seattle from Toronto and had plenty of time before the flight boarded, decided to sit down and have a late lunch.   Typically airport food and service is pretty average so my expectations were low....\n\nI ordered the Fish and Chips which are made with Pogo Island Cod.    The fish and tartar sauce were fantastic and the fries were hot and tasty as well.     There wasn't much left on my plate when i was done.\n\nService was a bit slow but not painful.  The iced tea was bottled which was my only disappointment but I was surprised that they had unsweetened ice tea at all as it seems to be unheard of in Canada.    \n\nI would definitely dine here again if I found myself in Toronto.
