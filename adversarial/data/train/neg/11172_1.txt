Run down of my 2 visits here. 1st visit- Everyone I talked with was very friendly and helpful. Beth was great! I saw Dr Medina - hes doesn't seem friendly but seems like a good doctor. Sets up mammogram and they actually called day after that with results.\nI thought...all those online reviews must be wrong and they've straightened up the practice.\n2nd visit (One week after initial visit). Saw Dr Torres. Smiled and was friendly. We discussed things, a medicine I need and to see a dermatologist. Set up ultrasound.\nWent down hill from there. Maybe it's  just the doctors assistant that failed but it's caused me to find a new doctor!\n I had made 6 phone calls in regards to the prescription that was never sent in and about my test results - pap and ultrasound. Things woman worry about!  I was always told her assistant will call me back. Radiologist said the should call you tomorrow but they didnt call until almost 3 weeks later. In that message they just said...all your tests came back fine. In fact, they didn't call me back until after I had left a bad review on Google - coincidence? \nLike I said...I have found a new doctor now.
