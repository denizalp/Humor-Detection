This is a great place to go after long party night in Vegas and somehow we ended up at Noodle Asia two nights in a row. It's definitely good food after 5 straight hours of dancing and drinking. The prices are a bit high, but the food is actually really authentic. All the dishes are pretty good. The noodle soups, porridge, nian gao and the shrimp xo lai fen are good. The first night we ate there, JH, B and I got there first..ordered our food. Our friend M came by a bit tipsy and cleaned up B's noodle soup. I guess it was pretty darn good to him. The next day, we were walking to Tao through the casino floor, but JH started walking towards Noodle Asia. I guess he really loves it that much! We partied it up at Tao and ended up at Noodle Asia again. Again, good chinese food and the portions are pretty decent. The service is quick too...one thing to note that it closes at 3AM. So, it's open late..but, not vegas-late.
