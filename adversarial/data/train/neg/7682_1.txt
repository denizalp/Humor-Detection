Okay this place is a MUST if you're trying to have any type of fond memory of Vegas!!! The food is incomparable, from their chicken & gravy and Mac & cheese down to their bourbon syrup and apple jam. Their cocktails are strong and so fresh and flavorful (the blackberry bourbon lemonade is necessary for life). The best part of this restaurant is the customer service. Our server Christina had such wonderful energy and so so helpful and friendly. There were at least two different people other than my server who checked up on my group to make sure everything was great. Even just walking in, we were greeted with someone who made sure we were being attended to. Every worker looked polished and professional. From start to finish, this is a special place that will leave you with the best meal of your trip and great interactions with the staff.
