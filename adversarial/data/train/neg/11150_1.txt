I truly believe there is a place for western medicine. However, if there's something that can be dealt with  the natural route, Dr. Kwan is the one to see.    When you go to see her, it is only her, not a nurse practitioner which is refreshing.  She spends the time to listen and to properly diagnose your issues.  I highly recommend Dr. Kwan to anyone seeking a sincere and caring physician.
