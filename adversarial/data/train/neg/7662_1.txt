We had the large spicy poke salad. The fish itself was fresh and the amount of sauce was appropriate. however I have to say their service was a tad slow compare to poke guys though there was no lineup. They also didn't ask us for any customizations like poke guys does and they also have less choices of toppings and sauces as poke guys. I would come back again and try the rice and another poke.
