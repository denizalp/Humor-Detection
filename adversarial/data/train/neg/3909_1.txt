I can't resist the vegan Frito Pie from Ladonia Caf√© (Madison, Wisconsin food truck). This delicious dish is not always available, but I buy it whenever possible. It is mildly spicy, and the vegan cheese sauce is better tasting than any recipe that I've tried making at home. Even my non-vegan\/non-vegetarian friends enjoy this dish. I've heard this dish also referred to as a vegan \"Walking Taco.\"  Ladonia's food cart is usually parked on the south side of the Capitol Square during weekdays. I've had other entrees from Ladonia that are tasty, but the Frito Pie is my favorite. Good eats!
