Went here for dinner at my hotel's recommendation plus all the great reviews on yelp while traveling for work. I might now need to plan a move from Florida. The good was amazing. I spent a lot of time studying the menu before I went only to throw all those ideas out when my server suggested the featured dish - saut√©ed breaded pork cutlet with maple Dijon sauce with artichoke and tomato risotto and hericot verts. Knee buckling. The bread and butter is truly unique as others have pointed out. Classy but warm decor, attentive server, obnoxiously sinful dessert with the caramel popcorn sundae. I might volunteer for work travel more often here!
