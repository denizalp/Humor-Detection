I'm on the fence with this place. I think it's a little overpriced but the idea is pretty cool. All inclusive meals with salad, bread and unlimited wine. They have a limited menu, such as they only have one salad dressing, though. It's not family style either, which you kind of assume it will be, so if you want to split add $10. The service is just fine and if you have a reservation you can be in and out quickly. I would go back at some point but I'd rather try several new places before then.
