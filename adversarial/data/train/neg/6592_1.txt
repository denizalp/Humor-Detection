It gets pretty hot here in Arizona and a refreshing, cold drink, like a DD Coolatta, is always very welcome.  Unfortunately, whenever I come her to buy one, I'm told the Coolatta machine isn't working and I drive away empty-handed.  Consequently, I've pretty much stopped coming here and stick to my favorite Starbucks location nearby.
