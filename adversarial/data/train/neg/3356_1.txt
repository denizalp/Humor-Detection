I got upgraded to this hotel from Mandalay Bay for my birthday!! The wonderful staff upgraded me to a 1 bedroom suite! I must say out of all the hotels I have stayed at this was by far the best one. The suites are great!! I also loved the wonderful Michael Jackson Tribute and pictures they had in the show area very nice! HOwever there is a funny smell in the elevator area and in the hallways. Smells like a sewer!!  But after so many drinks lol I didnt even notice anymore. Thats why I give 5 stars!!
