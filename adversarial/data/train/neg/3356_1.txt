Wonderful place we happened upon for lunch.  \n\nAll meatballs, all different kinds.  We didn't want anything especially heavy so we opted for salads each with one meatball.  I got a chicken while my husband got beef.  They were both extremely flavorful and the salads were so fresh and good.  \n\nOur waiter was really great and explained everything to us.  \n\nTheir meatball of the day was a bacon cheeseburger, which sounded awesome but I was in a chicken mood.  \n\nWe will definitely go back next time we are in town.
