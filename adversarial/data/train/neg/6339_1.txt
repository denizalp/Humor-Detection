One of the better Ethiopian restaurants in the country. I loved it. I've been going to Ethiopian restaurants for the last 30 years...all over the country. This was a great find. It's not far from the Strip. You can walk...or a short cab or Uber ride. Definitely worth the trip, if you are into Ethiopian food. Service was friendly and the Injera was delicious!!!!!
