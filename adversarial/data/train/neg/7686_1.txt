This was a great place to stay with a great price.  After a horrible experience at Extended Stay America, we stayed here for 2 nights. The room was clean, front desk service was very helpful, and complimentary breakfast was more than just a continental breakfast. Our flight was very early, so they even opened the breakfast room 15 minutes early for us. The parking was also convenient.
