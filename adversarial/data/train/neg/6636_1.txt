My partner and I spent Valentine's day here for their Kamayan dinner. It was appropriately titled \"Balentines Day\" and for $60\/person you got lobster tail, duck adobo, oxtail caldaretta, pork skewers and so much more. The ube (purple yam) cornbread was so delicious! \n\nA kamayan is a celebration of food and Lamesa lived up to it. Food is served on banana leaves and it almost felt like an orchestra, with two servers constantly placing food on the banana leaf and explaining what it was. When it was all over, our table was beautifully filled with garlic rice topped with delicious meats and vegetables and four sauces for us experiment with (some mild, some sweet, some veryyy spicy). You eat with your hands (and you should!)\n\nThe service was fantastic. Attentive without being overbearing. They send you home with a little takeout container of dessert (ube macaron and a chocolate truffle) - which is so in line with the culture (everytime I go to my boyfriend's house for dinner I always leave with a container of food!). \n\nIs it authentic? Probably not - definitely \"high end\" but a great introduction to Filipino food if you haven't had any before. There are definitely more authentic places to eat but for being a downtown spot it's great. \n\nIt is definitely worth a visit!
