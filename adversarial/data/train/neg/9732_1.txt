- Connected to Chatime (but doesn't have all of the flavours that Chatime in Scarborough has... i.e., honeydew)\n- Not a lot of sitting room; the people who do sit down will camp out there for hours\n- The bakery is just okay - quality of the baked goods is not that great\n\nI probably won't be back here.
