My husband and I bought a new house and need shutters for 6 windows and a sliding door. We went to Sunburst Shutters and met with Kim D. & Jennifer. Kim & Jennifer is friendly, professional and knowledgeable about the products. Kim explained everything the pro's & con's so we decided to go for schedule. Chris came out to measure everything and gave the estimates and he is friendly, professional and knowledgeable. We waited for 6 weeks. Then the installer brought the wrong fascia (older style) for the sliding door. So we called the office and they decided not to install the wrong fascia for the sliding door. Angie told us that she is going to charge 50% minus $200. We were not happy about this. Chris told us we pay 50% up front and 50% when the job is completed. Then we went to the office that day and explained this to Angie. We don't want to pay the last 50% until the job is completed. She argued with us in front of other customers. She is very rude and unprofessional. She doesn't care about customer relationship and referral program. We paid almost $6000. We will never do business with Sunburst if we knew we are treated like second class citizens at the end. We also told Angie that the installer need to caulk some frame corners and some hidden tilt louvers doesn't open open\/close properly, need to be lubricated. She told us the installer will be back in 1 week but it's been 2 weeks now with no responsed.
