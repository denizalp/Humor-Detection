My wife Judy and I were in Vegas this month for the WCC Tournament and were looking for a well rated Thai eatery. We loved this place, friendly wait staff and cooks, and the food was heavenly. We ate lunch here three times during out six day stay, and every dish was a delight, and spiced just as ordered. I can hardly wait for my next visit, it was a wonderful treat for us.
