I love indian food, and have been eating it for 20 years.   My favorite dish is Chicken Vindaloo, EXTRA SPICY.  Most places don't make it nearly hot enough, but Origin India cooked it perfectly.  I would have to say that this is the best indian food that I have ever eaten.  Amazing and reasonably priced too.  Highly recommend it!
