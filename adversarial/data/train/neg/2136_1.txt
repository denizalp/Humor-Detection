Absolutely the best Filipino restaurant in Vegas! Their specialty is their mouth-watering barbecue! Meat (whether chicken or pork) is tasty, tender and delicious! We also tried their monggo, and by far the best I've had! Palabok was delicious as well, (not salty)! \nService was efficient and very  friendly! It was a wonderful experience coming here and will definitely be back! Their food did not at all feel like \"restaurant food\" but more of an authentic home-cooked meal!
