I love this place.  It's usually my first pick when anyone suggests Italian.\n\nIt's very busy just about every night of the week.  When you get there, you'll be offered to order a drink while you wait, which is nice touch as it makes you feel as they have not forgotten you.  The waiting area by the door is quite small though.  The restaurant is large but they keep the lighting quite dark which gives in an intimate feeling.  To be truthful, it's so dark I'm not sure what the decor really looks like as I've only been for dinner.\n\nWith the restaurant so busy, the service is still good.  The wait staff manages to come by your table often to refill water and is eager to make recommendations if you ask.  I would recommend anyone coming here to order the meatball.  It's probably one of the best things on the menu!  Another top recommendation would be the Osso Bucco.
