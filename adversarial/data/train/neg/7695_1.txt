I have been here twice since it just opened. The first time I had the Original Italian, which has provolone,ham,proscuittini,cappacuolo,salami, and pepperoni. You can add the veggies and topping that you like. This sandwich was pretty good, but it didn't impress me that much.\nThe second time I went I got the Big Kahuna Cheesesteak which has steak, grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms, jalape√±os, and extra cheese. Now this what was quite tasty. It is one that I will definitely go back for. Overall this place is pretty good and is definitely a nice break from places like Subway.
