Let me start by saying, I NEVER write reviews, good or bad. I felt compelled to this time, because of some strange bad reviews on here. I have to question whether or not these are actually disgruntled ex-employees or just snobby, north \"snottsdale\" women (I grew up here, so I know how miserable they can be and literally NOTHING can make them happy). That being said, I've been to Shea Women's care twice now. Overall, I am in good health and have only gone for annual exams, so there was no real need to see the doctor. My appointments are usually early morning and the wait time is almost non-existent. \n\nThe nurse practitioner, Nancy Jorgensen, is so wonderful! I immediately felt at ease once I met her. I honestly can't say enough good things about her! She was warm and caring and really took the time to listen to any concerns I had. We had a long discussion about birth control options and she made sure that I completely understood and that I had no further questions before the end of the visit. As far as the staff, I thought they were very efficient and friendly. I work in a very busy cardiologist office myself and understand the importance of returning patient calls in a timely manner, which they do! I will definitely keep them as my Ob\/gyn office as long as I can and plan on using them if I decide to get pregnant in the future. Great team!
