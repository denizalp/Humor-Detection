Huge disappointment. I think I got sick off the oysters. Not a huge variety to chose from. I had a groupon coupon I purchased online. It came with champagne or wine. Both were not good. The waitress did offer mimosas instead which we appreciated but they weren't good either.The Fresh Salad Bar was really good as were the pastries but the food was so so and some of it not good. Lack of salt or spices but very bland. Don't waste your time here. Go to The Rio Buffet way better. Parties of 10 and more, automatic 18% gratuity. We won't be back.
