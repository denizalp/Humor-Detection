Go to this! Go for the experience of being in the complete dark and observe how you adjust to it. You might even have some fears that you get over. It was 3 of us, we had reservations for 2p. We were the only ones dining on this particular Saturday afternoon. We went with the 4 course menu which was plenty for the price. I won't give away what we ate, part of the experience is to try and figure out what your meal is, but I'll say.... Be open minded. If you have folks who tend to only like certain foods specifically, this may not be for them. Enjoy and have fun!
