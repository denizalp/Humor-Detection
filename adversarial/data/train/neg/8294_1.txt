I have so much appreciation for the shopping experience that Nordstrom provides.  I showed up right as they opened on Saturday, in a mad rush.  I, being the procrastinator that I am, needed to find the perfect pair of shoes in a hurry.  I walked in, found Christopher (or was it Michael?) and explained that I had no time to browse.  I gave him some preferences (size, price, style, color, etc.) and he was off in a hurry.  Less than five minutes later he returned with a mound of shoes for me to try.  He brought lots that met all of my parameters, but he also brought a few others that he thought I might like.  I tried every pair he brought out and, much to my surprise, I ended up loving one of the pairs that I would never have chosen for myself.  He rang up my purchase and I was on my way.\n\nI checked my watch and I had only spent 15 minutes in the shoe department!  I had budgeted an hour for my trip so I decided to run upstairs and see if I would hit the jackpot twice in one day.  I ran through the dresses, hurdling racks at record speeds.  A lovely associate, whose name escapes me, saw that I was in a hurry and offered to start a room for me.  I obliged, and continued rummaging racks for THE dress.  When all was said and done, I had nine dresses waiting for me in my dressing room.  I started marathon dressing and was checked up on continually.  I was delivered alternate sizes, honest opinions and good conversation by the associate.  She was awesome!  Together we found just the right dress for the occasion.\n\nI left feeling like I had struck gold.  In the end, Nordstrom kept every last drop of that gold, but was it worth it?  Hell yes!
