I'm not even sure where to begin explaining how awesome this company is! I had a plumbing emergency, made a single phone call comma and a plumber was in contact with me to guide me through buying the right components myself in less than 20 mins. In less than two hours, start to finish, my plumbing issue was fixed everything was cleaned up, and I was invoiced right away. I cannot cannot express how pleased I am with the way mr. Mackay handled himself and my issue. Wayne, you run one hell of a company thank you!!!
