I like everything about this theater. Before I moved to my present residence, this was the closest movie theater to me. It's also a Regal which I used to goto when I was living in California and they honor the Regal Rewards Card which is awesome!\n\nSome of my highlights...\nNOT located inside a casino. You can park and walk up curb side.\nCentrally located next to a couple shops including a candy store \n**(edible kinds, not that kinda candy...dirty minds!)\nRewards card\nLarge projection screens\nComfortable adjustable seating\nConcession stand variety\nDecent pricing for movies in general these days\nOccasionally features Indie films which I love!\nand easily located off Sahara. \n\nThis is the place to go....and if you have the Entertainment book 2013 there's coupons that can be used in there too!
