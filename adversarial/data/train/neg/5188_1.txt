Food was great, service was the worst I've experienced in a very long time.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving this one star is the food, which was very good yet completely overshadowed by the horrible service.  We arrived at 9PM and by 9:30PM, only 5 tables were filled yet service took over an hour and a half.  Our waitress spent more time talking with other staff than actually being a waitress.  We did not get utensils until we were 10 minutes into our appetizer, she never gave us water until my boyfriend had to ask for some halfway into our meal, we bought $10 guacamole and she never refilled our chips (she kept looking over at us, though), and the table that was seated a few minutes before us had their takeout containers ready to go before our entrees even got to our table.  The only time she was quick was to give us the bill and our tip was commensurate with the service received.
