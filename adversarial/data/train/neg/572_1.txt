Awesome Andre! My poor iPhone 5C had chunks missing from the screen for months and I finally dropped it again to where what was left of the screen was about to pop off. I brought it to Andre and it's like a brand new phone! He even put a tempered glass screen on it for me and its ahhh-mazing \nCool things around the swap meet to check out while waiting but he was so quick! Less than 30 min to replace the screen. highly recommended!
