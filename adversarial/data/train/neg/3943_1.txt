GUH! I love going here. I really love how great their service is. I really think it is quite genius how they have two servers assigned to one table is really great at times when your waiting around or if one server gets hung up on another table. \n\nThe food here is always on point. My only complaint is they use too much salt sometimes, which is easily fixed by simply requesting, \"less salt please.\" They are always really great at accommodating and giving impeccable service. I'm sometimes not a fan of what I like to call, \"cookie cutter restaurants,\" but if your looking for consistently great service, good food, and kind staff this is a pleasant place to frequent. If your a control freak and want to guarantee yourself a suitable meal and experience I recommend chilli's. \n\nLets get down to business FOOD. The food here is always on point I recommend the guiltless chicken salad, chicken enchilada soup, fajitas, and pretty much anything on 2 for 20. I really like chipolte chicken crispers.\n \nYou ask for perks? If you sign up to be part of their email list they send free app, meals and dessert coupons on a regular basis. Also my kids get post card they get to fill out and send to themselves that have a free meal for their birthdays. I also love the kids eat free coupons. \n\nI really love Their mixed drinks and margaritas are really good too. Nothing bad to say about chilli's only lose a star for being a franchise.
