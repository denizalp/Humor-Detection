I'm giving 3 stars because of the last time I ate at Rumfish, which was also the last time I was there. The food we were served was entirely too salty and we had to send the fish back because it was inedible. I think the prices are too high for the quality you get. But I will say that I adore their outside area, it is so beautiful in the summer and is a nice place to have drinks with friends. Service was always good in my previous experience so that's a plus.
