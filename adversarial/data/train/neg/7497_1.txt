Bad Customer Service Experience. I just experience something very bad, heartless and rude.  There was a poor, black guy getting Chinese food, such as orange chicken and noodles for lunch. He was missing 59 cents.  The fat, ugly Chinese cashier with the glasses was so mean and rude to him. The poor guy said I only have $4 and the guy took the food away from him and told him. there is nothing for $4, you are missing 59 cents.  the Black guy was starting to walk away and the Chinese, fat cashier was about to throw the food away instead of selling it for $4 dollars.  I called the Black guy and told him that I will pay for the difference.   then when the guy left, I TOLD THE FAT KID OFF.  I told him that he was extremely rude, unprofessional and you don't do that to some poor person that is hungry and needs to eat,  the guy is not begging for food or money. He was just short of money, Cents to be exact.  The Chinese kid told me, well I'm not a manager all rude.  I told him, then in a situation like that just Call your manager and explain the situation that the guy is short 59 cents.  offer some options.  You prefer to throw away the food, then be nice to a person for once?  He called his manager and you know what the manager\/owner told me?   Well, he was missing 59 cents plus taxes.      REALLY?   That is service?  Is not like there are always people missing some cents.   I told him, I have less money than you and I took care of the cents for the guy.   He didn't say anything.   What makes me more mad is that the Fat, Ugly Chinese kid with glasses was just laughing.         I told him off.  I told him you are such a **FUKCK Ass*HKDH      I used to go there all the time but after this.  I'm not coming back ever again.
