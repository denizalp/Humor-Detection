Really enjoying this place. Too soon to say but probably my go to place for Hakka Chinese!\n\nThe place is clean and seating ranges from booths to tables. Each table consists of utensils, glasses, and condiments. Best o all the entire place is clean (including the washroom).\n\nIv done mostly take out, with my dine in experience revolving around soup (to kill time). \n\nFor dine in, service was decent. Ordered at the front (coz was doing take out). Got served with water and althought my soup took a lil longer than id expect it wss understandable considering the 7 people in front of me waiting for their big take out orders. I got the small manchow soup (chicken n shrimp). The soup was hot and flavorful and i enjoyed it to the point where I ordered a large soup to go as well.\n\nThe next 2 items i ordered were the shrimp in garlic sauce and and the crispy ginger beef.\n\nThe shrimp in garlic sauce was delicious! Large portion of large shrimp in a flavorful gravy! The crispy ginger too was yummy but the taste of the shrimp was better. \n\nOverall, if you are looking for fresh (not 5 min fast food types), falvourful, large portion food at a decent price then yes I would recommend this place! Will definitely come here a lot to try different other items on their menu.
