My sister and I decided to do a sister spa day. We each purchased the 50-minute massage on Groupon. For some reason, I did not receive a full 50-minute massage. I received a 40 minute massage. In the room where the therapist calls your name to pick you up, I was the last person left in the room for a noon appointment . I was picked up around 12:04 or 12:05, walked back to the room, undressed so we probably got started sometime after 12:10. And when the massage therapist was done and I stood up to get dressed it was exactly 12:50. When I went back to the room to wait for my sister she came back about 5 to 7 minutes after I had been in the room..Which means she got a full massage. She was picked up before me and then came back after me. She also told me she had the option to upgrade to a deep tissue massage for 10 additional dollars. My therapist never mentioned that to me. I would have definitely paid the $10 for the upgrade.  I do not know if I would go back to the Joya Spa. It is nice, but there are so many options here in Scottsdale like the Spa at the Princess or Spa Avania at Hyatt - both of which I enjoy.
