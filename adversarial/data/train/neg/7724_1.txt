I really wish that there was an option to give this place ZERO STARS!!!! First of all I just went here yesterday and got a 2007 Chevy Uplander, 118,000 miles on it and they wanted a $400 payment per month, that alone should've had me running the other way, BUT I decided to get it anyway. I go to the car this morning to go to work, turned the heat on for 5 minutes then I got a system error message and the air started blowing cold! Then I started to smell something coming from under the hood, I knew I would need to call them! So I get my kids in the car so we can leave, secure my daughter in her car seat and make sure the seat belt is tight, turned a corner and the seat belt loosened and my child tipped over in her car seat! I call and speak with Johnny who was really nice and he told me to come in so they could check the car out, I get there and he advises me to speak with the GM, he approaches me and I tell him the issue and asked if I could exchange, he says \"This isn't Macy's you can't just come in and exchange, you're stuck with the car and we're stuck with you!\" Can't get my money back either! So after sending my feedback about the experience he decided to cut me a check and let me out of the contract! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE! GO ELSE WHERE, like Vegas Valley Motors, they are actually GREAT
