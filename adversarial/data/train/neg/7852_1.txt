This was a really flavorful experience from the iced tea through dessert. The Bloody Mary was excellent. The wonton sashimi taco appetizer was light yet packed full of flavor. The BBQ was perfectly sweet and finger-lickin' good. The Drunk fish tacos were good but a slight disappointment after the wonton taco appetizer. Churros crispy and a good ending.
