This has good food but I think it's a bit overrated. If you are going to stand in line for 20 to 30 minutes I suggest ordering the slut. It is their specialty. The biscuit is mediocre. I am sure there are better places to eat in Las Vegas. This is not a bad place I just think it's overrated and overpriced  for the long line and minimal seating.
