Another brewery has come to Pittsburgh! Have been anxiously awaiting this opening for two years. Grand opening is next weekend but am fortunate enough to be here today for a private soft opening. Have had their beers at other events and am so glad to finally have the real stuff in their own location. The pours are absolutely delicious and the brewery is amazing.\nThe flavors are incredible with a freshness that makes for pours that go down smoothly enticing your taste buds with every sip. Pure goodness on the lips.\nThe layout is fantastic. Really digging the vibe of this setup. It's relaxing, hip, modern, industrial and all of the things you want a brewery to be.\nDefinitely in my top 3 for local breweries; to the point where it's safe to say they're in the #1 slot.\nGet here next weekend for the public grand opening and plan to drink like you've never done before!\nLocated on Washington Boulevard makes it easy access in the East End.\nPS: Blonde Shag is my fave!!!!
