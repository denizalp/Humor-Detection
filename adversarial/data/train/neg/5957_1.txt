I've been visiting this location for the past 15 years.  I have only eaten the teriyaki chicken meal special which is my favorite it comes with salad and drink.  The chicken is grilled and perfectly seasoned withe the teriyaki sauce served over white rice. The salad is  plain lettuce cucumber and carrots covered with a savory vinegary dressing that is cool and refreshing. LOVE IT!  I usually order a side of egg roll  and or California roll. The egg roll is tasty and just the right size. My last couple of visits the California roll had been dry, don't think I'm getting this anymore.\n\nThe only reason I scored this as a 3 star is because the location is out dated. I believe it has not been updated since it was built. I remember going to this chain since I was in high school on the east side of town.
