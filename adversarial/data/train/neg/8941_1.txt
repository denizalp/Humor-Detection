This business marks up their prices for no reason- check other dealerships before buying for sure. Their salespeople got very aggressive (interrupting me, gripping my hand for far too long during a handshake) when I expressed my disgust with what I felt were ripoffs.  They then kept calling me and emailing me until I told them point blank that I was not willing to do business with a dealership whose business practices I don't respect.
