Several other people have mentioned this however I am going to share our own story regarding the owner.  He really really likes to talk, hear his voice, and sings way way way too many songs for my liking.  We tried to have a peaceful dinner however the owner was singing non-stop for a table next to us.  The patrons looked quite irritated as were we.  \n\nOnce, the owner actually came over to see how our meal was.  As we started to tell him, he completely lost focus and walked away mid-sentence.  \n\nThe food is okay.  I grew up in the restaurant business.  The cold case thing does not jive with me.  Some of the items were very good while others were lacking in flavor.  The price seemed on the high side to me for what we received.  The portions were decent.\n\nThe gelatto was awesome.  Maybe we'll go back for that.
