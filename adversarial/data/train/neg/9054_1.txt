New Italian restaurant in town. One of the best Italian restaurant I have ever been too! The ribeye and spaghetti must try. I'm crazy about tiramisu and this place has the best one so far! The head chef Rudy intruduced himself to us and greeted my family. The service is AMAZING! Ask for Ross, she is wonderful and gave excellent service!
