IT'S NOT THAT BAD!!\n\nYes, it's disjointed like the other reviewers said, however, we somewhat liked the different scenes that they used.  It added a lot of variety with stage settings, color, lighting, singing and dancing, and costume changes, etc.  My husband and I found it to be very entertaining.  \n\nThe Jubilee! girls wear these enormous, elaborate, stunning, beautiful feather and jewel costumes.  It's not easy to dance in them!  They mostly parade in them very graciously while other dancers are doing some of the dance routines and in between fluff.  They fill the show with this fluff while the girls are doing costume changes.  \n\nI did notice that some of the dancers were not in sync with each other especially the four male dancers.  The choreography needs to be more spot on.\n\nAll the women to my eyes were probably an A cup.  They purposely do not use big breasted women.  They ALL have the most awesome legs and butts!  A few of the girls though were so skinny, very flat chested and really not very shapely.  That surprised us.\n\nI hope the choreographers read these reviews because if they could just fix the plot, they would have an awesome show.
