Okay so it took me 3 trips to this place before I was able to get a crepe. The first time, we showed up 30 minutes before closing and were denied service of anything except coffee or the small pastries on the counter because the kitchen was closed. In a normal restaurant I can totally understand this, but it only takes 5 minutes and a hot plate to make a crepe so I was a bit turned off by this. The second time we showed up with plenty of time before closing. We were told that we could order crepes, but that it would be a 40 minute wait. We asked if there was a special occasion and they said that this is just a typical Saturday for them. Perhaps they should consider purchasing another hot plate? I love crepes, but not enough to wait 40 minutes. The third time we went was today and we finally got our crepes! My crepe was ice cold when I got it. My fianc√©'s however was luke warm. The crepe, though it was cold, actually tasted good and I think it could have been great had it not been so cold. I've been to Paris numerous times and know what a good crepe tastes like. The service was great and the people were friendly and attentive, but I don't know that I'll be coming back. My overall experience with this place hasn't been the best.
