I wish I had an option for 2.75 stars because I do love this place but not sure it gets the 3 stars.....The specials are always 'just fine' such as beef tips and rice.  The gyro is fine, nothing to write home about.  I always get the club sandwich when I go here and never can finish it (it comes with a ton of fries to share...)  The prices are very reasonable and the staff is super fast and efficient.  \n\nI guess what bugs me about this place is the consistency of the quality....leaves something to be desired at times.  Such as weird brown lettuce on the taco salad, overcooked meat on the gyro....it is almost as if the menu is too big and they should cut back and improve the quality of several best-selling items.\n\nOverall I would say A-OK!
