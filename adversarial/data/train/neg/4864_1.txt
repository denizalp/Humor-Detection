Having dinner at Crush was like spending an uncomfortable hour with an immature ex, who may be trying to kill you.  \nThe good:  The candles and low lighting.  The flatware seemed nice and functioning, and it was great creamed spinach (the two bites I got).  \nThe bad: Cauliflower was cooked by a sadist whose mission was to destroy all taste buds with so much chili that any other flavor vanished for the next half hour.  They turned what was a gorgeous piece of filet into a charred mess that a knife couldn't even cut through.  The one bite was so bad that there was no turning the meal around.  \nThe ugly:  Our waiter, the manager and most of the staff seemed more interested in the basketball game than actually doing their job.  It took almost a half hour to get our waiter over to us to order our meal.  The manager was either glued to the tv or wandering around the front, and only came over to us to let us know that my meal was being comped.  No apology, no excuse, nothing
