One of my favorite, relaxed and trendy cocktail bars in PHX.  You must get the White Rabbit Cocktail, it's amazing.  There is some good people watching, and it's great for conversation with friends.  It's a small bar, so don't expect to find someplace to sit, even though there is plenty of seating, it's always a comfortable level of full.  :)
