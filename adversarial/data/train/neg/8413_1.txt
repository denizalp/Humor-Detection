Where to I start..I have been to this Green probably about 1 Gillion times (I realize this isn't a REAL #) and I can't recall the last time I was disappointed except when this location was closed for reconstruction, but I can't hold that against them.  Anywho I love this place and almost the entire menu with my favorites being the Big WAC, Thai Peanut bowl, Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\", Original \"G\" Spicy Po-Boy, and the Ranchero Salad with the Strawberry Shake and\/or NO's 'n' Mint or Betterfinger tSoynomi for dessert.  My wife and I seriously go 1-2 times a week and LOVE it!  Yes, I understand it's a problem but I'm OK with that.
