This is my regular lunch stop when I am in Stow. The food is fantastic. There isn't an item on the menu I haven't had and haven't enjoyed. \n\nCome for the food, but stay for the shakes.  If that isn't your thing go for the root beer on tap. It's the best in town. \n\nThe monthly food specials keep the menu interesting. \n\nThe absolute best aspect of Retro Dog is the staff. I haven't met a better crew anywhere else. \n\nIn short, this place receives two lion fists up from Voltron.
