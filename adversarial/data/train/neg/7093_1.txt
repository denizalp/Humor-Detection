Came here a couple weeks ago and enjoyed the experience immensely...except for the wait, of course. We didn't have a reservation, so hung out at the bar and had drinks for about 45 minutes. We weren't in a hurry so it was fine, but if you want to sit immediately, make reservations...and make them well in advance.\n\nOn to the food (which - let's be real - is what we all care about). We ordered:\n\n- Cheese & Charcuterie Plate: We went with the Fennel Salami, VSOP Gouda and the Mobay, all of which were yummy (the Fennel cheese is very Fennel-y so if you don't like Fennel...you've been warned). I will say that I felt their meats\/cheeses were outrageously expensive (I compare them to what I can get at Good Food on Montford, which are similarly delicious and you get twice the goods for slightly more than what B&G's charging). I know, I know, quality over quantity...I just don't think I'm enough of a meat\/cheese connoisseur to think what they're charging was worth it. That said, we still enjoyed them.\n\n- The B&G Burger (their signature burger grind): I went pretty mainstream with my entr√©e choice, and was not disappointed...from the moment they sat that burger in front of me with its little \"B&G\" branded bun, I was a happy camper. Burger was cooked perfectly, bun was great, fires were great...it was great. Did I mention it was great?\n\n- Sides of Pan Fried Corn, Brussels Sprouts, Mac & 3 Cheese: In my opinion, these were easily stars of the show. These aren't particularly inventive or crazy sides, you see them (in various forms) on lots of menus...but what set them apart was the execution. They were all just perfection. My mouth is watering just thinking about how great each of them were...makes me desperately want to try to the rest of the sides. Could I get a meal of just sides? I kid, I kid...sort of...\n\nI can't exactly remember what my boyfriend ordered...I think I was too enamored with my food to care. A steak or something that I'm sure was amazing. \n\nWell done, B&G...well done. Slash the prices on your meats and cheeses, but otherwise, keep up the good work.\n\nP.S. they have corkage ($15 fee, which in my book isn't horrible - but then I'm from L.A. so take it with a grain of salt).
