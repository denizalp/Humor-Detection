I was at work and a customer reccomended this joint..and I didn't go. He saw me again and asked if I had gone and I said, \"no..\" he said, \"You've GOT to go to Poboys!\" I SEE WHY.\n\nliterally the best fish sandwich I've ever had in my life. Lovely atmosphere, plus super fresh and fast service. s\/o to the cute bus boy that hooked me up! ;)
