Delicious!  The burgers are fantastic, the onion rings were among the best I've ever had and the sirracha brussell sprouts were a pleasant surprise!  The carrot cake was out of this world! Olivia took great care of us and helped with menu selections.  The very customized burger I ordered was pretty pricey, but the taste, service and atmosphere made it worth it.  I'll be back for sure!
