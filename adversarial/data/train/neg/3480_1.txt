So excited to have found this shop in my area! I tried the Mangoneada and it was by far the best one I've ever had. \n\nI normally have to drive a bit of a distance to get to the smaller coffee shoes which I prefer over the chains any day. \n\nThe service was excellent and the staff is super friendly and informative. I will definitely be a regular here. \n\nSupport small businesses y'all!
