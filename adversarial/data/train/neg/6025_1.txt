The food was good. Not great. The service, especially before your \"real food\" is awesome. After, however, it was a mix of hit and miss. Then the check comes. Your waiter, or as they call it, the captain, is added and called out for a special tip??? For telling us the specials. I guess I'm too much if a pushover as I fell for it, but immediately felt violated.
