(Preface - This entire problem started in August 2014 when the toilet was ruined and was just recently settled by a nasty text from\nDennis the owner, who decided to mail a check for less than the toilet and installation is worth. )\n\n****BEWARE*****\nDo not use this company!\nThe company damaged my toilet and refuses to install another one with a reputable plumber. They wanted to use a \"handy man.\"\nNow they won't even replace the toilet.\nDennis, the owner, is VERY disrespectful and because his insurance company wouldn't pay for the repair he became very mean and combative, (to the point he called me vulgar names and had me crying!) because I wanted the plumber to sign a contract just in case something went wrong. He REFUSED. I waited 2 months or more patiently and that is how he decided to treat me.\nMy homeowners insurance has a deductible of $3100 so if something went wrong I would be liable unless Haden Maids guaranteed the work with a plumber that has insurance.\n\nI was extremely generous and kind to the staff that would come every two weeks. Tipping them and giving them gifts. \n***I would recommend never to use them!***\nI will make sure that this experience is told to all of the proper channels, including the BBB.
