We came here after leaving another local sports bar at halftime due to the obnoxious clientele at the time. This was a nice change. Super friendly staff and great service. Can't vouch for the food since we only came here for football and beer, but they had good deals on drinks during the games! We came here to catch the Chargers game, and although it wasn't on the main screen (with volume), the server gave us a box with adjustable volume that we could sit on our tabletop and listen to the Chargers game while we watched! Awesome! I wish more bars would do this! Knocking off one star for the smokey atmosphere. C'mon guys, it's 2014. No one wants to breathe that anymore.
