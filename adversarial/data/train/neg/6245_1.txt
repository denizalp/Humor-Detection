Probably the most  painless car buying experience I've ever had. Woody Woo was my sales advisor at Calgary BMW. I was in and out in 10 minutes flat.  Melanie Adshead in Finance is spectacular as well, laying out important details with great clarity.  I've bought two cars from there and plan to see Woody again in the future.
