I was at their neighbor location (19th ave and northern) and asked for a single party platter. I sat and waited for 45 minutes and they have not yet started it. I decided to call this location, 19th ave and Glendale, and asked when they could have one made. Before I arrived to the location the platter was finished and packed up with cookies within 10 minutes.  Customer service was the best that I've experienced. 100% would return to eat here again. Extremely satisfied with their prompt service.
