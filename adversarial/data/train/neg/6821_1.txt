Love this place dearly, have been here a half dozen times and food, service, prices, and personalities of the staff and management have been great. Just want to let management know that I took partner for a birthday meal today (Sunday). His ribeye was really good but I got Ipswich fried clams and they really were not good, and I was born 50 miles from Ipswich and know of full bely clams my clams.  There was one belly in the lot and they were extremely dried out and tasteless. So  managers, please check into this. Thank you and it's something I wanted to point out to you and we will always go back.
