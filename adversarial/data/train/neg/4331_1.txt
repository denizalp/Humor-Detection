My new favorite Vegas club!!!\nGorgeous venue with a gorgeous crowd.\n\nPROs:\n-Venue: Open layout ensures that even at capacity, there's still room to move through the club and dance without being too crowded. Plenty of elevated stages to dance on! Lots of lights all over, rave ambience without being pitch black like some clubs.\n-Views: Great views of the strip. \n-Music: Amazing EDM, perfection. \n-Crowd: Same crowd as the other classy clubs on the strip (think Marquee, Hakkasan) dressy but fun, hot and plenty of dancing. \n-Service: Friendly and fast despite lines.\n\nCONs:\n-Drinks: very expensive ($14 minimum) \n-Entry: there's always a line to get in but that's to be expected on the strip (either get there early or find a good promoter)
