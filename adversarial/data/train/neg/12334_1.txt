This place is amazing for fast, casual Chinese food.  I originally found this place through here and I'm so thankful for it.  I've been ordering here for the past couple of years but I'm just now writing my review for it.  I could've done it sooner but I wanted to make sure my experience was consistent.\n\nI've ordered for delivery and pick-up; I've yet to go there to sit down and eat.  The inside is clean and neat but a bit plain.  The delivery times has always been accurately quoted over the phone and ordering for pick-up is fairly fast as well.  There were a couple of times on my way home from work that I called to order for pick-up and they were so busy that no one answered the phone.  After 2 or 3 tries, someone finally answered and I was able to place my order.  That was definitely not a good experience and I hope they found a way to not let that happen again.  I did leave happy though and it was worth the persistent calling.\n\nTheir lunch specials are a great value.  Most are priced at a little over $5 and it comes with a lot of food.  It's very filling and a lot of the times I can't finish it in one sitting.  Their dinner portions are a lot more food and you will definitely have leftovers.  I've never been disappointed with anything that I've ordered and their service is always pleasant.  Of all the Chinese take-out places I've visited in AZ, this one is definitely my favorite.
