Okay... Sooo... As far as Yelp was concerned... You can sit down here to eat... Ummm... You absolutely can't. The parking is on the street and next to impossible to find. The food... We got a medium pepperoni pizza... The sauce was actually good...the crust was burnt. I also ordered a meatball sub.. Great bread... Decent meatballs... Not enough sauce. Not my favorite to-go pizza place, but... I would actually go back (if I were in the area)... Not bad.. Certainly not 5-star.
