I am from Los Angeles so poké has become a pretty mainstream and popular food. So i guess you could say i have high standards for poké. I decided to try poké catcher as it is close to my apartment and i needed a poké fix. The staff were super friendly and accommodating and the portion size was pretty big so I can't complain there. My issues were with the freshness of the ingredients. I've had poké from LA and Hawaii and you could definitely tell it was fresh as soon as you bit into it, but at poké catcher the texture and taste of the fish is way different. You can definitely tell their fish is frozen and thawed out. I bought a small bowl and ended up only eating a few bites because i just couldn't handle the taste or texture of the fish. Sad to say that I wasn't able to satisfy my poké craving.
