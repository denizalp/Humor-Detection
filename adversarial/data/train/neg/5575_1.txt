We tried this place for the first time today and were not disappointed. The popcorn is fresh and tasty and made with no preservatives. They use only the best, most tastiest ingredients. The quality of this popcorn is out of this world. The prices were reasonable and the people were very friendly. They took pride in their creativity and you can taste the difference that makes. You can sample whatever you like and will have a hard time choosing from so many great flavors. I guarantee you will love every delectable morsel you get from this place. So happy to have found My Popcorn Kitchen. Can't wait to go back!!!
