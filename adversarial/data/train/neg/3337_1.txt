Had a headlight burn out on my car.  Called Harbord Auto because it's close to where I live and my regular mechanic is 25 min away.  He told me the headlight was $15 and he wasn't sure about labour because some cars require the battery to be moved.  I brought it over, and he had the new headlight in the car in less than 10 minutes and only charged me $5 labour.  That's $20, and my regular guy charges $35-40 for the same job!  Really pleasant, honest, and reasonable.  I'll use them again!
