This is not a sushi joint so don't go expecting sushi though they do serve some.  Nagasaki Grill is about as close to a Japanese Ramen\/Udon\/Soba shop as you'll find in Arizona.  The owners are friendly and they even have the summer seasonal cold Saimin noodle dishes I like.  \n\nMy favorite dish is the Champon, it's a huge bowl of rich broth w\/ ramen like noodles, napa cabage, and pork belly slices. It reminds me of my dads cooking.
