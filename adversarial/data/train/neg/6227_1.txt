My husband and I were looking for a place for breakfast recently while visiting Phoenix and with the help of Siri (on iphone) we found Scramble.  It is a very nice, clean and considering the size of the room a very quiet place.  We happen to enjoy being able to order of a simple menu at the counter and very quickly finding our way to a table,  The food great and the service was friendly.  I thoroughly enjoyed my French Toast and my husband loved his Eggs Benedict.  The place was fresh and clean.  Simply decorated too!  We sat near the kitchen service area and never heard any noise....as well as the piped in music was the perfect level....no one had to raise their voices to be heard!  We look forward to going there again someday....unfortunately we were only visiting.
