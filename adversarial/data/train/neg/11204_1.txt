Nothing but issues since i started coming here. Why bother having an appointment? They never take you back on time. One time i drove across town for my appointment only for the front desk to say they tried to call (they didn't) to cancel my appointment. Then claimed they didn't have a phone number on file (impossible because they send texts to confirm). They asked if i wanted to update my phone number, which i did, only for the girl to say \"oh that's the one we have on file\" complete waste of time showing up since they didn't bother to call even though they did have my information. Another appointment i thought i might be a minute or two late and i called to notify them they girl had a horrible attitude and then hung up on me. This place gives me anxiety because it's always an issue and always an attitude being thrown at the client. Disappointing as you would think most people come here to feel BETTER.
