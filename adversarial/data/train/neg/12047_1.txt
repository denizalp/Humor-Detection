What a great breakfast spot! Lovely service (from the younger staff at least), fair prices and good diner style brekky food. Loved the Canadian sausage breakfast, yum! Expect a line on the weekend however the wait isn't too bad. Go on a weekday morning for a relaxed feel and get complimentary coffee or tea with breakfast.
