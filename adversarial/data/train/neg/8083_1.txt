I have been wanting to try this place for so long and it was everything I could have imagined! \n\nFirst of all, the place itself is super hip. Neon lights on the wall, huge booths, nice bar, etc. It looks pretty small when you walk in but once you turn the corner there is a bunch more seating. \n\nTo start, we ordered the chips and salsa which came in a huge pan. For dinner, I had the pineapple braised pork but I did it as bowl instead of a taco. It came with rice and pinto beans and it was AMAZING. The pork was so well done and mixed really well with the slaw and pineapple on top. 10\/10 would for sure recommend. \n\nThis place also has a great drink menu and happy hour. ALSO, I'll be sure to come back for taco Monday too-3 dollar tacos all day!
