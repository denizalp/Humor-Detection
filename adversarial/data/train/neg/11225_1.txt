The restaurant is inside the Gold Coast Hotel\/Casino.\nI've only been for lunch so far.\nThe food and prices are decent.\nIt's pretty good for reasonable chinese food.\nThey have the standard dim sum items for lunch.\nThe place gets pretty hectic for lunch, but it's the standard for any dim sum place that is busy. If you go for lunch and only have an hour, I suggest you definitely get there before 11:30am.
