Wow. Just wow. These guys are the best people I have dealt with so far in my new home buying process. I went in about 3 weeks ago when I was pricing out carpet for our home and of the 5 people we went too Affordable Flooring blew everyone's prices out of the water. The pricing was one part and the level of Customer Service was outstanding. Gomez was helpful in explaining the different styles of carpet and padding and then when he came out to measure the home he was 15 minutes early which was extremely professional. Lisa and Travis rocked it too when we went back in to purchase our carpet. The install team didn't a superior job and it's amazing what the carpet has already done to the look of our home. Thanks guys! Can't wait to work with you on future projects.
