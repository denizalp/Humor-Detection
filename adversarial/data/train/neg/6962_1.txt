I went there the other night. Plusses: BYOB and very tasty food. Minuses: relatively inattentive service, overpriced entrees--I would've paid $10-$12 for the curried goat as oppose to the $15, and not the greatest of atmospheres. I'd be happy to go back and try out one of their less pricey dishes like a burrito, and I think with a group of friends it would really fun.
