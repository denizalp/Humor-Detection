The tacos here are delicious and authentic. Perhaps the most authentic I've had in Canada (and this is saying a lot considering I've spent several years living in California). My favorite is the chicken taco followed by the steak and the mushroom. \n\nI also really love their aqua frescas. The pineapple coconut water or the hibiscus drink are delicious. I'm not a big horchata fan but their version with almond milk is pretty tasty. \n\nThe only reason this place is not getting five stars are the burritos. Burritos are not a traditional Mexican food, so there isn't really an \"authentic\" version of it other than the American Tex Mex, Cali-Mex version of it. So that being said, not adding beans or rice to the burritos makes them soggy and drippy. We tried the mushroom burrito and while the filling is the same as the taco mushroom filling, it just doesn't work as a burrito filling on it's own. \n\nI really enjoyed the food here and would make a special trip just to have the tacos.
