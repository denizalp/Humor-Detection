I give this place 4 stars base on value and selection. While it's not perfection like the other more expensive places, mid tier price  for a average dinner was good. Selection was great, lots to choose from, multiple selections of soups, and the usual prime rib, crab legs, and shrimp was above average. the desert bar could do with more selections. But good stable quality over the years.
