Actually, I don't want to give it  even one star, the service was bad, so bad.  The lady looked  impatient, angry. I don't know what's wrong with her. my friend said thanks to her very friendly when we left ,but she didnt say anything just showed us her impatient and angry face. I think she'd better stay at home if she doesn't want to work there, she doesn't have to treat customers like that. it's the worst service I've ever seen.
