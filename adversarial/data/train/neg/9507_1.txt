I heard a lot about this place and about how they had an awesome bloody mary, and boy do i need those on sundays. while they were cheap i wasnt impressed.  it was ok. (i didnt get one with the flares and whistles, just the good ol bloody mary)  \n\nthe food was also ok,  it was just ok.  not bad, but not over the top either.
