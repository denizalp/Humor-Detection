I've been to this place only once, a couple of years ago. I lived in Barrie and frequented The Dutch store there (flagship to Niemeyer's) \nI have moved south and was planning a trip to Niemeyer's, I was shocked to find out that the website said that they have closed down.  This was a great store, I was looking forward to a Broodje krokette. I did find a picture of a note on the Internet. It stated that they might reopen. I hope this will happen soon, there is nothing resembling this store in the GTA. Very sad to see this store gone
