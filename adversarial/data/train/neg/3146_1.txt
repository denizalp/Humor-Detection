Best Italian deli in Phoenix valley , bar none. The service is on par, quality and authenticity of their Italian soups, sandwiches, and salads are top notch. Would travel 20+ miles to come here any day for lunch or dinner. We like getting the meatball with Parmesan with an added layer of Prosciutto. Just heavenly Italian food!
