I have been eating at Pita Jungle for over two years while going back and forth to Arizona from Florida and made sure it it was a sure stop in the area.  I have never had anything but a great meal be it lunch or dinner. Service can vary as with many casual dining restaurants but is generally good to excellent.  sometimes there is a wait because so many people love the place.  I have eaten my way through the menu and no dish disappoints nor, certainly, do portions.  Can be a bit cacaphonous early in the dinner service as there are many kids, but this being Arizona early means it's quiet by 6:30-7:00.  Note that the Scottsdale location is actually in the food court of the Scottsdale Fashion Mall and has a limited menu.  The 4340 E.Indian School store and the others are sit-down dining.
