Probably the worst service I've ever experienced at and resto ever.  They were not only careless and vacant, but also rude and arrogant.  We were perplexed and how rude they were.  Here's what happened:\n\nThey brought us the wrong bill, which neither us nor the waitress realized.  They charged our credit card for that wrong bill.  Then they returned and told us they charged us for the wrong bill, and said they needed to correct this and charge us for the right one.  We say \"sure\" and gave them back our credit card.  Then we asked them for a refund slip for the original wrong bill they charged us for.  They said they couldn't do that, and that they were very busy and they promised to refund the money to our card.  We responded with \"yes you absolutely can do that, and we need to be assured that we aren't being charged twice.\"  The owner very rudely tried to tell us this wasn't possible as \"they were too busy\"... REALLY?  So we told them to \"just do it\" because we weren't going to pay for their mistake.  He sent another waitress over with a machine and she refunded the money in less than a minute,, but was super rude about it.  I can't help but wonder, what the issue was with doing this in the first place, and why they had to treat us like such shit.  Can't really explain how rude they were, but I was pretty close to wanting to deck the owner, and I'm not like that at all.  We left very angry.  \n\nFood is not bad, but nothing overly special.  However, I would never return their after being treated like that.  So many good brunch places in Toronto.. I would recommend Drift at Duff and bloor if you're willing to venture a bit east.  Excellent food, and excellent people.
