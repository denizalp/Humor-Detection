Tremendous Selection - Was surprised however, staff was a bit odd, very limited and not very friendly. We picked up some great items. Would definitely return back. Definitely worth the Uber Fare; go and visit - The place is just a lot of fun and very chill. Your bound to pick up something really cool and unique.
