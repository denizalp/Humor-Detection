I've always been a fan of New Mexico style Mexican food and especially the infamous green hatch chiles.  I never noticed this place before but found it on Yelp and its just down the street! The place looked extremely clean and the man that took my order helped me decide on what to get and was very helpful.  I went with the # 4 (green chile pork burrito smothered with hatch green chile sauce) and and the fry bread with carne asada.  The green chile was very tasty, I did expect more heat; but was still good nonetheless.  The fry bread was very soft but the carne asada to me lacked a little taste. Maybe it was an old batch?  Being an avid carne asada maker and eater, I know that the seasoning does it all; this was was subpar.  I'm anxious to try other things on the menu, and I also left without getting my bottled Coke that I had paid for. :(
