Ive decided to give this place another try.  Received feedback from the owner and a complementary meal.  I took my time coming back, beause i was so unhappy with the previous service and food.  I must say, this time was AWESOME!!! My server was Kris, she was very attentive, polite and just great.  The food wasnt like licking a salt lick like my last experience. It was MLK day, so you opended later in the day.  There was a line, but it moved very fast and we were seated quickly.  Overall, it was a way better experience and i WILL be back.  Thank you!
