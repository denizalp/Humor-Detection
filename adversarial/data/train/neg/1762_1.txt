I just took the full day racing adventure in willow springs driving cobras with my buddy. My buddy bought this as a birthday gift for me and I have to say WOW..... this was a awesome day and experience. \nAs the day approached the owner emailed us and asked if we would want to switch days due to our day not being full. We explained that we couldn't and Dave completely honored the day and was there ready for us. Cars and everything were completely ready. \nDave wasted no time showing the cars and explaining how the experience worked. Quickly we were driving and learning about race car driving. He showed us tons and tons of useful techniques and tricks for driving. We had lunch and the entire 2nd part of the day was all on the track. \n\nThe cars are awesome.\nThe teacher Dave was awesome.\nthe entire experience was awesome.\n\nSuper fun and not only do you drive these cars... YOU learn how to drive these cars...\n\nHighly recommended. Thanks Racing Adventures and thanks David.\n\n(side note... wear sunscreen)
