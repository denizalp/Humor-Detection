I've ordered cans of pro sheen in the past, and no problems. this time 2 cans were defective. tops broke off and it was dripping out,so i cant ship it back..(post office wont go for that) I've emailed Ryans twice about it and haven't gotten a response.its been a month or more now. Ive found another company that carries similar spray. really disappointed in them .bad costumer service.
