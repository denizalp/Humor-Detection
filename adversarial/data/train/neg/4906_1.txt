We've had several problems with our dodge Magnum with about 130,000 miles on it I've taken it to these guys twice each time they have  fixed the problem and more , BART and Chris are the Prime example   of customer service they explain everything , what they were going to do ,why they were doing it, what the best way to do was and what I should do first when the work seem to get a little high . When you go in ask for either Chris or BART and they will make sure to take care of you you can't go wrong if you ask for these guys
