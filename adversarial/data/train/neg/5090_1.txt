I've eaten in the restaurant here once, and ordered delivery a couple other times. \nI'll give them credit that they've got a pretty wide menu of options to choose from, and most of the food I've had was all pretty darn good including thai staples like pad thai, singapore noodles, green curry, etc.\n\nNothing overly groundbreaking to report, but its a safe bet and probably some of the better thai food available in the area, so it gets my thumbs up of approval.
