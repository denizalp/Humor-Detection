Johnnie Walker saved the day!\n\nWe were on our way to Denver (6-30-16) with a caravan of travel trailers when a roof vent broke off of one of the trailers. The timing could not have been worse as there was a huge rain storm approaching complete with flash flood warnings. We now had a repair emergency.\n\nAlthough the timing was terrible, it was also perfect (thank you Lord!) because a quick search showed that Johnnie Walker RV was not far away.\n\nOne call to their parts department was reassuring as they advised that they would have the part in stock no matter what style of vent we had. Sweet!\n\nI'm so sorry I didn't get the gentleman's name from the parts department who helped us, but when we got there he immediately came out and helped us.  He not only identified the correct part we needed, but he actually took the broken remnants off!  What superb service!\n\nAfter getting us the right new roof vent cover, they were kind enough to lend us a ladder so we could put the new vent on.  They even had a covered area right outside the parts dept so we had shelter from the rain during the installation. \n\nI would highly recommend Johnnie Walker RV if you are looking for the highest level of service. They have demonstrated to me the gold standard that is not often offered or obtained.\n\nThanks !
