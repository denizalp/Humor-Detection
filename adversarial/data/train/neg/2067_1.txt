Went there today -- Its not a very modern clean bar, and their menu was dated.  The whole experience seemed back to the 70's....They are trying to be a sports bar, and do have about 25-30 TV's showing NFL games.  It started to fill up and the crowd got quite vocal since there were about 4 games that went down to the wire..... It was OK but I would prefer something a bit cleaner, and bartenders that were a little friendlier.
