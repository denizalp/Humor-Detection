My wife and I stayed here for a concert. We checked in and went up to our room, the view of the freeway sucked but it wasn't a romantic getaway, so it didn't really bother me. After getting settled into one of the cleanest hotel rooms ive ever had, I went down while waiting for friends and ordered a couple beers, a chicken quesadilla and some wings (yep I was hungry). I was watching the Cardinals game on one of their couches and they were kind enough to bring the food out to me. The food was pretty good, and was the best option instead of trying to leave to find something. The staff here was so friendly, and funny. After coming back from the concert we spent some time chatting with the frond desk guy who was super awesome and kind. I went back out with my buddy for a night of shenanigans... I want to warn everyone about this though... After returning around 230 am with several whiskey and beers in my system I attempted to walk thru the front glass door..... Yes... I tried to walk thru it.... Apparently at night you have to use your key to have the automatic door open for you. I was not aware of this and my keen senses were not working appropriately... I face planted the glass door, thank god someone opened it for me because I probably would have just curled up and called it a night there. If im ever on that side of town and need a place to stay this will be my first choice!
