Although the prices are kind of high, this is a great pet store. They have a great selection of natural, healthy dog foods and treats, as well as all-natural grooming products. They have an online newsletter that notifies you of sales and coupons and their staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about their wide selection of food as well as caring for the pets they sell. We bought both of our parakeets at this place, one from each location and they're both healthy, good birds. \nOf all the good things about this place, the best is that they sell the raw food for the bones and raw food diet in their freezer section, which can be hard to find. Expensive at times but a great store.
