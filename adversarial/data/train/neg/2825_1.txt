This review is only for their gift registry. I signed up with them for my wedding registry for want of a better option that could give me both bedroom and kitchen stuff. The lady seemed nice on the first day when we signed up and assured us that we would receive all gifts within 8 weeks of people ordering them (which is quite a long time in this day and age). That's when things started going downhill.\n\nMy colleague tells me one day that more than half of the items in my registry are \"discontinued\". And this is two weeks after I put the items on the registry. After my guests ordered the items, I had to follow up 8 weeks after each order for them to even admit they have to give me anything. Then they act like they're doing me a favour by giving me my gifts. They make you wait, say rude things, return your voice messages days later... you get the drift.\n\nBest is - one of my guests ordered a LOT of stuff in mid-September and now they're saying they can't give me one of the items till February or later (it takes 6 months for them to give you something a person already paid for?????). I'm exhausted dealing with these people. And I'm not the only one. Whenever I go to the gift registry desk, others are complaining and are in the same boat.\n\nI felt so bad when Bed Bath and Beyond opened nearby soon after my wedding. Please save yourself the trouble of dealing with The Bay, who has had a monopoly and has exploited it with terrible service. Go get a registry at some place which values customer service and your guests' money. Or take cash and spend it how you like.
