Went there on a thursday afternoon and there was no line-up , my friend and I were able to get a seat right away. I usually don't eat Pho but I heard it was a nice place to eat, so I gave it a try. First of all, I had their ch√°o quay to eat with my pho and it was pretty good. The quality of their broth is almost as good as my mom's broth when she makes pho at home. Even though their food was good, I didn't really feel welcomed. There was literally no communication with the customer and the waiter. When I finished to eat, I proceed to pay and the person who was at the cash register literally didn't even glance at us, she was doing something else while I was trying to communicate with her. Although the food was delicious, customer service could of been better.
