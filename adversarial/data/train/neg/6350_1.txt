I love the atmosphere at Boulevard. We entered to an assortment of glowing candles. It was warm and cozy (and full of people!) on a cold fall evening.\n\nThe service was friendly...but kind of odd. Well, our waiter was a little odd. \n\nMy friends ordered the grilled chicken main and the fish main. I got the starter quesadilla. Before ordering I asked the waiter if it was filling enough for a main 'oh sure it is!'.\n\nNo it wasnt'. My $15 quesadilla was the size of a sushi hand roll (and rolled in the same fashion instead of the flat-plan style I'm used to). The flavour was great with crab meat and shrimp filling. I just wish there was more of it...\n\nI filled myself up on their hearty bread. My friend felt sad for me and offered some of her dinner...I felt pitied.\n\nI think...$15 was too much for the size of my meal. I wish the waiter had been more honest, I would of just picked a main. \n\nI'm iffy about going back. I feel like I had one of those moments equivalent to buying a $10 hot dog because its in the city.
