My Husband and I got married in early May we walked into Farrar Jewelry to take a look at wedding bands, we were greeted by Rod the Owner. \nHands down Rod is the most genuine and kind guy around!. He went through all the options we could have and stayed within our price point. He was not only fast, and efficient but did an absolutely amazing job matching a band that would pair perfectly with my engagement ring. Thank you so much Rod!! We couldn't be happier.
