Stayed here for a stay-cation. Restaurant staff was very friendly and gave great service, and should get a 5star rating. The rest of the hotel is a solid 2. From the valet who are stuck on their phones and vaping in front of the hotel. Front desk was not thrilled to be there and it showed. The pool had about 70 chairs but only 5 umbrellas. Not good when lounging by the pool under the Arizona sun. Also, no wait staff by the pool. Have to walk into the restaurant to get a drink for the pool. Great location but would consider something different next time.
