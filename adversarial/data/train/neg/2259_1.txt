Excellent food and fun atmosphere. I've been coming here for several years and we have never been disappointed. \nThis is a great bistro with excellent dishes at reasonable prices.\nEven eating at the restaurant bar is very pleasant.\nOur server tonight is Sara and she is exceptional.\nI would recommend getting a reservation on weekends which is very easy to do.
