Stopped in for a coffee on my way to a nail appointment with fingers crossed.  I say this only because it can be busy and its not a \"fast food\" coffee stop so with only 10 minutes to spare perhaps not a wise choice.  I even went so far as to totally disregard time and ordered a London Fog instead of just a cup of drip coffee.  Luck was on my side, it was quiet and my London Fog was ready in mere moments.  \n\nThis is one of my favorite coffee shops in Calgary but alas it seems to be a favorite with a lot of folks and thus it is more often than not very busy, very crowded and very difficult ot find a table.  I have found evenings quite nice, a little quieter and I'll order a pot of tea and sit and knit by the fireplace for a while.  (feel free to say hi if you see me).  Sometimes its nice to get out of the house and meet up with someone for a coffee or tea and well, my friends and I knit.\n\nI've not experienced the off service, everyone has always seemed attentive and friendly enough.  My lack of 5 stars is soley based on the lack of busing.  There appears to be more reliance upon customers to bus their own tables and that often leaves a number of tables pretty dirty and for quite some time.  I have no problem busing my own table and generally do unless I'm at a full service establishment but I don't know that this self service approach is as well received or even recognized by others.  I don't particularly like having to bus someone else's table before I can use it.\n\nPrices are a tad dear but the quality is tops and the baking is off the charts.  Free wifi is very handy but of course this also lends itself to customers hanging out longer.  Along with those darn knitters hogging spots in front of the fireplace.
