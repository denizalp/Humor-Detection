I am so excited to have found a real NY style pizzeria here in Phoenix. This place is fantastic, and the pizza is as close to NY pizza as you will get being this far from home. The crust on the round is thin, crispy and cooked to perfection. I was blown away. I found this place purely on accident, and I am so glad I did. Can't wait to try the Sicilian pie. I'll let you know. If you are not from NYC, you will never understand what you are missing. NY food is a complete delicacy. They don't say where they are from, so I don't know if they are from NY or not, but to make pizza like this, I would be surprised if they weren't from back East. Now, if I could find Italian ices in the squeeze cups, I would be in heaven.
