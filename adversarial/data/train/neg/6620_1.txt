Not worth the price at all. Go to the steakhouse at Circus Circus; the food is so much better and the ambiance is way less pretentious. If prices were cut in half then MAYBE I'd give this place three stars. As it stands two is entirely fair. Even if you shit money I would recommend elsewhere. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here because he had $150 comp from gambling. He felt really uncomfortable, but he dislikes the ultra chic\/pretentious elegance vibe. I was pretty indifferent to the whole layout\/vibe. \n\nOur waiter was very professional and nice--although he acted like a butler rather than a friend. I'm sure that's how they train them but it's definitely not my style. I'm much more compelled to go back when the staff is warm, welcoming, and free to have personality. \n\nWe started with the rock shrimp which was dull and worth about $5 but priced around $20. It was just popcorn shrimp...there was nothing special about it although the lemon aioli sauce was nice. French onion soup is normally one of my favorite items, but at N9NE it was average quality and double the price. I have had that soup at dozens of restaurants. Given that information, I'd say about 60% of the places I've been make better french onion soup than N9NE AND at lower prices. \n\nWe are completely unimpressed so far. \n\nHe ordered the burger ($28) and I ordered the 8 oz filet ($49 I believe) and some seasonal vegetable side. The quality of my steak was good, but the sauce that came on it was gross. It tasted like licorice, which I can't stand. It must be the house sauce because I didn't order anything specific. Vegetable side=gross. And it isn't like my mom made me order vegetables because they are good for me. I love vegetables, but these ones were burnt, salty, and shitty tasting. Half of the side consisted of giant chunks of onion which were horrible and overpowering. I finished 25% of it. \n\nBest item we tried=kobe burger\n\nThe burger was solid as hell. It's the only thing we ordered that was four stars--excellent quality meat, great housemade sauces, well matched flavors, and a lovely touch with the balsalmic grilled onion. With less knowledge of Las Vegas, I would recommend this kobe slam dunk burger, BUT..............right now Smith & Wollensky's Steakhouse on the Strip is offering a $10 burger special and that burger is also amazing, but $18 cheaper...AND the staff is so awesome and friendly. \n\nThe steak had potential but was ruined by the sauce.\n\nNo reason to return. Overrated. I've been to plenty of expensive restaurants that were worth the price but this one definitely wasn't. If you have a comp like we did then it's semi worth the $30 tip. \n\nOur waiter brought us mini carrot cake cupcakes which were delicious, but that couldn't really salvage the rest of the meal.
