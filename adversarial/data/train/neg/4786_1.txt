Hands down favorite pizza in the Madison area. Also both the Madison and Sun Prairie spaces balance cool and comfort. Sun Prairie is more family friendly because of more space to roam. I have heard the other food is also excellent but we have not yet been able to escape the lure of their delicious pizza.
