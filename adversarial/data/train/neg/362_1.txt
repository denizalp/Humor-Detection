For having young adults detail my vehicle they do a pretty good job the service is friendly. I work in the service industry so I always look for that with businesses. I think it's overall a good establishment I never have to wait long. Staff is friendly, don't expect a 5 star detail job with kids in charge they are not professionals I had to come back after my last wash since they failed to clean my back seat. Luckily they have great management Sean is the manager and he goes above and beyond he took my car a personally detailed it to perfection. He gave me 5 star service and for that I will continue to go every weekend.
