These patties are good.  The crust is flaky, thin, and there's a good amount of filling. The beef ones were better than the chicken ones I found.  I thought that the filling was a bit too liquidy as a well but maybe it was just too hot when I bit into it.  All same levels of spice. The ones with the red dot are the chicken patties.  You can buy them individually or by the half dozen or dozen. I usually freeze them at home when I buy a dozen.  You can also mix beef and chicken. Good service as well.\n\nI tend to prefer a thicker crust, but that's just my opinion. I've been on the search for the best patty in the city, and I have yet to find one better than at Warden Station--although Randy's comes pretty close.
