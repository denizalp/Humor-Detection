Outstanding stay. I really enjoyed my stay at the \"Hilton in downtown Toronto\". I've been here twice now, once for a ceremony and another for a reception. Both times the service, food, and ambiance have been spectacular. I can see why this is a popular choice in the wedding crowd!The people here work extremely hard to ensure the experience is perfect.
