This place has been my favorite BBQ place in town for years...until now!!  We placed a takeout order on Tues night. The food was old...super dry ribs AND beef brisket AND cornbread. I just called the manager to tell them how awful the experience was.  She did not care at all !! She hung up on me!! She explained that the food had to be returned within 24 hours for anything to be done about it. Unfortunately,  I have been suffering from an adverse reaction to medication that I was unable to even get out of bed yesterday. Obviously, calling Famous Dave's was not a priority. I told her that I would spread the word about this horrible experience and I would not be returning as a customer.  She did not care in the least. As th GM, she couldn't do anything.  Maybe if I call the manager on duty that night, that Mgr could do something if I bring in the receipt and the food. I call BS!! If she is the GM, she has the power to make it right. Shame on you Famous Dave's! ! This person should not be managing a customer service business! !
