Meet Ron the owner and recommended I try their Italian beef sandwich which I got with hot and sweet peppers. This was the best Italian sandwich I've ever had it beats Portillo's. I also had fries and Italian ice which were delicious I'll be back and I also noticed you can order it by the pound. I will be back to treat my family! Thank you.
