No, Michelle thank you for your reply. I appreciate you attempting to call me out by name as it shows your complete lack of professionalism, and you will lose much more business from sharing personal customer information than anything I could have ever wrote about you. I could take it down, but I will gladly leave it up for you reviewers.\n\nTo be clear for the reviewers of your company and anyone who knows anything about water softeners, I asked for the (1) hardness level that was previously used on my system and (2) the frequency for regeneration. That is not a set up and there is no need for a technician to come out and do that. It is a push of a button. Had I looked at it prior to getting the new system at your recommendation, there would be no need to contact you. If you think paying $90 twice to get this information that you already paid for, then this is the company for you.\n\nTo further assist your company, I would like you to know that if you are getting 20-30 hang up calls a day for Michelle, then she can proudly own them from the other reviewers and customers, as I don't have time in my day to call you that much. As I stated, 3 phones calls is what you received from me, the others are from different customers probably trying to avoid Michelle.\n\nAs I told you when we last spoke, I would rather give my business to another company, and would be providing your company with the reviews it deserves.
