So this is our new neighborhood pizza joint! The wait was about 10 minutes. The staff is super friendly! Kelsey our server was so patient in exploring the menu with us! The manager Ann came to our table to welcome us to the neighborhood and gift is a pizza cookie for dessert!!! \nWe were missing Oreganos in Our Great State of Texas! \nOur Thin crust pizza was delish and came out quickly. The Chicken Parm was more than enough for two! \nWe can't wait to be back!
