Good food for a good price. The chicken wings are very good, they are whole wings, but on the smaller size. The fried okra is okay, but I'm not really a big fan of okra to begin with so take it for what it is. The fries were very good, they reminded me of Long John Silvers fries. I would have to say the gyro was the highlight, it was very good and not overstuffed like many gyros.
