Me and my 6 year old son had a dinner date here tonight.\n\nI can't think of much good to say about my experience at the establishment\n\nGood: no wait to get in. Cashier was friendly. \n\nBad:The pizza was terrible. Cold, underdone, barely any toppings.\nSame with the desserts. The \"brownies\" were mush. Definitely raw.\nThe employees making them food right behind the open bar, we're listening to vulgar music. \nI thought this was supposed to be a family friendly restaurant??\n\nAt one point we had left the table for about 2 minutes and came back to someone else's dirty dishes on our table.\n\nI won't be returning to this location anytime soon.
