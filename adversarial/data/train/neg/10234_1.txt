I was wary because of the prices we had seen in the online menu, but are always looking for good Chinese food, it's on the way to Mekong Market, so we stopped in for lunch.  We ordered Spicy Lamb ($18.95), which the waiter said was plenty for two and they could tone it down for my wife.  Later the bill showed \"small spice\" or something to that effect, but the plate was full of peppers, hard to even find the lamb.  The lamb was so fatty that my stomach was a little upset afterwards, although I almost finished it and it's a dish for one, not two (which would be the only way to justify the price).  We also had a vegetable dish of eggplant ($10.95).  It was mushy and the sauce was nondescript and we left most of it on the plate.  My grandson was with us and his Mongolian Beef ($14.95) was decent.  The service was good except for the misordered spice level, which meant my wife couldn't eat much.  The decor is nice, but they played American radio which seemed out of place.  The bottom line is that the food is very overpriced and you're taking your chances with quality.  We won't be back.
