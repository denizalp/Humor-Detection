Came here in the afternoon, the service was really good and I got a hold of one of their best cookies and wow, it did live up to my standards! It was baked and left there for awhile but I cannot imagine how delicious it would taste right out of the oven...*salivating* haha besides that, the latte was good  as it had a strong kick to it. This cafe has great seating, the atmosphere makes me feel like I stepped into a European cafe, I saw lots of people studying and chatting with other people.
