I really like this Eastern European market. I came in off my boss's recommendation and I am so glad I did. They have some middle eastern products I have tried before like Lavash bread and yogurt drinks. The employees are friendly and very efficient. If you don't know what something is just ask. Especially at the deli counter. I tried several new Russian goodies that I just love now and it's good to try new things! They have a fried cheese dessert called syrinki ( spelling probably wrong) and it so tasty! Give this place a try!
