I'll give them 4 stars because they got the job done... Docking one star because it wasn't in a very timely manner. But then again, I haven't found a \"timely manner\" tire shop since I left he Northwest and the ever reliable Les Schwab. The warranty is great on their tires and everyone was nice enough. Just please don't say and hour to an hour and a half ... Then tell me after 2.5 hours that it's almost done, would I like to wait and get the alignment check still or come back another day. Hey, at least they gave me an oil change coupon for the hassle!
