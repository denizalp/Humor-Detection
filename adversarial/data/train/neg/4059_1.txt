Jolie's is awesome! It's our local hangout and we love the staff. They always remember us. On top of that, the food from breakfast to dinner is always delicious and we've had several things from the menu. And of course you can't forget the drinks. They're really good and reasonably priced! Thanks Jolie's for being awesome.
