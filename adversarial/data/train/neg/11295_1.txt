Thieves! Beware shopping at this store!! Keep your money. They are lining their pockets with consumers' money. I will never spend a penny in this company of stores. I wanted to try on a sports bra to make sure I was getting the correct size since I had planned to purchase three of them. I was told I couldn't try it on and it would be final sale. WTH?? So you're telling me that if I buy them and they don't fit, I've lost my money. FOH with that noise and foolishness. That doesn't make any sense. I can respect a business choice to have final sale but to then tell me I can't try something on to make sure it fits is ridiculous and robbery. I called the main store and spoke to supposedly one of the head managers who couldn't care less about my concerns. He just said thanks for your opinions. Really??? The staff at the location in Spectrum sucked and was unprofessional.
