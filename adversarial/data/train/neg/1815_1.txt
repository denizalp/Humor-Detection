I tried this salon to see if I wanted to use them for hair and makeup for my bridal party. I paid them in full ahead of time. The woman in charge was hard to get in touch with most of the time. The day of the wedding the assistant was scheduled to be there at 8 am. By 8:15 I was calling her - she wasn't there and she didn't answer her phone. I called her 3 times and left a voicemail and by 9:30 she still wasn't there. By 10:30 they both showed up. Neither one of them ever apologized that they were late, only saying they had it down for the wrong day, despite the fact that I confirmed with them. While it was great they were willing to come to my house, they were so late that my day was ridiculously stressful, and they burnt one of our chairs with their curling iron. Very unprofessional and inconsiderate of them to act like that-no apology, discount or explanation. I would not recommend hinging your special day on this salon.
