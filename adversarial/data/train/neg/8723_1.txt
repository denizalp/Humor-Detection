I was in Pittsburgh over the weekend and ended up picking Sienna Mercato for lunch. I wasn't aware that the place was known for its meatballs. I am vegetarian and wasn't sure how the veg meatballs would taste. I went with the server recommendation and she got me 2 meatballs with the tomato risotto. I loved it! For the price the quantity and quality was great! My date and I both were really happy being fed here. Also, the decor is so cute they do have a rooftop beer garden that's open on certain days. I will def be coming back here for more when I'm around next!
