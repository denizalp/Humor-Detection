Sierra is a top notch bartender the craft cocktails are very intriguing and detail oriented. Tried the Jumping Julep and was a very strong but awesome cocktail. I'm a fan of old fashions and stronger drinks so the Chivas Scotch in the Julep was very satisfying. Food was great however we just tried appetizers. Will be back for the hibachi style cooking at dinner hours!
