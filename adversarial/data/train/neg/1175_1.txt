Amazing buffet. I can think of only one other five star buffet (Boma at DisneyWorld), but this one easily earns its five stars. Go at the cusp between meals (like 10ish between breakfast or 4ish between lunch and dinner) and you can sample more things. If you have the room. The food quality here is top notch. Several good sushi options, great pasta dishes like mushroom ravioli, kobe beef tenderloin, prime rib, squab, great gravies, and all kinds of other stuff. From the simple cheese and fruit to the well-crafted fancy desserts, this place does it right. This is a must visit when in Vegas.
