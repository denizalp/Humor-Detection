Very pricey but great little vegan bakery!  What I especially loved was the building.  Apparently it was built in the mid-1800's, owned by Thomas Cook at one point and was also the home of the first Italian settler in Vaughan.  It was later restored by the Remington Group and is now a really awesome little bakery!
