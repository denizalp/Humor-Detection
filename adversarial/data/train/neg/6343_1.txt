Dr. Fisch and the rest of the staff of GVFP ( Ivy, Amy, Sherice and everyone else that I forgot to mention, sorry! ) have been truly wonderful. They have been really nice and caring, knowing that IVF is no easy journey, they made me feel comfortable every time. Im very happy that my first cycle with them has been successful and am currently 9 weeks pregnant. Their dedication to what they do is admirable and coming from the medical field myself, you would know that these people are competent and professional. Many thanks to you guys!
