I'm not sure what all the hype is about with these cupcakes...My daughter wanted cupcakes for graduation since we just moved here and we weren't going to have a big party..Being new to Chandler and not ever having gourmet cupcakes from a shop, we decided to pick up a few here and a few of the same flavors from another local cupcake shop and do a taste test at home first. I wanted so badly to like Gigi's because the presentation of them was gorgeous (hence the 2 stars). However, after getting both sets of cupcakes home and dividing them in fourths so that we could all sample each flavor and compare \"apples to apples\". Gigi's Cupcakes were dry and crumbly...They lacked any flavor at all and the frosting tasted like lard. We ended up ordering cupcakes from the other cupcake shop after everyone in the family agreed - Gigi's has a great LOOK but now they need to focus on their TASTE!
