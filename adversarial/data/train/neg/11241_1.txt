Very bad service just because we didn't have a appointment. One guy came up to me and asked if I had a appointment when I said no he went on to say someone will be with you. After 20 min of waiting another service tech asked if I I've been help when we said no he said ok someone will be with you. I can't believe that with all the techs in red shirts just standing around talking to each other no one wanted to do there job and give service to the customer. I will never come back here and I will never buy a car from them.
