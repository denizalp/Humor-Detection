I gave this place 1 star solely based on the my customer experience here. This is by far one of the most unprofessional restaurants I've been to in a long time. I walked in and approached the counter with no acknowledgement. After I spoke to the cashier she then simply replied \"yes.\" Staff was having personal conversations and were extremely loud. The food was great but based on the customer service and experience I will not be coming back here nor recommending this place to anyone else. There's way too many options here in Uptown to slack on customer service.
