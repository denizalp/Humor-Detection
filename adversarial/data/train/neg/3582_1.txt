Very busy on a Sunday afternoon, likely from the church crowd. Like the popular SongCook, this restaurant specializes in korean style chinese food. I ordered the jajangmyeon which is on special for $6.99 on sundays (if I recall correctly) and was a fantastic deal! My boyfriend and I also split the steam buns, which chinese people know as man tou. Instead of eating it plain or dipping it in condensed milk like I'm familiar with they had the store bought thai sweet chili sauce to go with the buns which I thought was novel and delicious. My boyfriend ordered something that came with the jampoong soup and that my friends was the star of the show. The restaurant was generous with the seafood in the soup, and the soup itself was extremely flavourful without being too spicy for me. It was so good I'd like to go back and order it even though jajangmyeon has always been my go to dish at korean chinese restaurants. And the icing on the cake was that portion sizes were great and prices (with the exception of dishes like the tang su yook) were very affordable. Overall great place for lunch\/ dinner and a good alternative to Song Cook which is nearby.
