Well, this is my very first comment on yelp. I went to this location today. Everything was usual at the beginning, after I picked the frame, my salesman(Liz) says I need to wait for empty table to get things done. Stand there for 10mins for the free station, sit at the station for another 15 mins( with no one come to assist). Okay I'm patiently enough till Liz come to access my profile said\"ok I will find someone to help you\" then she left. me and my boyfriend wait there for 20 mins with no one come. Staff pass by me act they are blind until I turn around saw my dear salesman Liz sit at the station behind me helping a man come later than me to make purchase. I am so pissed never return to this location and will help advertise this great customer experience to friends:)
