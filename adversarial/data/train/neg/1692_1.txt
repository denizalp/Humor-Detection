Came here with my girlfriend just before 6pm on a Saturday. Just a handful of people in the restaurant. The atmosphere is cool and hipster type with rap music playing the background.  Sat by the stairs and ordered our drinks after a quick look at the menu. Had a spicy caeser which my friend says she always orders and I had a Modelo beer. It took over 10 minutes just to get our drinks. Then when we placed an order for 2 tacos, a baja fish and a chihuahua cheese taco. That took another 15 minutes. Granted the restaurant was not full capacity, it took awhile I felt.  However, the tacos were delicious. My friend decides to order another one and after our server finally comes back to our table were we able to place it. Luckily it arrives quickly. This place would get better marks for faster service and I would definitely come back because the food was still delicious.
