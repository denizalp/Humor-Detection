I really do like the curry goat roti here. In fact that's all I've purchased and I've been back a number of times.  They've been in business a long time and I do sometimes wonder why they don't renovate the place to make it look a bit better because I think this IS the original decor. They MUST have the funds for it after being in business so long. That's my only 'complaint'. The curry goat roti is great.
