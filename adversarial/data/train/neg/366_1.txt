i needed to get an eyelash fill and this was the last place i could find so i went assuming they would have different lengths to match what i had on but of course. they didn't so she took my eyelashes off which was the most painful thing i've ever experienced. she was putting some liquid on the to make them come off easier which i mean kind of worked but she kept squirting it in my eye and it burned so badly that my eyes were watering and when she had done that she started putting the other ones on my eye and she had me keep my eyes open because any other place would have you close your eyes so i kept them and she kept poking my eye w the lash so they would water and she got mad. the glue she used is all over my lid. and to top it all off a little section of them has already fallen off. over all they didn't even look good. they're really short and it's not a cute look.
