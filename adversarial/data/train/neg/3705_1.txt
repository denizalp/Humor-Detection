Very sweet people here. I mean, they saw me cry my eye out. One of the staff even brought me a box of tissues. Anyway, I brought my dog Snow White because of her first seizure (of course I panicked) and they were the only place open at 2 in the afternoon on a Sunday to make sure she was okay. They took care of her and that's all I could ask for.
