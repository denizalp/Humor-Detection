I visited this place yesterday with family and friends.  When the bill came, I paid with my credit card, and was carded at the table.  We were there for quite a while and never saw any other parties being carded.  This made me feel uncomfortable because we were Black and this was the only characteristic that set our party apart from everyone else in the restaurant.  Terrible ending to our meal!
