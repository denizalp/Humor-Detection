We were a bit disappointed.  My wife said it was better that last time they ate at the restaurant.  For me the atmosphere (inside dining room) was depressing, everything in shades of gray, along with the remote location with little foot traffic kind of lulls you into thinking \"I really don't feel like i'm in Vegas anymore...zzz\".  \n\nThat said the food is pretty good, the flavors and sauces are sophisticated, as one would expect from the well known chef owners.  Beware of the salsas on the table, two of the three were pretty hot, and I typically like spicy food.  \n\nWe noticed a new location for Border Grill in the Forum Mall, this will be an welcome improvement, look forward to trying this location when it's completed.  I'll give it another chance.
