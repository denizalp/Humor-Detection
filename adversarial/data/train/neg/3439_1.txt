The worst customer service I have ever experienced. If I say bad I do really mean BAD. This Saturday my friend and I went to this DEN, I do not even want to say \"restaurant\" because if you don't respect your customers and show very offensive attitude and literally make people walk out from that place you are nothing more than an animal. (I feel bad for using this kind of words but we were so offended and humiliated.) I myself work in a restaurant that is why I was shocked by seeing the short Mexican guy's rude behaviour who was probably the manager or owner of the place. I never review restaurants even if I don't like the food I just leave and never come back but I couldn't close an eye on this. I AM NOT RETURNING TO THIS PLACE ANYMORE EVEN IF I AM FORCED BY GUN :) BTW  I am very generous giving one star.
