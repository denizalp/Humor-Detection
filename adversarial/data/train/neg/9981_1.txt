So... We came to Lou's a while back because the folks at our fav antique mall recommended it.  Lou was still running it then.  Today, we visited again; it was packed with happy people!!  A very nice young man named Brian stopped at our table to ask if our food was ok; conversation led to us finding he was the new owner.  He informed us the only changes he made were to use social media to advertise and the addition of wifi-- he doesn't plan to change anything else.  Verdict:  Lou's is still (and will continue to be) a family-run, old fashioned family diner with excellent food and a neighborly vibe.  Breakfast is the real deal here... Delicious, and large enough you'll probably skip lunch.  Good quality food, nice wait-staff, and YOU feel like family when you are there.
