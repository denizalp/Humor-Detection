Stopped by for the the first time to get some of their homemade flour tortillas. They are huge and worked out perfectly for a week plus of breakfast burritos. I  will have to make a return trip to have a meal, it obviously very popular judging by the number of cars in the parking lot and the line I waited in to place my order.
