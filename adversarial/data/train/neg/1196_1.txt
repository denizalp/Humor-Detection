Chic modern decor + fine dining at a reasonable price, I'm diggin it :)\n\nHoney Salt, what a cute name. Just had to point that out\n\nService: 5\/5\nOur waiter was very sweet and attentive, he had to be especially for me because for the looks of it for awhile it seemed as if I was being stood up by my friends. He knew the menu like it was the back of his hand.\n\nAppetizer: 5\/5\nbig-eye tuna tartar: avocado, ginger, cilantro, soy, lime, crunchy quinoa. Super fresh\n\nEntree: 4\/5\nMary's free range brick oven chicken: kale & anaheim pepper mac n' cheese YUM. I had to try one of their signature dishes If I really wanted to fall in love with Honey salt. Its very daring for restaurants to serve a chicken dish without the fear of cooking the chicken dry. For Honey salt, that wasn't the case, the skin was crispy and the chicken breast was succulent and juicy. The Mac n' cheese was a little too oily for my taste but it was delicious.
