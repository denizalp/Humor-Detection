The Papa John's on Central Ave closed so I thought I would give this place another chance. Let's be honest with the ratings because this place is a step below Little Caesars in quality (not sure where all these 'great' ratings are coming from).  It tastes pretty cheap and greasy.  Also, both times they messed up my order.  This last time I got charged around $16 for getting two kinds of specialty pizzas split on one large pizza.  Literally made no sense because it would have been cheaper just to pay for all the toppings as if they covered the whole pizza.  I mentioned it when picking up but didn't bother to argue because I have no intentions of ever going back.  I never see anybody in this place either so I figured they will be gone soon enough.  Maybe a Papa John's?!?!?!
