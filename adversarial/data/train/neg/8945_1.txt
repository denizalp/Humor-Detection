Stopped in to ask questions about ordering contacts. Jeanine (short hair blonde older lady) was super helpful.  She answered my questions and clarified some things for me I was confused on. \n\nProbably won't ever buy frames\/lenses here bc I didn't care for the brands or style of frames they carry...but I'll buy my contacts from her. She earned my business.
