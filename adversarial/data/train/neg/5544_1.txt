Coffee is great the people making it are cool and chat at you and remember you after a few visits. The wifi is free if you buy a drink and coffee is only 2$ if you get the normal no frills coffee. \nSmoking on outside deck is heavy at times but plenty of space inside for a smoke free environment. \n\nNot a coffee chain and I am glad for that. \nCome enjoy some coffee and meet a new friend. \n\nJoe
