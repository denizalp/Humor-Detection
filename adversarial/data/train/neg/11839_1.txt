If you are on the strip walking around trying to find a place to eat, please start walking towards New York New York and walk into Tom's Urban. You will thank me later. This is my new spot to drop in for amazingly filling foods. I came in with a group of hungry girlfriends, and we left stuffed and ready to lay by the pool. We started off with bellinis that were absolutely perfect to hydrate from the Vegas heat. For food starters we got a bunch of the small plates to share, and the duck wings were amazing! If you are unsure of duck you have to try them. The sauce is a perfect sticky stick to the duck sauce, and you have to eat the slaw with it. Absolutely yum! Brussels sprouts, fried pickles, and spicy edamame were equally as amazing. I highly recommend the fried pickles because they are the ones you want and expect- perfect crispness and not dry at all. Okay being 7 girls ready to eat we ate, but we couldn't conquer because the portions are absolutely huge! I had the lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese.... To Die For!!! It's baked, comes out in a skillet, and each bite will have seafood all the way till the end. One of the girls had the Hangover Slop, she said it's a must and didn't want to stop. I saw one of the girls having the eggs benedict and I was blown away at how huge the English muffins were. They could hold up to the thicker slices of ham on top! \nThank you Erron, Lina, and Carmen for the amazing customer service. You guys had the best recommendations. Lina was the sweetest for constantly refilling my water. It's so hot in Vegas and needed to rehydrate. Erron was our manager who came out to see how we were. Thank you being so kind and your awesome vibes. \nOh P.S. the homemade poptarts are a freaking must!!!!! \nComing back tomorrow... Or dinner...
