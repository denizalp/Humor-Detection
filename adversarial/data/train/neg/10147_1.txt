Visit this restaurant today for the second time ( first visit was a few months back) and I was reminded why this is one of my favorite bbq locally owned restaurants in town. Wayne (maybe is the business owner) was extremely welcoming from the time I entered the restaurant until I left. The quality of the meats is amazing and makes you wish you had more. Most of the side dishes are excellent- Mac and cheese, veggies. Cornbread and beans could improve on the recipe. \nIf you are looking for some excellent local bbq place and meet some of the most friendly staff make sure you give this place a try. Kudos to Wayne again!
