Very poor comunitcation. Lots of trouble with delivery. I am still waiting on my paperwork showing what I bought, because the computer was down. There seems to be nobody \"in charge\". They just keep saying they will check on my account and call back.  I did have a very nice and knowlegable salesman named Robert.  After that people seemed clueless to every question I had. I would not return for future purchases.
