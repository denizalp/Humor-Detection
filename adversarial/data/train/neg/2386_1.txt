Panera Bread style restaurant that offers soup, salads, sandwiches. Not so crazy about their salads since I like iceberg lettuce and they don't offer that. Yes I know, I'm weird I like the non nutritional lettuce haha. Their soups are good and you can never go wrong with a chocolate covered strawberry. Yum!
