Went back Thursday evening with several friends. the store was dirty again, some yogurt machines were partly open and you could see into the back room, yogurt was dripping down the front trays and walls onto the floor, several partially filled yogurt cups were left sitting at the bottom of the dispenser, dirty floor, kids behind the register not paying attention. Also, all of the flavors were icey and lacking in flavor. \n\nDear owners: you have a problem with this store
