We recently moved to Gilbert and found Dodge Electric on yelp and asked them first to come out for an estimate on several jobs and then we asked them to hang four chandeliers, two with pre-existing light fixtures and two were going to be brand new. They did an awesome job but just as important, while doing the job they asked for input to make sure the new chandeliers were lined up exactly where we wanted them and that the height of the other chandeliers are also what we wanted them to be.\n\nVery affordable and extremely professional. they are definitely my new electricians. Can't wait to have them back to wire my garage and install outdoor fans on the patio!
