Not all the crepes are good!\n\nJust because you didnt like the crepe you had doesnt mean there is nothing good on the menu! I tried the seafood crepe and berry crepe and didnt care for either. Now that i know what i like i never order anything but the Apple or pear crepe. We usually order 2 crepes and 2 Baileys coffees with the bill being $30. We dont care because its a treat that we only get maybe twice a year!
