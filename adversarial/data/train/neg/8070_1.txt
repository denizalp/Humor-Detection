Don't let the small sample size of reviews fool you. The food here wasn't what I was expecting from the other reviews here and the service was definitely lacking.\n\nFirst off, in walking into the restaurants the menus are extremely confusing. There are specials written on boards outside and at the counter, specialties up on wall, and the normal menu in written form on tables.\n\nSince I was set to meet someone later, I was in a relative hurry to get my food. So, I ordered what I thought was the most basic item on the menu...meatball sliders. A half hour later was when I finally received my food. While other customers who had ordered after me had gotten their food much sooner, there was no mention from the staff about the sliders or an apology offered. \n\nIn all honesty, the meatballs were not bad here with tasty herbs inside, but they were very dry at the center. The main problem with the sliders was that the inside portion of the buns were completely burnt. I don't know why they would even serve the buns to someone in that condition. A very big disappointment.
