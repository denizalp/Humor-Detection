Tried this place for the first time because I wanted something besides the typical Starbucks. The coffee is great! I ordered a Carmel macchiato and it taste just as great as Starbucks. I was very impressed. I also ordered a bagel with cream cheese, which was not as great but oh well. I thought the bakery products were homemade cause there's very little to choose from, but it didn't taste that way. I definitely will be back for coffee, but probably not breakfast.
