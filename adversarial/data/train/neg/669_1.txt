I love lululemon.  I won't wear anything else to the gym.  The yoga pants tend to wear because of pulling - from washing or rubbing against rough surfaces but they're comfy and flattering.  I find they have something for everyone.\n\nMost of the staff are great, others can be a bit snobby.  Wish it was a bit more affordable.  Items in black are also more expensive than colours, which is a bit annoying because i love black... and it's slimming - key for the gym.
