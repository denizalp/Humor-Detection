4 for the pork loin sandwich, the pork loin was half the size of the plate.  It taste like japanese tonkatsu. I actually like this better than the chicken.  You can get it with eggs but we got it as a sandwich. \nthe sage fried chicken and waffles were 3 stars.  The waffles was good with the bacon and the breast was yummy for a dark meat person.  I guess it could feed like three but 18.99for one plates is slot when you are visiting and you cannot take it home.  \nService was decent nothing outstanding.
