My first visit to the Ahwatukee farmers market was quite nice. It really can't compare with other farmers market I visited in the past as the other ones are massive. But it had a several booths to browse, with interesting, quality products. \n\nThere was produce, which in reality I didn't checked out. Cooking in my house has stopped until further notice as I don't have time!\nI got delicious tamales, tasty hummus, and a yummy crepe. I also tasted salsas, whipped flavored honeys, apple cider etc. Everything tasted very good, not artificial.  There even was home made dog treats!\n\nSince it's a small farmers market, I don't think you could make a whole morning of it but it's still worth checking out.
