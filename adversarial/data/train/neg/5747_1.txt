Found this place by accident....  must say I was pretty impressed. \nWent for lunch, and I'm excited to go back at night for some live music....\nonly downside was the lack of good cover on the back patio.  Its totally cute and I love patios... but every time the wind blew my iced tea (which, BTW, is ridiculously good)  filled up with little tiny leaves.\nBut aside from that small set back... our waiter was personable and attentive, the food was surprisingly good, and the ambiance just right....\nThe menu is a little sparse, but I kind of like that...  they don't try to do too many things, and what they do - they do well.\nThe servings are huge.  I wound up taking half my panini home (guess I shouldn't have filed up on the bruschetta!)  - what really impressed me was that it was still good heated up in the microwave the next day...  sandwiches, let alone paninis - don't normally keep that well.\n\nall in all a good experience, happy I stumbled upon it.... I'll be back.
