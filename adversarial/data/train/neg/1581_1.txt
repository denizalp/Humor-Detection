This out of the way BBQ is well worth the trip. Our group enjoyed the pork crisps and onion rings before ribs, chicken and pulled pork, all good. My one request is to chop the pulled pork--the long strands make shoveling it in difficult. Got to get back for the brisket and tenderloins on the menu. Service is right there for you to add to the experience. Don't forget the bourbon barrel, it is the best!
