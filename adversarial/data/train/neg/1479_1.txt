Right before dinner and the food looks like it is from yesterday. To add insult to injury your workers are making jokes about how bad the food looks that they have to sell. Fresh is not in the vocabulary. Don't ask for fresh food either because they refuse to do that. Lousy workers did nothing but complain about how much they have to work and how much they hate their jobs. All their customers that come in on holidays are losers as they stated and those who come in at or near Christmas are nothing but a**holes per your staff on 8\/31 at 421pm. Will never come back to this location.
