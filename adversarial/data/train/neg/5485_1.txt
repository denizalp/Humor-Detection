First time coming here with my family. As soon as we sat down the place filled up. Food was decent for a bubble tea place. My son really liked his meal that came in a red car container. The green apple green tea drink that came with my sausage and rice combo was great. The Frits(yam fries) was spiced with a different kind of pepper and we weren't a big fan maybe because we weren't used to the taste.\n\nThe staff were pretty friendly but I do believe they should have more waiters\/waitresses considering it was a Saturday. They only had 2-3 waiter\/waitress and the table we were at was way at the back in the corner so it was so hard to flag down anyone when we wanted anything. \n\nOverall, I would definitely go back and want to try their other items like their shaved ice and desserts.
