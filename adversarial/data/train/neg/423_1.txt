Steve at Mitch's was way more than a great representative. He was honest and forthright in his analysis of my situation. He recommended what needed to be done and didn't use the usual terror to get me to overspend on a car that may not have worth the investment. \nHis goal was to make me safe on the road and was very accommodating to my $ and time constraints.\nMission accomplished. Thank you Steve and your excellent team as well.
