Was kind of disappointed after a 1400 dollar bill for four people that I had to chew through the toughest sirloin I've ever eaten.I complained to the waiter who did nothing but justify the type of steak that it was. I already have my concerns with a sirloin because it's  the cheapest piece of meat on a cow and said to him that I was apprehensive in ordering in the first place. he said it was their best steak on the menu. At $92 I don't feel I should have eaten only half of it because it was so tough. he said he would mention it to the chef but he did not offer to do anything about it.  this is a one time experience at this restaurant I will continue to go to Vic and Anthony's were the steak is half the price and ten times better.
