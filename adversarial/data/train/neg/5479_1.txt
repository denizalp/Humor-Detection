Its your basic diner\/grill.  With no other non-chain options in the local area, it is the best around.  Breakfast is fast, good, and cheap.  Lunch is more southern style maybe even considered soul food.\n\nIts a little shack kinda near the hood, but it serves its purpose.  Everything is a little greasy, but what else would you expect.  Its rarely packed, but it seems like theres always somebody there.\n\nThey close after lunch, time seems to varies.
