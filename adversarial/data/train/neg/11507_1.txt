I've been here a few times. Both of my sisters absolutely love this place, so they suggest it all the time. I'm a huge fan of sushi, but I don't get the appeal of this restaurant so far. \n\nI think their sushi is decent, but not amazing. Maybe because I usually do the sushi buffet, so it's made in mass quantities and has been sitting out for a little while. (If I go again, I'll try ordering something off the actual menu and write an updated review.) It's also confusing because the buffet food isn't clearly labeled! I love trying different types of sushi, so I don't mind this. But it'd be nice to know the names of each so I could get more of the ones I enjoyed.\n\nThe presentation\/environment of the restaurant is not great either. It's squished and crowded. It also seems a bit dirty.\n\nI've never had a problem with their service, though! Their wait staff is extremely friendly and helpful.
