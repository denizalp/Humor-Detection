I would say that this place is just an average bar. The prices are reasonable, especially for the area. We didn't eat but noticed that most people there were not eating either. The service was a little slow and not very friendly. I was not a fan of everything being served in plastic cups, but I can understand why they do it. If you are looking for a bar with reasonable prices, this one is worth a shot.
