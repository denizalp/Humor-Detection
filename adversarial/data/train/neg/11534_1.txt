We went to Azul last night. I was really excited to try this place, but left feeling very disappointed. We sat for 10 minutes watching the wait staff sit at the end of the bar playing on their cell phones before someone came to our table to greet us. The waitress we (eventually) had was very nice but really didn't seem to know anything about the menu. The margaritas were good - not the best I've had, but decent - and the chips were tasty. The salsa tasted like toothpaste. When our dinners came out, the black beans were undercooked and the rice was cold. However, the meat was very good, seasoned perfectly and nice and tender. Overall though, I will not go back. The woman running the bar (who I am assuming was a manager or owner) seemed more concerned with sitting around with regulars drinking tequila than with what her wait and cook staff were doing. For the price, save your money - there are definitely other Mexican restaurants in PGH that are better, cheaper and more welcoming.
