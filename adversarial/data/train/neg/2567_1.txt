I bought a high end Seiko a couple of years ago. It needed a minor repair on the bands of which he quoted me $25.00 to repair. 3 days later, he calls me and the price ballooned to $150.00 because he couldn't get the parts and I would have to buy the whole band. I have found the parts and the band online and they are genuine Seiko parts for much, much less. He didn't seem to care, He sure was happy when he sold me the watch. Now I'm stuck with a watch I can't use. He was laughing while he was giving me the bad news.\n\nHe also overcharged me for the TAG I had him repair as well. \n\nI will never use this business again and recommend that no one does.
