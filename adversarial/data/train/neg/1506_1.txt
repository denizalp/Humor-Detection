The place was pretty much empty on a Thursday night at 830pm which struck me as kind of weird.  It had a certain sticky feel to it.  The service was fine.\n\nThe ribs were very good.  The spicy mac and cheese side was awesome, and both the coleslaw and the potato salad were very good.  The hot link was a bit large and a bit coarsely ground for my taste.  The portions were, in general, ridiculous.  The selection of sauces was great and I loved the Devil's Spit sauce.\n\nOverall, I'd say solid and I'd come again for the ribs, the sauce, and potato salad.
