I really liked this place. I'd give it a 3.5 on food and 4.5 on bar ambience. \n\nWe stopped in around 8 on Sunday night. We had the apple and blue cheese salad, fettuccine Alfredo, and pasta with basil cream sauce. We sat at the bar. It's very nice. It was clean, with large tags, not distracting\nOr gawdy... The bar area was clean and well taken of. \n\nThe food came out fast and it was all very good. I would return!
