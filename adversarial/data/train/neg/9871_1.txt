Ah, Pizza Care...the variety you offer lives up to your name so well done on that front. The price for the quality of the healthy options? *sad face emoji* I've ordered from this place twice and I'm delighted to report that the food was tasty & delivery service was fast. Since the location teeters on the edge of the Hill District, I've never been inside the joint. They do, however, deliver to Mt Wash!  \n\nThe latest meal I ordered was a gluten free margarita pizza. The gluten free crust was thin and crispy. I've attempted GF pizza crust countless times and it's a difficult task to master. I'm not sure if Pizza Care buys their GF crust from another company or if they make it in house but either way, round of applause! The crust was delicious. Their margarita style was served with tomato sauce (not diced or sliced tomatoes which I would have preferred) mozzarella slices (not shredded, a plus in my book) and shredded basil. The basil wasn't scarce but it wasn't enough to enjoy in every bite. The ranch served on the side is a nice gesture but I thought it took away from the margarita pizza experience. \n\nNow I know what you're thinking- why the 3 star rating if the food was good and delivery was fast? Allow me to clarify...the pizza was small and priced the same as a large non-GF gourmet pizza. Delivery charge was a $1 so with taxes, my order came to $20 and change. When I say small, I mean it was slightly larger than a personal pan pizza. Enough for two people but not enough to justify the price. Especially with the lackluster basil and tomato sauce instead of slices, I can't place Pizza Care on my list of go-to GF pizza joints.\n\nMy fellow foodies: don't rule this place out if you're not concerned with the price!
