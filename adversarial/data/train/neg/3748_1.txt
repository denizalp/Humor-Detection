This is another reason that I come to the strip. As a local, I usually steer clear of the strip at all costs, but when my husband and I are feeling like walking under some neon lights THIS is usually my first stop. \n\nIt's gorgeous, open, and the shows are always timed to perfection. Wanna see something even more spectacular? Stop INSIDE the Bellagio and check out their garden area. Bellagio always knows how to \"wow\"!
