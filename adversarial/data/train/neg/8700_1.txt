We just moved to the NW side of town and needed to find a new auto repair shop.  After consulting Yelp, we gave Mike and Doctor Auto a shot today.  Hallelujah!  Just the kind of place we were looking for!  Thank you Kelly & Jasmine for pointing us to the right shop!\n\nI have a HUGE pet peeve with repair shops.  I can't stand it when they talk down to either my husband or me, but especially me.  None of that from Mike or his technician!  Yay!  Mike was super friendly when we dropped the van off, honest and to the point when calling with the estimate and then his technician was great when I picked up the van.  \n\nI was pretty impressed that Mike automatically gave us a military discount without being asked.  Seriously, a discount without being asked for one.  That NEVER happens!  Granted, my husband was wearing his uniform when we dropped it off but that's happened to us at other places and never have we received a discount on that basis alone.  \n\nCan't believe I'm saying this, but spending almost $600 was almost enjoyable at Doctor Auto!  I highly recommend them!
