As a vegetarian I was passing by every breakfast place looking for something more than an egg and cheese biscuit for breakfast.  I was just about to lose hope and then just like the gates of heaven - there it was!\n\nI'm so pleased I found this place.  Sparkling mimosas and a fresh made veggie scramble with fresh fruit a buttery flaky croissant- yes please!!  And my waitress was so pleasant!!  It was also beautiful inside too.  The menu looked as if it had plenty of veggie options for any time of the day!  If I'm ever back in this airport I will not waste my time looking anywhere else and go straight here!  I give it 5 stars for being airport food for sho!!
