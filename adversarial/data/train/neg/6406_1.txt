Best Vietnamese sub I've ever eaten. Visit this place a couple times a year over the past 10 years. Quality never changes. Always hot fast and delicious. BRING CASH. I wish they'd get a debit machine, because I don't carry cash often. I would deduct a star because it's kind of ridiculous to be cash only these days... But I can't give anything less than 5 because it's too delicious, and dare I say, worth the hassle? Check it out!
