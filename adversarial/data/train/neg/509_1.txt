My honey introduced me to Juan's 3years ago and we visit just about every week. It is bar none the best Mexican food I have ever had. I am in the restaurant business and the service and food has been terrific all these years we have never had a bad meal or bad service. Without a doubt the best Mexican food in Vegas.
