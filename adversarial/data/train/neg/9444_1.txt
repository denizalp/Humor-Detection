Sat at the bar first was greeted nice than someone else took our order . ordered a hamburger do no know if we have a choice on the temp of the burger e never asked us. The burger was good however Luke warm the fries were boarserkine warm\/cold. The extra large drink best deal and awesome lots of booze.
