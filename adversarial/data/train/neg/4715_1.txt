I was pretty disappointed with the B Spot. My burger was way over done, (I asked for medium rare & there was not a spot of pink in the patty). The patty was much smaller than the bun so half of my meal was without meat. Also, their pickle bar that everyone raves about was below average: it looked like everything was sitting out for a while, things were so dried out and it looked extremely unappetizing. Our server was very nice though! Overall, I will not be back to the B Spot.
