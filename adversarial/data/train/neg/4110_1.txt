My friend and I  visited this restaurant at the recommendation of the owner's wife for whom my friend had done some work for. We started at the bar with a couple of well shaken martini's. So far so good...Then we were seated and proceeded to order a couple of appetizers. The chef had promised my friend that he would prepare a fois gras appetizer for us.  He was true to his word and it was delicious however there was literally two bites and it was quite pricey...My friends tuna appetizer was delicious but sliced too thin and quite pricey for the portion. I ordered a rib-eye that was extremely fatty and the texture was quite disappointing (not a fan of gristle!) My friend had a seafood and linguine dish that he was very pleased with. We had to ask for bread to be delivered to the table, and you would have thought that the butter was a specialty item...very scant amount....  The service was quite slow and she seemed bothered to wait on us.  I did not send the steak back because I did not want to embarrass my friend. In all honestly, we were expecting a much better dining experience considering the cost of the meal. We had early reservations, yet we waited a while for our dishes to be delivered, There were only a couple of other  patrons seated at the time. It was both our opinions that we would scratch this one off our list of favorite restaurants.
