Awful service attitude! When you walk in the place 9:40pm on a extremely cold snow day after doing your research on yelp which saying the place will not close until an hour later, the staff did not bother to explain their secret closing time but just shovelled you away saying 'it's close' while greeting and serving other guests as usual. Can't believe how a cozy and warm noodle place just turned this way in no more than half year. Would give zero star if app allows and will never pay another visit.
