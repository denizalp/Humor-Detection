Overall, I'm very glad I moved away from Phoenix back to my hometown; I will, however, miss this world-class establishment. They have the. best. BBQ. you will ever have. I guarantee it. I've never had BBQ like this. Generally, I hate restaurants that have the kind of hype that Little Miss BBQ has because they almost never live up to the outrageous fanfare.\n\nNot this time. I had some ribs and some brisket. Without a shadow of a doubt, both items were the best I've ever had. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone moist with the perfect seasonings and their sauce was so good, I'm pretty sure it's illegal. The brisket was more moist than brisket has business being, and was very tender and flavorful. Insane. Just insane. Finally, I had their cheesy jalapeno grits. Oh. My. God. I didn't think grits could taste like that. Get them. \n\nThe service was fast, friendly, and efficient. They know what they're doing. Regardless, expect insane lines. They simply cannot get people in and out in a super-fast manner given the number of people that come on a daily basis. This is not a ding against them; it's simply impossible to serve that many people quickly.\n\nExpect them to run out of things. They make a certain amount of each food item each day, and when they run out, they run out. That's it. Get there early if you want something specific to guarantee that you get it. Otherwise, there isn't a single thing on their menu that isn't outstanding. \n\nDon't let the hype sway you away from going here. It's absolutely justified. I've never had BBQ like this, and I'm not sure I ever will again unless I come back to Phoenix. So long, Little Miss. I will dearly miss you.
