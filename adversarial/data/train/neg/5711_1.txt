Located on the corner or Clark and Queen St... next to Tim Horton's drive thru.\nGreat friendly service.  Our server Marji was awesome.  \n\nThe booth seating does not leave much space.  I am not a big person and I have to say... its a tight fit.\n\nThere is a nice patio but the atmosphere is the busy parking lot and Queen St.\n\nThe bar is setup with a bunch of joined TV's.  Good for a sports event.\n\nThe food came out oretty quick and was very good.  I do think the portion was less than another Jack Astors I recently went to.\n\nParking is ample here.
