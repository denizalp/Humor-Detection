I have eaten at Sonoma Grill many times.  I used to eat there regularly when it first opened and I continued that program for several years.  It has been a couple years since my last visit and I expected things to slide downhill a little (which I find typical).\n\nI was delighted with the meal I had last weekend.  It was awesome.  The food, wine and service were all excellent.  \n\nWe started with the AVOCADO AND CRABMEAT TIAN and the  LOCAL CIDER BRAISED PORK BELLY which were both delicious.  I really like their appetizer sampler platter which is presented on this big curved wooden sled.  I skipped it this time because the crabmeat tian is so good that I would include it on the must have list.\n\nI was a little hesitant to order the CRISPY INDONESIAN GLAZED DUCK as my entree because I had a disappointing duck experience at Paris 66 a few weeks before (I keep trying different things at Paris 66 & I am consistently disappointed).  I tried it anyway it it was delicious.  It was tender and juicy with a crispy crust just as I would have envisioned the perfect duck entree to be.  My wife had the PAN SEARED DIVER SCALLOPS and they were seared with just a touch of crispy on the edges and nice and succulent on the inside....perfect!\n\nWe had a California Zinfandel which was very tasty and reasonably priced.  I can't remember the name of it...EMU or UMI or something like that.  \n\nWe spoiled ourselves with sorbet and the Apple Neapolitan for desert.  There was nothing about the meal that was not perfect.  There was only one questionable thing.  It was that the mayor came in with his entourage and we were concerned that the merriment that he was sharing with his crew was somehow coming out of our pockets.  He's allowed to enjoy himself - as long as it's not going on the city tab.
