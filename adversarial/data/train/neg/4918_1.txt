Why did I not try this place earlier???  We would have saved countless nights of figuring out what to eat for dinner.\n\nWe finally decided to try The Pie Commission for takeout. I called in ahead of time and ordered 4 of their savory pies and 2 of their dessert pies. The total bill came to around $40.  The woman on the phone was very helpful in explaining the pies, her recommendations, and what pies are most popular with customers.  My husband picked the pies up and he threw them in the oven (roughly 40 minutes cook time) later that night.\n\nThey were amazing!!\n\nWhat makes a great pie, for me, is the crust. And I can say that this place has the crust down perfectly! It is lightly flaky, crunchy in some parts, and not overbearing. Just perfect.\n\nIf you are a beef eater, I highly recommend the Steak & Cheese.  Next after that, I liked the Beef & Beer. But really, all of the pies that we had would have made a delicious meal on their own.\n\nAlso, you get a lot of punch for the price. These pies might look small, but they are mighty!  They are incredibly filling. One is enough for someone who has an average appetite, like myself. Also, I have no problems with their pricing - it was well worth the $ that we paid.\n\nThe dessert pies are equally as great.\n\nI loved this food! Hence, my 5-star review. I will be back many times in the future.
