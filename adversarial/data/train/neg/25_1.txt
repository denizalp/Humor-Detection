Not a frequent customer of the place since I cannot grow my small fingernails for work-related reasons, but this is the place I go to for a manicure when I want one for a vacay. Only $25 (+tip) for a shellac mani in half an hour, not bad at all! Had a pedi done before, but I cannot remember the price. I would recommend the pedi here, just because I got to take a seat with those automated massage chairs, which I chose to keep going as long as the mani and pedi service.\n\nGreat service for good price. Clean place, accommodating staff, and tons of polish colours to choose from! Fyi, HD could be quite noisy at times and the staff speak their native tongue across the room.
