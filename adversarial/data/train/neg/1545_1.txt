Today I went to receive a hair cut today at the Paul Mitchell school, I have been once before so I was already familiar with the top quality work that these young students are achieving. I couldn't be more satisfied with the haircut I recieved from Robert Bernardino, not only was he friendly and very intuitive to what I had to say but he was able to throw his own styles in as well, and being very patient with me when I changed my idea a good way through lol. I will definitely be returning to Paul Mitchell and hopefully have the chance to have Robert cut my hair again.
