Beware.  This store is dangerous.  There is a huge selection of decor and crafts.  Not to mention holiday\/seasonal decor.  There are always sales and don't forget your 40% off coupon.  The store is well stocked and clean.   Im always getting ideas to freshen up my decor at home.  Staff is always friendly and courteous.  They are closed on Sundays.  Enclosed are pictures of the Christmas decorations.  Because, yes, I am one of those people.
