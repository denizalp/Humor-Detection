Was hesitant to go to dandelion for food, only ever been for late night bar scene. Was very pleasantly surprised by the food. Service at the bar was friendly and helpful as well. I do wish for late night that the downstairs would turn down the music. Some people want to dance and have that loud scene, maybe keep that upstairs. Sometimes I want to hang out, sit down, chat with friends, it would be nice to have both in one bar. Dandelion has that opportunity, having 2 floors, to appeal to both crowds!
