Took my sister to this location on June 6, 2017. They didn't have her glasses ready and BROKE her original frames that she turned in. It's now September, I called the office and they claimed they had her glasses. Ok, when we're someone going to call her to pick it up?? The staff are confuse and no one claims to know anything. \nTook her to pick up her glasses, finally...the glasses didn't fit. Waiting for over 30min and no one has yet to approach us to fix the issues. TERRIBLE customer service. WILL NEVER RECOMMEND this location to anyone.
