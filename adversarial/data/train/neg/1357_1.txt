This place is off the charts.  I've been coming here for years, and I've never had a dish I didn't like.  The soups are phenomenal, as are most of the appetizers, especially the Tottie Rolls.  I had Chicken Chop Suey and it's by far the best I've ever had.  Perfect flavors, extremely fresh veggies!  I can't say enough great things about this place.  10 stars...
