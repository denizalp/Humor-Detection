I come to Cleveland on occasion for work and always stop by Bloom. I love the sweet people behind the country, the yummy bagels and pastries and the abundant seating. If it's nice out, sitting outside is great for people watching, but the indoor seating is cozy on a rainy day too.\n\nI'm disappointed today that some group of about 10 has rented out the entire downstairs so there is no public seating. It's sunny so I don't mind being outside but there is no reason they couldn't have used only a part of the space, or why Bloom couldn't have brought some of the unused chairs upstairs to allow people to sit inside.
