Long review warning:\nOne of the worse experiences with a \"bank\" I've ever had. \n\nWhile trying to rebuild my credit, I was advised to open a secured credit card with this branch, however they required me having an active checking account with them first.\n\nSo I opened one. \n\nThen they told me I'd be approved right away for my $300 secured card. \n\nThey denied me immediately, but only after they got me to open an account with them.\n\nI decided it wouldn't be a bad idea to just keep the account, maybe it would help having them reporting positively on my damaged credit.\n\nAs of today I've used my debit card only a handful of times making small purchases. \n\nWhat I wasn't aware of was that they charge a monthly fee unless I used my card like 25 times a month or if I set up direct deposit with them (this was something that wasn't discussed with me when I opened my account)\n\nThis first monthly fee hit my account right after one of my small purchases was made, this caused my account to go negative. \nThen they added a second fee of $32 to my account since it was now considered deliquent, THEN a $20 overdraft fee on top of that.\n\nAll of this was going on without my knowledge. \n\nA month went by and out of the blue I got a statement in the mail saying I owed over $94 and that my account was closed by the branch that opened it.\n\nI was like \"what? How could I owe money since I rarely used this card?\"\n\nAfter speaking with a phone rep, I was transferred to this branch(where my trouble first started) they answered \"yeah, hello, what did you need?\" \n\nI asked is this midfirst? \n\nThe bank associate said \"yes, what was your question?\"\n\nI explained what happened and how confused I was.\n\nDuring my conversation the branch associate apparently handed the phone to someone else who didn't seem keen on introducing themselves either.\n\nThis nameless associate told me that I had to pay the full balance before she could assist me, then I would need to reach out to the midfirst headquarters and ask if I could reapply for a bank account...what...the...frick!\n\nIn actuality having this account worsened my credit, it seemed quite clear that this bank brand and it's associates has zero concern with keeping customers.\n\nOverall conclusions: Midfirst might be a good bank for some but this branch is a God awful representation of its customer service, it's willingness to keep customers, and refuses to consider the main premise of customer focus or appreciation. \n\nOh but on a positive note they hand out orange flavored suckers when you visit the branch...I guess that is their subtle way of displaying how much of a sucker they consider us to be.
