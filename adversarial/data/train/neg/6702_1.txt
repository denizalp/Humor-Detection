Love the food but the attitude of the owners is terrible.   Its like they  are doing me  a favor in serving there food.  The heavy set ny owner needs to stay in the backround and have someone with a personality talk to customers.  You have guys like jerry folding napkins instead of being aware of the customer right across the table.\nFood great\/ Service not a winner here!!!
