I had a rebate issue with the office. Basically, a rebate was offered to me by the office if I purchased a number amount of contacts. The rebate was significant so I went for it. After mailing it it in, I received a notice by the supply company that the purchase I made was not part of the rebate. To make a long story short, what would have been a simple refund or credit by the vision office ended up being a long drawn out headache from Sept 2012 - Jan 2013. On the brighter side, I finally got the issue resolved. Staff is okay if you get them when they're in the right mood...but the doctors are very friendly.
