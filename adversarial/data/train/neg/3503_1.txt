Fast service! We reserved a table for a group of 6 and ended up with just 4 of us but the place had no issues with the changes. Water was brought right up after we sat down which was great. We then ordered the food and the sushi and the appetizers showed up first within 15 min and then the seafood combinations came up after another 10 min. Fast Service for sure. All of the food tasted Fresh and just the right seasoning. \n\nAs for the seafood, we only wished they came in a bag with the sauce to keep everything warm instead of having it in a bowl.\n\nAs for parking, there is a paying parking lot across the street
