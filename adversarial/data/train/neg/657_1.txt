Great doctors but their PA didn't return multiple calls day after surgery Had to call their office manager to get help who was responsive. Their \"online\" patient portal of little help either. \n\nThis group is going to have a rude awakening as provider assessments become more frequent. Time to get a clue on customer service! Next time....Mayo!
