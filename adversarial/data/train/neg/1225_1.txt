I love coming to Einstein Bros! I'm on the UNLV campus frequently, and I always tend to forget to eat in the morning, so I like to drop by Einstein's for bagels, coffee, or if I'm feeling really hungry a breakfast sandwich!\nFriendly staff and quick paced.\nIn addition to a variety of bagels, they have lot's of cream cheeses to pick too! They have breakfast sandwiches which I have to say top McD's breakfast sandwiches anyday!\nWhen you order coffee its self serve. You get a cup and select what coffee you want from the side. \nThis place is also a great place for a quick lunch or snack. \nIf you're feeling down on fuel, do drop by Einstein's!
