Definitely one of the best Bookman's in Arizona.  The one's in Tucson are great too, but they are kinda small here, but this one has a large amount of things to look at and buy.  I also like that they are a little bit cheaper than the ones in Tucson.  The wife and I found some foreign DVD's that we were looking for, for only $3.  Manga and anime selection is pretty good here, especially when you compare it to Zia and other bookstores in Arizona.
