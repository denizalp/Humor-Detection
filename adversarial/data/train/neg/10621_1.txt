If you are looking for a quick fast lunch, this is the place to go to.\n\nThere is pretty much not a long wait time as their turn over rate is consider fast. Everything on the menu is basically heated and ready to scoop out into your bowl as soon as you order it. \n\nMenu choices are pretty much very limited so you don't have to spend too much time deciding. Either wet or dry noodles, with wonton, fishball or sliced beef, or you can get all 3 in a bowl too. If you don't want noodles, you can order these on the side.\n\nPrices are $6-$8 depending what you get and what toppings. If you want anything to drink, it's self serve hot tea or hot water. There is basically no service besides the servers taking your order and bringing your food. Food is considered decent, not a huge portion but enough to fill you for lunch. \n\nWhen you are ready to pay, you just take your bill to the cashier and pay. They only accept cash and purposely hint you to tip because most people don't feel that there was any service because I certainly didn't.
