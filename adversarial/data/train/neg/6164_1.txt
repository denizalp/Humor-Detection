First off I noticed that the patio was huge, a large open space.  Kind of nice, but it doesn't look like they have done anything too spectacular with it.  The waiter was nice and friendly, but overall not a great server.  I didn't even get my drink until after a 20 minute wait and I had to ask for it again.  I ordered a bacon cheese burger, which was huge, but overall fell short of flavor.  The fries were kind of boring and soggy.  As I complained to my girlfriend about how many pickles were put on my burger (7-8), she pulls a pickle out of her eggs.  What the hell, lol.  Shortly after that, the waiter noticed that there were a ton of red peppers left on our friends plate.  I guess the kitchen didn't get her food right either, she asked for no peppers.  The waiter had taken the drinks off the bill, which was nice.  But he should have taken her meal off the bill.  I wasn't impressed with the food or service.  This place lacks consistency, according to all these reviews.
