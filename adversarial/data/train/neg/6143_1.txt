PNC bank has one good thing going for it. You can usually find a branch in another state. This is probably the only reason why I keep one of my accounts there. I have a good relationship manager whom I meet with from time to time on financial matters.\n\nThat's really all I can say on the plus side. On the negative side they pay very little interest. They charge you ridiculous fees when you are cashing in on IRAs or their investment accounts. I'm not referring to premature cashing when I refer to these areas. I really feel one is entitled to all of their own money when the situation arises but they don't do that.\n\nAgain, however, they come in handy when I do travel because with their help I am usually able to find a branch in another state. My real rating would be 2\/1\/2 stars but I normally round up.
