I don't trust mechanics and always hate having to get anything done with my car because of them.  I came in today based on a friend's recommendation and I can honestly say these guys are the real deal.  They were swamped, but were friendly the entire day.  I wish i could remember the names of all the guys I had the pleasure of talking to, but I only remember Billy's name.  All of them were incredibly helpful and I have never seen a place that was willing to advise customers ways to make repairs cheaper on their cars.  This showed me just how much they cared about their customers and service.  While I was checking out, they let a guy know how to fix a problem on his own so that he wouldn't need to pay for a simple service.  I was so impressed with them, that at first I came in just to price check them and shop around but ended up not only having them work on my car but Superior Tire will be the only place I will take my car.  I can't recommend this place enough.   They put a lot of my fears on mechanics to rest, a great bunch of guys who do their job proud.
