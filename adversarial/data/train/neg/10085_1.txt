Received a new phone for birthday and it was way over my head! Being a long time T-Mobile customer I thought what better place to ask for help than their store. I was right ! I walked in and was pleasantly greeted by Jessica Lejarzar (Store Assoc.) She answered all my questions, installed the necessary sim card and had me back on the road in a matter of minutes.\nThank You Jessica !\nD , Henderson customer
