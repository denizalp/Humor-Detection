I wasn't sure if I should write this review because then everyone would know. \nBut, their vegan cookie dough ice cream is their best flavour. I've been told it's better than regular cookie dough ice cream. Tastes mildly like a birthday cake cookie dough, which chunks of raw vegan dough and chocolate chips. \n\nI bought a big tub and ate it within a few days. Now it's gone from this store but if you ever see it, at least try it!
