Great Pineapple Martini and some other fruity drink that Larry the bartender made us. Larry was such an awesome bartended we decided to eat at the bar. The calamari was so so, good not great. We tried some Blacked Ahi, salad, chocolate souffl√© with some port...All were excellent. I enjoyed our stay very much!
