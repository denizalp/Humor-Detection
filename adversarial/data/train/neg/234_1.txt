Whenever I am in Charlotte, I practically BEG my friends to take me to Musashi! For three years, I have gone to this Japanese Restaurant for their Miso Ramen and croquettes. Both of which are truly amazing! Them miso ramen always has such tender pork in it, and the broth is fantastic!\n\nMy last visit (which was last Thursday), I finally got to sample their sushi. I have some Unagi (BBQ'ed Eel) and some Ebi (Cooked shrimp with some vinegar). I had NEVER had Unagi and Ebi that was this flavorful! The Ebi had the perfect amount of vinegar taste to it, and the Unagi had a wonderful BBQ sauce on it. The green tea they serve is always hot and a great way to compliment any meal.\n\nThe atmosphere includes a private section that is like a traditional Japanese Restaurant. it is closed off by some sliding doors. It also has  a hole under the table for you to place your legs when you sit.  The rest of the restaurant is brightly lit and a cozy feel to it.\n\nThe Staff is always friendly and kind, and you really could not ask for any better. They always feel very attentive to their customers. If your glass of tea is nearly empty, someone will be by in a few minutes to ask if you want more and then refill it.\n\nMusashi is my favorite Japanese Restaurant in all of North Carolina. It is a shame it is so far away from me, but it's worth the trip when I am in the area. if you are looking for some fantastic sushi, tempura, or ramen, this is the place to go!
