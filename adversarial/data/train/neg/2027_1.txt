Literally live 2 min walk away, and their philly sandwiches are very good.  Usually, a once a week treat for myself, my son, or both.  \nThe reason for my review is more about the service.  Decided to go there for lunch on a school day.  I picked son up, and arrived with 26 minutes left to get him back.  So, how long does it take to get order in?   Just 4 minutes.  The problem came when it was time to get our sandwiches.  I watched as the person in front of us received their sandwiches, then they began making more.  I assumed ours since we were next, but no.  The 2 people making sandwiches made 4 sandwiches, and put them on tray only to hand them over to some guys who walked in well after us.   His explanation for taking 16 minutes to make our sandwiches was take the men were regulars ?! WTH ?! \nWell, I hope those regulars keep coming, because I will not be back.
