Their sushi isn't bad actually. We got the rolls platter and it had 40 pcs for $22. I mean, that's the cheapest it gets. We ordered on the spot and it was made around 10 mins. Some reviews says their salmon is fatty. I guess it is a little but I honestly didn't realize it while eating. Their ingredients are pretty fresh and their rolls were pretty big. I think they put a lot of mayonnaise on their rolls but that can always be asked not to put on. Will be back for their platters for sure!
