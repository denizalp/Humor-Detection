I love this place! Like Jessica said, you don't expect much from the outside, but once you step in, its a complete 180. I live across the parking lot at the Grigio, so going here to pre-game before going out is a great option. I would have no problem staying all night, but they usually close by 12AM. They'll stay open later, but only if it's busy enough.
