Shake shack just (well, kind of...) opened up in Charlotte and I had to try it! I'm a fan of the original locations in NYC, so I wanted to see how Charlotte stacked up. In short: Charlotte Shake Shack makes a great burger (especially compared to the burger competition nearby), but it can't beat other Shake Shack locations.\n\nI got a burger and their signature fries. The burger was okay: the patty was a little dry, but it was hot and everything worked well together. The brioche-style bun was great, too. The real star here was the fries, though. They're crinkle fries just the way I like them- crispy on the outside and softer in the middle! With some extra crispy ones throughout, of course. \n\nThe vibe in Shake Shack is great. I think families could definitely come here (lots of booths!), and it would be perfect for watching a game too- lots of big TVs. Overall, SS was so close to being a new staple in my book, but I think I'll be hesitant coming back (though those fries were delicious).
