Best BBQ in the Phoenix Metro hands down.  Forget Honey Bears, Joe's, The Pits Again, and throw Famous Dave's out the window also.  If you are looking for great BBQ Hap's is it.\n\nThere are several reason's to love Hap's.  But the only reason to love a BBQ joint is because of their meat.  Not only does Hap's have the traditional beef, pork, and chicken, but they also have some odder choices as well like lamb, and ham (some places have ham but most don't).  Hap's uses a combo of pecan and green mesquite wood for smoking (I don't know anyone that uses green mesquite).  This combo gives the meat a really rich smoke flavor but does not hide the taste of the meat.  This rich taste also insures that you don't need to use sauce on your meal (Thank God for wood and fire).  The sides at Hap's are a good compliment as well.  Garlic mashes, bean medily, and fresh made potato salad are some of the best.  If you are a rib fan then Hap's is your place.  They don't serve babys but spares are my favorite anyway and Hap's brisket and pulled pork are very flavorful as well.\n\nIf you are wanting BBQ in Phoenix Metro Hap's is your place.  They only have one location so it gets real busy during the lunch hour.  I would suggest to call ahead and have your meal waiting for pickup.
