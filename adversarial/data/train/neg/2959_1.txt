I really liked Sienna Mercato!! I can assure you, you've never had a dining experience like it.  It's unique.  You order your meatballs and sauce.  I highly recommend the Saucy balls of 4!  The chicken and beef balls were excellent and the crack sauce is a sure favorite.  There's a reason it's called crack sauce, afterall! You then pick your side.  The crispy Brussels were delightful! My salad, The Rocket, was the best!  It had arugula, tomato, toasted almonds, fresh mozzarella! Can you say delicious? To finish off our meal, we ordered the warmed, powdered donuts for the table that came with dipping chocolate and whip cream.  Yum Yum! Lastly, another reason I enjoyed this joint so much was the lively, happening ambiance.  This place is hip, energetic, unique and the food is pretty darn good!! I highly recommend for your Pittsburgh dining experience!
