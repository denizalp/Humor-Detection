1 star for very inconsistent wash. Still had bugs on grill and windshield and tires were not cleaned with $20 wash. 2 stars for being allowed to go back through again free of charge. Even after second wash, my car still was not clean. :-(\nFree self-serve vacuum, but no other services are available such as no wipe down, no tire shine, no touch-up check by an employee, and no vacuuming by an employee. I'd rather pay or tip money and get a clean ride, otherwise it's not worth going. I should've paid $20 elsewhere or did it myself at home. Lesson learned.
