We came here for a rehearsal dinner. Right from the moment we walked in our waitress rocked!! She was very knowledgeable about the menu and what exactly each item was. Some of the stuff I never heard of. It was delicious and the waitress was awesome! If I ever go back to North Carolina I will definitely revisit!
