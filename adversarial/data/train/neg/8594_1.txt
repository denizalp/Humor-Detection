After my intense day of Black Friday (weekend) shopping, I decided to refuel at Aroowha... and boy did it ever hit the spot. The salmon sushi is legit melt-in-your-mouth good, and the shrimp tempura is finger lickin' good. The shrimp they use for the tempura is actually pretty thick compared to some AYCE joints I've been to, and when served piping hot, it's SO freaking good. Service is the same as every other time I go, the servers are attentive and friendly. Will be ordering something from them for my office Christmas party
