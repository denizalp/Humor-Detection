Delicious!!! All of the cookies I've had (choc chip, peanut butter, m&m, and snickerdoodle) and delicious and fresh. They're also huge and you get a lot for the price! The service is always very kind and efficient. They are cash only but they make it as easy as possible by having an ATM both outside and inside the bakery. Would recommend to anyone.
