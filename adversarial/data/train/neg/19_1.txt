I have been an excellent customer for at least two years now.  I have two cars that I take in several times a month for the VIP wash mostly.  I have both cars detailed more than once.  The service I thought was pretty good when I first started going there, I was taking it to Super Duper down the road but the service there was horrible.\n\nThe past several months the service and job performance has deteriorated significantly.  I took one of my cars in a couple months ago for a full exterior detailing (clay rub, wax and clear coat).   I started to notice that there was wax \"splash\" on the black trim areas on the car.  When I opened the trunk there was was \"splatter\" around the edges.  I brought this to the attention of the attendant (s) who all know me well since I am such a regular customer.  They stated they would have this taken care of.  When the car was done the didn't touch a thing and I had to point it out.  I do not like being the type of person that goes around and inspects and points out minute spots.  I should have to.  My cars are very well maintained and always kept clean so they are easy jobs.\n\nMy second car after it was \"cleaned\" and I started home the windows were so streaky and dirty I had to wash them when I got home.  I do not know what they use but I swear it develops a smokey film within an hour after leaving.  I use a mixture of ammonia and water for all glass at home and the windows in the car stay clean for weeks.  When I brought this to their attention the next time I had this car in they wrote on the window with their wax pencil to \"Please do a real good job\"  This was discouraging to see; it was better but not up to par either.\n\nThen I went again and asked to have the floor mats cleaned.  When they put them back in I noticed they had put them on the seats first before putting them down on the floor.  The next time I was in the back seat there was dirt splatter all over from the mats being flung into the car.  they are supposed to remove dirt not add dirt.\n\nIt seems like the past month or two I have had to keep pointing out flaws.\n\nYesterday (22NOV16) I asked to speak to the manager.  i had just paid to have the Platinum service done ($29.99) because the dashboard and doors were dingy looking.  I explained what  had been going on and he had an excuse for everything, then left and went back into his office and shut the door.\n\nI would have expected some type of customer appreciation but nothing!  I am going to look for another place to have my cars cleaned.  My family who all take their cars there now because of my recommendation will also follow me to a different vendor for their car cleaning needs.\n\nTheir loss.\n\nSo disappointed.\n\n04APR17 - The new car wash that I started going to closed down for remodel.  They weren't the greatest but closer to my home.\n\nSo I went back to Full Circle on Dysart and apparently things have changed during my absence.    More detail (not the greatest) is being paid attention to my car(s).   \n\nWhen I first started going there they were slower than most detailers but I didn't mind because they were doing a pretty good job.  Then service sped up and the service and product declined and prices went up!  Not a good business model.\n\nSo I will continue going to Full Circle and hope the service returns to the level that my decision to go in the first place is restored.  If not, then......  When and or if that time comes.\n\nI have to go with 2 stars \"Meh, I've experienced better!\"   Ironic, my better experience was with them....
