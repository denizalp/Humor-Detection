Came here today after my regular cupcake place closed early. Shop seemed cute enough; however, the person at the counter presumably the owner seemed annoyed we came in. Although, she greeted us, she did not offer up any info about the cupcakes and.just seemed unfriendly. I selected 4 cupcakes and was disappointed. The cake was dry, artificial tasting and tasted like box cake but more flavorless. The icing also tasted artificial. Im curious as to how businesses stay open with such poor product and customer service? I will not be back.
