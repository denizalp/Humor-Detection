When you are in need of a slice of sweet sugary deliciousness, The Cheesecake Factory has got you covered. It's a staple \"nice restaurant\" sure to please even the pickiest of eaters...their menu is like a novel, granted half of it is full of advertisements. \n\nYou can quickly turn to the lunch menu, page 8. The portions are plenty and will run you around $10, give or take. However, their regular beverages will run you a solid $4. A nice perk is that they serve their \"chocolate and vanilla\" bread (that's only how my friend's daughter describes it, not the flavor) anytime of day, whether you eat lunch or dinner. They do not have very many vegetarian options, but they do have a veggie burger filled with brown rice and beets. \n\nThis location is prime...after a fun shopping spree at South Park, you can relish the day on their open patio! Service was attentive and friendly and the people working the host desk were all smiles. \n\nI don't go here often, but it's one of my mom's favorites and when nothing but cheesecake will suffice it is my go to place (a slice will cost you approximately $10). Like me and everyone else the day I was here, you'll leave full and happy with a \"to go\" bag in hand with a slice of deliciousness for later.
