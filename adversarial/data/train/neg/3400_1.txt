I'm a big fan of Greek food but I was unsure of what to expect from Estiatorio Milos.\nI glanced the website before I entered and while they do have some of the more well known Greek dishes a lot of their dishes were straight up foreign to me. \nI was a tad hesitant but i'm soooooo glad we went.\nSo I decided to go during Restaurant Week and the food was DELICIOUS!! \nI had the Lobster Spaghetti and was blown away.\nWhile the dish itself when served looks relatively simple it was much more delightful than planned. Sometimes with lobster the taste can be kind of sweet so I was unsure of how well it would fare with the spaghetti sauce but they pulled it off. \nAnd while it is pricey they have a wonderful lunch special that anyone could afford. \nI will definitely be back! \nThey would be a 5 star but I was unimpressed with the reservation service. \nThey opened at lunch but had multiple multiple 12 noon reservations so even though we arrived on time there was quite a line forming and we had to wait about 15 minutes. Not too bad but I would expect a better flow. Maybe i'm being picky.. Idk !
