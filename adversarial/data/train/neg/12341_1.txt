This is hands down the best BBQ I have ever had. I've eaten some of the countries best BBQ through various \"Rib burn-offs\" or Regional BBQ tournaments. And yet Little Miss BBQ is the absolute best. \n\nThe ribs are cooked to perfection, his brisket is the best I've ever had, the pastrami (if available) omg! \n\nIt will be the best BBQ you will ever have any time you walk up to the counter. Just get there early.... \n\nAn hour wait is common and sellouts happen daily. This isn't an accident, it's just that good. \n\nScott Your Food is the best!
