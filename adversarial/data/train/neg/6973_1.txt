Poor experience solely because of the service. When we walked in we were very excited because we had heard good reviews but weren't really sure how everything worked. We told the staff upfront that we had never been in and we hoped to get a better understanding of how to build our meals. The girl behind the counter just said \"Um, we have tacos and enchiladas and stuff.\" And flags down another employee to help her explain who then gives us only the most basic explanation of the process. The staff is very young and lacks proper knowledge about the ingredients in the food that they are serving. Wish I could leave this place a better review because our food was delicious and the price was fair. Management needs to step it up with training.
