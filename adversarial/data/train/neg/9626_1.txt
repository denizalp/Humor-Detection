\"Love\" is like a mashup of your favorite Beatles songs ... that you watch whilst on an incredibly pleasant acid trip. There's no better way for me to describe it.  \n\nDon't go into this show expecting a traditional musical with beginning, middle and end---you're not going to get that. There's no storyline. \n\n\"Love\" is really all about taking the audience on a unique multi-sensory experience. It is a series of unique, artistic (mind-blowing!) interpretations of Beatles songs. It's more like the best concert you've ever been to, and less like what you might recognize as \"traditional theater.\" \n\nIt's about feelings and experiences, not about a storyline.\n\nAt the risk of throwing around a cliche, it was truly a \"feast for the eyes.\" It was packed full of every kind of entertainment: beloved Beatles tunes, dance, trapeze artists, clowns, contortionists, gymnasts, roller skaters, and more--each more impressive than the one before.\n\nThe use (and creative manipulation!) of stage space, lighting, costumes and props really blew our minds. It's clear that sooooo much creativity went into the making of this show. The way that the show transformed the environment and welcomed the audience to participate in the production was really unique. There was one part where the stage and audience was almost entirely enveloped in a huge parachute, onto which a lazer show was projected. It was incredible and just one small example of how mind-altering the show is. \n\n\"Love\" was filled with so many impressive, awe-inspiring, and truly amazing moments. (I can't tell you how many times I accidentally said \"Oh my god\" audibly out loud during the show.) I was hesitant to see this show because I'd heard so many folks say that the Beatles \"Love\" is  only so-so in comparison to other Cirque du Soleil shows ... but I'm glad I did! Me and my husband (in our 30s) saw it with my parents (both in their 60s) and we all absolutely LOVED every moment of it. It was such a unique and special experience, and worth every penny of the $119\/each that we paid for our tickets.
