I had taken my cat to one of those chain vets and they wanted to run a bunch of expensive tests that weren't going to tell much. I called Kaibab and the girl quoted a fair price and offered to schedule an appointment right away. I called back and was seen right away (not my experience with the chain). \n\nI was instantly comfortable with Dr. Wright and he knew exactly what test to do to get a good diagnosis ($400 cheaper). Dr. Wright was kind, compassionate and patient as he explained my options. Although the news was not good, I am grateful to have Kaibab Animal Hospital as we go through our final months. Thank you Kaibab Animal Hospital!
