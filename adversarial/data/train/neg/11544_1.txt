I had the pleasure of dining at this intimate seafood restaurant. I am not a seafood lover, but I had to try some off of my husbands plate. I tried the sushi and lobster and couldn't get enough. I had the steak and risotto that simply melted in my mouth. If you are looking for a fine dining experience on the Strip - look no further... RM Seafood is your place!
