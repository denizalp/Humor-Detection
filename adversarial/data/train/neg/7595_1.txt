I've been to The Paiza at the Venetian but a few weeks ago, it was my first time at The Paiza at the Palazzo.  Both places deserve 5 stars for the food and customer service.\n\nI went with my mom and sister for lunch at The Paiza and all the food that we ordered were presented well and it tasted great.  The shark fin soup was made well with the taste of the broth just right.  The quality of the shark fin was superb as well.  \n\nThe raw geoduck was made well.  You can't really make geoduck wrong, especially since it's raw, but the quality of it is what counts and it perfectly fresh and crisp.  For dessert, we had the bird's nest with coconut, which if you like both of those items is definitely something you should try out.  The sweetness of the coocnut complemented the bird's nest, which of course was also of good quality.\n\nIn regards to the customer service, it was absolutely fantastic, especially since there weren't very many people around at the time we ate.  If you decide to go for Chinese food and you're at the Venetian\/Palazzo, you should definitely try to eat there.
