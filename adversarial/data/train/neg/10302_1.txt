Was here on Saturday before fathers day around 5pm. They were pretty busy we had a party of 8, we were seated with 5 minutes.  The hosts were so nice to my kids they gave them some doodle pads to play with.  The minute we sat down,  someone was right there to get our drink order. Chips beans and salsa were delivered right after.  Took our food order, food came out so fast.  Food is delicious. Shrimp fajatis are bomb.  Chimagana are Amazing. Soup is the best ever.  Drinks were never empty even the manager was right there getting refills and asking us how everything was. love this place and you guys have a great process down of how to serve customers.  Don't change anything.
