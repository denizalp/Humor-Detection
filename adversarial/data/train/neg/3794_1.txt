The spaghetti with clams!!  Most clams I've ever had!  Almost....almost didn't finish it.  Bruschetta was delicious.  The bread was crispy yet soft.  Get the PLT...hmmmm! Fettuccine with chicken, my daughter loved it.  Cocktails, a bit lacking on the alcohol. Stick with beer or wine.  Great happy hour prices!
