I am very picky and selective eating out. Even more serious about ingredients, preparetion and taste now, when I am expecting baby. I am so glad \"Eatt healthy food\" exit and I can totally trust them. I felt like Sheff  Yuri made my dish not for a guest but for a family member.\nMy friend and I shared the broccoli guacamole, which was a great idea. Then I had salmon with beet and sprouts- so delicious. Best housemaid strawberry lemonade I've ever try. And for dessert I picked the pistachio one. You must not leave without tasting it! \nAffordable local new place, very modern design, great service and healthy, creative, tasty food. I would Eatt healthy again and again!
