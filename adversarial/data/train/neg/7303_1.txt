Nice place, great ambiance. Great food well flavored.\nHappy Hour.\nDrinks are very good, try the cocktails , had the lincoln($6) blackberry flavored bourbon martini, very good. Also ordered a 89 ale ($5) good value for happy hour.\nFood, HH menu was somewhat limited, ordered the sea stack ($9) good taste but somewhat overpriced for a happy hour menu item as there was only a single scallop. I also ordered the Brussel sprouts with chorizo, ($9) this was ok, kind of bland tasting but a good compliment if you order the burger ($12) but that is again overpriced for a HH menu item. I've had a far better HH burger at Fleming's HH for a lower price.\nOverall a nice place, excellent service (Esther) but needs a new face on its HH choices to bring me back.
