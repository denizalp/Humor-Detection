It helps to be the first one in the buffet line and grab all the food before other people mess it up. They've got a great variety; everything from Italian, mediterranean, etc. They've got chefs ready to cook you a custom pasta dish. Juan cooked me delicious salmon pasta with marinera and alfredo sauce.
