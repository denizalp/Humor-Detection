I purchases a birthday party package from living social for my daughter's 11th . according to the details , they provide riding and led activities. they also have themes , my daughter chose cowgirl . according to the description , the horses and people should have been dressed for the theme . the workers , all young girls , were rude and barely attended to our party. when I asked about the activities after the riding , they gave me two balls and sent us to the arena for one hour . When I sought them out for help during the party , I was told ( by the girl playing on her phone ) that they are a stable and too busy to help with parties . They never told me that the cake in the fridge was for us , we had to ask about parent signature forms , nor did they say goodbye when we left . My daughter left the party in tears .
