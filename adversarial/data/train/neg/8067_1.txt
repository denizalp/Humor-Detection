Went there for breakfast during our stay in Vegas.  The food was bland.  The eggs were tasteless.  Not even allowed to have salt or pepper to add some flavor because it would be an insult to the chef.  What about the insult to our taste buds?  I expected better from a chef's restaurant.  They only good thing about the breakfast was the build your own Bloody Mary.  We definitely will not return to this place.  Overpriced and lousy food.
