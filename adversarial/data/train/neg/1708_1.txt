I'm extreme happy with Amy. She is professional and skillful. I had her as my make up artist on my wedding day and I got so many compliments on my looks. Hair and make up were amazing!! She went above and beyond and helped me to fix my hair\/ put flowers for tea ceremony when she didn't have to. She even helped me with the dress when I was struggling.  Definitely recommend to anyone who is looking to do their make up professionaly, wedding or not.
