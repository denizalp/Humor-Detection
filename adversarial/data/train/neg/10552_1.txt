We drove to Sunnyside Chevy from our house in Richfield on Monday to pick up our son's first new car, after first working out the deal with Matt Smolik over the phone and by email. Let me tell you, the drive was well worth it...and Matt and his team have some new loyal customers for life. \n\nHaving been to a different dealership a few weeks before, we were pretty frustrated with the car-buying process, not to mention disgusted by the lack of professionalism at that dealership. The atmosphere at Sunnyside was totally professional and laid-back. There was no pressure and it was a very comfortable and easy buying experience. Kevin Chojnacki was pleasant and fun to deal with, as was the Finance Manager, Dave Samples. \n\nKeep up the good work-- and keep all the good people you have at the dealership. It is so true that the people are really what makes a business successful!
