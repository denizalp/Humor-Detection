Went here totally hungry. I had a nice shake but nothing off the charts. I would have preferred something amazing since I make one for myself every morning. I was needing a protein fix and could not really find a good combo on the menu. The amount of stuff they put in a shake is so small, and they had to keep adding coconut water to make it work. I would have like coconut cream, almond milk, cashew milk, etc as an option to add. Protein options were few and not to my liking. It would be nice to say, make your own and just have them put your ingredients in and make it that way. Kinda strange that no one does that!  I paid $8 for one little shake.
