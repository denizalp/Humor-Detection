My sisters got me the prosecco ones for me. Too tart but actually quite tastes like prosecco. The texture is on point, though. One thing: for such expensive candies, could you fork in a few more cents for better packaging? After ripping off the seal and undoing the plastic zip I realized that the zip on one side had actually disengaged from the bag itself... how is that supposed to keep the gummies in the texture they've perfected?
