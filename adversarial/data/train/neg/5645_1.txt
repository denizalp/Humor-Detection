For younger boys (elementary ages), getting hair cuts are boring and a waste of time.  Until....Sport Clips.  I now have my kids asking me when they are going to get their hair cut here.  I love how I no longer see the pain in their faces, combined w\/ a slight whine, when I say \"we need to get your hair cut...\" \n\nThis place does really well catering to males. Sports on the tv's, massages, hot towel wraps, sodas & water...etc...and no frilly, estrogen domineering personalities from the stylists makes this a super win-win for both males and parents of male children.
