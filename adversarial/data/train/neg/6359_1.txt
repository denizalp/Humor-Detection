Was not what I expected. Room was cute kind of small. Does NOT have an iron or blow dryer in every room. No ipod dock. Airport is right there so you hear planes all day and night. The gate next to our room kept slamming shut and making all kinds of noise. Staff was just 'ok' . They hold an extra $100 until you check out .. bathroom sink was taller than I am so that sucked...next time im staying on the strip! Oh...and the ice machine. ..broken
