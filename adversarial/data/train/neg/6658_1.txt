Good luck if you're looking to get help finding something. I asked two guys who were just standing around for help and they said they would call someone. Twenty minutes later I'm still standing around waiting for help and go back up to them for assistance. At this point they're just looking at me like I'm wrong for being upset and get the nearest employee who clearly didn't know anything about the product I had questions on. On top of this, no one seems to know when shipments come in. I got conflicting answers from everyone I spoke with. When I tried to call the store, I was on hold for enough time that I drove to the store from my house and no one had picked up the call yet. This location does have a good selection of products, though.
