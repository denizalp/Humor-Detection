We went in for breakfast a couple weeks ago and at first glance the menu was a few dollars more expensive per item than other places offering the same items--but I'll say now that the food was worth the extra dough.\n\nWe had the chicken and waffles and breakfast sandwich, both were delicious, better than expected.  I can't call either of these dishes particularly healthy but they were definitely tasty.  Staff and service were friendly and attentive.\n\nWe'll be back.
