Makes a great afternoon or late night hang out place for groups of friends who are feeling some Taiwanese snacks or glassful of bubbletea :)  From the drinks I tried and the green tea shaved ice my friends and I ordered, I feel like the food at Cha Me Cha is pretty standard and comparable to Destiny's or other Taiwanese bbt cafes.  However, I think the interior is adorably cozy and the service is fairly quick.  Didn't see any board games or magazines to read, though.\n\n+1 for the cute name!
