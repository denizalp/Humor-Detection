I never had a problem with this company until this year. My AC has been out since the 2nd of August. Couldn't get a repair out to my house until today 05AUG2018. This is Vegas!!! This heat is murderous!!!!! There are 24 hour AC repair places but I had to wait 3 days. Then the repair company that was sent said it would be another week before my AC is properly fixed. You can't get ahold of anybody at this damn company. This is my last year. I'm done!!
