I have no idea why the sandwiches here are ~$3 more than the same ones at Planet Hollywood. The line was shorter than the PH ones usually, but it was also slower. \n\nSandwiches are still good - maybe not as good as the ones at the Planet Hollywood location but I was starving enough to not care. I don't think the portion sizes are any different. \n\nEveryone knows the sandwiches are good. I want to add that the flatbread is pretty good as well. It's marketed as \"healthy\" - only around 400 calories per order - and as far as I can tell at no expense of flavor. I got the BBQ chicken and it was great.
