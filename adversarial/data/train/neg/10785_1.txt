Went here last night with my boyfriend. Immediately walking in, I was a complete fan. It's such a cute, European-style little place. We went thinking it was just a coffee\/tea place, but they had dinner food as well. We only stayed for tea, but we would definitely come back again. The servers were very nice and friendly. The only thing I could complain about was that our tea took 20 minutes to arrive.. And we hadn't ordered anything else. The patio was super busy, but we were sitting inside, which was quite deserted. Other than that, it was a very enjoyable experience! Good place for a date. Took a few glimpses at the dinner plates coming out, and they looked so delicious! I'd really like to try the food next time.
