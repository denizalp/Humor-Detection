What horrible tasting food. Literally tastes like reheated food!! Buying frozen would have been worth our money, not this place!! We made reservations for a belated Mother's Day lunch.  We used to go here for ribs all the time (when we lived in the area) and wanted my mom and mother in law to try. We ordered the ribs and chicken tenders today and it just wasn't what it used to be.  Super super dry and flavor was lacking. ...so much so that we could barely finish our meal and all left with a doggy bag.  The fries were the only good thing on my plate.  Not only was our meal not up to parr but the service was just unacceptable.  I overheard the manager and waitress arguing for several minutes- for anyone to hear.  At one point our waitress seemed to disappear- but I later realized she was covering several sections. we had to request for our bill from the hostess, and even still, we had to wait a ridiculous amount of time.  At that point a manager should have come by or done something to help.  Felt bad for our waitress. Never returning here.
