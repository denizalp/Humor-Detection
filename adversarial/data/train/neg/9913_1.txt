Website says they treat children, well not if they are under 15 they dont.  Although it was great that they took appointments on their website if they dont put this stipulation to their services anywhere how are people to know?  \nThen when I asked where I could go for a child she tried to send me to her regular doctors office.  We are in Vegas from out of state so dont need a regular doctor visit, that is why we are at an urgent care.
