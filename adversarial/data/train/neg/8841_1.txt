This buffet is quite nice, however, not worth the price. Unless you always eat way too much food at one meal, this place is a rip-off and you can do far better. If the price were a few bucks cheaper, it may be worth it. But at the prices they charge -- you'd do better elsewhere, for sure.\n\nIf you do wind up going there, make sure you have plenty of time to pace yourself. I made the mistake of going to this and meeting a bunch of people who were practically done when I got there. This isn't MGM's fault; just mentioning it because you should have ample time when you set about eating at this place. It really is massive, so if you're gonna spend the moola, you might as well take the time to truly enjoy it. Don't go with someone who is always in a hurry or who likes to wolf down their food!
