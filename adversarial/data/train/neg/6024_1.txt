I've heard for years how good the wings were here... and so we finally stopped at my husbands suggestion.  With a near empty restaurant, we were guided to a table at the dark top level.. .no thanks. I asked to be seated at the lower level by a window. Table was small small small. Chair was small small small. We got a pitcher of beer as $3.50 for a draft of Bud was a bit much. Wings are sold in quantities of 5, 10 or 16. What happened to dozen or 1\/2 dozen. Prices were, again, a bit high... 5 for $5.79!!  Best part was the curly fries... very good. Wings were small and very disappointing. I asked for Cajun Rub, but my wings came to me wet. I was not happy. My waiter said that because I asked for hot, he assumed I wanted the wet rub as the dry rub has no heat level.  Ah, he may have known that, but I didn't know that's how they did it there. That's his job, not mine to explain while ordering. We ate off of small paper plates with cheap plastic forks and used napkins that shred with the first touch.  What a gold mine to be close to Robert Morris U with students who may not be used to better. WAY too expensive. We'll keep going to our dive bar - Rooster's Roadhouse. We like, no make that LOVE our dive bars, but appreciate getting our money's worth! Adding 'Dud' to the end of their name.....
