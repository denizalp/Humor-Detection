This is what it's all about! Food that fills your mouth and soul with flavors that you didn't know existed. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly! I didn't know spaghetti could taste this fresh and satisfying. Best lasagna ever with the perfect blend of cheeses and whatever else of goodness they put in it. Just ordered tres leches cake and rice pudding for dessert. I can't wait!
