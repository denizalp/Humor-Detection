Seoul Kwan (House) was actually started by the man who brought table-bbq to Toronto. His original place was Bulgogi House down on Spring Garden. Then he opened Seoul House. His place was always known for top quality dishes, especially the bbq, and amazing banchan (Korean side dishes).\n\nThe latest owners, who took over Seoul House Steeles within the last couple years, seem to have brought back the top-level quality of the restaurant. Food is delicious and perfectly presented. Wide variety of very good side dishes, refilled upon request. The owners are there all the time and personally look in on patrons.\n\nI visited a couple weeks ago with my wife and daughter. We enjoyed two different soups and an order of Korean ribs. The quality of the food and service is definitely back, and the price is fairly lower than the other top Korean bbq restaurant in the area. I think that people are catching on, too - by the time we were done, the place was packed!
