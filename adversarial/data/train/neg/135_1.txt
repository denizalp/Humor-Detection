Hertz Car Rental\nLas Vegas McCarran International Airport.\n\nTerrible service, Manager's attitude. \n\nMade a reservation one month in advance for the Sept. 29. Had a guest from overseas with me and we were second in the line. After 25 minutes the person in front of us was called in and then we waited for about another 25 minutes or so and no one was even looking at us. Few Hertz representatives working there didn't have a happy face, a professional look, or even the skills to be quick with their computers. When the manager showed up from the side door, I stepped forward and told him that we have had been waiting for over 50 minutes and it seems no one cares. I'm in my 60ish with gray hair, well mannered, professional and very polite; but this manger yelled at me that I had to go back in line and wait to be called and then after finishing the paper works I had to wait for at least another hour for them to get my car ready. Most of the costumers were elders and some from overseas with little ability in English language and  the Hertz was obviously taking advantage of these costumers. I was feeling very down in front of my guest, we left Hertz and went to the next door, Enterprise. They all had happy faces with big smiles and welcomed us with respect. We rented a car from them and we were in our car ready to go in less than 5 minutes. Not only that, their final charge was about $80 less than Hertz.quote for two days car rental. I will never ever rent from Hertz or recommend them.
