Been here twice now - once on Thanksgiving Eve and this past Saturday. First time there, it was dead. Second time, it was packed and hard to walk around.\n\n3 different rooms, bar\/lounge, dance floor and game room. Cool layout, decent DJs (Kris the fist was there in November). I like the arcade games. Your typical newer, somewhat urban Phoenix bar. Not sure how the Gypsy fits into this, but whatever. I'd check it out if you're nearby but this scene is probably not for everyone.
