Just left this store and I felt so disrespected and he's lucky I wasn't in a bitch ass mood honestly . I went here to get beer and a bottle of alcohol but I needed to pee really bad. So me and my friend went to the bathroom before grabbing the alcohol and right when I sat on the toilet he comes pounding on the bathroom door to come out !!! So before I can even pee I get my ass up ! I open the door and he is yelling at me like I'm a little ass kid telling ME I need to ask to use the restroom !! So I leave but I come back and tell this guy he sounds dumb and needs to put signs like other places NO PUBLIC RESTROOMS or you need a key to use it !\nHe tells me that it's an employees bathroom only yet when I walk to the back they're is no signs !!!\nSo please whoever the owner is fire this guy or put signs specifically stating the restroom is for employees !!! Or you need to ask before using !!! I will never go here again especially because the worker was so rude and unprofessional !!!! \nDo not go here !!!!!! You will be treated like crap
