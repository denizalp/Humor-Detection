I have been to this restaurant several times in the past year.  The sushi was always fresh and delicious.  The all you can eat offer was a great deal and a main reason that I continued to patronize this restaurant.\nWhen I went last weekend I was informed that there is no longer the all you can eat option. They now have a $30 dollar fixed  menu option.  The reason for the bad  review is that the quality of the food was so poor this time, that some of the food was not even eaten by the group I was with.  Everyone in the group commented that the food quality was poor and none  of us would ever return.  Sushi Sai WAS a nice restaurant, but it is time to find a new sushi restaurant.
