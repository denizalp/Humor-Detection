Went there for dinner tonite. Visiting from out of stat and it's close to the hotel where we're staying. Everyone complaining around us. Took our order quickly. Told they ran out of bread and we could have crackers. Waited a half hour for our food.   Waitress said they were running behind in the kitchen and out of a lot of food. Asked the waitress to check on our food and waited for her to come back and when we saw her serving water to another group, we just left. Poor service and management.
