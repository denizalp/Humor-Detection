This is my go-to salon. Even though it's half way across the city for me I continue to go here because the service is excellent. The receptionists are very friendly and I am always greeted with a smile. Upon arrival they ask you what you'd like to drink, and I always get the cappuccino because it's delicious! I get my balayage done with Dee. She is very talented and is really just an amazing, down to earth woman that I look forward to seeing each time. The salon is cleanly and the staff are all very nice. They always ask if there's anything you'd like (I.e another drink, popcorn, etc). I always feel like a queen when I am there and although it's pricey (for my student budget) I believe the quality of the service and atmosphere is totally worth it. Oh and on my birthday they brought out a little ice cream cake with a sparkler on it which was completely unexpected but a wonderful touch. Definitely check this salon out!
