This Red Robin is the first location in the C-U area. I've visited Red Robin restaurants in Washington, Oregon, and Wisconsin. The location here must be a new format as it is considerably smaller than other places usually have. However, the menu is the same and has a variety of items to satisfy most tastes. Burgers, sandwiches, and salads dominate the choices but there are a few entrees as well. Food and service are both of a standard quality so I have no complaints. While not fine dining, the experience is good and is an \"OK\" choice for dining late.
