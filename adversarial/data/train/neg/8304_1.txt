Great quick lunch spot in Downtown Las Vegas.  Very accommodating with the 2nd floor seating if you are entertaining a large party.  I normally sit at the sushi bar as the chef's are always very approachable and their service is incredibly fast.  I highly recommend trying their Shishito peppers and the Salmon Skin Roll ($5.50) is a great value.  My favorite two specialty rolls are the No. 5 (Crab, cucumber, avocado, cajun albacore, spicy tuna topped with crispy onions) and the Yellowtail lover (yellowtail, avocado, cucumber, spicy yellowtail).  When the crispy onions melt into the soy\/yuzo sauce, you will ask for a spoon to shovel the tangy delicious mixture into your feed hole.
