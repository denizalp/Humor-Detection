We went there tonight for dinner and I'm so upset that we spent 50 dollars on this place.  Server had an attitude like we weren't important.  Our food was taking a very long time for a skillet and 2 sandwiches and 2 kids grand slam. Not busy at all.  One of the sandwiches  came out about 9 minutes after our 4 meals came. We let the manager know... She apologized and never made it right. She said she would gives a discount but never did. Then I had to ask the waitress for a Togo box because she never returned. Just terrible all together.... And my 3 eggs of medium were not even running. Food was disgusting. I will never go there again. It is very sad they said they have new manager when they really don't care about costumes.
