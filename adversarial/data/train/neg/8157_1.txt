Order of jerk chicken and a pork sandwich morphed into order of grilled chicken wings and 2 slices of pie.  Let me explain.\n\nI arrived at That BBQ Joint for takeout later in the evening, and as you can imagine, much was sold out (which is true of good BBQ joints).  I ordered the jerk chicken and a solo pork sandwich to go.  After paying and waiting for about 10 minutes for my order to be ready, the employee informed me that they were just out of jerk chicken and so I asked for a substitute of chicken wings.  Since there was a small price difference and I already paid, he asked if something like a side or dessert could be thrown into the order as well, which I agreed.\n\nI checked my order after I got home--wing entree, two slices of pie, but no sandwich! I agreed to sub wing entree+side for the jerk chicken.  I decided not to call back about it since overall the value turned out to be the same, but I guess it's just a reinforcement that one should always check takeout orders anyways.\n\nOut of the sides, I definitely prefer the baked beans to the brisket chili, and both the sweet potato and pecan pies are very good and worthy of your time. But I really wanted a sandwich too!
