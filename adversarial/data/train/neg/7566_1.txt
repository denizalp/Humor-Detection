I got conned. \n\nThe travel agent suggested I use the cancellation insurance for my flight booking. That it would cover me for ANY cancellations and it turns out that completely untrue. There is an extensive list I was not informed about for the specific terms RBC insurance will cover your travel insurance for. In fact, there are several different types of insurance you can get with more flexibility, like the one I was advertised to which was complete misinformation from the Travel Agent. This looks poorly on RBC, and reveals obviously the greedy standards the travel agents at flight network must work under. On top of that, I cannot even get a refund for the policy I bought that I cannot even use. There is no one manager to speak to, apparently, until the other travel agent admitted to lying to me that there is a manager on duty who will call me back. Doubtful but thanks for pointing out the pathetic behaviour the business is run on. So now I have a useless travel insurance policy, and a flight difference fee to pay for on top of that because I am suddenly presented with many policies that are very obvious to travel agents but not communicated to me before I gave my credit card information. \n\nI strongly recommend to use ANY OTHER travel agency because this one is quite clearly NOT here to help you, but quite MARKETED to take your money, fundamentally.
