I went into this store and was greeting by Gary Glass, he asked what we could do and after I explained what I needed\/wanted he had just the thing. He was very knowledgeable about the product and could go over al the features with me. I was dealing with a trade in that was a bit challenging, after some work on his part, he got the deal that would work for me.  I always wanted to have the car he put me in.  He was great, not pushy at all, gave me the info I needed to make my decision. He was so nice, easy to talk to and I definitely recommend you go see Gary if you are in the market for a new car!  He rocks!
