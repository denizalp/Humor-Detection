Incredible.  \n\nYeah the portions are smaller than most restaurants (who overfeed us anyway) but it is WORTH it.  My husband got the four cheese ravioli with meatballs and I ordered the White corn agnolotti with lobster and it was so delicious and unlike anything I had tasted before.  They were a delicate pasta with a hint of corn and truffles with tender pieces of lobster that melt in your mouth.  \n\nAbsolutely mouth watering.  The bread the waiter brought was delightful, with an assortment of what I believe was French bread, sour dough, and a unique and tangy olive bread.  \n\nNot to mention the alluring atmosphere of a French street paired with \"street\" performers in the form of a flutist and violinist.  Very romantic and classy.\n\nWolfgang puck lives up to his hype with this winner of a restaurant.
