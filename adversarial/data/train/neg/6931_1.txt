This was a blast! There were so many machines to play! I figured I would burn through quarters fast and be out in no time. But the machines are inexpensive (25 to 50 cents each) and the play lasts for a while. My daughters even figured out how to play and were engaged for hours. Besides pinball there was air hockey, a bunch of classic arcade games and even bubble hockey. I will be back for sure!
