I was in my office above the garage around 1 PM Friday afternoon and heard a loud bang coming from the garage. When I walked into the garage I saw the garage door torsion spring broken into two pieces. Of course the garage door wouldn't open now.\n\nI found NGDS on the web and called them at 3:00. They said they would be here between 5:30 and 8:00. They called at 4:30 and said the tech would be at my house next. Gin showed up at about 5:15 and apologized for being early. He was very knowledgeable and gave me an assessment of my door and setup.\n\nWe agreed on a price and he even had the supplies on his truck. He had the new spring installed and working by 6:00. I'm so happy I called them.\n\nHighly recommended.
