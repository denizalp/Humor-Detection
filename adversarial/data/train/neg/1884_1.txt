Excellent food and service!  I got the Chile Verde and it was great! Another thing that I love about this place is that they serve abundant chips with 3 different types of salsa.  I was introduced to this restaurant by my sister.  My wife and I will probably eat here every time that we come to Las Vegas. Five stars for this exceptional restaurant.
