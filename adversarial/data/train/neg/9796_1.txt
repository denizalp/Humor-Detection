Update! \n\nI am happily bumping this to a 5 star rating. \n\nWent in tonight for round two, to give them another shot. After my previous post, I was personally contacted by management and they thanked me for the feedback, said they would speak to chef about it, and that is super awesome. \n\nThis time I had the daily special - chicken pot pie. Holy cow. Best pot pie I have *ever had.* The chicken was cooked so perfectly, the creamy sauce was spot on, and the puff pastry on top was light and flaky and amazing. They have a veggie pot pie on the regular menu that I must absolutely try next time I am in!\n\nThe BF had the chicken parm and he was very satisfied as well. It was huge! So much leftover! \n\nWe started with the beer cheese fries. They were so good. And also huge! Way too much for just the two of us!! \n\nWe left very happy and *very* full. Lots of leftovers for lunch\/dinner tomorrow. Bonus!
