Employees were not professional and the car had a terrible smell. This is not at the airport so we had to wait 30 minutes for the shuttle to show up. I had a rofe to the airport thankfully or i would have had to wait 30 minutes again in 110 degree weather. No military discount or credit for dropping the car off early. I will not use this company again.
