Since I'm new in Toronto, I searched the Internet for recomended hair salons downtown that seemed to be worth the money. The excellent reviews for Evoke salon were verified today. The staff is really friendly and helpful. I had my hair cut and styled by Priya. She's awesome! My hair is long so I wanted to give it a flair and a shape. Priya did an exceptional and thorough job from the very beginning. She also gave great advise on hair maintenance and style. She is great at doing the wavy hear style by using flat iron.\n\nP..S. They give a bag with \"treats\" for first time customers.
