Was in Vegas for WSOP, and had heard so much about this spot and their gigantic portions!!! It is true the food is massive and the restaurant is large. We never had a wait even though the hotel was packed. The service was fast and friendly. The three stars is because the although the presentation on the food was great the flavor was average. It was good but no more or less than a ton of diners anywhere. My friend had their chicken pot pie. Said it was a little dry. I had the biscuits and gravy. Biscuits were good and the gravy was okay. We left full but not totally amazed.
