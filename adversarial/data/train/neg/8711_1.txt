Gadzooks is one of my favorite places in Phoenix to eat.  I live nowhere close but will absolutely drive here just to eat.  It's like Chipotle (but better) for enchiladas.  First, you start with this incredible tortilla that is their own 50\/50 blend and then add your fillings and toppings.  They have some wonderful veggie fillings like spinach and mushrooms.  I usually get the chicken and a side of cornbread.  Cornbread?  Yes, it will blow your mind so do not miss it.  Next you choose a sauce, I go for the verde because I'm #teamgreenchile and love the spicy sweetness.  The red is also good and packs a powerful smoky flavor.  Then I load up with both jack and cheddar cheeses and it gets tossed in the oven to get gooey and magical.  Then I'm topping it all off with pico, habanero salsa, pickled red onion, and crema.  It's just so damn delicious that you will not be able to get enough.  Stop reading this review and get yourself to Gadooks.
