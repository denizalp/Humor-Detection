August 4th, 2016:\n\nADAM YOU ARE AWESOME! He walked up to me immediately upon entering the store, I asked him to run a diagnostics... It took less than 2 minutes!!!! From there he told me exactly what was wrong, he told me what it meant, what it would mean for my truck, and gave me a receipt. He wasn't pushy about me buying the parts right then & there. He was the perfect salesman & because of that, I will be coming back again & again! Thank you Adam!
