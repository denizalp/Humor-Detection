The Security Officer at the entrance of the Mesa office was extremely helpful. He was very nice and friendly. Even though he told us that we had to go to a different location in Phoenix for what we needed to do, it was very pleasant to be greeted by such a nice gentlemen. I had to post because he deserves some recognition.
