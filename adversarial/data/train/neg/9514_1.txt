I live in Southern California and there is an Eggslut in LA.  However, I have not had a chance to to it yet.   Then I saw there was in Vegas, so I had to take the opportunity to try it. \n\nI came a little bit after 9am and there was a decent line, although as others have said it moved quickly.  I probably waited about 25 minutes.  I ordered the sausage egg cheese sandwich.  It came out soon after I ordered, which was a little surprising for me.\n\nThe sandwich itself is good.  I liked the flavor of the sausage and the egg was a little runny.  The mustard aioli was a good addition to the sandwich, since all the other elements are fairly rich tasting.  Overall, I was not blown away for the price I paid, so I am giving four stars.  It was still a satisfying meal.
