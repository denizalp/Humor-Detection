I can remember when this place had just barely opened.  No one knew what and who they were and coupons were provided in the local ads for their breakfast.  That QUICKLY changed, but I know understand why.\n\nThis used to be a quick hop and jump away from my old apartments.  My fiance and I visited nearly every weekend and sampled a variety of items on the menu.  Each time we went back, it kept getting busier and busier.  So, to beat the crowds, be sure to arrive early (i.e. before church gets out or the morning hikers are done).\n\nWhen it comes to breakfast, I am pretty basic.  I don't need anything fancy to satisfy my taste, although I am partial to greasy flavored food.  Our last visit went smoothly and quickly.  I ordered the 2 egg special with bacon and rosemary potatoes and an ice tea to drink.  My fiance ordered the chorizzo (sp?) burrito which also came with the rosemary potatoes and an ice tea to drink.  \n\nALL THINGS ICE TEA:  I am a huge fan of ice tea.  I don't like the crap out of the pump, nor do I like any sugar in it.  They serve FRESH ice tea in multiple flavorings to soothe your palette and quench your thirst.  \n\nFOOD:  I love their bacon!  It never comes out under or over cooked and always has this deliciously wholesome taste to it.  I also am not a big fan of eggs, so when I do order them, scrambled is the way to go.  The last serving I got were moist, fluffy, and not over\/under cooked.  Perfectly whipped to perfection!  The potatoes had the right amount of crispiness and flavoring added.  What a delicacy for my breakfast palette.\n\nThe only down side to Scramble is how far they are located to my new place.  However, anytime I am in the neighborhood I make it a point to stop in for breakfast.
