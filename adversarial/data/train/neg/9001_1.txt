It's tough for me to find an ice cream place that I can actually eat at because of my nut allergy so I needed to try this place! I LOVED IT. I personally liked it better than cooln2 in markham because the have more unique flavours, more seating, and a very aesthetic shop. I got the tiramisu flavour ice cream and it was so creamy and had a really authentic flavour. Highly recommended!
