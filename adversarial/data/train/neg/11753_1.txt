Just dropped by this adorable little bakery that just opened in Aurora.  The desserts look amazing!  I was out walking so didn't indulge but will definitely be coming back to pick up one of those pineapple cakes.  The owners were a nice friendly couple who told me they make everything themselves and they just opened a week ago.  Enjoyed the ice coffee and looking forward to trying some of those desserts!
