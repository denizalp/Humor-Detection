This location scheduled me for an oil change a few days ago for 5pm today and then had the audacity to call with less than 50 minutes before my appointment to say the scheduler screwed up and should never have made an appointment after 430p. Instead of providing good customer service and agreeing to do the service they scheduled he was calling to tell me tough shit and ask that I pick another day. I fucking think not. And you,  reader, should go elsewhere too.
