This place is old school greatness. I can't imagine why anyone would go the Denny's nearby when this gem is right there.\n\nOversized portions, quality grub, great coffee all in a neon fueled diner setting. Open 24 hours. They always bring their A game.\n\nThe Fireside Lounge in the back is a must stop for anyone. You will recognize it from the movie Casino. Bring some friends and order some Scorpions.
