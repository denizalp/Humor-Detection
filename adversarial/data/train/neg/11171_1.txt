I have stayed at over 30 hotels this year for work and this is one of the best hotels I've stayed at. Dog friendly with no fee! That was the deciding factor. Also,  beautiful, modern, robes in room, clean, walking distance to food and convention center. And the process as fairly moderate for this hotel on a weekend. I will stay here again!
