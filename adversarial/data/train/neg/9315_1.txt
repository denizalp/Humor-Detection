I felt I was having a bad dream the whole time I was eating here.\n\nI was hungary, and in mood for shaved ice.\n\nWe ordered the fruit ice, a bulgogi burrito, and a spicy ramen.\n\nWhen they girl gave me the bulgogi burrito, it fitted right in her palm, and she has a small hand. $2 for 2 bites of dry tortilla and bulgogi without any salsa and cilantro. It was a joke. \n\nI was told no meat in ramen, that's fine. But I was not told that my ramen is going to look and taste like instant noodle(Shin Ramen). If I knew that, I would have gone home and cook it with microwave. I would not have to pay $6 for that.\n\nThe shaved ice was not bad, only thing was we had to ask more condensed milk for our ice. I guess only we like things on the sweet side when eating dessert.\n\nIf I am ever return to this place again, please wake me up from my nighmare.
