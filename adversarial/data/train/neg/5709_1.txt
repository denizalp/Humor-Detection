Super fun with great food, we've been a few times and tried different dishes, all of them yummy!  From fluffer-nutter milkshakes to Chicken Marsala, we've been impressed with the food and service of this location (the one at Paris had awful service and we won't go back).  Love the quirky decor and the friendly staff.
