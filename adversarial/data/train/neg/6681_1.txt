UltraStar cinema is a fun experience when you feel like splurging.  I went and saw a movie in the Star Class theaters, and had a good time.\n\nPROS:  \n-- Big Comfy Seats with big armrests\n-- Great Decor\n-- Serves Beer and Wine\n-- Friendly Staff\n-- POPCORN.  Can I just say, OMG...they have cheddar, caramel, and kettlecorn popcorn.  TIP - get the cheddar and caramel mix together.  It's delicious.\n\nCONS:  \n-- Portion size on food.  We definitely went all out on the food and ordered the quesadilla ($7-$9), hummus ($7), and nachos ($7-9).  For the prices, they definitely skimp on the portion size.  \n-- Taste was bland.  The food was very mediocre unfortunately and didn't have a lot of flavor.  \n-- No tray space or place to put your food.  The biggest design flaw at this theater is, there's no tray for holding your food.  So you're stuck playing this game...where am I putting the food?  Armrest? Floor? Lap?  Kind of annoying when you feel like stretching out in your seat.  Maybe a consideration for the theater...when people get food, leave a tray on a trayjack somewhere so there's extra room for plates.\n-- Beer is priced at $7.25 a glass.  When you're paying that much for a Blue Moon, you're expecting a normal size glass.  NOPE, you get a small glass of beer.  My recommendation, stick with the wine as the size is normal.\n-- Halfway through our 7pm movie, our waiter dropped the check off and gave us last call.  Hmmm a bit early?\n\nOverall I like the concept of UltraStar.  I'll definitely be returning...but I'm not willing to pay for the food or beer.  I'll just stick to the popcorn and wine.
