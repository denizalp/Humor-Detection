WOW!  We have a fairly new dryer but recently the clothes had been taking forever to dry (hours for a load of towels).  I was sure it was the dryer itself but realized that i may be the vent after checking some online blogs.  So I decided to risk the $69 to have Matt check it out...money well spent.  He was at my house for FIVE hours and did not charge me any additional fees.  That's impressive!!  And even more impressive...my dryer works better than it ever has before and my towels dry in minutes!!  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
