Decent & Cheap prices. Their lunch time DIMSUM hits the spot everytime. Its priced much lower then any Richmond Hill competitor although not as good its a great cheap option. Just be prepared to wait in line during Dim Sum hours. Huge crowds on weekends. \n\nOpen 24 hours. Local Police frequent this place at night for late night cravings.
