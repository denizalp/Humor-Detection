Fantastic non-chain coffee company in the Gateway District right in downtown Cleveland! I stopped here for a decaf soy latte while back in Cleveland for the holiday season. Excellent coffee and customer service. The owner is friendly - great conversation - and an easy place to stop for a coffee on the way to work or an appointment in downtown. Can't wait to try one of the pastries - fresh baked in-house daily.
