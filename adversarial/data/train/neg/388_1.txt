Probably the only truly clean pho place in town.  The open kitchen layout is awesome!  You can see the cleanliness of the kitchen as your food is being prepared.  The pho is delicious, and with so many meats to pick from you can't go wrong.  The spring rolls are crispy deliciousness,  and the fresh rolls are also equally great.
