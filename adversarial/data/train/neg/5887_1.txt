Huge disappointment!  The waiter, George Jr., was completely rude to my wife and mother in law. Overall, the service was extremely poor given the cost of $50+ per person for a meal.\n\nAs for the food, it was pretty good. Had Nobu the previous night and Nobu was 2 times better seafood quality, same price, and 10 times better service.
