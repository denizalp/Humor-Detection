Whoa, great-tasting-gyro-salad!!  I went here the other day as a sort of pit-stop before heading to Gold Bar when my friend and I realized we were all of a sudden hungry.  I had no idea this place was even here, but we discovered it just driving around looking for some 'refreshing' food.  (who really wants to eat a non-refreshing greasy pizza or fast food when it's freakin' 115 degrees outside?)  So glad we did!\n\nThe place is clean, the food is good, the prices are reasonable (specials appear to be a daily thing here), and the service is pleasant and quick.  I'm sure I'll be back.
