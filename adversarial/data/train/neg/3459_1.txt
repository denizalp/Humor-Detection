They have a very friendly staff. I've had multiple hair cuts as well as hair extensions by Fabiola. The extentions were done using the micro loop technique which lasted a long and and were very comfortable , not to mention how full and amazing my hair looked. I love this salon my family comes here even though we live quite a few miles away. They do amazing hair color and cuts. We have been customers here for 5 years and my family and I love the results every time.
