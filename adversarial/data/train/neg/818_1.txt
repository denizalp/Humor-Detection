Went in there looking for some flowers for my mother. the owner helped me pick a beautiful bouquet and my mother loved it. the owner was wonderful and understood the price range I was going for and they have a very decent amount of flowers to choose from. She took her time and made sure that the bouquet was beautiful. They also have a large selection of vases but I didn't choose to get one that day. Next time I go in to tiny flowers I think I'll pick up some of the succulents that I saw there because they had a very large selection of succulents.
