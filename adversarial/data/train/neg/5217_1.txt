For my third and final buffet of my Las Vegas trip, it was to dinner at The Buffet at Bellagio.\n\neh. \n\nI thought it would be better. I mean come on....The Buffet and Bellagio. Expectations were high. Seeing the long line, they grew. Luckily one of our party showed up early and waited the 40 minutes to get to the front and then they put him in the side line until we all showed up. Once we did we were promptly seated. Nice.  But then they sat us at a table that was a tad bit small for a group of 9.  boo.\n\nMaybe I was on a buffet burnout or something, but I just couldn't get my eat on here.  For a $35 buffet, it was just ok.  I expected more and better.  The Kobe beef wasn't all that great, the crab legs were small and the sushi\/sashimi was lacking quality.  The lamb chops were good, not gamey tasting and cooked a nice medium rare. The butternut squash ravioli's were delicious as was the seabass.  The desserts were good too.  \n\nOverall it was just a regular buffet. Nothing special. Nothing stand-outish.  And there were too many  things that you had to ask for instead of being able to serve it yourself...some of those didn't even have signs. Too much trouble and not worth the wait.\n\nI was nice and gave it 3 star just cause the experience might have had more to do with me than the buffet.
