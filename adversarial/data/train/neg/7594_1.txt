Awesome little ice cream shop. We got a milkshake to share which was plenty for two people. We got the option of all edible rim which was quite nice. Milkshake it shelf comes with very large straw which you can actually use for a milkshake. This was nice because I did not finish all the milkshake at the restaurant so I took it on the road with me.
