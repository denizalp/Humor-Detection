Absolutely love this place.  The food is just amazing. We had a group of 4.  We asked the server to just bring out plates and set an approximate price limit ($50 ea).  There was an assortment of meat, rice and of course.. Sushi.  A couple of my favorite dishes:  JAPANESE A5 WAGYU BEEF GYOZA, Yellow Tail with Jalapeno and the plantain.  To make this place seal the deal of a 5.. The cucumber martini was delish!!!  Can't wait til the next visit.\n\nP.S.  Staff is fast, courtesy and overall awesome!
