Went here a while ago, NOBODY on the staff said hello to me or ANYTHING at all to me. Walked around the floor for a good 7 minutes too...Not sure if they're prejudiced against darker skinned people but whatever their issue is it needs to be resolved fast. Truly disgusting and PATHETIC. Yikes, stay far away. Downtown location MUCH friendlier and WELCOMING. Idiots.
