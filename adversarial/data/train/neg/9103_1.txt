It has been years since I set foot at Olive & Ivy mainly because I had been distracted by life's other attractions.  A friend reintroduced me to O & I this past weekend and I couldn't believe how much I had been missing out.  It's just an authentic, large but quaint space.  From inside to the outdoor patio, all you can see is happiness and tastiness.  We were a rather surprising, large group of chatty women but Mark, our patient waiter, served us graciously.  Olive & Ivy, go there for a happy time.
