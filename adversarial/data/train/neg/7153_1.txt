This little place has poor decor and it looks outdated. BUT IT'S FOOD IS AWESOME! !!  I'm a bacon, sausage, steak and cheese loving individual.  BUT, I love their veggie wrap, and I would have it everyday for lunch if I could.  Their wraps and sandwiches are so delicious.  I have been going here for over two years, and will continue to go.
