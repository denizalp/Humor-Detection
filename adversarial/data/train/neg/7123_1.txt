I'll be honest, I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. I only came because it was my friend's birthday and she really wanted to try this place. Thinking back in it, I don't think I fully enjoyed it because I found the menu limiting. When your allergic to seeds (of any sort) and tofu it takes away some options. I ended up getting the mac and cheese with jalapenos. It was good but SO SPICY! My mouth was on fire! Dessert was a pleasant surprise. I got some sort of deconstructed cheese cake and it was pretty amazing. Although the food wasn't to my taste, the service was great. We had a great waitress who answered our many, many questions.
