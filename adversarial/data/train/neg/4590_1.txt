After looking at countless sushi places midtown, and basing it on the reviews, Echo Sushi was our decision to try. \n\nI must say that the interior of this is very warm, cozy, small with its Japanese themed decor.  The servers were very polite and extremely efficient. Though the ambience and service was rated a 4.5\/5, the same can't be said for the food. \n\nOur dishes that we ordered were beautifully presented but looks can be deceiving.  Both Iriana and I decided to share a few dishes: dynamite, California, Echo Sushi roll and mixed veg n shrimp tempura. First thing we both realized was the amount of rice used to make the rolls, it's disproportionate sizing was a bit of a turn off.  As well my echo sushi roll did not look appetizing that it began to fall apart as I tried picking it up with my chopsticks. The overall taste was ALRIGHT, their tempura was properly seasoned and fried.  \n\nTheir prices are reasonable, however if you do not wish to order a la carte you can opt for AYCE (all you can eat). Echo sushi is mid range leaning towards my mediocre radar.  I don't think I'll be coming back.
