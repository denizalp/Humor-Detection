Decent neighborhood bar. Went on a Tuesday night and, while it wasn't as busy as the place has seemed to be driving by on weekends, there was still a decent sized group. \n\nWe had tacos, a steak sandwich and waffle fries and they were good.  Basic taps of Miller products, but also had Fat Tire. Total check with two drinks was only $22. Pretty solid.  \n\nThey also feature a line of drink specials for Badger and Packer games that we'll definitely be back for.
