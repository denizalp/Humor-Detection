I've had my Chow for 8 years, lived in 4 cities, 3 states and moved 11 times. Needless to say I've tried many groomers all over.\n\nJennifer is so polite, she LOVES our dog Kona and actually gave us a discount because he is such a great dog to groom. \n\nWe moved to Phoenix just over a year ago and this place was a mile from our apartment and had good reviews. It took maybe 3 hours, which is the shortest tinge except for the mobile groomers we've tried (at double the cost). Coming from San Diego where I paid $80 to $120 for his grooming, I felt like I had won the lottery when she told me $55!!! I was so used to paying more I give her a bigger tip. \n\nOur Chow gets the full package cut, nails, ears, etc. And, we just added a new rescue so she'll be coming with the big bro soon. I can't believe I'm getting two dogs groomed for what our one used to cost is in California.\n\nHe's been groomed 4 times here and I haven't had a complaint. I tried more than 5 groomers in just San Diego, and still couldn't get a reliable groomer who didn't look like a new barber working at Great Clips.\n\nLove this place and we drive out of our way passing several groomers just for Jennifer.
