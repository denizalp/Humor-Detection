Great selection of day-to-day necessities!!  \n\nIt is funny.. Now I am talking about really DAY-TO-DAY items.  Like socks!  I am a fan of their socks.  A lot of the \"slip-on\" socks out there do no stay on.  But the ones from Muji never have that problem.  \n\nAnother simple product, the wiping cloth - probably the best that I have had.  They are thin (so they dry super fast) and yet they absorb the water so well.  You have to give it a try to find out.  \n\nI can probably go on and on about the simple products sold at Muji that is somehow \"better\".. Also this location do not have embroidery service.  The one in Yorkdale has embrodiery service for items like handkerchief\/towel\/tote bag\/pajamas etc.  Can be great gift ideas!
