This place is a bit of a dud with lots of potential.    \n\nService: lackluster.  \n\nAmbience: confusing and could use some alignment with the concept.\n\nMy drink: Manhattan was strong, which is how I like them, so it gets a nod here. \n\nQuality of Food: I had the walleye.  Good for the area although I suspect If another restaurant like this comes around this place is toast.  \n\nPrice: No way. Too high.  \n\nCome back? Nnnnnope.  So why a 3 and not a 2?  Probably because the Manhattan was strong and there's potential to be a great restaurant.
