My nails were done fast, they were beautiful and they were done exactly as I asked. I will visit them again, definitely. With that being said, although they understood and spoke English, they spoke in their native tongue and laughed among themselves almost the entire time I was there and my daughter and I felt pretty uncomfortable. This is why I only gave 4 stars instead of the five.
