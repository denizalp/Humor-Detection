I was visiting Charlotte on business and needed to grab dinner somewhere near my hotel. After wandering up and down the street, I finally decided to step into Dandelion Market, which my local coworker recommended to me. Despite its name, Dandelion is a bar that serves tapas and feels very much like a bar rather than a restaurant. At just before 8 pm on a Tuesday evening, there was plentiful seating downstairs and upstairs and no wait for me. I was attended to frequently throughout my visit and appreciated the service! 2-3 small dishes per person are recommended. \n\nI ordered the pan seared scallops ($17) and mac and cheese ($8). The scallops are on a bed of collard greens and something else (I wasn't able to identify it by taste or in the dim atmosphere of the bar) and sauce. The sauce was a bit on the salty side for me, but it was still tasty. \n\nThe mac and cheese was very cheesy and tasty; I'd say it would place #2 or #3 on the list of \"fancy\" mac and cheese dishes I've had. Not the most amazing but definitely savory!
