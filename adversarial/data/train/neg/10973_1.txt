variety of foods i had 3 plates and 1 pho noodle...prime rib were delish very moist and well seasoned, Pho was perfect same taste what i m used to in noVA, their selections are big, not a fan of italian fish cakes but their catfish is flaky good! latin fajitas dish was alright only had small portion of every dish...wish they have more sushi to choose but otherwise well worth it for lunch. I didn't try queen crabs which was a bomber since i was full. This place is also good choice for hangover too :) I did gained 5lb after i left this place
