This place, I thought, was a great find. First I found them on an app called OfferUp looking for French Doors. They had great prices, but they were posted a year ago, and when I went in to inquire about them the One guy there had no idea about where those specific doors were as the app wasn't being kept updated. Okay that's fine no big deal there were plenty of doors to choose from and I found what I wanted, negotiated on the price to pay cash and take with me that day. The next part is what makes this experience a 3 out of 5 stars, the door handles would be placed but it would take a few days because of orders they were working on. My uncle visiting from out of state is a carpenter, he was with me to take measurements as he would be the one installing the doors\n- 1st they were not at all square and when he asked them to please do their job and make the adjustments the men assumed he was hired help and stated (in Spanish) \"why don't you do it yourself that's what they're paying you for\" Not only was that a rude comment to make and assume but also why is it too much to ask they sell me a product that actually is high quality. I didn't pay Nothing for this product. So after some conversation about what needed to be adjusted they begrudgingly agreed and said within 2 hours they could have the job done. This has redeemed them in my eyes, they also applied the door handles, a job they said would take a few days. The operation of this company needs to be better is as simply put as I can say it. The sales person was decent. I cannot say I'd return for certain but their prices are competitive
