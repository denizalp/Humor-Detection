Got the name and number from HSA Home Warranty.  I then checked their website and it stated that Five Star Garage Doors service was available 24 Hours a Day, 7 Days a Week\nProudly Serving: Northeast Ohio, including Akron, Ashland, Ashtabula, Avon, Avon Lake, Canton, Cleveland, Middleburg Heights, North Olmsted, Parma, Shaker Heights, Solon, Strongsville, & Westlake.  However it did not show any local Columbus neighborhoods.  I called any way.\n\nI explained to the gentleman that I got on the phone, that I had a garage door that was stuck half way open and that a roller had come off.  He said that the soonest that he could have someone here was in 4 days.  I explained again that the door was stuck half way open and asked about the 24\/7 claim on the website.  He said that was for non HSA claims.  If I wanted to pay his full rate he could have someone here tomorrow.
