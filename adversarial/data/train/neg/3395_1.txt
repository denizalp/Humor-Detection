I like to think that we're regulars here as we often make it a thing to get our fix whenever we come to Sin city. My wife and I love this place and have never received a bad experience. The massages are so thorough and professional you think you're taking advantage of them cause their price for the massages are priced so affordable compared to other day spas.
