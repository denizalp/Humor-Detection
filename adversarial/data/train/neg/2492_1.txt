Would love to give this place a good review but I just cannot. The food was decent....but something went really wrong when it came to paying the bill. We were a party of four and asked the waitress Sam to split the check in half. My boyfriend paid with a card and my parents paid with cash. She came back and said she had to run the card first and then the cash. We all thought it was weird but allowed her to continue. My boyfriend tipped generously and signed the receipt and then she came back with change for my parents.\nMind you each total was around $65. Later that day my boyfriend found out on his credit card statement that Sam had charged the full amount on the card which makes me wonder if she just pocketed the cash. The credit card company is taking care of it but just be aware and attentive if you decide to eat here. Such a shame because we were really excited for this restaurant and meal. I will never come back.
