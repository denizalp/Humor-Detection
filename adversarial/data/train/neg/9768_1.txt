Came in with low expectations and was very surprised. I'm not a cider fan but my partner is which is why my expectations were low. I've gotta say the ciders are great. So many different varieties and really refreshing on a summer day. \n\nThe food is great, I've got the bean burger many times and it's not your standard shotty veggie burger. It actually has flavour and doesn't taste like cardboard (like most other spots). Service is great and the wait staff are very attentive and helpful.\n\nPro tip: go on Saturday when they bake their apple pies. Jesus Christ they are incredible. Huge freshly baked apple pie (apparently the owners grandmother's recipe). Do yourself a favour and buy one if they still have any in stock.
