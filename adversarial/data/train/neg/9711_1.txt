Really enjoyed this bar. Atmosphere was large and dark and fun. The bathroom is in the basement and very interesting. Place was packed and our service was amazing. Justin really knew his stuff and kept us entertained and well stocked the whole time we were there.\n\nI got a sampler of 4 beers and 3\/4 were amazing. I highly recommend the Albino Stout and the Spice Spice Baby. They were both unlike any beer I have ever tried. Stout was very oaty with amazing hints of coffee and chocolate. Spice tasted like Christmas but without being overwhelming or having a sharp finish.\n\nWe ordered a meat and cheese plate. I loved the smoked duck ham and the Gouda with some blueberry jam and honey mustard. The pheasant was really good too. Would love to go back and try more of their menu. It all sounded delicious!
