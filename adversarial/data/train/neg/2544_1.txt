The Davisville location is spacious and moderately clean. Decor is a bit tacky but I guess it adds some character. Service by the only employee (cook, cashier, etc) was good. He was friendly. Where as the owner just stood there on his phone - which made me feel a bit uncomfortable?\n\nThe prices are okay. Ordered the 1\/2lb wings and fries for $7.50. Suicide wings were hardly suicide... I wouldn't even say it was mildly hot at all. The fries were more disappointing. They were dark, and tasted or felt stale. I think they probably fried it some time before and refried it for my order...\n\nI'll only come back for desperate times as it is fairly close to where I live.
