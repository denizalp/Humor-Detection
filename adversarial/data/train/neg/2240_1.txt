I am not your pompous artsy food guy. I am a regular guy who likes good food and good service. I have been here a couple of times as buddy lives around here. I was very impressed at the portion sizes and the service. So many places you go you get very little for very much. I found the portions well above average for Canada no US!! The service was great but not excellent as it seems to be busy every time I went. Overall great place to go and sit with friends and have a great meal.
