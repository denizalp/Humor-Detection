Well, I came here for the Wed before the Thanksgiving holiday and it was pretty packed. I used to come here back in college all of the time for their crazy drink specials but it has probably been a few years since. It is exactly like how I left it except for a couple of changes. One, I didn't run into any of my friends like I used to. Two, I felt a bit older among the crowd. Because it is Phoenix, there is always a decent mix of age groups, but I def noticed that I wasn't that fresh 21-23 year old who had to buy cheap drinks to get by. Overall, this is a fun place, but next time, I will probably go somewhere else and get myself a nice IPA instead of 25 cent coors lights...
