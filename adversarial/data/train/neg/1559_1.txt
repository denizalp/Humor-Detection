I came here with my friend who lived in the neighbourhood and she always raved how good the gelato was at Il Gelatiere. She made it a point that it was one of the Top 10 Gelato places on blogTO. I'll be honest, I'm not sure what good gelato is. I've had gelato a bunch of times but I could never taste the difference from a low vs high quality store. \n\nThe store is easily accessible because it's located near Eglinton station. As soon as you walk in, the cute interior design of the store put a smile on my face because of the bright colours and the sweet smell of gelato. They have a large patio right beside the store, so it makes it an awesome place to visit on a hot day. \n\nThey have a wide selection of flavours, from fruits to desserts. Whenever I get gelato, I typically get the Tiramisu and something citrus like Grapefruit. Both of the flavours had a deep taste which I liked. I got the small cup and you can pick two flavours! I find it to be a bit pricy though.
