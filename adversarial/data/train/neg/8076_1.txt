All I can say is W O W! I was extremely impressed with how clean hallways and spacious elevator makes you feel like your living at a resort! The place sells itself really. The gym is perfect and they have yoga there every week! I can already see myself living here for sure.. Sarah was my leasing agent, she showed me around and was extremely educated on the property and super attentive. I felt like I was in super good hands with her. She was very professional and funny at the same time! I really want to rent there! Who doesn't want to live in the Biltmore with a spiral staircase going to your room? I am a big fan on esplanade movie theater and the location.
