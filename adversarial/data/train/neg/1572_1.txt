We were looking for Korean food to tame a craving. We were sorely disappointed by the bibimbap which was mostly rice.\n The most anglicized version of Korean I've ever had for $13.95! \nWe had shrimp fried rice to fill out the meal. 4 pieces of shrimp and fried in vegetable oil and butter!! No sesame oil.\nCraving unsatisfied.
