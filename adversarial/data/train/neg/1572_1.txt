What a hidden GEM! \n\nWhy this is one of my new favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh: \n- It doesn't take itself too seriously but you still feel like you're getting a good quality experience and even more important, quality food. \n- Speaking of, the food....YUM. This menu is wonderful, a WIDE variety of things, many I have never seen in Pittsburgh before. We ordered some of every type of meat (the chorizo was our fav!), some wings, guac (delish!) and the plantains for dessert.\n- The waitress was great- I think it would be helpful for them to have more than 1 server for the entire restaurant because the poor girl did look a bit frantic at some points but she handled it well for being the only server there. \n- The cost is super reasonable and allows you to try multiple things on their menu which is great, because believe me, you'll want to. \n\nCan't wait to go back!
