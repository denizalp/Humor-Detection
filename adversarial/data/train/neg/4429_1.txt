So first, I have not received my mattress yet, I will update when I receive it. BUT...\n\nMy husband and I bought a Stearns & Foster in 2012 from R&S. It has depressed 4.5 inches in 5 years! We called R&S, now Brooklyn Bedding and they had someone come out to measure it. Called me a few days later and said I had a credit. We arrived last night within an hour of closing and Brett was so amazing. Very helpful, VERY patient and extremely kind. I walked out with an even exchange and I think a nicer bed (at least it cost more). He even threw in the \"magic\" pillow I fell in love with and I used it last night, it IS magic! All in all, so far a terrific experience! I will report back when the mattress comes on Monday. :)
