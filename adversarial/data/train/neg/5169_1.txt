Frequented their Casa Grande location and was excited to try them in Chandler. The taste and value was consistent but that's it. Ice was broken in the soda dispenser, they got ice from the back. Fair enough. My gripe is as follows \n1) tortilla for my burrito was cold \n2) cold avocado paste inside my burrito \n3) cold hot sauce \nAdd that up and you get a lukewarm burrito. \nIn a word, ghastly. With so many other and better options, I won't be back.
