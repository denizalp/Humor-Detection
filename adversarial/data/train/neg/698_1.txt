Pains me to admit it but Montreal has the best bagels, better than Ess-a, better than H&H. Crazy right?\n\nThis place is very Ess-a-bagel-esque, minimalist in presentation, delicious in taste, a no frills mouth adventure.\n\nMontreal is surprisingly also very good for, steak, smoked meats, maple syrup and turning out TV show hosts. \n\nDo not ever take the train there from Manahattan, you will die!
