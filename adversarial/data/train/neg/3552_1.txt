We were told it was great. So we met friends here. So we waited to be seated...NOT busy...no one was around so we went to sit ourselves and she came over and sat us right beside the other 2 tables that were full in the entire place. Sat us without saying anything...no \"hello\" no \"how are you\" nothing. I'm looking at all the empty tables  so we get up and move ourselves. It still took 5 min for someone to come take a drink order.  Once we ordered food it came out lightning fast. Food was good. I'm a stickler for service though and this place sucked! No thanks! Go somewhere else.
