I purchased the Yelp deal knowing it was located close to our hotel. We walked over Tuesday night. (Closed Sundays)  I had a chicken quesadilla. And the wife ordered the barbacoa tacos with rice and charro beans. Food was good and hot. Of course I got to eat some of my wife's rice and beans. Interesting seasonings on both. I think to owners would do better in a nicer location. But what do I know?
