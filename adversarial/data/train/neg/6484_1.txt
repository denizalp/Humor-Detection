Want to eat with the locals?  Then go to this restaurant to have an upscale meal without the uber tourism of the Strip.  Our service was impeccable from the time we walked in  the door. For apps, we had the hummus, a must for the vegetarian at the table, the crab cakes and the calamari.  For an entree, I had the mushroom  risotto.  The server suggested it as a side but there is plenty to eat as a meal. It was wonderful! By the way, they make an amazing raspberry Arnold Palmer.  We were so full, we could not indulge the desserts, so save room because it looked amazing!  The next time, I am in Vegas, I am going to skip all the chef named restaurants on the Strip and head further out to the suburbs (9 miles) for fine dining, a relaxing atmosphere and no sounds of slot machines outside the door. \n\nNote: It is located in a office area, so look for the big \"V\" sign off the road on the right and then turn right at the next street and then another right and drive through the parking lot to the back area for the entrance. ( of course the locals want to keep this gem a secret!)
