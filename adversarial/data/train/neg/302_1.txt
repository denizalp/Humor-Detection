The food was good but the service was terrible. It took two hours to get three appetizers. I understand it was a busy Thursday night but two hours to get appetizers is a bit ridiculous. The waitress offered to give us a free round of drinks but that didn't help considering we had an event we were going to and were late to because of their slow service.
