Just went today and loved it!  I was hesitant to spend that large sum of money but It's definitely well worth the money. It lasts for about 3-4 hours but when your on the course it seems like only an hour. We had a great instructor. I have forgotten her name but she has brown shortesh hair. She was very informative and very pleasant. She remembered everybody's name and made sure we knew what we were doing. And for the people that complain about the bugs we didn't have any problem with them at all. Probably because we went during the fall. Anyways in the end they give you a certificate and a coupon for the next trip! Definitely will be going back soon! Extremely impressed.
