Amazing!!! Well done Cirque Du Soleil, what an enjoyable show, just a great great time with amazing Iconic music that pays off in Aces!!!\n They really did the Beatles justice in my opinion, we went with my wife and her mother who is from Brazil and we all enjoyed the show immensely!!!\nI would have to say that I would see it again!
