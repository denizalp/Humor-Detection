I've been coming here since they first opened. My boyfriend & I can't get enough of their Crying Tiger Beef Salad. The first time we got a 5 in spiciness & it was wayy too much for us & we actually enjoy spice! Now we get a 2-21\/2 & it's perfect. Can't find anything to compare to this salad. Mmm!!!
