I appreciate great customer service! If the server, cook etc. makes a mistake with my order, I expect for it to be corrected properly. I should not have to compromise as the consumer. My experience today was that I ordered the Green Curry Shrimp and asked if the eggplant could be substituted with Zucchini  and I also asked for an extra side of rice. The eggplant was not substituted with the Zucchini and I didn't get the extra side of rice to eat with my entr√©e. I mentioned to the server and she said she would steam some Zucchini and remove the rice from my bill. The issue was that my dish was cooked in a sauce, therefore I asked if the Zucchini be cooked in the sauce as it would have been if the order was correct and I would have been satisfied. She could not fulfill that request. I mentioned to the owner which is the older lady that takes the money and she said I had to take it up with the server. My coworkers enjoy this restaurant and my food is usually good but I'm not sure if I will re-visit.
