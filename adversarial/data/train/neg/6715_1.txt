This place is my heaven. :D\n\nI went here one night with my boyfriend and we were both pleasantly surprised at how amazing both the food and beers are!\n\nWe went in the early evening and had no trouble getting a table. I ordered the ostrich burger with carmelized onions and goat cheese. He ordered a buffalo burger with green peppercorn and beer sauce. The burgers came with a side of their homemade french fries and a small side salad. \n\nMy food was DELICIOUS! I wouldn't change anything about it. My boyfriend enjoyed his beer and burger, but was open to trying new things next time we visit.\n\nThe service was good, not something to rave or complain about. The selection of beers is ridiculously good, with over 100 beers to choose from. Some of them are from local microbreweries, while others are really tasty imports from several different countries. \n\nGood food and good beers... heaven.
