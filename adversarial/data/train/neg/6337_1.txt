Would recommend many others places in Vegas and on this trip I had a chance to try four restaurants in four nights, and Onda was my least favorite.\n\nThe restaurant is in the Mirage, which is where they hold the Beatles \"Love\" show by Cirque du Soleil. The hotel is a bit dated and a bit smokier than the new hotels.\n\nOn to Onda - it's a traditional Italian restaurant. \n\nThe app was the best part - Prosciutto w\/ Parmiagano and 25 yr old balsamic.\n\nThe entree was Olive Garden - Ordered Ravioli stuffed with Lobster and Shrimp served in a Broccoli Rabe Puree...I thought it would be significantly lighter than what came out - Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli in a heavy buttery cream sauce that puts you straight to bed.\n\nThe service overall was a letdown based on what I expect in Las Vegas, even from an older hotel. We had a group of eight, three separate times had to motion a waiter over for service.
