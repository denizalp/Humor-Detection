This is a great place!  They sometimes do have a long line and some some extra cashiers but here's a helpful hint: most times if there is a long line you can pay with a credit card inside the hotel.  Overall the staff is very friendly and helpful and the grooming salon is wonderful as is the Banfield located in the store.  Their staff and nurses are some of the best we have experienced since we started using Banfield!!
