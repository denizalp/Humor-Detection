Very professional, clean massage. Guys should wear gym shorts as they do not have you fully undress for the massage. Great pressure and the masseuse worked every knot in my back to its death. Very little attention to the feet for a place with this moniker. Not really a \"full body\" massage, but the parts they do hit are done very well.
