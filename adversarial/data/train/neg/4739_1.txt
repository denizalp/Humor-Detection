I am still waiting to see this place of the food network or travel channel on one of them shows. I don't understand why they haven't made it yet?!?! Because the CAPISTRAMI has to be one of the best pastrami sandwiches in the world. No it's not your Italian deli pastrami but I'm not Italian so I don't care. It's dam good! And the BOBBIE! OMG the BOBBIE will smack you in the face. Imagine a turkey dinner with all the fixin's in a sandwich. And the turkey is fresh. It's not your deli sliced turkey. This is chunks of real turkey which you will never find at any other sandwich shop. This makes me sad that I haven't eating meat. So yesterday I tried the VEGGIE CHEESESTEAK! It tastes just like the real thing. It's some soy meat stuff but it's pretty good. Kinda chewy. But I'm giving it 5 stars because the CAPISTRAMI AND BOBBIE are two of the most original and tastiest sandwiches ever. And this is the only place you can order cranberry with your sandwich in Vegas. At least from the places I've been.
