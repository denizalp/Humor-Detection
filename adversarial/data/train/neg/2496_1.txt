Use to love taking my maltipoo here I've been bringing him here for about a year now. It's become very inconvenient now they won't answer the phone or call back as they say they will. My little canelo is now matted due to the fact I've been calling for the past 2 weeks and NOTHING!  I live a minute away literally so it sucks now I have to find somewhere else to take him even though there's see spot clean right across the street from me.. whatever!
