no stars not only was my late pizza, wrong, & a fairly decent tip. When I talked to the \"manager\" he told me that \"He made it right by remaking my pizza\"...smh. I work 12 hr days and I have a dog so I dont have time for a 2+hr mess up...Especially considering a representative of the company can't take the blame. I sure long for my money pizza place in Federal Way, WA....Pizza pizzazz.
