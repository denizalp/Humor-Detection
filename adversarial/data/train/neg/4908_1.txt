I was taken to Chada by a friend while visiting Vegas. I'd lived in Vegas for a couple of years and was well acquainted with the Thai offerings: Lotus of Siam, Archies, and Krung among them. The meal I had at Chada surpassed them all. \n\nI won't go into extensive detail. Suffice to say that the fresh oysters, crab curry, and ribeye with mint sauce. All were exceptional. I was hoping to get back again before my trip ended. I can't recommend this highly enough.
