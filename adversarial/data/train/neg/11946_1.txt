Hubby and I came in for a date on a cool October afternoon.   The ambience of this restaurant is cozy and inviting, and the decor is fairly modern.  Since we were having a late lunch, we only ordered the soups and bubble teas.  My rare beef and beef ball pho was flavourful (you definitely can taste the aromatics infused in the broth) and it was served steaming hot.   A lot of care went into the broth itself--it was the clearest and cleanest I've ever tasted.  Although one can only order the pho in one size only, it is a fairly large serving at an affordable price ($9.99 to $10.99). I do wish that they would have given me more rice noodles, though.  The pho comes with your own individual plate of bean sprouts, lime and fresh basil.  \nThe mango bubble tea was made fresh(no powder).  Be sure to ask the server, since some bubble teas are made with flavoured powders...\n        On my second visit a week later, I ordered the spring roll appetizer(crispy and hot off the fryer) with my son, which we gave it the thumbs up!
