We recently moved to midtown Phoenix and needed to find a new cat sitter.  It's always hard to give someone you just met a key to your home and leave town, but after reading the previous reviews on Yelp I decided to give Jen a call and I'm glad I did.  She came over as promised to meet with us and took notes about our needs and a few days later off we went for a weekend get-a-away.  We had a little problem as I gave her the wrong key (totally my fault) but it all worked out in the end.  Oh, and our kitty even got a report card and a new kitty toy (left by Jen).  Jen's our new go-to when we have to leave town.  Thanks for everything Jen!
