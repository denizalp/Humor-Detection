Dr. Deshazo has been a Godsend for me.  I recently moved to the LV area from SoCa.  With a long history of multiple medical issues, the prospect of finding a new doctor was daunting.  Somehow with a google search I stumbled upon Dr D.  At the first appt I was immediately struck by his kind, empathetic nature.  You will not find a more empathetic doctor -  I've had dozens of dr's over the years and he has been the most understanding & empathetic I've ever found.  Aside from his caring nature, Dr. D is EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the body, it's various systems, as well as, current and alternative treatment options.  He has helped me so much already -  if you have a medical issue, see him.  He gets an A++++ from me and I'm a tough critic.
