I've been visiting this location for little longer than a week and from very beginning was impressed with the stuff and equipment available. As stated in previous review, it is located in the basement but it is nice, new , big and clean. First time I came in I didn't have my own lock for the available lockers.  The girl at the front desk removed the lock from the cabinet behind her and gave it to me with a smile saying \"no problem\". Stuff is there til 10 pm during the regular business days and til 6 pm weekends. So that's quite enough if you need their help.\nSaturday evenings are quietest but during the week in the early evening gets very busy..But still no problem getting a locker or using equipment. I got the black card membership, just to say honestly, I don't see any reason to go anywhere else..really like this one.
