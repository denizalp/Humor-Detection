The wait at this place is ridiculous. I've been to different Sonora quests in Phoenix where the walk in wait wasn't too bad. They tell you it's an hour when you walk in....but I've been here almost 2 hours now and half the waiting room was here before me. This is getting ridiculous. They are extremely slow. Why even take walk ins if they're going to make you spend the whole day here?
