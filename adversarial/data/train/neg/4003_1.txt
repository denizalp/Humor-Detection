I need to return to try other stuff. I only got a quick lunch to go-ground beef and egg. IHOP you got nothing on this flavor. So good.\n\nI did return I got what the menu said was veggies and homemade cheese. The waitress asked if I wanted egg on it to I said yes. Unfortunately when the meal come the was no homemade cheese on it which was the only reason I ordered it. Again I got the meal to go so I could ask what happened to the cheese.
