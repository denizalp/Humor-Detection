There are so many good reviews of this place on Yelp that I'm left wondering whether we hit them on a bad day. \n\nWe made a special trip from the Strip, arriving at 11h00 on a Friday morning. About half the tables were occupied. We were seated immediately. No trouble with the service - drinks and the carts arrived quickly. We selected the sticky rice, shrimp pastry, bbq pork bun, pork siu mai and the shrimp har gow. The sticky rice was acceptable, and I did enjoy the shrimp pastry. The other items were not to my liking.  It seemed that the ingredients were of poor quality, as opposed to the skill of the chef in preparing them.\n\nWe have enjoyed dim sum in many different cities and countries, as we try to make a point of having it at least once per trip. On this same trip we went to Noodles in Bellagio; while it was twice as much (almost to the penny), we enjoyed it much more than Ping Pang Pong.   It is unlikely that we would return, because it's not worth the hike from the strip for this level of quality.
