This is a favorite spot of ours. Always delicious food and drinks. All of the sushi is always fresh. The Hamachi Kama is an absolute must try! Located on Carson and 6th (aka about a minute walk off Fremont), we never have a problem parking close. Make sure you stop in the next time you are in Vegas!
