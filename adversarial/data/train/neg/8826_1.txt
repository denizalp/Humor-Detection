Not my favorite or the nearest theater to me but sometimes you just have to be here. Like the Suncoast up the road they cater to playing a lot of independent films and small run films. Pricing is like most theaters around town for tickets and concessions. As one of the early theaters before wide spread stadium seating sight lines are OK and no reclining seats like in newer places.
