This place is just completely and utterly charming. I went with some old friends for lunch and we sat outside at the picnic tables under an umbrella and had a great time. The food was delicious and fresh (sandwiches, salads, fruit) and the ambiance with the trees, gardens and birds chirping nearby was just enchanting. It's like an oasis in the middle of the desert.
