Called the shop and got to talk to a guy called \"Raffy.\" Asked about a phone and said the he has it available and has only one left. Got there and asked for the phone. He kept on looking in the back of his store but nothing. At one point even asked if I wanted a different one. Made me wait for a long time with nothing. Left the place... Wasted my time driving over there..\nDon't go there. Rude person.
