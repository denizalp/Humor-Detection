My son has been attending Wonderland Montessori for about a year now and he is the happiest he has ever been at any school\/daycare. I should say that the main difference between WMA and the places he was at before (Tutor time etc) was that this is a school and daycares only watch your child until you arrive. My son is being introduced to quantities, science, art, politeness, and is being challenged at his own pace. The headmaster, Ms. Golanski, is so passionate about the children and the quality of education that the children receive. She is receptive to feedback and always keeps her office open to parents and the children who attend WMA. I'm so thankful to have my son enrolled there.
