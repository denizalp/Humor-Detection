I went here for lunch today and I am definitely going back. To start, beautiful restaurant. The seats are comfortable, the ambiance is relaxing and fresh, and the service is impeccable.\nI started with a lovely tomato soup that came with a grilled toast place within the soup topped with goat cheese. Absolutely delicious.\nI had the halibut which came with a lovely couscous and orzo side that was absolutely delicious. The halibut was cooked perfectly and the size was perfect for lunch.\nI then had a zabaglione for dessert and it was really good, similar to strawberry shortcake in the best way.\nMy friend started with a lovely salad and followed with a beautiful chicken breast with salad and summer vegetables. It too was incredibly good. \nThese were off of the power lunch menu, which we really liked. It allows you to have an appetizer followed by an entr√©e and dessert, and all are just the right size to have you full by the time you're done. The portions are generous without being overbearing.\nThe dishes are absolutely beautiful when they come to your table.\nThe glass of Prosecco was just the perfect amount of sweetness without being overbearing.\nThe prices are reasonable, and once again, the service is bar none one of the best in town.\nThis restaurant is an absolute must if you have never been here and a place people will go to over and over again if they have. 5+ stars.
