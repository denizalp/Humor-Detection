I ordered two sets of locks. They arrived in two shipments in two weeks. upon opening, the locks were dented and rusted. I emailed them for a return and they promised to send over new locks the next day. I would wait until few days later, got an email again telling me to send them the pictures of the dented products or else they will not send the replacement. I thought, wait a minute, you did not allow me to return the junk, and then want me to prove that to you before you can send me the replacement? what kind of customers service it is? never ever buy from them.
