So the worst thing in the world happened. I tried to turn on my TV and it wouldn't start. So instead of buying a new TV I called them up. I was surprised they came out the same day. The tech that came out was knowledgable and I didn't feel like he was trying to rip me off. He was honest and had Great customer service. If you need tv repair tv I would definitely recommend them.
