I really love the 80's feel at this place and the fact that it is open all night.  Go in and sit by the fire in the bar if you are over 21.  Have some cocktails and appetizers.  Or sit in the main area and have a full meal.  I can get Oatmeal with fruit and brown sugar 24 hours a day.  I really like Breakfast around midnight.  My friends were happy with the regular food items though it can feel a little pricey for the food and drinks.  Give yourself time.  The wait staff is somewhat slow and they are always packed.  We met up with friends to eat something before their flight and it took almost an hour to get food.
