U.S. Egg has been a family favorite for years (Tempe location).  It isn't somewhere to go for a gourmet meal, but for high quality American breakfast food, it's a winner.  The wait staff is always great about substitutions, the guys (owners) at the front are charming and the food comes out quickly.  I am an egg white omelet girl, but my parents love the protein pancakes that are full of granola and blueberries.
