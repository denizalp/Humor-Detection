OMG this place is delicious! Went there for breakfast this morning with a couple of my girls. I had the smoked salmon benny- wild caught salmon (not nasty farmed!) smoked in house. It had the BEST delicious smoked flavor... SO good!! And the accompanying potatoes- sooo flavorful. To die for! They even brought us out some cinnamon chip things with nutella banana dip.. \nI can't wait to go back and try more dishes! A little hard to find (right across from Tran MD)  but well worth it!!
