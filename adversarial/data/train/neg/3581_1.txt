This place seems to be an average fast food place. I got the grilled chicken sandwich combo meal #7.  I got the fruit cup in lieu of fries, and a diet coke to drink.  The sandwich tasted OK although I've had better at other chick-fil-a's.  The fruit was good with strawberries, blueberries, apple pieces, and orange slices. The cashier filled the styrofoam cup all the way to the top with ice and then added the soda.  Trying to put the straw in the cup forced an ice cube out the side of the styrofoam cup.  It was a disaster lol.
