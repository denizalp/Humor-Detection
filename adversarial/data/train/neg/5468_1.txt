This is one of the better meals we had since we have been here. I saw the great ratings and with so many other places we almost missed out. I am so glad we didn't. Let me start by saying the bread with carmalized onions is heavenly. We had the truffle chips as an appetizer and they were very good. My husband had the pork chop which he loved and smelled amazing. I had the gnocchi and that was delicious. The staff is very attentive and it is very comfortable here. Do not miss out you will love it here.
