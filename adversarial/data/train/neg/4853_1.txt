So disappointed in the $60 bouquet I sent to my neice today. I live out of state so I called to ask for a special bouquet all in Pink for the birth of the new baby. Orange and yellow daisies, a few pink carnations and loads of baby breath. I'm embarrassed now after my sister notified me and sent a picture. If they didn't have all pink they should have informed me. Total cost over $80, what a shame I have to look for another florist in the Chandler area.
