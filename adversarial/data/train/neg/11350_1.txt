First this is really a dance performance more than anything, with spectacular visuals set against Beatles music. Those expecting acrobatics will be disappointed, but there are a few outstanding acts here and there. \n\nI felt that the start of the show was a little messy and contrived. But by the third or fourth song the show had hit its stride, and it got really enjoyable. One thing to note I wasn't a big fan of how my favorite Beatles' song was interpreted. Oh and try to sit in the second section for the best view!
