I was super excited to try this place after reading about it on another website. The menu online sounded delicious. It turned out to be a total disappointment and I wish I had read some reviews beforehand. \n\nWe visited on Valentine's Day, though it was not busy at all. Perhaps because it was early (we were going to a show later). Dinner was a prix fixe for $95 per person (we were notified of this two days before, not at the time of the reservation). \n\nThe food was not 'bad' but generally just lacked flavor. For appetizers we had Glazed Walnut Prawns and Squab with Lettuce (literally chicken lettuce wraps since it is apparently made with chicken). Entrees were Black Pepper Lobster and Velvet Chicken and were served with Pineapple Fried Rice (not sure there was actually pineapple in it or that it was fried) and Exotic Mushrooms (a mix of shiitake and king oyster mushrooms, some of which seemed under cooked). Chef's Choice desserts tasted like they came out of a box. \n\nDecor in the dining room is unique and interesting and the staff was all friendly but service was definitely sub par for what I was expecting. Overall, the food was mediocre and it was just a terrible value.
