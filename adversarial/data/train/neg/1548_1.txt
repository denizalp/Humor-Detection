Not impressed at all!  The first time we ordered drinks our server forgot our drinks and the second time we had to ask if we could have more drinks.\nI ordered, white frutti di mare for 24.49 and I only got 2 scallops and 3 small shrimps.  Our bill was $120. 00\nWay to pricey for 2 scallops and pasta.
