Do not trust their website menu.  I checked out their menu, then decided to try it out.  What a sticker shock when I checked out.  I ordered the four piece dark with two sides.  According to menu online, I should have been charged $6.25 for the chicken and $4.00 for the sides.  Not the case.  I was charged $11.25 for the chicken and $2.50 for each side.  Total bill with tax was $17.59 what a BIG difference.  Everything I received was just OK, nothing specIal.  I did ask the cashier about the difference was told that the menu pricing as posted online was incorrect.  Do not believe I will return, can buy a whole chicken at Costco for half the price.
