We went here on our trip to Vegas and had dinner. It was an open restaurant inside MGM grand. We don't have a reservation but we got seated right away inspite of the crowd. We ordered, the calamari and truffled potato chips and both are Hella good! Then I saw this beautiful pasta dishes. I remember my husband got the pasta with clams and mussels I tasted it too and I love it. I ordered the ravioli with pancetta green peas... I love it too...and for the dessert we tried this lemon bar cake that is tangy and not too sweet... It is quite good. Wolfgang knows what he's doin for sure. He has some more resto in Caesars palace and next time Im goin to try them when I get back to Vegas... What I like with it is the fair prices...  Wolfgang pucks creations in a good price....
