Great breakfast spot, quick service, and friendly staff. Stopped in for breakfast last weekend, got the pancakes which were extremely big and good! My husband got the biscuits and gravy, which he said were delicious... ask for an extra biscuit and it's perfect. Although it's a chain, their food all seems fresh, and the prices are very reasonable. We will definitely come back.
