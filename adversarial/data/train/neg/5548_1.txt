Nom. From their wood fired pizzas, to their salads, to their appetizers, to their drinks, this place was a consistent delight for my drunk friends and myself. We probably spent at least $200 over a course of 3 days. They are opened pretty late (4 am?) and you can sit at the bar to order take out to stuff your face in the privacy of your hotel room. \n\nPrices are expensive, but not the level of a fancy restaurant so definitely doable for Vegas.
