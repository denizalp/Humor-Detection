Delicious, affordable and we will return.  We were here recently and wanted to experience a famous buffet.  We got there right as breakfast was ending so we ate breakfast and at 11am the lunch food was served so we ate most of that.  Drinks such as wine and beer were included and it was great.  This place is a must and anyone in the area looking for a buffet needs to go.
