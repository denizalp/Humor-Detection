Food was good but not great. Caprese salad was decent but was seriously short on the balsamic reduction which was a bummer. Risotto was done well but lacked something. Waiter was sort of snarky. Nice looking main room but if you get seated in the other room all sounds echo and you can hear all the conversations around you. Stay in the main room if possible. Nothing to write home about.
