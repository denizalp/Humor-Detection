Terrible location, ease of access is non-existant and parking lot layout is rather odd and inefficient.\n\nSeems to be a common trend in the south hills area-see my review for the Starbucks that's somewhere around here too.\n\nEmployees are extremely slow, wait area was dirty and men's room looked like it hadn't been clean in weeks.\n\nCoffee was fine.\n\nFor overall experience, I'm glad I'll never be at this one again - compared to the Shaler Twp and Wexford location, this on pales in comparison.
