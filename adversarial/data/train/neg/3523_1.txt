Cool exhibit with nice movie props from the Avengers and Marvel movies. Some of the interactive displays are interesting. I wouldn't pay full price for this so definitely look for discounts from Yelp or other services, and it's also worth it if you can get a tour guide to walk you through the whole exhibit.
