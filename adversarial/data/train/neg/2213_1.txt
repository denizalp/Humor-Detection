Amazing prices and staff!  Mulch is always a bargain and they carry a high quality dog food that isn't even comparable to pet stores - I'm saving over $7 every bag when I buy it at the Yard Place.  That aside, the family who owns\/works at the store are the kindest people.  I have never carried a bag of food to my car - the owner always insists on helping.  I couldn't recommend this store enough.
