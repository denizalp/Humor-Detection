My daughter recently visited.  We are Vegas natives and I have decorated much of my home with great finds from this store.  However, Sunday I saw a light fixture hanging made with galvanized steel egg baskets.  Asked if it was for sale, made an offer, offer accepted but she said she didn't have a ladder to take it down but she had another one in back...brought it out and it wasn't the same as one hanging.  Needless to say I'm very disappointed.  If the owner of this light fixture reads this please contact me if you'd still like to sell it at my offer and you have a ladder, lol. Uan2@aol.com
