Going back home to visit my family and friends after 2 1\/2 years we decided to meet for brunch on Sunday the day before Memorial Day at the Lantern! When I walked In I was mesmerized by the remodel.\nThe place looked amazing! \nI was greeted by one of the girls who remembered me when I used to frequent the Lantern before I moved to Savannah! \nShe asked me how I liked the place and all I could say was incredible, amazing! Wait a Mimosa and Bloody Mary bar? Oh yes! I absolutely enjoyed the Mimosa bar and all the trimmings and choice of juices! I could not decide what to order everything looked so good! Well how about a drunken shake? Sold!!!! Lets just say I had 3!!!! Time to order some food!!! I ordered the Rueben tater tots! To die for!!! I also ordered an awesome blue hamburger made perfectly! It was a perfect Sunday brunch. I can't wait to go back!
