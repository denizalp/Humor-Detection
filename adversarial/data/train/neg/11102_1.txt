Ryan was the only name I got but the service was horrible we weren't engaged as guest my girlfriend asked what should she get seeing how it was out first time. Our question was totally ignored and we weren't asked if it was to go or were we gonna stay so naturally they assumed we were dining in when I corrected the mistake it took like 10 minutes to finally bring our bagged stuff. A mess was spilled and none of the necessary procedures was followed to assure guest safety. Safety Rangers where are you? I also ordered bread for the side and got chips. So for my first time I will not be coming back to this location I will try another one and I only hope that they get the customer service skills up. If your coming here turn around and go home it's not worth it.
