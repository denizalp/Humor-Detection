My husband and I ate at Smoke last night and enjoyed the Charlotte Restaurant Week menu. This was our first visit and I was excited to see (and taste!) what all the buzz was about. \n\nFor starters I had the burnt ends mac and cheese and my husband had the burnt ends appetizer. His burnt ends were done Korean-style and were out of this world. My husband had the ribs entree with sides of baked beans and mac and cheese. Despite others complaining about the baked beans, we found them to be quite tasty. I had the 2-meat platter consisting of pulled pork and smoked chicken. Both meats were perfectly done! My sides included creamed spinach and cole slaw. I would definitely get the creamed spinach again! We both had so much food left over we were able to off our leftovers for dinner tonight. I had the brownie sundae while my husband had the banana pudding. \n\nOur server, Kate was fantastic! The manager stopped by our table to see if we enjoyed our first experience. We assured him we would be back again soon. Already planning our next outing to Smoke!
