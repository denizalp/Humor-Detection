So here's what I heard:  This place is apparently the Starbucks of Israel.  Someone who worked on a food show told me so.\n\nWhether that's true or not is largely  besides the point, because this 'espresso bar' opened at a corner across from a Starbucks and a Second Cup, as well as down the street from a Tim Horton's, and it's still done exceptionally well.  Of course, considering how much coffee Annex people consume, I doubt that even a man who sells coffee out of a thermos would go out of business.\n\nBut Aroma is actually good.  They serve good americanos, and their mint tea is another popular choice.  They have a selection of healthy sandwiches, all of which are great.  I really can't name one in particular because the sandwich you get will totally depend on the mood you're in.\n\nThe often packed store is in the process of expanding.  Pretty soon there will be extra seating space towards to the back.
