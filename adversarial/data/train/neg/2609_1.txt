Its a struggle getting AYCE with any degree of rapidity. The price is right, the food OK, but during the day the selection is scanty. But they have a price to meet and that is understandable. The sushi 'rolling' is terribly slow. I would still be waiting for my income tax return for next year for my 3rd order. But I guess you get what you pay for.\n\nFor $10.00.
