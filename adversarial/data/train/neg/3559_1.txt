Kneaders is the all around place for a bite to eat. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner and you can't go wrong with all of them! On my first visit (and second and third and fourth) I tried the different sandwiches---I mean it's a bakery---the bread has to be good. I WAS RIGHT. I went through a healthy phase and dabbled in the salads-without fail. SO AMAZING and fresh! Just this AM tried the breakfast---CHUNKY CINNAMON FRENCH TOAST. Okay stop stop stop! The homemade Carmel sauce is just all you need to know. Try it. Try it. TRY IT!!!
