This has been the best hotel stay I've ever had. From day one of our trip we had amazing service. I went to the concierge desk multiple times to book shows and spa services. Super professional and helpful. The hotel room had a fantastic view of the strip, super clean, very spacious, and absolutely the most comfortable bed in a hotel I've slept on. Will definitely return to this hotel! The restaurants here are amazing as well, especially Chica and Bouchon.  Very pleased with our stay.
