Kina is the best! I started going to her for waxing a few years ago. I initially decided to go here mostly for convenience (I work and live uptown). But now I would find a way to get to her even if it was no longer convenient, because I'm so happy with the service. \n\nI only get my brows and upper lip done, so can't comment on the full range of services. But my experience with her has been so great, I feel confident she can do no wrong. My brows and lip look great, prices are very reasonable, scheduling is a cinch thanks to online scheduling, and Kina is super friendly -- she makes the process of having hair ripped from my face seem pleasant with her bubbly personality. \n\nDefinitely recommend her for all your esthetician needs.
