Great place to get lots of nice sweets all in one spot. Good ice cream, chocolates and cupcakes. More like a contained piece of cake than a cupcake, which I loved. Also their macaroons are good.\n\nGot the red velvet ice cream sandwich -  be warned, it's really really soft and melts a minute after getting it so don't eat in a car! Got the cookie dough cupcake, and some truffles.  Laslty, a birthday cake macaroon. All tasty.\n\nBonus points for having so much vegan options, I didn't get any, but it's really nice to see them here for vegans.
