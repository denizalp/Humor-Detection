I only had one good experience at Sefora, and the last 2 times I went the employees were very lazy  that is weren't willing to put on the make up on me how would I know if it look good so I can buy or not and she was using some electronic to test my color which I think does not work for everyone, definitely not for me, so I walk out and went to Lancôme at Belk(Northlake) instead and met the sweetest lady ever, knows a lot about make up and the products. I actually went for just a foundation and she did a whole make over for me and I end up getting more than just the foundation :p. If you're looking to buy make up or Lancôme , go see her( Katherine\/Kathy). She will make your day, she does not pressure u, she just love doing what she does. That's a true artist.
