So happy I found this place. I was so unhappy with my hair because I had two bad dye jobs prior to coming in (one was my own fault...oops). But I called and they fit me in the next day. Jade was my stylist and she was super sweet and attentive to what I wanted. They only use amazing Aveda products which smell fantastic. And they had super delicious hot tea while I was getting styled. Loved the salon and Jade is great!!! I will be back!
