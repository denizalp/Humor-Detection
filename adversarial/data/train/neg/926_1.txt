Typical American fare. Burgers, fries, beer battered shrimp, fish and chips. Quite honestly, one of the best, and cheapest, burger joints in Clark County. The crispy chicken sandwich is amazing, and the beer battered shrimp dinner is quite good. \n\nYou get good service, but go early on Friday and Saturday nights as sometimes it is literally standing room only. Great for a cheap option any day of the week.
