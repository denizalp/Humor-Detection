I have four kids with me who are starving. Went to an iHop first where we waited at least 5 minutes and no one even came to greet us or even give us water so we left. Hit this Denny's up and we were in and out. Everyone was friendly, service was great and fed four kids and myself for about $30. Definitely recommend this location!
