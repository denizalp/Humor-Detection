Thai Shan Inn is a great place to go.. my family has been going since I was young. The original owners are back and the owner, Louisa, is such a sweet woman. She gave us spring rolls on the house and she is so kind and thankful. The food is great, I recommend the Pad Thai. Definitely check this place out!
