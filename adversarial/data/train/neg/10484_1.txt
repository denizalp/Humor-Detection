This place is amazing.  They helped me get set up with a mod that is right for me and had a great selection. Very knowledgable about the products and Jamie the owner is a great guy.  People here are truly passionate about vaping. Huge assortment of juices that they make in house and have an awesome set up for trying out flavors. Would recommend this place to anybody, new or long time vaper. Do yourself a favor and check this place out!
