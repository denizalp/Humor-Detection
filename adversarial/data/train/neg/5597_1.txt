Right near my office and it took me nearly 3 months to try it.  What was I waiting for?  I surely missed out on some great sushi.  Now I'll be making up for lost time.  I decided to try the combo of 3 rolls.  They were all so delicious.  And the black\/purple rice looked a little odd at first, but it didn't change the flavor at all.  I can't wait to go back!
