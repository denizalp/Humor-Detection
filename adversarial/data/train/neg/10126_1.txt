I was in the area and decided to try this place despite some mixed reviews. I ordered take out for two house special pho and deep fried spring rolls. \n\nFirst off, the lady ripped me off and charged me more then the price on her menu. The pho broth was so bland that I had to add salt. The pho was $9 for absolutely nothing but lots of bean sprout. And the spring roll was crispy with very little to no meat inside. \n\nI don't mind paying more for good pho but this place taste like crap and is over priced! Stay clear.
