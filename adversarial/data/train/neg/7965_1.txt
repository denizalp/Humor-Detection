Was very apprehensive about this place after I read lots of mediocre reviews after it first opened.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, at the quality of the sushi and I've been back multiple times.\n\nSushi has a good rice to filling ratio, and the rolls are generously sized.  Fish is the right temperature too.  Bento boxes are great and my 2.5 year old ate all of his chicken teriyaki, which is an accomplishment for any restaurant.  Pushed my luck one night and ordered a cocktail, which was pretty mediocre, so save your cockail $$ for the Passenger down the street :).\n\nDecor is lovely and the place felt pretty clean with very friendly service.  A nice eat-in option and a great addition to the neighbourhood.
