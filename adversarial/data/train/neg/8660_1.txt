Staff cannot be asking customers for their backpacks just because they don't trust someone. In my opinion I was being stereotyped because I look young. I am 25 years old with an amazing paying job due to my education. I had to buy confetti for a baby gender reveal today. It was $4.72. THATS IT. But I was judged the second I walked in and I was asked to give them my backpack. Then one employee told me I could even ask the corporate manager who was there. Which was actually just the store manager. They have NO signs posted saying that they don't allow outside bags in. It happened to feel good outside so I decided to ride my motorcycle which is why I had my backpack with me. But to be judged for being young and pretty much accused of being a thief or looking like a thief. I show everyone respect even when I don't know them. But that staff disrespected me right when I walked in. 1:10pm on September 4th 2018 !!!
