the first two times I went here, it was pretty good - food and service. but recently I went and it was not up to par. I went on a weekday around 2pm for lunch with a friend, we were seated in a booth where I could see the waiter just waiting along the side - which made me quite uncomfortable as you can imagine. the food was decent, and we paid, but a week or two later when I was checking my bank statement, it had said I had been charged an extra $5 dollars for my meal, I checked my receipts and it did not add up. I'm not sure if the waiter added some tip after I had already added one, or if it had gotten mixed up with my friends, but it was very frustrating l. I called to get it figured out, I was put on hold and then hung up on. I had to then call AGAIN to speak with someone - and he basically said that my order wasn't in their system anymore and that I would have to go into the restaurant to get it sorted out properly. this is obviously frustrating especially for someone who isn't super close to Yorkdale, but I made the drive - if they were a superb company they would have refunded my whole order, but I was given the difference that I was mischarged for. will most likely not be returning.
