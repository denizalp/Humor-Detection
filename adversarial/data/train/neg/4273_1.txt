This Subway is definitely the best Subway that I have ever been too.  The first time you walk through the doors you are a guest.  The next time you are family.   I work closer to another Subway but always walk a few extra minutes to come to Subway  in the Consol Energy Center.  All the employees here are so sweet, kind, and go out of their way to make sure your order is perfect.  The manager Tara is the nicest lady.  Whenever I am having a bad day at work, just her warm welcoming and greeting make me feel better.  She definitely is a great asset to this Subway
