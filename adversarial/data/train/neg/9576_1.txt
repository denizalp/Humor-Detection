Review for unlimited brunch:\n\nI don't like eggs and would take a bloody mary over a mimosa so I'm not usually a big brunch guy but I've gotta say I enjoyed this one. As others have said, it's all you can eat and you keep ordering 2-3 items at a time rather than continually trekking to the buffet. The downside is you wait to stuff your piehole, the plus is your food is always fresh. I liked everything I tried but the shrimp n' grits (with a spicy tomato sauce and lots of shrimp), churro tots, and the fried chicken with blue corn waffle stood out. I'm also not usually a mimosa guy but the $10 for unlimited is worth it here since they have lots of different types including peach, strawberry, coconut, pineapple (order this one half coconut and half pineapple). \n\nService was very friendly but even the waiter commented at one point that the food was slow. We sat outside on the patio on a warm and sunny day so it was a good brunch. I'd come back here for all you can eat brunch. Oh and a wedding reception was taking place inside right behind us so that was a little weird that we could see the whole thing.
