I'm Cleveland born and raised but flew the coop the moment I had the chance. I lived in Austin, TX and now live in LA; both cities cater to vegans. Needless to say, I've been pretty spoiled as a vegan. But when I fly home to Cleveland, where do I go? Where's the vegan food? Now, I'm happy to say, Cleveland Vegan!\n\nThis place did not disappoint! I brought 3 meat-eating family members with me and everyone loved it! I got the pumpkin French toast bake and the Benedict bowl. Both were amazing! Other food at the table included biscuits and gravy, avocado toast, and the beet burger. I was a bit nervous when my cousin ordered the burger. I think it's easy for someone who's used to beef burgers to be disappointed with veggie burgers, but he really liked it! We shared the hummus, which was creamy and unique. All food was the bomb! And the coffee was delish!\n\nThis place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon. Every table was filled. Service was a bit slow because of this, but it was worth it. I think this is a testament that WE NEED MORE PLACES LIKE THIS IN CLEVELAND!!!
