I'm not a big fan of buffets, but I went here for breakfast. It was okay, not a big selection. The omelette station was my favorite. It wasn't the best buffet but I left satisfied. There was an bottomless cocktail menu which made breakfast more enjoyable, I paid the additional 15 bucks...\n\nI would recommend this to people staying at the hotel looking for something quick and close.
