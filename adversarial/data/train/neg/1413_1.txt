If based on food alone I would easily give Luna's 5 stars...but sadly the poor service is the biggest distraction from eating here. I would love to tell you that it only happened once but no, many occasions. Today being the most annoying because there are floaters in my glass of water and I would love to tell the waitstaff about it but they ALL are MIA.
