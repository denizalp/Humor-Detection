Stopped here for some breakfast on our second day in Montreal and everything was delicious. A fairly large brunch menu with so many options to mix and match your favorite breakfasts. Their potatoes are delicious-you have the option to substitute those for fruit but I still got a few pieces on my plate anyways. The eggs and brioche are delicious, the service was great. Gets crowded around lunch time but still a really cool atmosphere. Waiters and waitresses spoke English and French very well. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a big breakfast\/brunch!!
