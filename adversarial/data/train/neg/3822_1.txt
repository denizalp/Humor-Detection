Village Square is a nice area with some good restaurants close by and the option to see a movie after is a plus. The multiple theaters allowed for a wide selection of movies. Although the ticketing office was improperly staffed, management sorted it out and the line eventually came in. Many upset patrons waiting outside in the cold while their movies are about to start is not a pretty picture.\n\nWhen we got in, there was still ten minutes until the show started. We got good seats in the middle and the chairs were comfy enough. I ended up adjusting a few times throughout. I like to slide down and wiggle around until I find my sweet spot. It was harder to get there, but somewhere along the line, I got there. \n\nThe theater themselves are kept in immaculate order. No sticky floors and trash laying around at Village Square. Definite plus!
