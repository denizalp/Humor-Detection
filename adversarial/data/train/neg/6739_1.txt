First I would like to say that I have been coming to the Silverton Hotel since it's opening. I have had time to experience and enjoy all of the promotions and\/or benefits of being a diamond card holder  for quite some time. The Silverton has always been more than accommodating to any and all of my requests even if they were put on the staff at the last minute. whether it was a last minute room reservation or a requested last minute complimentary dinner. I have never been disappointed in staff service. In a world of corporate assembly line gaming institutions, and all the glitz and glitter of the Las Vegas strip. No other Hotel and\/or casino can hold a candle to Silverton Hotel and Casino. As a Las Vegas native since 1962 I think I would have some insight to this fact. I would also like to give accolades to one of their cocktail servers her name is Lorraine she is a real diamond in a often overlooked and taken for granted occupation. She always has a smile on her face and always remembers you when you come in. She knows when to ask you if you need anything and more importantly can read and know when your having an off day, \nand you just don't want anything. It takes talent, experience, and customer service to balance a tray and your customers. I have seen and known a lot of cocktail waitresses she is hands down one of the best . You should very glad she is one of your employees because she is one of the many reasons I play where i do and I really can play anywhere!
