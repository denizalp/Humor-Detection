Overall I would give this place 4 stars.  \n\nI'm compelled write this review because I had their bahn mi sandwich (however it is spelled). Let me clarify I've had this sandwich at other shops, so I understand it is a fattier sandwich. \n\nHowever, I give this sandwich at even Stevens a 2 star....just the sandwich itself. Staff is friendly, restaurant has great vibe, etc. if you order this sandwich just understand you are getting quarter inch slices of the fattiest bacon you've ever seen. I literally ate half my sandwich and tossed it. I realized I had nothing but pork fat in my mouth. Maybe this is okay for some people, but I don't want to pay $10 for pork fat. \n\nTry anything else on the menu or sub the pork for the mahi.
