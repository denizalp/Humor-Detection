We've bought some our kitchen appliances here in the past.  My husband doesn't fool around with prices, he looks for the \"best buy\" and we ended up here.  \n\nWhen we went looking for a new computer printer, we ran into the Kodak representative  who was setting up the display and he sold us on the printer, the staff wasn't even around to get involved until we asked for a boxed one they had to get from stock.  At check out we received a Gift card, so I came in today to use it.  \n\nOccasionally, I am greeted by a staff member but most of the time I can come in and browse without hassle.  They are always re arranging the floor plan, making things appear fresh, they have stopped stocking so many choices, and the prices still seem decent.  It's still a good place for electronics and such.
