WOW! JUST WOW! I just walked out of this DISGUSTING Cafe Rio. They are out of grilled chicken, grilled steak and fish. All thats there is the shredded pork and shredded chicken thats sitting in the grease water sauce. The green sauce is a dark dull green dried up on the sides, the serving counter is FILTHY. They obviously DO NOT wipe as spills are made. The girl at the register and the guy that takes the order are debating and confused on who doing what, OMG!!! Im kicking myself for not going to the one by my house in Green Valley thinking im going to make good timing for work coming to this location closer to my job. Im going to contact corporate now and attach the pictures I took of this gross establishment. Its food poisoning waiting to happen.
