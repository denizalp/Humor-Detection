Nice Hotel right next to the water.   Nice View.  Clean rooms.      Nice walk to the park.  The room we had had a large lcd screen.    And a nice view of the harbor.  \n\nWife was there for a conference.  I guess they are trying to be \"Green\" so there was no bottled water.  \n\nWe also had a banquet there for my Aunt.  It was a nice size ballroom.    About 15 tables and a dance floor.    There was a deck outside with a view of the harbor.
