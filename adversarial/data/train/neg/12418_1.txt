The food is amazing.  The cooks are amazing on the grill.  I have just one suggestion.  Don't sit near the grill.  The air circulation makes it so sitting ANYWHERE near the grill means you will freeze the entire time.  I went for my birthday, they were out of Sake and I was freezing to death, which meant my food got cold really fast...but I still enjoyed it.
