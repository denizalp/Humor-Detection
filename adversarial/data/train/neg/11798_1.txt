This ramen place is far from being authentic. The noodles taste like the ones you get from the frozen\/refrigerated section from the supermarket, then corn tastes like canned corns, and the soup base is lacking. It's alright if you see it as a convenient fast food place, but it's not like a bowl of authentic Japanese ramen.
