I had an excellent experience dining here. I stayed next door at the Tropicana, but their list of restaurants is slim and the MGM has a huge list of great places so it's well worth the stroll across the walkway. \n\nIt was a busy evening for the place, but the found a seat for me that wasn't at the bar. I ordered a Manhattan and although I forgot to order it 'up', it was still a very good drink. \n\nProbably no surprise to anyone I ordered Chicken Alfredo and a glass of red wine. Wow, the Alfredo was great!  Rich, creamy , buttery, and hot.  The pasta was perfectly done.  I don't think I've had better pasta. The wine went well with this dish. All I remember is it was an Italian red. \n\nI ordered a peanut butter pie and coffee for dessert. Again, both were great, especially the coffee. \nSee the photos for more detail. \n\nGreat place to eat and I recommend it to anyone stayinf close the the MGM.
