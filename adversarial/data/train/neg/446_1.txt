If you are looking for authentic Thai food, you have come to the right place! This place has it all! \n\nThe food is tasty and well seasoned. There's not ONE thing I wouldn't recommend on the menu, but my favourites are the noodle pad kee Mao and the gaeng phed! \n\nDelivery is free If the order is above $20. And they used to offer free spring rolls if your order was above $30 or a mango salad for above $40.
