Went with a group and sat at the sushi bar. Service was not so good. One person's meal was served after the other three of us had several orders of sushi. We ordered two orders of sashimi and only one was on the platter. Quality of sushi ok. One was stringy. Valet returned car keys because they were going to leave early.
