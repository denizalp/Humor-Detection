If you are going to demand (I'm sure past bad experiences dictated that so OK) payment up front for to go orders then do it all at the cashier. Why would ANYBODY have to:\nplace an order at the bar\nwait for the ticket\ngo to the cashier and pay\nGo BACK TO THE BAR\nGive the ticket so it can FINALLY reach the kitchen\n\nInefficient is a understatement
