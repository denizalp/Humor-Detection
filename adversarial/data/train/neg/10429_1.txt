Let me just say, this was the first time ordering pizza from Papa Kelsey's and I'm sorry that I didn't, sooner.  Tonight, I ordered the Papa Kelsey's special and it was delicious!  They don't skimp on the toppings and it had a yummy crispy crust.  I loved the inside of the restaurant because it reminded me of the old school pizza places with video games and tv's.  Very clean inside and according to my receipt, the gentleman that helped me was named Cody.  He was very pleasant and so was the gentleman that brought my pizza to me.  Next time, we'll be dining in and trying other items on their very generous menu.  Thank you and we'll be back!
