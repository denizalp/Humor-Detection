This market is tops on my list. Whenever I stop in Las Vegas we stop here. The prices on the fruits and vegetable is way cheaper than the local supermarkets. Service isn't tops but It's a easy trade for prices. The employees try to make you happy, which is good enough for me. The variety is remarkable. If your cooking an Asian recipe, this has everything and some.
