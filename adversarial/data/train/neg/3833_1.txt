UNBELIEVABLE.\n\nThis place is pricey, but when it comes to fine dining, you get what you pay for.  Ordered the oyster appetizer, Ribeye, all 4 sauces, asparagus, mac-n-cheese, wasabi carrot soup shot, misc drinks...left here fully satisfied.\n\nAll-in-all it was great food, great staff, and nothing but first class dining.
