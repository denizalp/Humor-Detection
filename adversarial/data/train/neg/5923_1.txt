Getting ready to leave on a flight home the next morning, we would get a small snack and drink at Chili's which was located a block from our hotel.  Have gone to our neighborhood's Chili's which I consider just an average restaurant.  We sat in the bar area.  It was just before 4 pm and the waitress came back and said that it was Happy Hour and the appetizers were $4.99.  We ordered 2 - one flat bread pizza and some kind of nachos.  I was surprise of the size of the plates.  We were totally satisfied.   The service and 2 of the staff we dealt with were so nice.  Can pay electronically from the table which we really liked.  Highly recommend for a snack or bar drink.
