The room was amazing in the Venetian tower, so much room and two huge tvs, the bathroom with the vanity and separate shower and tub was perfect!! The pools were awesome as well. We didn't get a room with a view but we were on the 29th floor and could see over the city with the huge window, loved the remote shades. Our friends stayed in the Venetia tower and it seemed a little more plain then our room.  \nWe did planet Hollywood the past two years and after staying at the Venetian we will be returning guests everytime we visit Vegas.
