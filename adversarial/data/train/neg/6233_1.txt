Had to walk over and see what this store was all about.  So unique of a soap bar store!  Lucious smelling soaps a creative soap designs.   \n\nAn employee, JUSTIN RAMIREZ, waited on me.  He was super duper delightful.  He answered all my questions about the various soaps... and went out of his way to find me the best soap...as I bought 4 of the macaroon style soaps!!   But, I really really enjoyed my conversation with Justin!  Consider this a free therapy session with Justin and some smelly soaps for me!\n\nELLIE from Phoenix
