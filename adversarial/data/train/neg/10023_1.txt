Look around the street; Blanche Neige was here many years before the current crop of restaurants and it will be here many years after they leave. It's a staple for doctors working late nights and the casually hungover. A practical icon of CDN at this point, I believe they've been here since at least the 60s. I've worked at many restaurants in the area and we've noticed that their dogged persistence at keeping prices relatively low has allowed them to thrive where others have closed shop.\n\nBe warned, the food at best is better-than-mediocre, and the service is hit-or-miss. The food is pretty much a recreation of items from other local American\/Italian\/Greek\/Quebec restaurants, but with lower quality ingredients (or their substitutes). The portions are fairly large. Some of the waitresses have this attitude, kind of a \"the breakfast is 2$, what do you expect\" attitude. Don't expect minor substitutions to be granted and asking them for poached eggs is something that's not within your prerogative. The owner's wife works there sometimes and is pretty nice however.\n\nThe breakfast (which in theory is 2$, but in practice usually at least 5$) is cheap and filling. Considering how breakfast is overpriced at many places, I couldn't fathom buying breakfast elsewhere in the vicinity on an informal occasion.\n\nI was torn between giving them a 3 or a 4-star rating and would realistically give them something in between both. If I could sum this place up in one expression, it would be that this place is really a you-get-what-you-pay-for establishment. Usually, I don't go back to 3 star places. I'll definitely be going back, but mainly when my wallet is feeling light or when I'm out late at night. Or maybe just for the nostalgia.
