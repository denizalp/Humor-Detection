We represented a buyer in a residential transaction where Quality Pool Service did a pool inspection. The report was clean but after closing, Quality Pool Service came out to begin a cleaning service and told the buyers that the pool and the equipment needed a lot of work. None of these items were mentioned on the report prior to closing and when confronted, the office was defensive and told my clients that they just did what the real estate agent asked. When I called the office, they denied having said that to my client. The reason we do inspections is to know exactly what is wrong with the pool prior to close so we can ask for necessary repairs from the seller. Without the correct information before closing and the fact that the office was not honest with me or my client after the fact has put my client in a bad position. I would not recommend this company for pool inspections and feel they lack integrity.
