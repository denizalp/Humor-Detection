Rooms were clean and reasonably priced. Location wise a C- as it is far from the strip and all of the action especially on a long weekend when Las Vegas Blvd is a parking lot and so is Highway 15. Very loud at night - with live music from the performers below echoing throughout the building through the night. Not recommended if you want to get some sleep. Not recommended for families
