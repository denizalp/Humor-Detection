We decided to go on a culinary tour for our 15 year anniversary and Yardbird was one the restaurants that made our list.  After touring some of the best restaurants in Vegas I have to say that Yardbird topped the list.  We ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  This dish was enough to share with the table since you get a whole half of a chicken.  The chicken was crispy but not dry and the waffles were fluffy and cooked to perfection.  We also ordered the Swine Burger 2.0.  Yes, there is a lot of meat between two pieces of bread but talk about some juicy goodness!  To top it off we got the fried Oreo for dessert.  First time having fried Oreos but enjoyed every bite.  While we had some good food on our culinary tour, Yardbird stood out not only for their flavors but their service.  The staff at Yardbird treated us like we were family.  Their food is not only good but literally a work of art (just check out their pastry chef when you visit).  Shout out to Iris and the staff as they made sure to make this stop memorable for our anniversary.
