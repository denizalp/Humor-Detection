Lon's has a really beautiful dining room, great food, and wonderful service. I loved the ahi tuna appetizer, shishito peppers, and sweet corn agnolotti. \n\nI was blown away by the quality of the service. We were celebrating a birthday, which we told them about when we made the reservation. After we settled into our table, the hostess brought over a birthday card addressed to the honoree and that was signed by the staff! They also brought a special dessert for him. The waiter and our busser were both so knowledgeable about the menu, and were very attentive and helpful. \n\nThe dining room is relatively small and really lovely. But note- this is a really classy place, and you may feel uncomfortable if underdressed.
