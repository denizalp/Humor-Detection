DAYUM!!!! What can I say?! OMG SO GOOD!!! I'm a SOCAL Mexican food fan... anything other than that isn't Mexican food. Forget TexMex barf! When I moved to Vegas I missed the kind of Mexican food you can find on nearly every corner. Roberto's is no comparison to Wahoo's. my favorite burrito  is a shrimp  burrito. Roberto's makes it with a red sauce  BARF WTF?!?! Wahoo's does it right with a dope white\/verde creme sauce. So bomb! The manager\/owner also hooked us up with free churro chips and brought water out for our 2 dogs   on the porch. Wahoo's is GOOD AF!!!
