Donuts are a big disappointment here. The reviews are actually accurate. I don't even dare to  eat their donut, it just does not look appetizing. \n\nThe lady in the front was very nice so I ordered coffee which she said was fresh, just brewed. It's either the coffee was stale or it's some hella strong coffee. Yuck! Sorry, I have to give such a review as this establishment could actually used some positive review.
