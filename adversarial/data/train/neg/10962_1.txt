The problem with subs is 6in isn't enough but 12in is too much...ha!\n \nAnyway, 7.5 is perfect and a 15in sub split just makes sense which is what Cousins has :)\n\nThe subs are yummy, the service is superb. The owner is SO nice, remembers you from last time and is concerned about your food\/order. \n\nWe love coming here to support this small business owner and his yummy food.
