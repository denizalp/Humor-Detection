I have been here twice for lunch. Both times the service was extremely slow. There was no way that you could eat here if you just have an hour for lunch. On both occasions my food arrived and was not that hot. I ordered the Guinness pot pie the first time and the chicken club the second time.  I would say both of these meals were OK. I have not been here in the evening so perhaps it is different?
