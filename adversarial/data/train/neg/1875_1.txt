First time for this Denver Broncos fan visiting this Broncos supported sorts bar and wow what an amazing feel. Outside walking up I didn't hear much but inside it was live. A week 2 game felt like they playoffs. Food was great, I'm a bit of a wing snob and they were delicious. Server Stephanie was like one of the gang, such a cool girl and made it that much more fun. This place is 25 mins from my house and I'll be back very soon for another game \"experience.\"
