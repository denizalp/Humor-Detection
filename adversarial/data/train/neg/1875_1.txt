Had dinner here recently.  It looks and feels totally different than the old Clevelands.  The Plaka Combo was almost large enough for 2 people (2 pork kabobs, 2 stuffed grape leaves, rice, tomatoes, feta and olives, a heap of gyro meat and pita slices) and .  I've also had the ouzo burger, which was not as good as the combo platter.
