Plus: Large color selection, lots of stations.\nCons: No posted price list, the most incompetent young man ever working, lacking proper equipment.\n\nSo I go in and a young man seats me. Doesn't offer me a menu of services so I guess they only have one type of pedicure? Either way he cuts my nails way too short, does the process out of order and SPRAYS ME WITH THE HOSE. Pants soaked in the crotch and leg. Another tech comes to help him when we get to the paint part and has to re do my cuticles. I asked for a gel pedi since they offered. No floor lamp. So shes balancing a hand lamp on the edge of the bowl. Then, after charging me what I believe is full price, the credit card machine is down. \n\nJust say no.
