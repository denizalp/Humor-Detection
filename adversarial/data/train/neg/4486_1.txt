The goat cheese empanada thing (from the appetizer menu) is amazing! I was in Montreal for a few weeks and we went back time and again just for that one item. Oh, and their signature bread pudding! Also amazing. I ordered a crepe the first time I went, but nothing compares to their goat cheese\/brie empanada. It sits on a sublime tomato sauce and the cheese oozes out when you cut it open. Super duper.
