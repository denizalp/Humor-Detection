This consistently continues to be one of my favorite locations to dine and grab a couple drinks. I cannot talk up the staff enough! They are so kind and genuinely want you to have a good experience at their restaurant. Be forewarned though, their martinis are delicious, but strong! The menu does not have a plethora of items, but everything I have tried is great and the prices are reasonable. My favorite dish is the chorizo mac n' cheese. If you are looking for a classy yet casual place to eat and grab drinks in Downtown Willoughby I would highly suggest Oliver Twist.
