It is $2\/movie.  Thus, you get what you pay for, but the hotdogs are tasty and affordable at $1\/each. Highly recommend visiting during the day, if possible, because the neighborhood is a tad questionable. Good luck with parking. If talkative people decide they plan to converse during the movie, kindly tell them to refrain, give them the look, well, you get the idea. In conclusion, I highly suggest this movie theater especially if you are on a budget.
