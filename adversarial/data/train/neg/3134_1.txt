My daughter started going to this day care and when she first started it looked like a great place to take your child. So i checked it out and took a tour, I loved the fact that they use an app to take picture of the children and activities that they are doing. The parents can view at anytime. They also had a sign outside with great rates. They had somethings that i questions though like not having filtered water for the children and the children having to drink tap water. I was told that they were working on getting it but after months and months it never happen. Staff was working with higher up to try and convince the children to be allowed filtered water. I don't understand why they can not afford it being that they do charge each parent an activity fee every month to supply the children with what they need. The rates have also gone up as well  tremendously due to the new wage increase. My daughter stopped going here after me going to pick her up one day and seeing one of the staff members grab one of the older children by the arm and yank her. The communication with the staff is horrible! Not to mention once my daughter stopped going there i called to check if the rest of her belongings could be picked up and also receive a copy of amount paid since my daughter had been going there. My daughters belongs were never retrieved and refused to give me a print out of payment and fill out a 2441 form. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone ! The place is cluttered, water unfiltered, prices are outrages, and could use renovation!
