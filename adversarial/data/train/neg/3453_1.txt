Dick's Last Resort.  This place is a novelty where the waitresses and waiters schtick around being rude to customers.  It got pretty annoying after a while, but, I guess it is good for the tourists.  \n\nAside from the atmosphere, the food was not so good.  Personally, I do not know of anyone that would go there to eat.  Must be the warm and fuzzies the servers give you.
