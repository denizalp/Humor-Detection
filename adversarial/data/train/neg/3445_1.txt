Little bit on the pricey side but that is to be expected. I've had the green monster as every one has recommended it and it was really good. The sweet potato fries are a great compliment to your meal. You can really taste the freshness of the burger as they cook it in front of you. Not my first choice for a burger fix but overall very good!
