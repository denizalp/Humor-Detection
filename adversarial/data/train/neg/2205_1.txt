Saw Portside Brewery and Distillery on New Day Cleveland, and HAD to check it out. It was beyond all our expectations!! I had the Rusalka Vanilla Stout & Shoreway Shandy. The stout was so smooth with hints of Madagascar vanilla bean. One of the best I have had. The Shoreway Shandy was so quenching with an outstanding taste of lemon.  I absolutely LOVED their special touch of three raspberries added as a floater. Fantastic idea! We ended up bringing a growler home!! My husband had the High Tide Hefeweizen that was outstanding, amongst other beers they had on tap. We also tried a three flight of their rum, the vanilla maple rum, spiced rum and Christmas spiced. We ended up bringing home a bottle of the vanilla maple rum made with Madagascan vanilla beans and pure Northern Ohio maple syrup. As far as food, I had the avocado chicken salad sandwich and my husband had the beef sliders. Both were served with pasta salad and everything was outstanding! Service was awesome! The kind of service no one sees anymore, which was very refreshing! Francesca is the BEST!!!! You can tell she loves her job and people! There was not one thing we didn't like about this place! And parking is FREE, yes FREE!
