To be fair, this one star rating may have more to do with a personality mismatch than a complete fault of the vendor, but let's divulge.\n\nThe reason for the one-star review is due to their inability or unwillingness to listen to the customer, and their opaque process.\n\nThis is the only conventional bridal salon that I visited, because they advertised rental gowns. I specifically asked for selections on rentals, and proceeded throughout the appointment thinking that all of the dresses I was trying on were for rentals. At the end of the appointment, I was told that I could only have a rental if the dress fit me as-is. This information was not shared with me until after the appointment. As a result, I spent the entire appointment trying on dresses that did not fit me, mistakenly thinking they were actual options, when they were not.\n\nI shared my vision for my dress at the beginning of the appointment, which was dismissed immediately. I asked for a tea length dress, or a cocktail dress, since my wedding was outdoors. I was told that those are \"bridesmaids dresses,\" and that I didn't need to worry about the length because the dress could be bustled. Then a parade of huge ballgown dresses were brought to me, none of which fit my vision.\n\nEssentially, I was told that my idea for my wedding dress was wrong and forced to try on dresses that I had no interest in wearing.\n\nEventually, I left and found a bridal salon that listened to what I wanted.
