To me, this is the ideal record store. The guys who run this place truly care about record collectors and those who are new to record collecting. I have never experienced less than stellar assistance and conversation with the staff. No attitude whatsoever. They have a lot of neat accessories (vintage 45 accordion albums for one), and lots of turntables and stereo equipment. I have been collecting records since I was 11, but still have a bit to learn and the In Groove is a great place to explore vinyl and audio equipment.  I always seem to find a rare little gem here when I visit!
