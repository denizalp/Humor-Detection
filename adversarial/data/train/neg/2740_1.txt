This review is just about the food, service and atmosphere on a night where they did not have live music.  I've been here a couple of times.  The food is good.  I've had the burger and the walnut burger and both were solid (not excellent, but good). Every time I've gone it's been pretty empty and the bar feels a bit dirty (I'm a fan of dive bars but something about this one was a bit too much for me).  Maybe if it had been full I wouldn't have noticed.  While service here has been adequate some of the staff seem to have a very negative attitude towards the customers.  They are generally curt, and one time, when we came in after the kitchen had closed (but didn't realize it), we were rudely told that they were no longer serving food and would close soon.  Now, I have worked in food service so I know what it's like to have people come in when you've already shutting things down, but we were not demanding or anything.  They could have courteously let us know that the kitchen was closed and we would have been on our way.  Anyway, at this point, I generally stay away from this place but if a friend really wanted to go there, or a band was playing that I wanted to see, I would stop by.
