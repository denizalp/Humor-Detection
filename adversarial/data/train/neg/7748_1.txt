It's been ages since I've watched a musical and I had a blast watching this show! I saw Kinky Boots and the show was great. It was full of comedy, nice musical performance, and colourful costumes. I sat at the balcony and had a good view of the show. Seats were comfortable.\n\nOne thing that the ushers will do is tell not to put things at the edge of the balcony, presumable so you don't drop things on the people sitting below. If you're into Arts and want to have good laughs, I highly recommend watching this. It's a heartfelt story about two boys growing out of their father's shadows and pursuing their dreams.\n\nI should mention the nature of the story revolves about a drag queen, so it's not exactly a kid friendly show ;)\n\nAnyways, go watch it and have fun!
