I am a sucker for live music so I always have a blast here. The atmosphere is very chill and the decor is really fun. They also have outdoor seating. The music has always been great  no matter who is playing, just FYI it's not always a piano. My favorite parts of this establishment were the homemade fireball, Grapefruit beer, and glasswear. This place is well thought through and made to feel a bit luxurious. A nice oasis from the craziness of the strip
