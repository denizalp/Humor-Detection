If you need cheap HDMI cords, they have a section on cheap cords here. The service here is sometimes a hit or miss and they consistently compete to give you a paper \"receipt\" to get commission even though they didn't help you whatsoever (happened to me several times) They also have a cafe inside, it's pretty awkward but I guess it works?
