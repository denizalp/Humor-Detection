I give them ***** for lack of empathy and efforts to loose a customer for life. Hotwire booked me with Hertz and they did not have a car for me when I got there. So I spent 2 hours as I had already paid and Hotwire again (to my amusement) booked me with Hertz. Apparently, staff acknowledged that system was broken, both bookings were cancelled by Hotwire and Randy (supervisor) offered to HELP ME. They (Cindy) wanted me to rent the same car that I was double booked for by paying $182 vs booked rate of $37 which I had already prepaid. \n\nAfter 3 hours of struggle and a valiant fight, the road warrior in me gave up and meekly followed my wife to their competition. I paid $52 for a convertible and was off with a smile in 30 mins. \n\nSo, stay away and good luck if see the H word on the booking after you paid for it!
