I really enjoyed this show. I'm not really a Beatles fan and didn't recognize many of the songs, but I would definitely recommend this show. It has somethings for everyone. Humor, dancing, acrobatics, 60s era social concerns, rollerblade athletics, and more. I was entertained the entire time. This is a good show for both young and old.
