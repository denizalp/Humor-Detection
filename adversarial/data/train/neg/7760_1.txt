12 friends of mine went out to celebrate a birthday and we picked Joes. I've been there a few times with my boyfriend for drinks which has always been great, but I have to say dinner and service were fabulous. They were super accommodating for our large crowd that comes witb a few picky eaters and they never let our drinks get empty.  So in kind we ensured they had a few pieces of homemade birthday cake as a just reward.
