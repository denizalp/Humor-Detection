Short version: keep track of your sessions! This is the second time they have said I used sessions when I have not. I only used 2 out of my 6 sessions and they are telling me I completed all 6 in their system which is a lie. \n\nAfter my last review I was given two free sessions to fix my hairline. I went in the for my appointment and the tech asked the usual questions. I told her I was using a topical retin A but had stopped over 5 days ago. The tech told me it needed to be longer more like 10 days. I specially called and still have the email from laser away verifying that you must stop 3 days before and after treatment. So I wasted my gas and time.\n\nI stopped the retin A all together just to be safe. I did receive my 2 sessions and There is no longer a half circle in my hairline. I still have that weird patch area but I can live with it unlike looking like I had a bald spot in my hairline. \n\nNow on to my current problem..... I mentioned in my last review that I had purchased the back of my neck. I only did two sessions then had to stop due to having to take an antibiotic. That was around the time I wrote my last review. I called yesterday and I was told I had completed all 6 of my sessions. I had the girl double check with the \"director\" who confirmed the computer was right in saying I was \"done.\" I did NOT receive 6 sessions and am still in shock they are saying I did. \n\nThey also tried to gyp me out of another one of my sessions when I first started going here. Since it was only one and they fixed it right away I thought it was an honest error. \n\nI called corporate and was told somebody else handles complaints and would call me back after she got out of a consult. I have not received a call.
