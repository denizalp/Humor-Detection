I am so glad that Congee Queen finally opened a location in Mississauga.  I used to have to drive out to the East end of Toronto and Markham for this type of food.  The food at the Mississauga Congee Queen location is as good as their Commerce Valley Drive location and much better than their CenterPoint mall location.
