I went here for the 4th of July since some of my friends had heard about this club. I am so glad I went! We had the best time here. One of my friends was on a promoters list and we got in really quick and found the perfect spot right by the bar. \n\nI don't remember who was hosting but the music was definitely something you can dance to. When we got drinks we were able to get to the bar right away and the bar tenders were friendly. We stayed till the club closed and our feet hurt. This place also has tons of seating which is a huge plus. The dance floor was mainly outside, I didn't get a chance to go inside the club but I had just as much fun out in the pool area. \n\nThis place was full of people but there was definitely room to move around and dance. We'll definitely be coming back!
