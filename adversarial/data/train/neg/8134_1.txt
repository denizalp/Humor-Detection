Jack, was very awesome! \nHe was funny and had quality customer service! He made me and my mother laugh as we were ordering! There should be more people like him working in any customer service industry! He had a very pleasant personality. He truly made our experience in Vegas amazing! He would be the reason we would eat at Fat Burger as we only came to order fries. He deserves a promotion!!!!
