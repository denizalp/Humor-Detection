Poor planning on managements part - for that I would give them one star, however the product is usually great.\nWhy so low rating? Today, the Saturday after Black Friday? Well, we got to the mall at 9:30am and Cinnabon says it'll be another hour before they have cinnamon rolls, they're still being made. Only product up were the sticks and the round little rolls. Um, hello. You were scheduled to open officially at 10am, not 10:30. These are breakfast and decadent treats. Such a shame we have to sit and wait. Terrible planning and the attitude of the cashier could be improved upon.\nBetter luck next time.\n***Update****\nFinally got out rolls at 10:50. Delicious, but took far too long.
