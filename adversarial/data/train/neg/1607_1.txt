After a long day of other dealerships giving us the run around we found ourselves at Hertz. It was a wonderful experience to have a fair price set and no switch ups at last minute. Dale and the team had my trade in processed and my new loan in no time. It was painless, up front and no surprises.  I've bought a few used cars and they are by far the best!
