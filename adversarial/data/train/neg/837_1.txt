I took my Staffy x Lab with high anxiety to get a nail trim. He's 70lbs and very anxious about everything.  The girls were awesome with him.  They did his nails, brushed his teeth and cleaned his ears with no issues.  That's quite a feat!  He gave them kisses and a wiggle butt when we left.  We will be going back regularly.
