Had a great bartender. Great food. The turkey and cranberry blew my mind. I felt underdressed in a t shirt and jeans.  Love that I can get a little bit more dressed up for dinner and not have to break the bank. The happy hour is awesome. We had three drinks and two entrees and our bill was $33! Defiantly will be going back.
