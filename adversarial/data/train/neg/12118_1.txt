I am going to be the \"maverick\" and give this show three stars. I love the Beatles but the show, in my opinion, did not represent them or their music the best possible way. It is mostly dance and artistic renditions of the fab four. Not enough acrobatics. Some people may like that but if I am watching a Cirque de Soleil production, I want death defying, precision, skilled and inventive moves.
