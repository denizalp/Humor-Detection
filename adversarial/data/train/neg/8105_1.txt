We ordered 3 bacon cheeseburgers with fries. We got to choose what kind of cheese we wanted. The bacon was thick real bacon not crumbs of microwaved wanna be bacon. The patty was thick and juicy. Restaurant quality burgers at fast food prices. Delivery took over an hour but it was at lunch time and I did receive a text telling me there would be a delay. The driver was courteous. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the lack of a receipt. Please provide receipts with deliveries ...\n\nThanks for the phone call and the reply on yelp. The Eat24 receipt via email is not itemized and I feel it's good practice for the driver to supply a written receipt. It gives me something to put in the cash register to record how much I took out including tip. Sure I can print from my email ... When I get home at night and bring it to work the next day to put in the receipt box but at that point it's easier to order elsewhere. I actually wrote you a nice review and just offered my two cents on what could make your service even better. I'm somewhat taken aback at the (almost) defensive reaction on the phone and the need to publicly follow up telling me where to find the receipt. Maybe just accept people's input without discouraging them from being honest in order to grow your business? \n\nI ordered lunch from another restaurant today via the Eat24 app. I asked for a receipt in the comments section and received an email almost immediately saying \"of course - we always provide a receipt.\"
