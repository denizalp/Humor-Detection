Called Matt, the owner, about installing a new gate and automatic opener for our external garage.  He came out, took a look at the job and promised me a quote \"within a few days\".  Two weeks passed, during which I sent him an email and left him a voice mail, but never received a response.\n\nIf the job wasn't right for him or he was too busy or whatever, I would have preferred he be straight with me and simply say that.  Not responding at all is unprofessional and indicative of a poorly-run business in my opinion.
