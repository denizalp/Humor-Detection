Went here recently with my sisters. This was my very first time here. The interior is very sleek and modern. Plenty of space inside to eat. The food is great here. I ordered the Tikka Masala with chicken. Very yummy especially with the Naan and Basmati rice. This place is very unique, which is what I love about it. Check it out!!
