So happy to find this place! I was looking for a quick and painless way to get my middle console cover recovered (my elbow had worn a hole in in).   I called todd and he gave me a rough quote over the phone (which was about 30% less than I was expecting it to be) and said I could bring it in right a way.  When I got there he seemed like he was in the middle of something but he dropped everything as he knew I was in a hurry and he quickly dissembled the console cover, took my name and number and told me it should be done by friday.   I got a call wed evening stating it was done.  He even offered to stay late if I wanted to pick it up that night.  I picked it up the next day and it looked great.  The price was what he said it would be with NO ADD ONS or additional charges  (I hate it when businesses do that!)  The cover looks great (matches perfectly with everything else) and I'm happy to have a new home for my elbow while driving.   \n\nLong story short, this was a small job but if I ever need anything more substantial done in the future, this will be the first place I get a quote from.
