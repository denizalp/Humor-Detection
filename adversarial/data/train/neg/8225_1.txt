So. First off we walk into the establishment and run into a hostess who doesn't know her job. I asked her was tabletop seating first-come first serve. She looked at me as if I spoke Mandarin or I was from the moon. Thank God that this place recognizes that their staff maybe incompetent and put a sign up that says \"table tabletops are first come first serve.\" or maybe I just don't pay attention. Anyway got to the table and the server has been great so far. I ordered the half chicken garlic mashed potatoes and baked beans. My boyfriend ordered a sausage, mac & cheese and sweet potato fries. Let's discuss my meal. The mash potatoes had no garlic whatsoever no salt or any flavor for that matter. The chicken was really juicy but it was bland as well. The baked beans were just not good. On the other hand my boyfriends meal was great. The mac & cheese is really good, the sausage was amazing. The sweet potato fries are your every restaurant standard sweet potato fries dusted with salt and pepper. All in all I probably won't return to this so-called modern barbecue spot. There are some better hole in the wall places in Charlotte. Prices are fair n the atmosphere is pretty good. The mac & cheese is a go though!
