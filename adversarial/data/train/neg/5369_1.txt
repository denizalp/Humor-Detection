Lets fast forward 6 months exactly from the date I purchased the car. The transmission went out  with 62,489 miles while I was driving and at a stop light. I called the dealership 2 days later and spoke to a Sales Manager that to told me to have it towed up there as good faith since the warranties had expired and he would have EVERYTHING fixed with parts and labor for $800-$1000. I still was upset but was okay with paying that and thought it was a good gesture. I had the car towed from my repair guy in Matthews. All of a sudden no one was getting back to me. The person I spoke to days ago acted as he had no clue as to what I was talking about. Fast forward to today 04\/06. I have to call, mysteriously the sales manager that told me that no longer works there and the finance manager that helped me finance the car named Josh tells me he would look into it this morning. Hours past by and I reach him again after 4 pm only for him to tell me that that can't honor that and telling me lies that the lying service people made up. and rudely told me that I can come get the car. I mentioned that I would call an attorney and he hung up on me. I called back to let them know how unprofessional that was and he hung up again. WHY would I have  car towed from a different county if thats not what I was told and it could have already been started working on. This place is shady and if it wasn't on my credit, I would tell them to keep it. I should have listened to the bad reviews before I purchased the car.They are not honest and very suspect and I would never tell anyone to go there!
