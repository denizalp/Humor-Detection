What an awesome show. I wasn't sure what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. Pretty all the music I listened to as a kid growing up in western New York. \n\nWe went with friends and we sat at a table on the orchestra level. We ended up paying for bottle service at the table, well worth it. \n\nI would have given it 5 stars but towards the end of Act 1, someone set off the fire alarm at the hotel. The show had to stop and the actresses and actors had to leave the stage until the fire alarm was resolved. With that fire alarm, all the energy from the show pretty much disappeared. Act 2 was excellent. \n\nDefinitely worth seeing.
