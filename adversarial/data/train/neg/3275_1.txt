I absolutely LOVE this place! The staff is awesome. Great atmosphere for alone time or for hanging out with friends. They have a nice selections of teas and other beverages that you can customize.  Other than the mason jar teas, I recommend the butterfly pea tea. It's not so pretty. I haven't had the food because I have allergies and can't eat a majority of what's on the menu. But there's something for everyone. They also have ice cream, that I will try when it gets a little warmer. I wish I lived a closet but glad I don't because they would have ALL of my money.
