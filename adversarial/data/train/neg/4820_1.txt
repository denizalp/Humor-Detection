Steiner's calls itself a \"Nevada-style pub.\" But this food is so good that it would work well anywhere.\n\nI have been here a half-dozen times, and I always get the same thing: a small order of the Mediterranean salad with lamb chops. It's basically a souped-up Greek salad topped with three grilled lamb chops. But, man, are those lamb chops tasty! And although you can order the chops by themselves as an appetizer, I think it's a better deal to get them as part of a salad.\n\nMy husband had the Cobb salad; the full order was huge, but he nearly ate it all. We each had a large draft beer (Miller Lite for him, and Blue Moon Belgian White for me), and if you're just there to drink, you can't go wrong with their extensive beer menu. It looks like they have a pretty good happy hour, too, and I know several people who like to play video poker here and at the sister location down the street.\n\nIt's funny I don't come to Steiner's more often; maybe that's because it's not that close to my house, so it's not in the front of my mind. But I like this place well enough that I'm going to try to remember to stop in next time I'm in the mood for some good bar food. And maybe next time I'll try something else off the menu: a burger, perhaps. Or maybe the Cuban sandwich... (Naw. Why mess with a good thing? See you later, lamb chops!)
