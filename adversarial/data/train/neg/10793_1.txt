Best of the Fresh locations because the tables are reasonably spread out and it was dead quiet (due to the awful, business-crushing construction, maybe)? I LOVE the macrobiotic soba noodle bowl w 369 sauce on the side. The larger size is expensive but also soooo filling it's your meal for the day. Pisses me off they don't have calorie counts. Bathrooms clean and nice. Servers here don't tie up their long hair either, guess it's an overall chain bad habit
