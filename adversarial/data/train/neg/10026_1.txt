On a recent trip back to phoenix with a friend I was talked into trying Hey Joe! I used to work right downtown on Central and McDowell so I already knew all about the food trucks on fridays, but I was really excited to try something brand new and different. \n\nWe walked right up and I wanted to opt for the chicken, however once again I was talked into a new experience to try the braised deep fried pork belly. I was a bit scared away but my friend was super excited for it, which made me excited even though it was 110 degrees out side (I LOVE IT THOUGH). \n\nReasonably priced and the portion size was good enough for us to split to simply try something new but not for a full mean. Hands down though it was really delicious I can not lie about it. A great combination of whatever they deep fried it in with rice and delicious sauces on top. Obviously not healthy at all, but we were on a mini vacation so we deserved it :)\n\nOf all the food trucks down there that I have had this one by far is the winner.
