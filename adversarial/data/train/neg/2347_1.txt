This place is understated.  It is an awesome place for breakfast.  A fews of the awesome breakfast items are the bacon omelet, banana bread french toast, pancakes, bacon is always crispy and the coffee good, strong but not bitter.  We have enjoyed eating in and also take out and delivery.  Love their breakfast!!  Lunches were great also.
