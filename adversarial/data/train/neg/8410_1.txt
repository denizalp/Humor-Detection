THE FOOD\n\nStandard Quiznos fair. Pretty consistent in quality. I recommend skipping the fountain drinks if you are sensitive to water taste.\n\nSETTING\n\nStandard sandwich chain shop, clean.\n\nSERVICE\n\nFast, friendly  and consistent. Just the way I like it when I am hungry.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nNothing exceptional but nothing to complain about either. Good place to grab your sandwich.
