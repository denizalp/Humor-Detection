The tradition continues! We went on Saturday evening this year. It was as crowded as ever but that's part of the fun! My wife found plenty of gifts from all the wonderful vendors\/artists to purchase. I noticed this year a lot more \"local\" artists selling Charlotte themed items. One of the coolest was a guy (can't remember his name) that had beautiful pictures of old businesses, buildings and places in Charlotte. Brought back tons of memories! Every year is a new experience. Can't wait for next year!
