Usually this place has really good service, very nice employees and their food is delicious. Today, I ordered by phone a combo plate with chicken kabob and chicken gyro like I have always ordered. The person taking the order took this as I wanted 2 separate plates. She found out that I only wanted one combo plate and became very frustrated with me. She made me feel really bad even after I had apologized for something that really wasn't my fault but, I understand miscommunications. Anyways, it a damper on the day and I probably won't be back:\/ Again, food is great!
