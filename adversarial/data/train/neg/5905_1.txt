I'm addicted now to all the pastries this cafe has. Vanilla cake is the most popular among our friends and only 30$. I don't understand why people are paying crazy money for cakes at pastry boutiques, because most of them are not tasty at all - too sweet or to oily. Antosha is Russian place with authentic NAPOLEON cake, not like everything we tried at Yammy market or Amadeus. Tiramisu is amazing as well and we buying cakes there each Saturday and everything is fresh.
