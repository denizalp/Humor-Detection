This place is super cute! Friendly staff, decent menu variety and I really enjoyed their lox platter, I recommend the iced dirty chai! Something I wish I'd known prior: you order and then sit yourself, so if you bring a pup, have a friend that can wait outside with it while you order! I was hassled about it and thankfully was still able to order since I'd been waiting in line forever, but I understand why dogs aren't allowed in. We'll be back!
