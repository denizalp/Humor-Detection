My boyfriend has taken me here twice and I really loved the food both times. It didn't take long after we ordered for our food to be done. The strawberry limeade is a DELICIOUS drink but I didn't really love the miso soup, wouldn't order it again. The dish I ordered was the beef and broccoli...AMAZING both times. First I ordered it with fried rice which was okay, the second time I ordered it with regular brown rice and this was better. I just felt like I could enjoy the perfect flavor of the beef and broccoli more when the rice \"had a little less going on\". \n\nWe will definitely go back to Ling & Louie's for the food (and the limeade) but I really can't say much about the service here. The hostess was friendly both times but the wait staff wasn't great to us either time...not rude but nothing to rave about either. Also it was a little awkward for me to have most of the staff in my direct line of sight standing in the kitchen area either A) eating, B) fooling around with coworkers, or C) standing around doing nothing...both times we were there. \n\nThe food is awesome though, so we'll be back!
