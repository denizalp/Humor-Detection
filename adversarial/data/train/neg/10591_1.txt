I eat at this location at least once a week. I sit at the counter and that has allowed me to become very friendly with the very outgoing and equally as friendly staff.  So besides a great and attentive staff, the menu has a huge selection of just about any which way you can order eggs. Then add in all the pancakes, burritos, burgers, pizza and it's insanely good, fresh and large portions. Their eggs works breakfast potatoes are awesome and I usually have to add ketchup to any type of potatoes except for theirs. All in all the food I've never had a dish I have not liked very much. If you don't like your dish they will replace it with anything else you do want and you will likely get a free muffin for your troubles. I also can't say enough about the laid back staff, great attitudes and very eager to help make you happy. That is a good enough reason for me to go at least once a week.
