This is one of our favorite restaurants! We eat here a few times a month and we are never disappointed. The house balsamic is very good! I recommend the salads, chicken parm, lasagna, chicken bruschetta, wedding soup and any of the sandwiches. They have a smaller menu but they also have daily specials. It is in the Hillcrest Shopping Center and doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside is a nice little restaurant with unique decor. It is a good place to have a relaxing meal in a quiet atmosphere. They don't serve alcohol but you can bring your own wine.
