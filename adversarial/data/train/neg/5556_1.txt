By far my most favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas. Wonderful flavors, very consistent, nice atmosphere. There is room for some improvement with their service, as well as the amount of rice they serve with their curry. Take-out, however, seems to have portions that are more generous. My favorites: Massaman Curry- rich flavor, not to sweet. Pad See Ew- perfectly balanced sauce. Tom Kha Gai- wonderfully balanced as well. Pad Thai- not too tangy, not too sweet. Highly recommended!
