Such a shame.  My family and I have eaten in and gotten delivery several times, as we always enjoy the food here.  This weekend, we ordered delivery.  A lady called to get directions and berated us for living so far.  She resumed her disparaging comments at the door, reiterating that we shouldn't be ordering from them because of where we live.   We called to advise the manager about this experience.  He restated that we live too far for them to deliver food.  Why accept an order for over $100 if you don't want the business? Lots of great places for Indian food in the city.  We will try somewhere new.
