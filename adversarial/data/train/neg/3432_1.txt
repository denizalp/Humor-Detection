I was referred to Pui by a friend who did an amazing color correction on my friend's hair. Pui is extremely knowledgable with color and she is very quick and always willing to accommodate your schedule. She works in tandem with her very friendly staff and the shop is very clean and relaxing. The pricing relative to the services you get are good as well so I would highly recommend The Color Room.
