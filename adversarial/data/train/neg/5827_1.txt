Super crowded!!!! The concept of top golf is really cool. It kinda reminds me of bowling but has way way more people there. There's people everywhere waiting to play this driving range game. I went for the first time on a Saturday evening. I don't suggest that time especially if it's your first time and your excited to check it out.
