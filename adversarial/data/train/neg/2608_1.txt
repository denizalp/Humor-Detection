Ok this used to be a descent local mall.  Now it seems like half of the stores are closed and the stores that are here are so random (besides the big stores.). It's ridiculous!  The VR place is fun for my kids and they have fun walking around like good Tweens do but it's just not a good or even descent mall anymore!  Bummer!!!
