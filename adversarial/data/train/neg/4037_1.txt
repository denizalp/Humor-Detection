well well, I liked this place a lot!  A group of us went to get a booze and burger fix (why there aren't more places that specialize in these two things exclusively is a mystery).\nAnyways, although it was a pretty crowded weekend night we managed to get a good seat very quickly and our waitress was great.\nThe food was pretty good, and the menu had a lot of option, different meats, veggie options, different buns (lettuce included) and sauces. If anything it was almost over-whelming. But when i finally did make a decision it was tasty.\nThere own take on mixed drinks were pretty good too, not too sweet and not overly alcoholic. And the best part...the boozy milkshakes, although to be honest it would be very very hard to mess up a boozy milkshake, but they were really great.
