Came here with my mom today and I didn't realize that there was this fancy Chinese bakery.  They also had ready made dimsum but I would stay away from the Sui mai because it didn't look too fresh.\n\nThey also have rice topping specials but based on the size it isn't too big of a meal.  I had the maths croissant and it was really just croissant with matcha powder on it.  I expected more from it.\n\nThe one thing I would give a 5 out of 5 is their lava cheese tart.  It is soooo good.  The crust is so flaky and the filling is so yummy.  Definitely a must have when you're there!
