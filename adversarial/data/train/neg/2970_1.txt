I love the feel of this place as soon as you walk in. I have always found the staff to be very friendly and the food and wine are great.\n\nI have been to Italy at least 7 times and the pizza here is as authentic as it gets! I would recommend......hang on......are you ready for this? The Vegetarian Pizza with Sausage added. I know, I know.....there is a reason for this. The veggies on this pizza are carmelized. Carmelized veggies and sausage are sent from heaven.\n\nIt is a great place for a casual date night.
