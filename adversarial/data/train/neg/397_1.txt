If this review were just for the vet care, I would give it 4+ stars but the truth that if I graded the \"experience\" it would be 1 star so I averaged it.  I understand it is an ER clinic and they are busy but it took only 1\/2 hour to be seen by triage and seen and diagnosed by a vet. BUT, then it took an hour after that to be checked out and I finally left when it was going to take even more time to get the drugs prescribed.  I had them phone scripts into a pharmacy rather than wait even longer with a sick and contagious dog in a crowded waiting room. This is not good for my dog or for all the pets around me.  The suggestion at that front desk was that I could wait outside but again, sick dog in 85 degree weather doesn't seem like a good idea either.   Good vet treatment but the admin staff dropped the ball on this one.
