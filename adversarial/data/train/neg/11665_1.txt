I love Vietnamese food, and there are a ton of options on South Blvd that we haven't tried. This year we've decided that we want to just try new places (for the most part) and Doan's was kind of one of our first new experiences. We arrived about 40 minutes before they were to close so it was fairly dead in there however they were quick to seat us and help us. We started with the meat rolls (beef) and they were really good. They have a homemade peanut sauce that we loved and their hot sauce (not sure if homemade or not) was to die for. We really wanted to take the bottle haha. We got the chicken broken rice and the egg roll, chicken, beef bun. The food was just really good, like comfort food good. It's not fancy but the taste and flavor is just there! Seriously sitting here right now thinking how I'd love to pop in right now and get take away for dinner tonight!! I definitely 100% want to try the hot pot the next time we go as we will most likely become regulars here!! Also side note I got the iced green tea which was a tad too sweet for my tastes (we've been on a no sugar kick) but really grew on me!! He got the sparkling limeade which he very much enjoyed. Basically 4 1\/2 stars from us and may bump it up to 5 upon a revisit!! :)
