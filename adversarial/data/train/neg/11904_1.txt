Yeah, baby!\n\nThis place was terrific. The service was spot on. Friendly, helpful, and on it.  \n\nWe ended up with a mix of dishes; the rolls were unique, tasty and decently priced for Vegas. The BBQ duck breast was really great. Not too chewy and a great to split. And the yellowtail ceviche was a big surprise; awesome to taste with the right amount of sweet and tangy. \n\nThe shishito peppers were a big hit as well. Though there was a spicy one in the mix! \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed this place.
