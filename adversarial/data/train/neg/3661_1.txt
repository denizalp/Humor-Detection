Ice cream shops like Yogurtland are a dime a dozen in Scottsdale. In my opinion Yogurtland on Scottsville Road is one of the better ones. I ordered red velvet and toasted coconut ice cream with Oreos and a hint of chocolate syrup. I was a little bummed out that they did not have marshmallow topping. And what the heck, only chocolate syrup and no hot fudge? Overall pretty good I come back again
