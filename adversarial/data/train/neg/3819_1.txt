This place actually has decent fast Mexican food. It's pretty much good for when you need Mexican food in a hurry. It's pretty convenient with a drive thru, and there is a salsa bar if you dine inside. Think like the style food you'd get in a Mexican super market. Why only 3 stars then? Well it's good but not great. It will do when you need some Mexican flavor in a hurry.
