Absolutely amazing.   Chef Neal Noble was incredible from day 1.   The tasting went incredibly well and he was accommodating beyond belief.   We picked a mix of hors d'oeuvres (like 7 because we loved them all and couldn't choose), a choice of halibut, pork or vegetable tower for the main, and a late night poutine serving.    \n\nSoooo many people came up to us and told us how amazing their meal was- even the pickiest of eaters.  It was so great to hear.   You invest so much time and effort into this one big day and when your vendors are incredible, it makes it all worth it.\n\nAlso, the staff that was there for the day was totally on point.  I left a very detailed (perhaps insane) list of things that needed to be done on the day of and they did it all seamlessly.   I was so impressed with how everything was carried out.
