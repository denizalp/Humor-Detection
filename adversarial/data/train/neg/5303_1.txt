Our visit was horrible. We waited for seating for an hour. The waiting staff and manager refused to accommodate our party, which included a disabled person - which prevented us from seating at the high top chairs. Waiter, Seth, then berated us across the parking lot when we left, unserved.\n\nThis venue is not welcoming!
