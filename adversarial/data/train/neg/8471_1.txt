I have used Senge for the past 20 years, for both company and personal vehicles.  The service was always excellent, the prices were always fair, and - most important - was NEVER lied to or given any BS.  If they couldn't do something (rarely), they told me. If there was going to be a delay, they told me.  \n\nEXCELLENT SERVICE, FAIR PRICES, AND NO BS.  WHAT MORE CAN YOU WANT?
