Dang..Hate to write this.  Big plans...Make reservation specifically asking for quiet table. Guess what?  They sit us next to a group of 20.....\nWaiter and staff were very nice..professional. Takes our Drink order..spends the next half hour with the group of 20. Finally I get his attention and beg for another beer. I actually have to ask about getting an appetizer...Dang..  So far the anniversary is going south....\nNext we decide to split a $65 Ribeye medium rare..... Comes out raw.\nDang.... Could have went to Safeway for this steak. Server tells me be careful with the plate...Hot...and all that.  It was about as hot as a chilled salad plate at Applebees. Dang.. So much for sizzling butter.\n\nAh..man...Well the coffee was delicious....I will say that. Again, the waiter and staff were top notch. The food was no better than Sizzler..and that is after dropping $200.  Cant risk going back with that kind of damage....
