so i've been to honey salt on multiple occasions and overall the place is great. only taking away one star because every single time i've gone the service is suuuuper slow. \n\nthey have a great unique selection and healthier options like vanilla bean scallops and lemon chicken and caesar salads. i've liked everything i've eaten here. the monkey bread simultaneously changed and ruined my life because it was so good. \n\nlove the free salt water taffy too! and the stuff you can buy is always delicious. \n\nbut... only things are that the aftertaste on the mimosas and peach bellinis are a little weird. and i went to during restaurant week and the food was kind of cold and sloppily put together. also what's with the ceilings? they look like school auditorium ceilings. was really looking forward to some reclaimed wood beams.
