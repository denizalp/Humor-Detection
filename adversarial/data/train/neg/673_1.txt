We've gotten delivery from them about 5 times now and everything has been just stellar.\n\nFood arrives within 45 mins, is piping hot, the portions are HUGE, and everything is better than I would expect, every time.\n\nReally surprising how well their Thai food is seasoned, food isn't too greasy, they aren't afraid to kick the heat up a bit, and know how to make every part of the dish taste good, from the rice, to the veggies to the proteins.\n\nGreat stuff, highly recommend. I wake up at nights now craving their curry rice.
