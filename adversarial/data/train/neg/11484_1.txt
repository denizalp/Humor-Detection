Went last night, it was probably extra crowded because the June event had to be cancelled because of a storm.  Crowded is the operative word here, Rockwell Avenue was almost impassible and the East 21st Street and parking lot stands were just as bad.  No problems but I thought that they could have used a few more police\/security.  There were so many (large, off leash) dogs that I wondered if we had wandered into a dog show.  Afterwards went back to Phusion Caf√© on Superior Avenue to get a snack that we could eat in peace. \n \nRockwell is so jammed with people, they should consider closing off the street all the way from East 21st to East 24th and only having stands on one side.
