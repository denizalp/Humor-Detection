Had a great experience today for lunch. Ordered the yellow curry with chicken and requested it to be hot. It was the perfect amount of spicy that didn't overpower the flavors but spicy enough that I needed to sip water. \n\nAlso got a Thai iced tea. It was one of the best ones I've had in a long time. \n\nService was great and fast. I will be going back again very soon.
