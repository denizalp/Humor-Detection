She planned for us to go here for sunday brunch! I was thoroughly surprised that she planned it here. Her backing was that its a \"hole-in-the-wall local\" place like how I like it. I was like sure lets give it a try. \n\nIt took them 20 minutes to seat us, as it was busy and too cold & windy to sit outside. The service was good and people amiable. It was a typical breakfast place, right from pancakes, omlettes, salads, burgers, burritos, etc. \n\nHad a few veggie options, like a typical breakfast place. I got the avacado and black bean patty omelette. Check pix. Havta say didn't like the patty since it was soy based (like BOCA) and not a black bean garden based. I got a side of the southwestern hash browns and a French toast, both were good as well. \n\nAll said and done, no particular reason I havta go back to this place when there are places like Mimi's and lolo's. it's a small place with good people and decent food at almost the same price as other places.
