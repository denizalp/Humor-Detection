Longos has replaced Metro as my main grocery store. There is an impressive range of extensive gluten free items including Schar bread and there are many deals to be found. The organic fruits and vegetables are plentiful. What stands out is the excellent staff. The customer service at Longos is better than at any grocery store. I once saw an irate customer be totally unreasonable to a team member and the team member maintained her composure and professionalism. The car park may look full but there is usually room. I could sing Longos praises forever.
