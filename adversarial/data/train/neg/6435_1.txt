This is what is becoming the stereotypical urban restaurant I believe. Dark, noisy, overpriced, and confusing. \n\nThe IPA was well-balanced, and the other beer drinkers at my table of 9 were satisfied with their selections. \n\nOrdering food was another story. The menu says they encourage family-style sharing and that 2-3 plates are suggested per person. When we asked the waitress, she gave us varying estimated amounts for each dish however. Some of the dishes were enough for one person, some were meant to be for two people, and some were too small for one person to be satisfied. My date and I chose to order starters instead of a meal, since the peasant food served was outrageously overpriced. $12 for four wings?\n\nI was very frustrated by this restaurant. The only saving graces were the good beer and tasty food. I will not return. I feel like their serving style is a scam.
