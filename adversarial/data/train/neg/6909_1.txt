AMAZING! It was my first time here. We a sat at the bar, had a couple cocktails, and then ordered two rounds of tacos. Loved the carnitas and chicharron (pork skin) and marinated pork with pineapple salsa was my favorite. The corn on the cobb was a great ending to our meal...yum!!! Eddie took great care of us! He was patient and took the time out to explain the menu to us. Thank you for making my first experience a great one! Will definitely be back!
