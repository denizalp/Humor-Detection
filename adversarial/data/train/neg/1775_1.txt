This location has redeemed itself. Manager on duty Carissa definitely took care of us!\nThe vibe of the store is completely different during the day time. Feels welcoming and has a flow with employees.\n\nOur sandwich was a complete 180 from the last visit. Taste was there, presentation was there and definitely had the usual capriotti's fullness!\n\nCarissa, thank you again to you and your day time staff!
