I used to like this place, with has pretty standard Portuguese fare. It's especially good for a family meal, which was why I came here. However after my last time here, which I will detail below I'm not coming back.\n\nWent in on a Monday night. Please was busy, as usual. Two police getting their order. I was next in line. I was looked over by the older gentleman with blue eyes, who proceeded to ask the person behind me for his order. I looked at the guy behind me, who had 'jumped the line' and we shared a look - mine basically saying 'WTF', the other guy smiling oddly. I told him to 'go ahead'. \n\nI listened as the older man with blue eyes asked the guy who was now getting his order before me where he was from, telling him he looked Spanish; in Spanish. The guy told the old man he was Mexican. I might not look it, but I speak and understand Spanish. Because I'm just not Spanish looking enough I won't be coming back to this place any time soon.
