Great little sandwich shop!  It got a good selection of sandwiches and wraps. Perfect for an easy inexpensive lunch. Owners were really friendly and offered to make me exactly what I wanted without even having to be asked.  Not the best location so I really hope this place can make it!!! Wish it were closer to my work, i'd go every day!
