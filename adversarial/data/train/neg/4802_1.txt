Let me start by state 3 stars isn't bad. I have raced 3 times here. On the Roval and the outside road course. I prefer the outside road course over the Roval but thats the case anywhere for me. The tracks are extremely flat but what else would you expect from a desert. The facilities are great, clean bathrooms, RV hookups in the infield pit area, no RV hookups on the outside road course though. The outside road course has acouple configurations and can support two races at once. The curbing though out the whole facility is pretty good. If you are looking for some practice before hand Iracing has a scan of the Oval\/Roval that is pretty good.
