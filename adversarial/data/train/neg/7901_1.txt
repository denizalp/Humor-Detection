I'm giving In-N-Out Burger 4-stars because it does what it's supposed to do - provides good burgers and fries.  But I've been to at least three In-N-Outs now in my lifetime (I live in Indiana, so we don't have them) and I still don't understand what all the fuss is about.  It's certainly better than McDonalds, but it's basically the same level as a Five Guys or a Steak n Shake.  Higher end (but not quite gourmet) burger places.  I almost gave it a 3-star just because it doesn't meet the hype level everyone places on it, but that seems unfair.  If you want a great burger, go here.  If you need to do it because you've always heard about it, go here.  But don't make the trip because you expect some mecca of burgers - you'll be disappointed!
