The pulled chicken sandwich is literally the best sandwich I've ever had. Service is quick. I travel for work every two weeks and stop in to eat at the Hearth every time. The food is really good! The BBQ pulled chicken sandwich is so good. The sauce is creamy and unlike anything I've had. The bun is soft and fresh. heard that the burger is also really tasty.
