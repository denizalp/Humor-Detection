The food and coffee are the best I've had in a coffee shop in a very very long time.  In fact the only reason it loses a star is its obviously geared towards regulars.  In fact, I felt like all the regulars were giving us out-of-towners the stink-eye for Michiganing up their coffee shop. \n\nThe staff were polite, the atmosphere was also quite nice, and the like I already said the food and coffee are amazing.  It just really feels like a \"locals preferred\" kind of place.  Still stop in if you're here visiting.
