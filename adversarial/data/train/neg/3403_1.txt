I was here last night with my girlfriend to celebrate my birthday, saw the great reviews on Yelp so I thought I check it out myself. Perhaps we went during a busy time, but we were still able to find a seat outside. We for iced lemonade, she got the green tea and I had the raspberry (this was too sweet), salmon crepe and the green matcha crepe. We dug into our savoury crepe, so no pic, but we did snap up our matcha crepe. Delicious from start to finish
