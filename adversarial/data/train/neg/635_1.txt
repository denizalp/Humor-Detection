Jody, Mom and Russell you guys are awesome.  \n\nMeat Jun, Spam Fried Rice, Macaroni Salad, Loco Moco, Fried Saimin and the best Man Doo I've ever tasted.  The banchan are always good with extra care put into everything.  The most nostalgic thing is the complimentary boiled peanuts.  Ono!  No matter how busy, they treat you like family.  This is the best Korean \/ Hawaiian Plate Lunch place in Vegas.  Why?  Because they know how to cook, they use quality ingredients and they actually care about their customer and what they do.
