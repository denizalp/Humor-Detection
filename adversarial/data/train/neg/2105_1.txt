Delicious down south seafood. I went in with my family last weekend, it was our first time. The restaurant is also a seafood market. You can pick from the cooler what type of seafood you would like and they cook it for you (fried or grilled). There are also choices of seasonings. They even have alligator tail! My family had a little of it all and we shared, the scallops were delicious as well as the flounder.
