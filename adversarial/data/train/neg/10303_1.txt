Did take out from here as my fridge was empty and I was about to catch a flight to, ironically, China on a business trip.\n\nObviously, as a frequent traveler to Asia I have quite an inderstanding of how Chinese food differs from American-Chinese food... but sometime you just want some comfort food in the form of sugary, deep fried chicken and rice!\n\nSadly, the food at Yummy Yummy was the toal opposite of its name.  What I received was bland, and somewhat generic tasting.... almost like they prepared things ahead of time, and then added some additional seasonings to try to match the order (in this case, orange flavor).\n\nI've yet to find a good Chinese place in Phoenix, and this place certainly is on my list of bad ones.
