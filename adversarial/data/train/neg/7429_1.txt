I live around, so I went with friends to take a drink. I forgot my wallet so my husband came back for it to our home meanwhile the other drinks were ordered. Then I showed them my green card, cause I'm not American. The waitress looked at it and showed to another waitress and then they said that they can't sell me a drink with that card. I told them it was a green card, what's more legal than that? She asked me for drivers license. I said I don't have, so they denied me the drink. I was almost freaking out so pull out all the IDs I had in my purse, including my original country ID and I said, don't you have to know how old am I, What if I'm passing by and I'm not from Ohio? I can't have a drink? I am a 26 years old woman, married and a neighbor and I felt bad... the girl realized they were making a deal for no reason and they finally ended up selling me the drink. Oufffff, finally. Other than that, music it's very random, there's some karaoke and food looks good, very home environment. It's more of a loud place than a chill place.
