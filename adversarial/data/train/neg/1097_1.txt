Lan Zhou serves great hand-pulled noodles with the perfect thickness, chewiness and texture--and gotta love the clear broth. Warning for those who are expecting a thicker, richer broth: this is chinese ramen, not japanese ramen!\n\nI've tried a couple of different noodle bowls here--duck, pork, chicken. The duck was by far the best, the pork+soy marinated egg was really good, and the only one that didn't quite meet my standards  was the chicken. At $8.95 each though, these were all very reasonably priced and of decent quality. The sides are a bit more pricey but the noodles are always given in generous portions and I always leave full. Would come back for the beef or duck!\n\nService is alright, the place isn't usually too busy so we're always seated right away and we get our food \nreal fast. Have to wave the waiters over for water\/ tea and the bill, but when you do they come quick.
