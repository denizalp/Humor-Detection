Food and drink: 4\/5\nAtmosphere: 4\/5\nService: 4\/5\nOverall experience: 4\/5\n\n(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)\n\nI give this an overall 4 stars because of the selection of wonderful beer they have. If it's your first time here I suggest you try the Blackfoot Blueberry Wheat Ale or River City Raspberry Wheat Ale for a unique and flavorful beer. There is a wonderful hint of berry in the beer and it's light and refreshing, perfect for a hot day. \n\nI came here with my bf and sat in the lounge area (there is also a restaurant portion for dining). The decor was clean and simple- casual, not too over the top. I found the lounge area more relaxing and cozy with their wooden booths, and high tables and stools (for those who like them).\n\nMy bf and I thought the food was overpriced for pub food. I do however like the wonderful selection of food they had, and I wanted to try something new but we settled for the Brewster's special pizza ($13.99) which was delicious. The crust was nice and soft yet crispy on the outside (appeared to be homemade), and my bf loved the homemade spicy Italian sausage on top. There is nothing greater than homemade\/from scratch and fresh food when I go out to eat.\n\nI will definitely come here again with some friends for a good beer when I'm in the area!
