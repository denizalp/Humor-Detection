This is the third hotel I have stayed at in Vegas and is by far my favorite. It is absolutely beautiful to look at. I thoroughly enjoyed the gondolas that go through the hotel and the guys that man them who also will serenade you. We stayed in a suite and it was, well, sweet. I am not sure how much it cost because I didn't end up paying for it but whatever it was I'm sure it was worth the money. I liked that they had people checking room keys before you could use the elevators as well. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because we wanted to ride the gondolas but felt it was pointless because the outdoor area it would go through was closed and dried up. Its in a great location on the strip and has tons of self parking which are both always pluses. I hope next time the gondola ride is back up and running outside!
