Wife and I went for a Tuesday lunch.  Had the buffet , not bad. 4 meats, 2 soups, plain and seasoned rice, 3 sauces, hummus, and couple of salads.  A bit pricy for the minimal spread, but the food was good.  Nothing spicy, some needed more spice.  Overall, we will be back, but probably order from the menu.
