My husband took me here for Valentine's day and it was some of the best food I've ever had!! \n\nAppetizer: We shared the Southwesten Shrimp and my God although the portion was small, it was absolutely incredible!!! The shrimp was juicy, the sauce was spicy, the corn gave it some sweetness and the cornbread just amazing. Combine it all for the perfect bite. The bread basket was meh. I prefer warm, fresh bread and soft butter. \nMain: we had the new york and filet minon. My filet was like butter. Perfectly cooked. We got the tator tots and cheddar & onion scalloped potatoes. Double yumm.\nDesert: We shared the chocolate souffle. Omg. It was like a dream. Devoured it.\nDrinks: We ordered the coconut martni and chocolate martini. Both were pretty big and definitely strong. No complaints. \nSetting: We had one of their high tables. Wouldn't call it romantic exactly and hard to get on the chairs. Next time I will request a booth.\nService: slooooow. I know it was a holiday but it took forever getting water refilled, dessert ordered or paying our bill. I mean our server was nice enough, but the lack of attentiveness was a little annoying. \n\nIn conclussion, the food was beyond amazing. I'll be back.
