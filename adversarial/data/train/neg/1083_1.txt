Customer service is poor. Waiting in a line for a long time just to get a oil change. Becky asked me \"Whats Up?\" told her I needed an oil change to where she had to ask me twice in a snotty tone \"Can you get an oil change?\" little did she know I called earlier and she told me no appointment was necessary as it was slow. Shook it off and gave her my groupon and was told it would be ready in an hour. My husband and I went out for an hour and come back only for my car not to be touched. Once again Becky has a line and is overwhelmed! Sears needs to be sure to properly staff this location. Theres no reason that I should wait 2 hours for an oil change especially after being told that it is slow at the shop. So the one star is for poor customer service and slow wait time.
