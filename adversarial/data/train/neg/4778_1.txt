I enjoy taking my son to this park I really like the gated playground :) with helping keep my son safe they have a very nice splash pad :) that has very cold water for these hot days !!!! The few things I don't like is the pond smell overwhelming the park and the play ground looks like it needs some love and to be fixed up some :) all in all :) it's a very nice park to goto on a hot day ;) and play
