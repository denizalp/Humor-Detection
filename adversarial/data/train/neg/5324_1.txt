Would give 0 stars if I could. I should have walked away from the counter, but unfortunately I didn't and ended up paying a few hundreds dollars more than the price quote and reservation I made on their website. I would never rent from this company again. They're sleazy and their sales man was extremely pushy with all the options, and even charged me for things without asking if I wanted them (like roadside assistance).\n\nI strongly encourage you to go with another company. I usually go with National but tried Payless in an attempt to save money. Bad decision. Payless is Paymore, and my experiences with National have been leaps and bounds better in every case than with Payless. Go with whoever you want, just not Payless.
