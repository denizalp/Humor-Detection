Great patio for people watching. My friends and I had a pitcher of the peach mojito which was very reasonably priced at $15 and huge. Didn't get a chance to try the food but saw the menu and everything looked good and very reasonably priced again. Would go back to try the food and more of the drinks. Service was a bit slow however for a Saturday night and it wasn't that busy. We weren't in a rush though.
