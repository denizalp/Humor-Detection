Went here for dinner a few nights ago.  It was about 7pm and the place was pretty dead which was nice.  This place is most definitely more a bar than a restaurant and probably gets packed at night.  Kelly's seems like a nice spot to relax and have a few drinks.  The decor is interesting with lots of comfy looking couches on which to socialize.  Anyway, to the food...   \n\nTo start we ordered a round of drinks.  The happy hour specials are pretty decent but the $8 martini ($16 regular price) had an extremely weak pour.  Barely even worth the 8 bucks.  The wings were just ok but the mac n' cheese was pretty tasteless.\n\nFor an entree I ordered the burger which was very good.  Perfectly cooked and had excellent flavor.  I wasn't sure what to think of the side condiments that came with though (some kind of peppers and another mushy spread thing).  The fries were also very good and seemed to be freshly made and not frozen.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her chicken breast sandwich.  I had a bite as well and it was very good.  The aioli makes it I think.\n\nOur waiter\/server was very good.  He was courteous, friendly, and didn't take too long with my diet coke refills.\n\nIn summary, this place is a bar with above-average bar food.  I probably won't be back, but not because it wasn't good.  It was good but just not that special.\n\nPro Tip:  get the half price certificate at Local Dines ( http:\/\/bit.ly\/dfR4eQ ) because it is definitely worth it.
