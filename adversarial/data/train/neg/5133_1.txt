Very deserving of their spot on Open Table's 100 Hot Spots Restaurants in America list! We went here last night looking for a great meal, and we got just that. Everything from start to finish was perfect. \n\nThe dishes come in smaller portion sizes, so our waitress recommended we order four or five things to share so we got the watermelon salad, the wood-burning oven brussel sprout hearts, the hanger steak and the sticky toffee pudding. \n\nI can't get over how good the watermelon salad was. Light, refreshing, incredibly tasty. I could have eaten just that and left happy. (12.00)\n\nThe brussel sprouts and hanger steak were both equally as fantastic. \n\nAnd finally, the sticky toffee pudding. I didn't know desert could be that wonderful. I highly recommend this dish!\n\nOverall, the experience was close to perfection.  It definitely doesn't disappoint.
