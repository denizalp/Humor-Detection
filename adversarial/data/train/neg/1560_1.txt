Started working close by and I was always going to the nearby Starbucks until I started noticing my coworkers coming in with cups from this shop. Excited to know there was a speciality shop close by, and wanting a break from Starbucks, I went by to check it out. \n\nPros:\n- Great staff. Every time I stop in the staff are friendly and make conversation, it's quite refreshing.\n- Delicious decaf. Yep, I drink decaf and the quest to find shops that offer a cup that tastes good is an arduous task. At Black Canary it is quite tasty.\n- They offer almond milk as an option when in the mood for a latte.\n- Free wifi.\n- Small shop, but great seating options for hanging with friends or working the day away.\n- Prices aren't outrageous. Decaf Americano is $3 (at the time of this posting).\n\nCons:\n- The washroom is a little bit of a walk in the back, so you probably don't want to leave your laptop out if you need to go.\n- If you spend under $4 they have to charge you $0.25 to use the debit. Slightly annoying, but I understand.\n- Finding a plug for your laptop can be a little tricky if it's busy. But I think this is an issue for most coffee shops.\n- The hours in the morning. They don't open very early on the weekend, so if you're an early worker it makes it tricky to grab a coffee before you head to work.\n\nIn the area and looking for something that isn't a big chain? Definitely stop by here. Enjoy the great coffee and atmosphere, fun music sometimes too!
