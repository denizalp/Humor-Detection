Nice, but nothing exceptional.  The place was not busy at all on a Sunday night which I suppose might be expected although I think generally speaking Vegas tends to be humming all of the time.  I think this was just a reflection of the Off the Strip location and the nothing special aspect of the place.\n\nThe menu is interesting and our entrees were good but some of the items are way overpriced, namely the appetizer boats which did not warrant at all the price.\n\nDecor is nice although the dining room is a bit too cavernous.
