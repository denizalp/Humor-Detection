Baton Rouge never disappoints,  whether in Montr√©al or Toronto.  \n\nWith three kids,  from out of town,  we wanted good quality and reliable fare.  Filet mignon excellent, mouthwatering baked potato with the works, delicious Louisiana chicken salad.  Kids liked their pasta though some steamed broccoli on the side would have been nice,  but not available.  Wine pricey but good selection. \n\nDesert incredible,  Baton Rouge chocolate cake super chocolatey,  Key Lime pie with a graham cracker crust divine.  Cappuccinos excellent.  \n\nWaiter's timing was a bit off as far as serving adults before the kids?!  And he didn't ask us if we wanted coffee and dessert.  But he did serve the kids their dessert first... Lol.  He did acknowledge he was new,  and was very accommodating overall.
