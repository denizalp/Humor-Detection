I recently had purchased a Honda Civic from arrowhead Honda. Michael James was very nice and honest. He was not your typical pushy salesman and got me a great price that was affordable in my price range. He provided excellent customer service.  As being a customer service representative and dealing with the public, great customer service is the biggest thing I look for. I had no problems throughout doing business with him. He kindly took the time to help my family and I. I want to say a great Thank you to him and Arrowhead Honda for the good service provided!
