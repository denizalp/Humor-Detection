I've tried a few nail salons in the area and always come back here!!! It is definitely a fancy experience- your nail technician is focused on you rather than chatting with the other employees- they're so personable and professional and the salon itself is so chic!! My husband even went with me today and had a relaxing pedicure. Summer did my nails and she was awesome!!! I won't go to another salon!
