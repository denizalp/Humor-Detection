Yummmm. I love this place! It's a small order at the counter kinda place. They serve hot dogs with an Asian flare. Everything tastes fresh and it seems like everyone that works there is friendly. I've eaten here a few times and I've liked everything I've tried. If you haven't been I say give them a try.
