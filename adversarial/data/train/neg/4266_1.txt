Shamika is amazing! I was so nervous to get my hair colored again. Over the years I've been pretty adventurous with color and my hair was so damaged because of it. So I hadn't colored my hair for over a year. I was getting bored with it but was so nervous. Shamika did such a great job! She took real good care of my hair and the color is phenomenal! I've never had better color before. I'll keep going back to her.
