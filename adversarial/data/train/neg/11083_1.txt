We were at MGM and starving... The sign at the buffet entrance said $17.99 for the brunch. seemed like a decent price so we went up to the register as there wasn't much of a line, because as I said we were starving. She rang us up...$58.99 for two. we asked about the cost and pointed at the sign. Apparently the sign is for take out buffet.  OK, whatever, we were so hungry we didn't care. Then we proceeded to a long line to get in. We waited in line for over 30 minutes to get seated! ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! Especially considering we saw 5-10 empty tables at any given time during this ridiculous f@%king wait. There was a group of 12 people that walked up in the 5 persons or more line and waited maybe 2 minutes. The large groups were flying by us with no wait meanwhile the 2 of us and other couples were standing there waiting for over a half hour with tons of empty tables. I was shaking and nauseous by the time we were finally seated. had we known it would take that long we wouldn't have spent the money. And the food wasn't very good either. I will NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN NOR WILL WE EVER SPEND $$$ at this hotel ever again.
