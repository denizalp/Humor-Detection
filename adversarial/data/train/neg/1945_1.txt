The large(it wasn't) steak and white cheddar was pre made and was removed from a cooler to spend a few minutes in what I assume was an unplugged panini press because the chesse was unmelted the meat was piled and mashed down in the center of the bun was still cold which made the grissely meat even tougher to chew.\nThe large (it wasn't)chicken, kale, lettuce and Caesar salad was edible but should have cost half as much. This is also true of the sandwich. \nI think the lack of care in food preparation plus unjustified high prices will soon alert the Flynn Restaurant Group to a possible franchise failure
