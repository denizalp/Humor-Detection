OMG the Kouign-Amann is to die for. There are only two tables so we couldn't stay and have it there with coffee. We bought a slice and ate it on the street. It was so good, we returned immediately to take a slice home. Well, we didn't get very far, I ate the second slice in no time (didn't even share it with my partner). It is just so good. Service is great and very reasonable price as well (Cad$2.25).
