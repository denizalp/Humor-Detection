Happy Hours rock in general, but I have to admit I was impressed by Kaya's HH...1\/2 off drinks - AWESOME!!! \n\nA friend I went there last week and we got the black bean dip (delish) and then I ordered the Jamaican jerk wings which I really enjoy with their cilantro cream sauce which is delectable. She got the fish tacos which I had a bite out of and they were sooooo good! \n\nWe also got the BBQ Tofu thingy and have to admit - NOT a huge fan. There was little flavor to them and they had a cinnamony taste which was weird. Maybe I was expecting the Tofu that they have at Mad Mex as an appetizer (I think it's Asian inspired) which is really really good. \n\nSo although I wasn't blown away by all the food, the fact that we were getting 1\/2 off drinks and 90% of the food was very tasty - I think I'll check this place out more often!
