Our A\/C stopped working during summertime in AZ on a Sunday...Shocker! I called our home warranty company and they put a service request in for Denali Services. They called me Monday and were able to get is in us an appointment for Wednesday morning (luckily we had somewhere to stay for those three days). Alvin was the technician and he was SO friendly. I would definitely use Denali Services again!
