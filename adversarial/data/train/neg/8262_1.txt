I bought a groupon for 2 hours of moving services. The 3 guys showed up, I showed them the furniture I was wanting moved-I figured with only 2 hours and the travel time they wouldn't be able to get everything moved so I wanted them to focus on the furniture. I've used movers before and I honestly was soooo surprised with how fast the moved. After 15 minutes I was starting to look around and find other stuff for them to move because they were so ahead of schedule.  Such a relief to have more items moved by them and less by me.  They were great with my furniture and cared about the quality work they were doing.  Thank you skinnywimp for making another move go smooth! Would highly recommend
