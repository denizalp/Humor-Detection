Pedi alert! What can I say. Called ahead, didn't need to schedule, and on a saturday. In a chair and soaking within 5 minutes. Lady was so nice and gentle, entire experience was very relaxing. Was clean and professional. Wish there was a little mood music, but I tend to play headphones. Colors where not the largest selection, but for shopping nook salon, it was good. Oh, and super cheap.
