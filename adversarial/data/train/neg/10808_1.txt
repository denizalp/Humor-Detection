I was so happily surprised by this place! It doesn't feel like a school at all. \n\nI got a great facial and both the student and instructor seemed very knowledgeable, friendly, and experienced. They both seemed to genuinely enjoy doing the work. That always makes me happy to see. \n\nThe rooms where services are performed are small but sparkling clean, super comfortable and very well laid out. They are nicely decorated and feel very private so you can really relax. \n\nOverall I'd say this place is just kind of a hidden gem... Especially with their super reasonable prices, I'd way rather come here again than go to an overpriced spa!
