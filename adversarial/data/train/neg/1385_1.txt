Old Mexico in Century 3 Mall isn't pushing the envelope of Mexican cuisine.  Nor is it introducing North America to the multitude of diverse esoteric delicacies of Mexican regional cooking.  Then again, it never claimed any of those things.  If you put those expectations aside, and aim your sites for Coronas and taco\/burrito platters with the ubiquitous rice and re-fried beans, Old Mexico will deliver a satisfactory experience.\n\nAs a denizen of the South Hills\/Mon Valley, Old Mexico has been my go to place when I have a hankering for Mexican food.  Yes, I have had better and more authentic.  But, it is convenient for me, and I have yet to have an unsatisfactory experience there.\n\nThe portions are generous and the prices are reasonable.  I have ordered the various incarnations of the combo platters, fajitas, etc.  The meat, fish, and veggies all seemed to be reasonably fresh.  The guacamole is acceptable.  Yes, the food tends to be on the bland side, but I think they are trying to find a reasonable balance as to accommodate those who don't like the bang and zest of spicy Mexican food, and going too conservative.  I would think that the kitchen would be willing to accommodate if you request the food to be spicier.  The service was friendly and attentive.\n\nOld Mexico isn't a destination restaurant for those outside of the South Hills\/Mon Valley.  But, if you happen to be in the area and the mood for Mexican strikes, I think Old Mexico will satisfy your cravings.
