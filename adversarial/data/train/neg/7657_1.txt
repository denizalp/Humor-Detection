No appreciation for customers. We went in with personal cups that we use everywhere, because we try to be contentious of the environment. We were told that were not allowed to have our coffee within their shop, because one of the cups had the logo of another coffee shop on it. We were told the only way we could have coffee within their shop is if we use their disposable cups, which defeats the entire purpose of bring our own reusable cups. We asked to speak with a manager who said they had a \"no outside drinks\" policy. I explained we wanted to buy their coffee, so it would not be an outside drink. Apparently that wasn't acceptable. We still bought coffee, so we could leave an informed review. My Americano was burnt. If you want a decent cup of coffee from a small business that appreciates customers, don't go here.
