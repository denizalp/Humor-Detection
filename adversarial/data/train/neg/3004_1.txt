Sushi Ken is great for sushi. They've catered a couple parties for my family and their food is above average for a Japanese restaurant in the valley. The sashimi is really really good, while the rolls were average at best. Nothing special there. The entrees were decent as well. Average japanese food, nothing special. \n\nIf you are a fan of sashimi or nigiri, I would suggest this place. If you want good sushi rolls, you may want to go somewhere else.
