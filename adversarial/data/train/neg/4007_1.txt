In 1997, Steamers was where I went out to dinner with the lovely lady who is now my wife....\n\nIn 1999 on New Year's Eve (Y2K), Steamers is where I dropped to one knee and proposed to the same lady....\n\nAnd in 2001, Steamers is where my wife and I got a bite to eat after our wedding reception - since we were too busy talking to everyone at the reception to actually eat.\n\nSo when my in-laws suggested Steamers as a place to celebrate my recent birthday, I gladly accepted.\n\nAfter going, I think perhaps we should find a new place.\n\nThe restaurant still looks the same and the ambiance is fine, but the food is tired and boring.\n\nFor the price you are paying, you'd expect really good food, but instead it was all just kind of blah. The service was fine although the waiter didn't really seem to know much about the menu and I hate it when they deliver the food and have to ask who ordered what - isn't there supposed to be some sort of a system whereby they keep track of who ordered what at the table? \n\nThe calamari was overly breaded and rubbery, the spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy. My jambalaya was soupy and had too many vegetables and not enough seafood or sausage. My wife's steak was OK, but did not compare to what can be found at many steakhouses. Even the oysters on the half shell were just there, nothing special.\n\nThe one highlight of the meal was the ice-cream, brownie thing they brought for my birthday.\n\nAll in all, not enough positives to go back. I think we'll find a new place for future special events.
