A dear friend recommended this salon to me, and I have been seeing Enzo for brazilian blowout hair treatments for over a year now. The shop itself is cute and has a nice atmosphere, but I really cannot say enough wonderful things about Enzo himself. Apart from his fantastic and thorough work, he is just simply a pleasure to spend a few hours with every 3 months or so. Great place to go and get pampered and enjoy yourself.
