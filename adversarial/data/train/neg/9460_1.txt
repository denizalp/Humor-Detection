i bought some furniture from Mor. I would not do it again! When you walk in the door, they assign a person to shadow you, and prompt you throughout the time your there. I went in looking for ideas and new furniture, I told the staff I just wanted to browse. I then heard one of the supervisors prompting the salesman to follow me and help me.. I don't think this place is conducive for shopping, but probably good if your looking for Espresso colored fake wood mixed with micro fiber material. It all look the same..
