this is my second time to The Venue, once for a Big Bros\/Sisters meeting and yesterday for the scottsdale winterfest (read review). \n\nthe venue itself.....seems ok. i like the new orleans\/vegas (meaning you \"think\"  your in new orleans when really you're in the desert). there's plenty of space to move around with several side rooms. \n\nwe never found any bathrooms though. maybe because there were so many people at the winterfest event. and i wonder if there's actually no A\/C or if there was a malfunction because it was HOT in there for the winterfest event. \n\nin any case, The Venue itself was pretty cool....the winterfest was far, far, far from cool.
