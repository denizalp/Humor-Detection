This place is now called Visionworks. I went here because they were the only ones that would accept my insurance. My eye examine went only okay. One guy asked me why I was even there because after examining me he thought that I had perfect vision. I told him I was having issues driving at night and my eyes always felt tired and strained. Then the doctor discovered a stigmatism and light sensitivity. So they were in complete different pages about my vision... I was in the office purchasing my glasses for 2 hours!!! & they wanted to charge me almost $700 for 2 pairs of glasses. (That I didn't even love.. They were only okay.) before insurance this would have been $1200. Since this was my first time buying I didn't realize how over priced this is. My RX is very week. Basically just something for me to stop the glare while driving at work & working on my computer all day. I asked around and everyone I spoke with said that I should cancel the order because of the price! So I did. I heard of a place in Scottsdale called Lesco. I was in there for 15 minutes. Found 2 pair that I LOVED & the service was 5 star. I spent only $109 (single vision frames are $30 w\/ lenses.. My second pair they added anti glare for around $80... Total price coming to $109) I will never go anywhere else to purchase frames! And I would refer all of my friends to Lesco for their frames as well! Don't waste your time and money at Visionworks!!!
