I always past this place when I'm driving to school so I thought I'd finally give it a try! I got the Brown Cow (root beer and vanilla cream) while my boyfriend got The Jojo ( dr. pepper, raspberry pur√©e, and coconut cream). The soda pop tasted better than we expected! You have the option to customize your own special drink if nothing on the \"pop favorites\" menu catches your eye. They also offer popcorn and cookies. Always a gamble on whether or not your popcorn will be fresh. \n\nThis is a really cool shop with a fun, unique concept. The shop itself is a small location that offers a drive thru if you don't feel like getting out of your car. Will be returning to try their other flavors!
