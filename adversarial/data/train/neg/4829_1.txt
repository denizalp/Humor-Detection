Best theater for catching the 'Cinemark Classic Series' of films when they're showing!\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed seeing a wide variety of mainstream and independent films at this theater through the years.  The Century 16 is a nice big theater with nice, comfortable seating and great video and sound presentation.\n\nReally, as a movie-goer the only complaint I have is their concession stand prices.  I think that their soft drinks are about 2-4 dollars higher than what you'd normally pay at your average fast-food place or 7-Eleven.  I'd recommend bringing your own if you go with your significant other in a bag or purse.
