A+.  Sat at the bar--got right in at 7:30 on a Friday night.  Immediate service.  Great house margarita.  Had pomegranate seeds on the homemade guacamole--never thought of that but will have to do this at home now.  Able to get steak fajitas done medium rare--which is disappointing everywhere else--but perfect here!  Already counting down to my next trip to Scottsdale to come back!
