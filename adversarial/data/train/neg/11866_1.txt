I had my misgivings about this hotel because of other reviews I had read. \n\nI was a little concerned because I tend to be a light sleeper and the sound of planes taking off could really kill any plans for a good nights sleep.\n\nAs it turns out, the planes seemed to stop flying at around 11:00 pm. At least we didn't hear any after that. \n\nSince my boyfriend and I don't go to sleep until around 1:00 am this worked out nicely. But I suppose if you go to bed early, it would be a bigger issue.\n\nAs for parking, it sucks big time. The parking deck was packed and we ended up parking on the 4th level and had to basically just walk down to ground level. We didn't see an elevator....maybe there was one....in which case we will both feel like silly goobers. \n\nOnce you get your key though, you can get into the hotel through the parking garage with that. I made several trips out to my car and didn't really feel unsafe.\n\nThe biggest issue? It was bleeping COLD and I am just not into doing that much cardio in crap weather. \n\nI actually really liked the weird bluish light that came into our windows. I told my bf that I think it would be cool if ALL places had that bluish light. I found it calming. \n\nI slept well, and was awoken bright and early by the sound of planes taking off overhead. I didn't mind, although it was a little jarring. But, hey it's just as good as an alarm clock by any standards. \n\nBreakfast was a little annoying. They make you sit down and order something so then you have to wait for them to fix it for you.\n\nI appreciate the desire to be all fancy and stuff but I just want to grab my bagel and coffee and run. I am really just not that fussy. \n\nIt also seemed very clean, nice smelling, and bug free, which is HUGE with me. I am fairly easy to please so I guess that is something to keep in mind as well. I am a budget traveler so I usually just stay in hostels or cheap motels so this was a very nice treat. \n\nMy bf and I both liked it. I would stay here again once I have a little more cash.
