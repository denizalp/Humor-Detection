I love Smiley's. It's that kind of amazing local establishment where Ginny (the owner) knows everyone's name, their pets name and the products you like to buy. You know the one....the only place around that carries that food\/treat\/toy your pampered pet likes, so you will travel near and far to find? For us, that pet is our cat, Nicholas, and that hard to find treat is the dehydrated chicken treats he loves. What I love is that but everything they have is a quality product. None of that good, better, best stuff like the box stores; they will only sell the best, healthiest products for your pet. Super friendly staff and fantastic products... I mean, what else can you ask for??
