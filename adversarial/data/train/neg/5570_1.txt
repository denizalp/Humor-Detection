Good pub grub.\n\nThe best fried pickles I've had in Phoenix so far. So many places do the pickle chips, but I prefer the spears. AG has nice, big spears fried in a tasty batter with ranch. From 4-7 you get 6 big spears for $3.\n\nThe beef stroganoff is great too. Once you get past stroganoff using bow tie pasta you'll love it.\n\nA little loud at times, lots of sports on the various TV screens, crowded bar area.
