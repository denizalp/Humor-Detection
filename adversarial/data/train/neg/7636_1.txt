My second time using them. Had lots of mud tracks, olive tree tracks and an ugly plumbing mess on our carpets. Joe and Michel took time in identifying the problem areas with me. During the cleaning they double checked my satisfaction of each area. All spots are clean and I didn't have to pay a ridiculous price. Plus THEY DIDN'T TRY TO UPSELL ME LIKE ALL CARPET CLEANERS DO WHEN THEY STEP IN YOUR HOUSE! Great company. I highly recommend.
