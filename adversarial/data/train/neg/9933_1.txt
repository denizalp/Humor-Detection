Number One Pho deserves more than the 3 star rating that it currently has. The food is really good. Compared to other Vietnamese places in Cleveland, it's one of my favorites. I ordered pho, of course, but their menu is quite extensive. The fresh bean sprouts and basil served with the pho were plentiful and clean. \n\nOne of my dining partners had the chicken and cabbage salad and she really enjoyed it. It was a very generously sized portion. Another had a peppery chicken dish that looked really good (didn't get to try it). We also shared a few orders of spring rolls. Now those i didn't care for. Probably would skip the appetizer next time. \n\nParking could be an issue but we were able to find a spot on the road. It wasn't busy when we stopped in. Everyone was nice and the service was pretty fast.
