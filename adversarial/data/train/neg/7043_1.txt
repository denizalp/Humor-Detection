OMG this place is amazing! My boss and I were here for a conference and wanted a nice dinner. I did a little research and found this place on yelp! We didn't have a reservation, so we gave our name and told it would be a thirty minute wait. No problem found a comfy spot in the couch and looked at their amazing cocktail menu! I had an amazing vodka drink with watermelon cube with spicy pepper taste and my boss enjoyed a fruit and whiskey cocktail topped with cured Italian meat. It was exactly what we were looking for. \nThe food was incredible I would everything again! The biscuits were incredible! Loved the Brussel sprouts and beef short entree. The burnt ends were also an amazing appetizer! Highly recommend sharing it worked out beautifully!
