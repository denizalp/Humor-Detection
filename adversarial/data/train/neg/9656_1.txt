The food: I ordered the crab & avocado quesadilla, some queso & chips.... Whew! Lots of food! I did not finish it all. The quesadilla was REALLY good! The crab tasted like real crab, not imitation crap. The queso was awesome, came with it's own flame under the fondue bowl to keep the queso hot. \n\nThe Decor: Great! The patio is really nice. They have one long table for large groups. \n\nThe service:\nJULIANNA was my attentive, but not annoying waitress. She kept my drinks flowing and always had a smile when passing by my table. \n\nRecommend?\nYes especially for groups...
