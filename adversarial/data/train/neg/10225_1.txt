this place used to be pretty great but it has gone down significantly in the last year. the food used to be great but now is sub par. they downgraded their nachos from pulled pork to ground beef. also the nacho chips were stale. very disappointing. their fries with all the fixings used to be served on a large plate with tons of meat but now is a tiny plate with scraps of fried chicken. also beware of their beers - the menu said $6 for Highland seasonal but I noticed when I got home that we were charged $8. the service wasn't great either. the place wasn't very crowded and it still took us almost 2 hours to get out of there. won't be going there again any time soon if ever.
