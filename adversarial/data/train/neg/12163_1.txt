What a great surprise.\n\nThree of us had dinner here.  The restaurant was clean and modern.  The staff were professional, friendly and they knew their dishes.\n\nWe had salad rolls, cocnut shrimp, green chile mussels to start.  The salad rolls were some of the best we have had.  The shrimp was ok, and the the mussels were excellent.\n\nThe entrees were terrific and all three of us enjoyed them.  I had the rice vermicelli bowl with chicken.  It was a first rate presentation of quality food.  the pan fried salmon was also a hit.  As well, the waiter recommended a white wine which my ffriends raved about.\n\nThe waiter told us that the menu was being upgraded to add steak and lobster.\n\n\nOne improvement suggestion - move to cloth napkins rather than paper.\n\nGive it a try.
