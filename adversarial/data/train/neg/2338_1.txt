Has most of the great stuff of the full size cousin but with lower cost. My girlfriend and I stopped in here and ordered dinner. the food tasted just as great but i was able to eat it from home while watching a movie. I've never had the fries before and decided to have them with my lamb souvlaki (how ever its spelled) and they tasted great. my only complaint is that we ordered a hummus appetizer and it only came with 2 pitas, when we needed 3 or 4. \n\nyou order from a counter like you would from in-n-out or other fast food place, they give you a number and in our case they brought it to our table in a plastic bag ready to go.
