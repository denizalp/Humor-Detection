Applebee's just underwent a major revamp of the menu so I thought this would be a good time to update my review. The current effort seems to be to transform Applebee's into a steak house along the lines of Outback Steakhouse. They have a rack with hunks of wood and a sign touting the Wood Fired Grill items in the entry and steak knives that look identical to the Outback Steakhouse. \nI had seen an ad on TV for their wood grilled sirloin steak plus two sides for just $9.99 for a limited time (it will be $12.99 after the initial promo). I had a tasty 6 ounce sirloin steak grilled just the way I like it and garlic mashed potatoes, and broccoli. All the food was very good and the steak was even tender. Service was friendly and snappy. \nOverall, the meal was a great value. I just question whether the Valley needs yet another steakhouse chain.
