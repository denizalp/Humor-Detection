3.5 Stars\n\nWent to The Arrogant Butcher during its first week and for a place just getting its sea legs, it was pretty good.  Clearly the place is popular with the downtown crowd - which is clearly starving for more quality restaurants.  Casual, kind of loud atmosphere with an industrial feel to the decor.  The apps we ordered, the potato fritters and rock shrimp were both deep fried and solidly average, even though they were the top reocmmendations from our server.  The brussel sprout and squash salad, though, was excellent - I split it with a colleague.  The crab stuffed chicken was fine, but nothing special.  And, it was pan-fried - I had no idea I was ordering so much fried food.  We sampled a couple desserts and they were ok.  The server was very friendly and even comp'd us, without us asking, my colleagues' jambalaya which was too spicy to eat.  The manager also came over to apologize.  They're clearly trying hard at The Arrogant Butcher, and once they iron out a few kinks, I'm sure they'll earn at least 4 stars.
