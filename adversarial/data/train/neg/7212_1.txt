Food was delicious at a very reasonable price. Loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. The waiting staff was nice and checked on us regularly and the place was pretty packed to the brim on a regular non holiday Saturday evening. Goes to show why this restaurant has opened such a long time and business still booming. \n\nGreat food at such a low price. What a deal!
