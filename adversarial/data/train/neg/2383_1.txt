If you're in the mood for a hot dog or sausage sandwich, you'll like JJ's. But, if you go there hoping for something more, prepare to be disappointed. Their chili is good on a dog, but not great on its own. Balsamic salad dressing was very blah. Both the Italian sausage and Andouille sandwiches are good. Their onion rings are the skinny shoestring kind.
