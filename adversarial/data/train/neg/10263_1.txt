I love Dr. Krugly and Dr. Bradshaw.  Dr. Krugly works with me and Dr. Bradshaw works with my dog.  Their entire staff are friendly and obviously love working there.  Dr. Krugly is excellent at explaining and treating.  I am the survivor of two car accidents and have related problems with my neck, ribs, hip and ankle.  With regular treatment and recommended exercise (check out their resident personal trainer Erin) I am getting better and better and having fewer relapses.  I have been to several Physical Therapists, Rolfers, Massage Therapists, etc. but Dr. Krugly surpasses them all. Dr. Bradshaw helped my dog when she fell and hurt her back.  She is gentle and very in tune with animals and got my Tina back in shape with just two adjustments.
