YUM! Great place for a hearty sandwich, fresh pizza and the best macaroni and cheese ever. When you walk in the place looks busy with all different types of pastas and sauces you can imagine. The menu is posted on the back wall along with cold cases filled with homemade sides and fresh meats and cheeses. If you're smart, call ahead and have your order ready when you arrive because the wait can be long during peak times. I love how you can grab a beer from the cooler or a bottle of wine to share on a cute date. I haven't had the chance to buy the fresh pizza dough, but will get on that pronto! Make sure to get their stamp card (spend $5 and get a stamp) for some future savings- trust me you'll be back!
