Nice atmosphere and decor.  It was definitely a place for the working crowd.  A tab on the expensive side.\n\nThe food was tasty.  I ordered the lobster quesadilla which was delicious.  I'm not a big guac fan, but the quac they had on the side was great.  My friends got the pulled pork pizza and the stuffed chicken and they both really enjoyed their meals.\n\nThe menu was nice but I wish it was more extensive.  That goes for the wine selection as well.  I know it's the BEER bistro, but I feel there should have been more than 3 white wine selections for those who aren't a huge fan of beer.  \n\nAll in all, I had a tasty time and would go back.
