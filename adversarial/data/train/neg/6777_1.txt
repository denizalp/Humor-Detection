We payed up front for June but we won't be returning for July. The instructors are so great with my 3.5 year old and I feel that she is learning from them but the facility is so old looking and dirty.  The locker rooms have rusted out lockers that are falling apart and the doors are also rusted out and it gives a dingy appearance.  The little play area for kids is distracting to most young kids who don't want to leave the dirty toys to go to their lesson.  I really wish they would update the locker rooms and front entrance.
