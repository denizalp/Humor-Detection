The good: beautiful facility, lots of classes, super great admin staff, awesome location. \n\nThe bad: the free personal training session - I was advised not to do any bootcamp classes (apparently I would be predisposing myself to injury). This is silly because I am 24 with no health conditions, and have been exercising regularly for years. I know this was an attempt to get me to pay for PT - but it made me sad :(\n\nThe spin classes were alright, but not a fan of the old bikes that didn't display the RPM. Maybe I'm not the right clientele for this gym, but I was also missing the pump up top 40 beats! \n\nSummary: All the classes were fine, but none were amazingly fun or awesome for $110\/month. Maybe more accurate class descriptions would help members know the level and style of each of the classes. I guess specialty fitness classes are the way to go in Toronto?
