My hair was done very SLOPPY \nAnd it was so unfortunate that we we're running late. We were suppose to leave at 430 pm but I was seen around 350 so by the time the hair stylist was done, we were late.\nI showed her how I wanted my hair, shown her few pics and extension hair added for a HOLLYWOOD STYLE hair...\nMy hair was SO HORRIBLE on my wedding day and I didn't have anymore time to spare to get it fix. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE
