YOU CAN ORDER ONLINE!\nIf you order $50 or more, shipping is free. They shipped my chocolate in a styrofoam container packed with dry ice and ice packs. The ice packs were still frozen when I opened the box. Perfection\nPs in case u need another reason to order from them, they sent me a large bar of chocolate as a thank you xmas gift for ordering from them over the summer\n\nIt's so hard to describe how much I love hexx chocolates, luckily I don't have to because hey offer free chocolate tastings! I think the best way to describe it is it tastes more like pressed cocoa powder so when it melts in your mouth it doesn't have the oily texture. If you buy 5 bars for $30 they also provide an ice pack so you don't have to worry about your precious chocolate melting. To taste the chocolate, just head to the counter in the back and ask for samples.
