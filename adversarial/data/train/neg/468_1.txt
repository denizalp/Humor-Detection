So this is hard for me, because Nova's is one of those places i really WANT to like a lot. I mean, i love the idea of Nova's, and i daydream sometimes about taking a leisurely stroll through Plaza Midwood to grab a Sunday morning yummy and some good coffee, but unfortunately i keep leaving unimpressed with everything i try (some of which, not even my kids wanted to finish eating). This is always very disappointing, but actually, probably more of a good thing, since i live so close by. \n\nOn the plus side, they are super friendly, which is why i always consider going back. They are always so kind to my kids, which i love! So kind. They seem to go out of their way to be friendly. My kids LOVE Nova's, and it's so refreshing to go somewhere to grab coffee and have people seem genuinely at peace with you bringing little kids in. My 4-year-old said he is going to work at Nova's when he grows up, and my 5-year-old says she wants visit every day. So kudos to you Nova's, for having the kindest employees!\n\nPros: Super friendly, great with kids, good coffee.\nCons: Entirely unappealing baked goods, slightly pricey.
