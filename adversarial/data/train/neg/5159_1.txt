I had a good experience with this company fixing my heater last winter so I thought I'd use them for a plumbing problem I had over the weekend. BIG MISTAKE!! My water softener, which was already not working, was leaking even though I had it bypassed. I called them Saturday and they said they would send someone out first thing Monday morning. Well the plumber showed up and \"fixed\" the problem by disconnecting my water softener. It took him all of 5 to 10 minutes to do this and had the nerve to turn to me and say that will be 125 dollars. I told him I had a coupon for my service charge and then he said that's only if I can't diagnose the problem and I did, \"it's broken.\" I thought I finally found a fair and honest company to do business with. I was wrong. I understand all work needs to be payed for but 125 dollars for something so basic as a disconnect and to tell me it's broken??  I will Never do Business with TempRite A\/C and Plumbing again.
