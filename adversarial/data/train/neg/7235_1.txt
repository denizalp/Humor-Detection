I love that there are even reviews on parks on this site! Ha! I'm totally in!\nI moved to this area a couple of weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised to learn that there are THREE parks super close to me - ALL with skating rinks! Yay!!\n\nSo, pointing out right now, that it's December and I've only gone to this park for skating. As such this review is a bit limited. \n\nThe park isn't huge, but it's a decent size with a good off-leash dog area. The rink isn't huge, but is a good size. They have pretty decent hours for general \"pleasure\" skating (no hockey allowed!) and tons of hours for \"shinny\" (pick-up hockey). There is an indoor changing area and washrooms. You need your own skates - no rentals available.\n\nIt's amazing to have a skating rink in the neighbourhood! I can't wait to go back!
