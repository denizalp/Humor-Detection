Came here really late after the Penn and Teller show at Rio's and we were craving dim sum.\nNot very good...\nSome of the dishes, like the siu mai weren't fresh, maybe from the previous night...\nSome of the dishes that came out didn't seem authentic, one was wrapped in a tortilla...?\nAnother was also odd, \"gold sand bun\" or something, it was a little sweet bun with sugar in the middle... Never had that before and I don't recommend it.\nA couple things they did get right, but I can't remember which dishes because they were just right, not exceptional.\n\nWe may have gone at a bad time because every time we walked past it (over the next few days) there were long lines for the restaurant.
