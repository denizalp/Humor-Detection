They are not consistent. About half the time the food is excellent, and the other half... meh.  And I order the SAME thing each time - the Philly Steak sandwich (no onions).\n\nWhen it's good - really good (which was the first time I came in)\n- Hot\n- Juicy \n- Moist\n- Flavorful\n\nWhen it's meh (the last time I went in there, and about half the time in general - I've been in there about a dozen times)\n- Hot meat, but cold bread\/bun\n- Dry - both meat and roll\/bun\n- Stale bun\n\nI've watched them make the sandwiches, including putting the bun over the meat at the end, and I'm thinking that sometimes they just slap the bun on top of the meat for like 10 seconds, instead of letting it simmer there, soaking in the juices and the heat.  When it's been bad, it's clear they didn't keep the bun on the meat long enough because the meat is hot and the roll is cold. And when it's off it taste no better than a sandwich I could get at Subway.\n\nBut when they do it good (everything is hot and moist), damn that stuff is GOOD.\n\nIt's just so hit and miss and each time I get a 'miss', like today, I'm more hesitant to go back.
