A group of 11 of us had our Saturday night ruined at Estiatorio Milos. Half of us were Greek and were very excited to try Vegas's new Greek offering. I had eaten at the New York location years ago and remember excellent food and service. We arrived promptly for our 8:30 reservation and were told that our table was in the process of being set up.  Fifteen minutes later, we had not yet been called and were ignored when we approached the hostess stand. At 9:00 we were again told that our table was being set up. We should have left at this point. Numerous other patrons were also complaining about being seated late for their reservations. Finally, at 9:30, we were shown to our table, without the slightest apology. Someone promptly brought bread to the table, but we didn't even get water or menus until we asked for them over 5 minutes later. This was the trend for the whole dinner. The service was a total disaster. Our order was messed up, the food took an eternity and our glasses were often empty. Our whole fish and sides were very good, but certainly not worth the hefty price tag.  French fries were $15 an order (we needed 3 orders for our table), a Greek tomato salad was $27 and TINY!!! The tuna was a good cut and fresh, but very bland. Dinner and drinks ended up being about $100 per person. Three and a half hours later, we were finished and left with a bad taste in our mouths. No one seemed to be at all concerned about our bad experience in the restaurant.
