I have to admit I was skeptical when they served our soft drinks in a can instead of a fountain drink and then no soup well I was sure it would be a disappointment but well then the entrees came and proved me wrong.  My S&S pork was great even the bell pepper was eaten, my daughters Chow Mein was great the best we have had here in Las Vegas in over 3 years.  My wife thought the pan fried noodles would be the big ones like we are used to but oh well now we know.  The only reason this is not a 5 is the soup.
