came here recently and sat outside with a small group of people. I got the ysters for $32, for 12 oysters (2 varieties) they weren't the greatest. they didn't taste very fresh at all. and weren't shucked well. the SO got the seafood pasta, but he wasn't impressed. you can def make better pasta at home. the pasta wasn't cooked dente, it was too soft. you could tell it was dried package pasta. not the best. our server was an idiot, we were waiting 40 minutes when i called the server over to ask about our desserts. she was like \"oh you guys want those?\" and turned around. she also took forever to get a plate and was pretty rude. maybe she was having an off day. the staff inside seemed nicer, but it def wasn't as busy as the patio. overall, i was disappointed with the oysters, food and service here. i remember all 3 being great a few years ago. i used to love the voodoo hours as well, but i've notice a decline in the quality of those oysters in the last year or so as well.  shame.
