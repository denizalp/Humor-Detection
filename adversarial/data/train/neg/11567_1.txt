I used a MyVegas reward this time so I can't really complain that I'm not getting my money's worth.\nI made it in before the dinner changeover and waited in line again to get seated....and waited....and waited...finally I get asked to follow a host and she tries to give me a table right infront of the entrance.\nNo thanks.\nI ask for another table and was asked to stand by the entrance.  \nAnd so i wait... And wait again.\nI glance over to where all the hostesses are standing and chit chatting amongst themselves until I got the attention of one.\nHere is what I hate...\nI got asked to stand to the side...which is fine....but instead of walking over to me to show me to my table... The lady beckons to me with her hand from across the way.  \n15 minutes have passed from the time I got my receipt and I got seated. \nFood is fine.\nDrink server is fine.\nHostess...not impressed.
