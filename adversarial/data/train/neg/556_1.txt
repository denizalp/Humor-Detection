Watch your bill and don't be surprised if you get another bill in a year for an upcharge that AHN suddenly thinks you need to pay.  Sure, AHN facilities are clean but their billing is dirty.  I hate UPMC but they bill your carrier once. AHN bills your carrier for the most they can get and if they don't get it, they come after you. Consider yourself warned.
