Some girlfriends and I went to Chuy's after work on a Monday; none of us had ever been, but I'd had my eye on it since it took over Zink (boo).  \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised to learn about the 4:00-7:00 Happy Hour free nachos in the bar, and they were pretty darn delicious for being free!  I was hoping for some guacamole on the \"car trunk\" buffet, but for free, I'll deal with chips, ground beef, queso, beans and salsa.\n\nAlthough the decor is loud, fun, and crazy as other reviewers have mentioned, most of the wait staff seemed sad and dumpy, shuffling by slowly but fast enough to never ask if we needed anything.  I ordered two glasses of sangria ($5.95) and there was so much ice that I maybe got 3 good sips out of each glass before it was empty.  \n\nIt was a nice enough night that there were a decent amount of people on the patio, and the restaurant side was hoppin' by the time we left at 7:30, but I was surprised that the bar area was just the bar and maybe 5 hightop tables that felt oddly arranged.\n\nAll in all, probably a fun place to take the kids or sit outside on a nice night, but something about it just didn't make me want to plan my next visit.
