This is a brand new hotel, close to the airport (YYZ is about 10 km away). There is a Swiss Chalet, McDonalds, Royal Bank and most important, a very good pub (Fionn MacCool's) in the parking lot!  No need to run all over looking for food.\n\nI understand that the \"WESTIN\" set up the Element hotel brand, so SPG points are earned for your stay. \n\nThe staff have been awesome, rooms are brand new, clean and quiet.  \n\nI will be back here the next time I am in town!
