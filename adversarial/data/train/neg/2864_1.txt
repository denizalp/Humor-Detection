For as slammed as they were, the wait staff kept checking in on me and kept me updated with my order, total time was 40 minutes from order to table but they were SLAMMED, and being in no rush and working in restaurants before I understood, can't say much for the other patrons but they were hauling ass behind the kitchen and the sushi chefs didn't sacrifice quality for trying to get orders out. Definitely worth the wait. I only wish the other patrons didn't give them a hard time for the long wait. Sushi is an art and food sushi requires attention to detail. Good job guys. I came in May 12, 2018.
