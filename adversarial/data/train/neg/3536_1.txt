No better value for Lebanese food on the yonge street strip. Ordering can be a struggle sometimes, but you're basically able to fully customise any dish (without extra cost, which is unusual). The quality of the salads (they have about five to choose from) is the highlight. And the baklava makes up for any thing that went wrong in the ordering process! It's incredible. Take out at this place, as only a few eat in seats.
