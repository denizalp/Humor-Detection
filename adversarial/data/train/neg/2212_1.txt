Excellent service. You get what you pay for and the server was flexible with our taste and spend preferences. Even converted one of our guests who claimed he didn't like sushi. While the drinks were unknowingly expensive, $12 per bottle of Japanese IPA which inflated our suggested cost per person of $50, the experience and service was worth the price. This is not a place for the price sensitive. You're in Vegas! Would love to visit again and highly recommend.
