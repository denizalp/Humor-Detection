The food is decent but it is a little pricey for the quality. I've come to expect that with this place, very skimpy on the portion sizes. When someone who spends the amount of money that We do at this restaurant asks for extra bbq sauce the restaurant should oblige. You will not keep customers by being a cheapskate with the sauce. You can always add an option on UberEATS for people to purchase extra sauce if need be but for Pete's sake stop acting like jerks always ignoring the request. There are other options for bbq in the area!
