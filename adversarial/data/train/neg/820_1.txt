Jeff and Brad have serviced all of our vehicles for 5 years. Absolutely the highest quality work, fair price, and delivered quickly. Above all, these guys have real integrity. They won't try to sell you what you don't need.  We took our vehicles to the big auto dealers for many years, but will never go back. Crawford's Auto is a rare find, and we will never go anywhere else.
