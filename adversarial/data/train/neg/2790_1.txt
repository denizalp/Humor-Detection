Very clean, quiet, polite staff. Excellent location. We were only in Toronto for 1 night but can't complain at all about this hotel. We were about a 5 minute walk from the CN Tower and the Harbourfront. The hotel has a little convenience shop by the check in area that had some nice snacks. There's a starbucks and a small grocery store across the street as well. Valet parking was $50 per day but my husband and I parked on a surface lot on the corner for $25 with no issues.
