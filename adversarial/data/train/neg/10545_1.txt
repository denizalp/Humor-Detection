Taija Rae is so awesome!! she did a cover up on my back and a quote tat on my forearm and I couldn't be any happier! She is very good and very specific in the placing of the tattoos which is great to me! If anyone is looking for someone who can do some great stuff it's this girl! Highly recommended! And the new shop was so clean and very nice!
