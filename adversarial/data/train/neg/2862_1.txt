Been back twice since my first visit, and loving this place more and more! Taking my parents here was the most fun, sat at the counter, they ordered a shake and a phosphate and talked to me about how they did this in the old days. I ordered the Razzle Dazzle, just because its fun to say, and OMG the flavor was so yummy and intense...the group favorite actually!
