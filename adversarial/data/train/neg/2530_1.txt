Ate from this restaurant 2 mornings in a row.. first time we sat in the restaurant. It was really warm (too warm) in there and got a real rushed type feeling. Hubby got corned beef which was small in general. I got pancakes.. both were ok. Just ok. \nSecond morning I called and tried to order take out but the woman said that you have to come in personally and order it from the bar.. I've NEVER heard or seen any restaurant do that. Get a credit card over the phone or whatever to ensure order. The whole point is to run in and pick up your food. If I wanted to wait I'd eat there?! Unfortunately when we got there it was a 30min wait and we had a flight to catch so we ordered to go. \nWe both got omelettes, which I have to admit, they were the fluffiest I've ever had. Flavor could've been better with better quality fillings. The tomatoes in mine were really under ripe. I wanted to try the Dutch baby but was short on time since I needed to stand there while the food was being cooked. If I could've ordered in advance I totally would've tried it!\nThe servers, hostess and cashier were all kind of a hot mess. No smiles anywhere. It did seem really busy I admit but still.. pull it together people.. it's a breakfast place. Start the morning with a smile!
