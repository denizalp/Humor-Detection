6\/22\/17 Update: Last visit there was was a 2 hour wait to see the doctor. Today I was seen on time, so I am upgrading my rating to 4 stars from the initial 3 stars.\n\nNewer facility next to Tempe St. Luke's hospital. Was in an ER with a knee injury and the soonest appointment I could get with this practice was about 2 weeks after the injury. That was scary since my knee was locked in a 90 degree angle (I was unable to straighten the leg) and I was on crutches. I was told to check in 30 minutes before my appointment time even though I had printed out and completed the online new patient forms before my appointment.\n\nTwo hours before my scheduled appointment I received a call from this office and was told that I could not be seen in their Tempe office due to some \"technical\" issue. I was given a choice of driving into downtown Phoenix or rescheduling for a week later. With my knee still iffy, I chose to reschedule to the next week. We are now 3 weeks out from the injury.\n\nThe day of my appointment I arrived 15 minutes before my \"check-in\" time. There were about 12 people in the waiting room. Only about 8 of them seemed to be patients, the other 4 were family. There was ample seating for about 20 people and a TV monitor showing infomercials for the doctors with this group. The receptionist was friendly and bilingual.\n\nThere were 2 doctors working out of this office on this day. I was finally seen by the doctor 2 hours after my \"check-in\" time (1.5 hours after my appointment time). Keep in mind that this is the end of May and the winter visitors are gone, so I can only imagine how long the waits are in the winter.\n\nOnce you are called to the exam room, a medical assistant takes your vitals signs and asks what happened. Then a Physician's Assistant (PA) comes in and asks what happened. Finally, the doctor comes in and asks what happened. Hmmmm.\n\nI will review the doctor separately after my care is complete.
