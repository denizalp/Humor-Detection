I have used this pharmacy for two of my dogs; one needed an oral chemo and I am now getting a dementia drug for another dog.  I haven't had any issues in getting the drugs when needed, I just make sure to call in advance and usually get them within a week.  I am grateful for these folks as the medications I have needed have to be compounded and there is not a pharmacy nearby that my vet has recommended.
