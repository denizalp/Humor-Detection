I was really disappointed with our experience here. I LOVE the Cafe Hollander in Milwaukee, but this place was just not the same. Our food was super salty and nothing special, and the cocktail I got (I'm not a beer person) was not good at all. Unfortunately, we won't be back to the Madison location.
