Anytime my family and I are on the east side of town, and we have a little bit of free time, we stop in and play a few games here.  The breadth of the games available is incredible-- from very old machines to more current pinball games themed after bands or movies or TV shows.  They even have some of the games I grew up with in the 1980s, like Donkey Kong, Galaga, Centipede, Dig Dug, and Pac Man.  Ah... the memories.  This is a great place for adults and kids alike, and you will be occupied for as many quarters as you are willing to sink into the machines.  Also, the owner's knowledge about electronics and the care he puts into the renovation of some of these machines is awe-inspiring.  He has always been quietly friendly, and watching him work is always a learning experience.  What a great place... a must-see in Las Vegas for adults and families.
