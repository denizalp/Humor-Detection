I came here on a yelp review for the area and really didn't know what to expect since a lot of people mentioned long waits.  I came on a Sunday at 3 pm and had the whole place to myself. Sat inside waitress's super nice and gave me some food tips I ended up ordering yellow curry chicken and thai iced tea I missed the lunch menu ended at 2 but all in all food was good curry was a little thicker than usual but meat was tender and veggies perfect. Entree was around $10 and tea $3 I also ordered basil chicken as suggested for my lunch tomorrow (beats airplane food) I walked from downtown Phoenix close to ASU about 2 mile walk but yes I would come again when in Phoenix!
