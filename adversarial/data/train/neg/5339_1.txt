Haven't been to Jameson's for a good long time. Looks like they have done a swap of all their staff. Server was very prompt and helpful. \n\nDidn't have a chance to try the food but menu has definitely been updated and looks quite tasty. They have food and drink specials everyday and brunch menu looks pretty tasty. \n\n3 stars cause was pretty average pub stop in for some drinks. Service was good and will go back for brunch for sure. Feel food will either up or down the stars so stay tuned for an update.
