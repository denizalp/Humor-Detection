UPDATED REVIEW: after my poor experience with the gyro sandwich I was promptly contacted by the manager, which of course got me to come back and give them another try. \n\nThis time I actually went to the location and it was quite nice on the inside. Service was terrific! My waitress was very fast and very friendly, no complaints at all, the staff seemed really on point. \n\nInstead of the gyro I order the chicken shawarma lavosh wrap, which was pretty good. The lavosh was kinda thin and crispy - more like a tortilla really. But the wrap itself was good as it held together right until the end of the sandwich. The chicken was nicely grilled and it had some crisp veggies and a garlic sauce, but I did find it slightly on the dry side, overall. \nThe side salad was very fresh and just the perfect amount. \n\nWhile I wasn't blown away by the wrap, I give a decent score - certainly better than the gyro which just tasted like salt and made of that generic compressed gyro meat instead of fresh shaved lamb\/beef steaks. But a gyro that authentic is really hard to find in Phoenix, to be honest. \n\nSo my updated score is an improvement, though I am still not 100% sold on Pita Jungle. This particular location is welcoming and clean and the staff gets top marks. I can't give it full stars for the food, because it just isn't the authentic middle eastern food I am looking for, it's more a trendy fusion style, something fresher than fast food, but still more a lunch meal than a nice dinner.
