Love this place for the food! We have eaten here several times and always enjoyed our meals and the varied menu. Patio, inside table or bar area all are comfortable and the decor pleasant, light. Service has always been pleasant and the prices reasonable. Music may be a bit loud, but that's the way they bill themselves so no surprise. Happy to have Joe's in the hood.
