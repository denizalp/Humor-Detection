The ordering system here is horrendous.  Instead of ordering everything at the register then sitting down and having it brought to you, you have to order certain things at certain locations.  I.E. sandwiches at the front, then salads down the line, then remind the person ringing everything up what you had, what was part of a combo, what wasn't.\n\nOverly confusing and annoying.  Food is average, just go to Panera Bread.
