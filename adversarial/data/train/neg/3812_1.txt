As I have said in other reviews, the mark of a great place is consistency, yet again great pasta, sauces that cannot be beat and friendly service, this is a place that deserves the support of the whole Yelp community.\n\nAnd again, the real secret star of the place, the chicken wings, they alone are worth the drive over on a stormy night.
