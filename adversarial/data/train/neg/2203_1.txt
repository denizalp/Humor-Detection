Came here for an early dinner on a saturday afternoon and they were still serving cheap dim sum.  Place was filthy, napkins and food all over the floor.  Service was cold, like the waiters all didn't want to work there.\n\nWe ordered 4 dishes which were completely forgettable.  Food was completely boring, no wok hay at all.  If you want to have cheaper food at odd times then sure come here.  But if you want quality, best to look elsewhere.
