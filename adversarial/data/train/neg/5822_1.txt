Adorable place to grab some breakfast\/brunch. Unfortunately, it was too crowded at the time we came for us to dine inside, so we dined outside instead, but it was still lovely. Sunday brunch seems to be a very busy time. It was a long wait to order and long wait to get food. Go before the rush if you can.\n\nSmoked olives appetizer was yummy, so that abated my hunger a bit during the long wait. I ordered the veg crepe, boyfriend ordered the breakfast burro. The breakfast burro was too heavy for my tastes, but I enjoyed my veg crepe a lot. It's basically like a samosa in a crepe, with a little fried\/baked cheese on top. You get the tamarind and mint sauce you usually get with samosas.\n\nYummy breakfast\/brunch place, but go early if you can to avoid the rush!
