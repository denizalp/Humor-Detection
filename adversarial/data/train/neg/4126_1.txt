We came here this Saturday, St. Patrick's Day, the second day of their soft opening. We were seated right away. The nice server took our order immediately and accommodated our request, eg: if they could grill our onions in our guacamole burger instead of raw, and we specified how we want our burgers made, etc; the server asked the cook and we were gladly accommodated with our requests. Service is fast, efficient and friendly. Even offered us 'to go' cups when server noticed we could not finish the humongous shakes. \nFood is very good, what's expected of Steak 'n Shake. \nThe Staff  are still ironing some bumps they encounter which is expected as it's still their soft opening. Cashier couldn't take gift cards  yet but stated they will in the future. \nOverall, will come back here and will recommend it to friends and family. They have really tasty burgers, delicious shakes; very reasonable price, place is very clean, really spacious (the Biggest Steak 'n Shake in the world!)\nAnd, excellent service!
