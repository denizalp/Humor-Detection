Had dinner here on a business trip and enjoyed it. Our waitress was personable and quick and didn't hesitate with recommendations. She knew the menu well as well as all the various beers available. \nWhile my prime rib sliders were a bit on the dry side, the cheesecake was awesome! \nThere are plenty of TVs throughout and the outdoor seating was perfect for a night of drinks, food, baseball and laughs.
