I've read some of the previous reviews already before posting my own, and overall I love the place and will be a repeat customer. \n\nWe got the baby back ribs since they are dry rub and not smothered in BBQ sauce like they normally are - which might be the source of some of the bad reviews.  Personally we love dry rub ribs much better, and since they gave us sauce on the sides, we didn't understand all the complaints about the ribs being under seasoned.  I actually preferred the ribs without the sauce and the seasoning was perfect to me, my gf dipped them in the sauce however.
