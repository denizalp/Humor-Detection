Stacy did a gorgeous job on my extremely damaged fine naturally curly hair.  I walked in with hair that felt and looked like blonde cotton candy and left with sleek and shiny healthy deep brown with creative purple peek-a-bos with a reddish hue.  Just beautiful! She also gave me great suggestions to continue repairing my hair. I had a ball chatting with her the entire time. She's so professional, knowledgeable and just a doll. So grateful I found her!
