Went this evening with relatives from the east coast.One member of our party of 4 is an avid brewery visitor,visiting microbreweries whenever he travels.I don't drink at all,but he's quite the beer connesseuir.So he did one of their beer sampler thingies and enjoyed a few of the brews.He said he's had better though.\nThe resturant was empty and our server Ryan was incredibly polished and professional.He knew not only the Brewery\/resturant's offerings,he was happy to make suggestions as well.\nHe knew a lot about the Tempe area's fast paced history which endeared him to all of us.He was engaged,present and it was obvious he made it a point of bringing excellence to the table.Yes,pun intended.\nThe food was plentiful,fresh and tasty.\nThe prices fair for the portion and quality.\nWould I be back?Yes,under similar circumstances.\nPersonally I despeise all that is Mill Ave with it's frat boy and girl mentality and am hard pressed to venture east of 24th street.\nI wasn't expecting much from a place I deemed \"touristy\",but was ever so pleasantly surprised!
