Very good experience, even with a shoe problem.\n\nWent to Men's Warehouse a few weeks ago to buy a tuxedo, etc. for a formal event. The sales  staff (Darla) got me properly outfitted top to bottom and out the door in less than an hour. While the total bill was (for me) on the 'make my credit card groan' side, I wasn't really surprised considering I needed everything--tux, tie, shirt, studs, suspenders, and cummerbund. The suit was ready for pick-up (after tailoring) on time, and I was pleased with the way it fit and how sharp it made me look.\n\nUnfortunately the expensive shoes didn't fit so well when trying to break them a few days before the event--resulting in an uncomfortable open blister on my heal--forcing me to revert to an older pair in the closet. I took the shoes back today and they exchanged them for a different model with no questions asked. The difference was refunded to my card and I received an email receipt of the transaction promptly.\n\nWhile I probably won't shop there for my everyday clothes I was very happy with how I was treated and with the formal wear. Now I need to find another excuse to wear it!\n\nBrian C
