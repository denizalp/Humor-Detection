So, I saw this place the last time I stopped at the computer store in the same strip mall and the reviews got me curious.\n\nI had to make the trip back to the computer store and I told myself I would try these guys out the next time an opportunity arose.\n\nI woke up this morning with a sore throat. Maybe getting sick, maybe too much drinking last night, not really sure.\n\nI told the waitress I wasn't sure what I wanted to get; she suggested the chicken and rice soup since I wasn't feeling great. Excellent choice, it's also sold in bulk so it can be taken home. Chicken and rice was super creamy and tasty. Could use a slight bit more salt, but there was salt at the table and I'd rather it be under salted than oversalted. This may be my personal preference as well, I generally put a splash of soy sauce in my chicken and rice soup.\n\nI got the steak and cheese, all the way, minus onions with chips. It was delicious. The waitress brought a bottle of some type of dressing which she suggested I add it, as that what she does. Really, really good. Vinaigrette type deal? I didn't hear what she said it was, but they were widely available.\n\nOn the strength of the food and other reviews, I got a BLT and potato salad to go for my mom. She doesn't like going out, but this type of food is right up her alley.\n\nShe loved it.\n\nGreat experience overall. Kinda dangerous because I need to watch my calories. They had lighter fare available. \n\nProbably requires another trip to investigate.\n\nOverall, really low key, really good food and apparently there's additional access via the neighborhood roads that don't require you to risk being rear-ended on Independence.
