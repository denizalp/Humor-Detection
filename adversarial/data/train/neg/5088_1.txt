Well, it's wayyy south Calgary, so great if you live down here, I guess!  The pub was noisy and had a few young tattooed rowdies mocking people as the came in. Cute!  It's a nice looking pub though. \n  We came for nachos, and they were a'ight, but not much cheese (cheese is important), and they had lettuce on them (weird)!  The order, however was definitely huge. My partner ordered some southern fried chicken meal and THAT was delicious. \n  I doubt I'd be back here. Although the burger and the fish and chips meals that walked past us looked awesome. Okay, maybe I'll be back.
