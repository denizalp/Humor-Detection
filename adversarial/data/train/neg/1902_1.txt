Authentic. Wholesome. Good quality. Como en casa is unlike the many fusion Mexican and pseudo-Mexican joints in Toronto. This is the real deal! Very fairly priced and tastes fresh and amazing, how Mexican food is supposed to be. Try out the pork items like Pork Verde, I personally do not prefer pork over beef and chicken at most places but here, it is godly. The guac is also delicious!
