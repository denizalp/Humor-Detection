it isn't too complicated: just a hot dog or taters... its the dips, toppings, and sauces that make this place one of a kind.  I opt for the taters, I love the crispy fried goodness of the tater tots, they're perfectly crunchy and golden in color.  I love piling it on the tots, with chorizo, sloppy joe, pork n beans, plus bacon, cheese and an egg!  you'll be stuffed with just the tots.  Personally, I'm not as big of a fan with the dips since I load it on the tots, but they are all very very tasty.  There's a decent beer selection, good music.  try to go for a DJ Kishka night...it'll be packed but so much fun!
