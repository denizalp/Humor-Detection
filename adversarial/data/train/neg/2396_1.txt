This business went over and above the call of duty to get our A\/C up and running.\n\nOur home warranty contacted Affirmative Air after another business showed little knowledge and was unsuccessful at repairing our A\/C, along with providing surly customer service.  \n\nThe guys from Affirmative Air came in and worked tirelessly at repairing a complex problem.  They worked within our schedule and coordinated with an electrician in order to get the problem repaired correctly.  \n\nThey worked with positive attitudes and were very professional.  If I could give more than five stars I would!\n\nA very happy customer in Cave Creek, AZ.
