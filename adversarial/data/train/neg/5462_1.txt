\"Kenkou\"? Sez you!\n\nI'm sad that Joanne Kates has retired from her column at the Globe and Mail. Next to Rose Reisman, she's been a favourite sly target in my reviews. \n\nShe probably doesn't know that I exist. \n\nI didn't even go to her summer camp as a kid, but her reviews informed my own approach to silly amateurish food writing. \n\nAt her best she was brilliantly descriptive. \n\nAt her worst, she relied too heavily on a few standard tropes: the presumptive superiority of French cuisine; the newbie's appreciation for Asian exoticism; the liberal douching of over-the-top sexual metaphors for food. \n\nI have had some great meals. Apparently, they stimilate different pleasure centres of my brain than Ms. Kates'. \n\nI read her farewell column with bemusement, until she commented on he difficulty that comes with finding new ways to describe sushi. \"Aha\", I thought. \"So we are on the same page\". I have reviewed my share of sushi joints, with more to come; but they tend to pile up in my \"complete your review folder\". It's raw fish-hopefully fresh; rice; seaweed; and occasionally fun deep-fried stuff. \n\nKenkou offers all of these, in varying degrees of execution. It's all fine; designed to be consumed in mass quantities, soyou don't really consider how any one piece tastes. \n\nAll-You-Can Eat sushi is eating, not dining; a robotic process that places filling your belly ahead of savoring each dish. I eat. I taste umami-bomb miso and allegedly spicy ramen. Hot, lightly filled gyoza and cool fish on cool rice. I rely on soy-wasabi sludge for a flavour punch. I don't get sick. That's good enough for me. \n\nThe sole item worth singling out are the Golden Shrimp; tempura shrimp wrapped in sweet potato strings before deep-frying. They alone are enough. \n\nMs. Kates now writes for the Post City chain of papers, from the wilds of Thornhill. \n\nI've already added their website to my favourites list.
