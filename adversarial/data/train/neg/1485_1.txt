I met Kathy by chance many years ago while looking for someplace that I could shop with my pit in tow. My husband and I noticed a little store set back from everything and our dog immediately knew he wanted to go inside. From day one and until my baby passed away we always bought his food and toys from Barking Dogs. At 120lbs he probably didn't need all the treats but he loved them so much and I always caved lol. Since moving out of Nevada and being a part of an animal rescue I always recommend Barking Dogs to our Vegas area adopters. Between the great selection of food and toys and the wonderful people, you can't help but fall in love with everything about the store. Even after moving we still make it a point to stop and shop when we visit Vegas. Can't wait to come back again this year.
