This was our first time here and there are a lot of choices and a menu that can be a bit I overwhelming in my opinion.  I had a brisket sandwhich with two sides and was stuffed. The main reason I did not give  it stars was due to the service. They were not rude nor were they friendly. We were clearly taking some trying to understand the menu as fisrt timers and they did not seem very thrilled about is doing so. The food was excellent though.
