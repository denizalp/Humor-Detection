I went into Reuben's at around 8:45 in the morning hoping to get a smoked meat sandwich.  They said they don't serve it until at least 10.  I said \"I'll be back\" because I didn't want to have eggs from Reuben's.  \n\nSo I just decided to walk down St. Catherine street to see what was there.  I saw a cool looking cow and they had a great selection of breakfast items, checked a few Yelp reviews and then ventured on in.\n\nLikes:\n-Service was friendly\n-The Steerburger special is amazing. It's a small, but very good quality beef patty  (good enough that they ask how you want it - I said medium), bacon or ham or sausage, eggs, shoestring fries, toast and coffee for $9.85\n-The coffee has free refills\n-The Steerburger was very good and despite it being cooked medium, it was still moist.  \n-The shoestring fries were AMAZING!! I loved these so much. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  \n\nDislikes: \n-None really but could be slightly cleaner.  I was going to sit at one booth near the outside but saw the seat was a bit dusty so I decided to find a new one. Not a huge deal though.  \n\nLike or Dislikes depending on your preference:\n-It's an old diner look but it adds to the fun of the place, IMO. \n\nVerdict: This is a great place for breakfast and much cheaper than Chez Cora.  Should try it out. 4.5\/5
