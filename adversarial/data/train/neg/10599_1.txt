We had our office holiday party here, about 20 of us. Cute place, we had Mexican buffet. Fajitas were fantastic, beef was very tender. Beans and rice were good too, wished I had chips for delicious guacamole and salsa.  Spinach\/mushroom\/bean enchiladas were very dry so I'm not sure how early in the day they cooked those.  Be sure to ask about additional fees if booking a meeting\/party.
