Fairly nice hotel on the inside, and the rooms are clean. Not sure if they still have smoking rooms or not, but mine was non smoking and I got a faint whiff of smoke when I entered the room. Also, the wifi barely worked at all in the room. I was only on the 4th floor so I thought it would be alright. I had to sit in the lobby to use wifi for my laptop.\n\nThey have big meeting rooms so this hotel is great for conventions and trade shows. The staff was very helpful with the trade show that I attended.
