Hip, industrial-chic sushi restaurant with oodles of choices on offer. The mood is young, fun-loving, and a little wacky--not at all uptight or pretentious. As my brother, a Charlotte sushi-lover, says, you come to Ru San for the rolls and go elsewhere if you're in the mood for nigiri.\n\n We absolutely loved the tuna tataki (piles of perfectly seared tuna atop crisp vegetable filaments with a side of pure heaven as a dipping sauce). Other winners included the Olympic Five Ring Roll, served with yet another divine sauce, this time a spicy aioli, and the Firecracker Roll, quite possibly the most delicious roll I've ever had. As another reviewer pointed out, their specialties tend toward the deep-fried and saucy, but that's ok by me. Just add edamame and Asahi for a nutritious, balanced meal. \n\nApparently Ru San plummeted in quality when chef and owner Ru left town, but now he's back and has restored the place to its former glory.
