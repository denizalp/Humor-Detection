Went here for the first time recently. It's not located in a pleasant area of town, & the interior ambiance left much to be desired. Our table was dirty. Instead of cleaning it before seating us, she seated us, then cleaned it while we were sitting there. The booth seat was not in great condition I felt a huge coil bruising my delicate posterior the entire time. Regarding the food... We tried the buffet. Nothing on the buffet was labelled. If you want to know what you're eating, are a newbie to Indian cuisine, or have food allergies\/sensitivities - you're probably better off ordering from the menu. The food was ok...not great. Sangam in Cornelius is by far the VERY best Indian buffet as far as I'm concerned. (The next best thing is cooking your fave Indian dishes at home.)
