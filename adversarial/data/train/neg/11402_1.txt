Until it closed, this was my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Yes, it was pricey, but the food was fantastic and the service was always excellent. From time to time, if the ma√Ætre d' sensed romance, he would sit us in the back room where we would have a first class private dinning experience. The waitresses were knowledgeable and attentive but not intrusive. And those wine flights! Mmmmm. \n\nTheir menu changed every month as the chefs tested new creations, so it would never get old. I can't remember not enjoying something from any of their menus.\n\nI couldn't believe it when out of business - I had thought of them as the most successful restaurant in uptown. And then the Harper's Restaurant Group replaced it with a burger joint. Ouch.
