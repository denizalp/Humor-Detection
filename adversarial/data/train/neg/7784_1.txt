Super cute brunch spot! The space is open and airy and I imagine it'll be awesome in the summer. The bar is very pretty and the whole space feels like a place you could sit for hours in. I came here for brunch with friends and we were all happy. We started with cocktails and I chose one with champagne, fresh strawberry and lemon.. it was nice to see some unique drinks (other than a mimosa or Bloody Mary) on the brunch cocktail menu. We shared the kale toast between the 4 of us. It was nice to be able to taste it but I don't think I have a full impression of what it's like as a composed dish. It's hard to get all the components onto one small piece. What I did have was tasty, though! For my meal, I got the Benedict with smoked salmon and avocado. You have a choice of potatoes or kale. I wanted both of the sides and so I asked for the Benedict to be served without the English muffin over the potatoes with the kale salad on the side. They were happy to accommodate my request, which was awesome! The dish was fresh and yummy. The kale is a little hard to chew, so perhaps they'll make adjustments to how they serve it in the future? It could use more time in the dressing so that it has time to break down, or a light steam to soften the rawness. I personally found Bluphies to be an overpriced, greasy spoon type restaurant, so I much prefer what they're doing at Everly! I'd be happy to come back for any meal.
