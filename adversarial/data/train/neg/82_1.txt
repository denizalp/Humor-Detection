I'm shocked this place has such high reviews! The service was perfectly fine but I found the food quite lacklustre. The pastas that my friend and I ordered were very mediocre, with sauce that seemed straight out of can with no herbs or spices. The bread was also quite bad.  It basically tasted like a more expensive version of East Side Mario's. I won't be back.
