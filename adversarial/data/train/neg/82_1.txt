The restaurant has tables now! I went for my third visit yesterday and was just as pleased as always. I tried the gyoza ramen and their sushi (the spicy scallop) for the first time. The ramen was full of vegetables and the broth was delicious. The dumplings were really flavorful. I once tried the ramen up the street at Little Tokyo and was really disappointed - this was nothing like that. I would recommend the ramen here! \nThe spicy scallop roll was really fresh and delicious. I was happy to see that their spicy roll does not mean that they chop up the fish into a weird mayo salad situation - the scallop was intact and soft and tasted great. The roll was NOT covered in sauce, which I feel is a problem with a lot of Pittsburgh sushi places. If you are so inclined to drown your sushi in sauce, there was a beautiful display of sauce on the side. I included photos. The presentation was nice - they shaped my wasabi into a leaf.\nNow that there are tables this will be a great little place to bring friends and family. James also said he is fine with BYOB and currently does not charge a corkage fee, which will be super convenient since there is a great beer spot right next door with 6 packs to go!
