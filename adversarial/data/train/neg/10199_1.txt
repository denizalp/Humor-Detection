In an area full of restaurant chains, it's always great when a family owned and operated establishment becomes 'king of the road'. Stoke's serves some of the best sandwiches and most delicious pizza's McKnight Road has to offer. Forget about going to any of those chains for over priced meals when you can get home made entrees right at Stoke's Grill.
