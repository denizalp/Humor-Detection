We just love Rubio's.  The food always tastes great.  The salsa bar is excellent and my husband says I always get too much chipotle salsa and that Rubio's should charge me for using so much.  I'm glad they don't.\n\nMy husband and I have had many inexpensive dates to this place and it's just a nice place to get relatively healthy food in the area where we live, shop and am around.  The people are always great, friendly.  The place is clean.\n\nAnd Naty is my favorite person there, though, I don't see her too often.  \n\nEvery Rubio's we go to ALWAYS has great customer service and we are so glad.  We go to the one on Warner\/Cooper, Power\/Ray, Power\/Baseline, Cooper\/60, Guadalupe\/McClintock, Ahwahtukee, Ray\/Rural, and the one in the Tempe Marketplace area.  We love them all.  We're so glad we have so many Rubio's to choose from no matter where we are in the South East Valley.\n\nMy favorite is the Blackened Alaskan Salmon Burrito, my husband loves the Classic Steak Tacos, my daughter, the original fish tacos, my son the Ancho Shrimp Burrito.  Gosh, I'm craving Rubio's as I write this.
