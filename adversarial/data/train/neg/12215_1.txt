I have enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere here. All of the food I have tried here is delicious but the Iskender is my favorite. It is essentially gyro meat over baked homemade croutons and covered in a tomato based sauce. I find myself thinking about it frequently! I like sitting outside during the summer and near the fireplace in colder seasons. The service has been friendly the times I've eaten here. I would say the price is moderate. It is a good place for many occasions.
