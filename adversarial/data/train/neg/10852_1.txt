Went to their new location recently with a friend for breakfast. Unfortunately they ran out of the handpies so I got a mini quiche with cheese and bacon. It was pretty good. But the waffles were even better. They have different kinds like sweet potato. The waffle is presented cut up in four sections with side of syrup. It is just the right blend of crispy outside and soft inside. If this place were a little closer to me than 7th Street and Thunderbird, I'd probably be there more. I look forward to a return trip.
