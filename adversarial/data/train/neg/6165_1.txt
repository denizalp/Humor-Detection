I am so disappointed with the services I got today at Aloha Nails. This is where I used to come when I wanted a really great pedicure\/manicure. They were a little pricier but I believe you get what you pay for. Plus...Aloha-gotta support. \n\nWell today I went in to treat myself before my vacation. I see a \"new management\" sign. I had called for an appointment & Mimi helped me. I think she might be the owner. \nThe pedicure was $35 & it sucked. My favorite part of a pedicure is the massage. Nope-no foot massage, just a little leg scrub that wasn't rinsed off all the way. When she started painting, I was so confused? Where's the foot massage? I'm not one to cause trouble or tell people how to do their jobs so I let this go. \n\nOn to my gel manicure. Worst ever. I told her please not too thick-it's so thick & has so many speed bumps on it!!! Also my skin was over cut & over chemical'd. It's so dry & hurts so bad. The polish is not straight & all on my skin. I tried to get it off of my skin but I'll prob have to wait a couple days since It's gel. \n\nSo with the 20% off gel manicure \"under new management\" special My total for mani\/pedi was $59 plus $11 tip. $70 for BS disgusting nails. I'm so mad that I gave that much tip, I'm so mad that I left without saying anything-that's my own fault. Change the name-you are not Aloha nails anymore. Theirs no aloha & the service sucks. Call yourselves Opala Nails & keep it real!
