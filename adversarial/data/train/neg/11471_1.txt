There are 26 different songs played at the Fountains at the Bellagio. The Fountains play every 30 minutes from 3 to 8 and every 15 minutes from 8 to 12. This was one of my favorite things in Vegas and it was free! It gives me goosebumps every time. I watched the Fountains facing the Bellagio as well as on the patio of Picasso inside the Bellagio while eating dinner.
