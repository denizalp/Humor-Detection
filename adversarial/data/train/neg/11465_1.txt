You know you're close to this restaurant when the smell of pure delicious starts wafting closer and closer. Patrick, our server, greeted us with such joy and was excited when we asked for recommendations. They don't call him the recommendation machine for nothing. I had the bean curd with black bean sauce, recommended by Patrick, of course. It was delicious. Priced to please and spices to delight. Can't wait to come again soon.
