Woo! Best bagels in Charlotte hands down. So soft and delicious. I love the mix of bagel sandwiches they have, especially the vegetarian options. However, the classic egg, sausage and cheese is bomb and always a great pick. I recommend getting the everything or asiago bagel if you're getting a sandwich -Trust me.  \n\nThey also have a BYO option so if you don't find anything you like you can always do that. Plus, if you check-in you get a free soda. \n\nThere is usually a line here, especially on the weekends, but they are pretty fast and the bagel is worth it.
