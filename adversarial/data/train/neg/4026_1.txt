I'm downgrading them two stars for their lunch selection.  Yes the price is cheaper for lunch but the qualify and the selection is a lot less as well.  They served flank steak and turkey at their carving stations and both cuts of meats were dry.  The sushi station is very limited to just veggie, California roll, and at request spicy tuna hand rolls.  The miso soup is really salty too.  The seafood menu is very limited too.  \n\nI guess its still an above average buffet but I was disappointed as dinner here the last time was really good.
