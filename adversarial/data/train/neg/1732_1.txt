Ate here for lunch on the great recommendation of a coworker who stated this was one of his favorite restaurants. \n\nAs many others have stated this is like Chipotle in that you pick your toppings for either nachos, tacos, or enchiladas. You can also get soup if you'd like. \n\nI chose to keep it simple so I could really gauge the taste of my food. I chose one short rib enchilada and one chicken enchilada, Christmas style with jack cheese. It was quickly assembled and put in the oven. \n\nThe taste was great. The red sauce was thick and dark red, just how I like it. The green sauce could stand up against many New Mexican green chile and not be ashamed! \n\nNow the short rib and chicken could have been a little more well seasoned, but I'm sure a dash or three of salt would have fixed it just fine. I like my stuff super spicy and well seasoned and most restaurants don't so I'm not knocking any points or stars off for that. \n\nAll in all this was an enjoyable eating experience and I'll definitely recommend it to others who are looking for fast and tasty enchiladas!
