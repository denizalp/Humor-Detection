Excellent food! Every time we've come to this restaurant the food has been top notch. Chef Rudy has passion, shows attention to detail, and a clear love of cooking.  I've had the had the breadsticks (always fresh, buttery, and hot), the caprese salad, and the lobster bisque  as starters. The bisque has a deep complex and unctuous taste and the caprese is flavorful, fresh, and sweet.\nThe main entrees have been outstanding with fantastic flavor. The nation adobo with chicken is sweet and sumptuous all at the same time. The pork belly in the dish just kicks the flavor into the stratosphere. The linguini alla Mediterranea made me just say \" wow!\" The dish was rich and succulent. Chef Rudy greets and chats with you to make sure you're happy and having a great experience.
