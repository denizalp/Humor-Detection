Late night and hungry in an unknown place - Yelp to the rescue! :) This place came highly recommended, so we went in, ordered and got our take-out. \n\nIt's a small Italian place and most people seem to either order a delivery or come in for a take-out, cause I haven't seen any guests at the time we were waiting for our pizza. Maybe it's also cause it's local and not a part of a big shopping centre or something. It's family owned (or so we were told).\n\nWe ordered a small Cheese Steak Pizza and Garlic Knots. Pizza was huge (at least I thought so, I'm used to smaller \"small\" pizzas) and there were 4 big enough garlic knots in my box. \n\nPizza was thin crusted and had more than enough toppings. We weren't able to finish it at all. The garlic knots were made of pizza dough, but nicely twisted and sprinkled with olive oil and spices. Both dishes were good and I'm sure if we were from the area we'd order again when hungry.
