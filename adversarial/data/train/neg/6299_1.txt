Best burgers in town! I love that they a extremely customizable by filling out the 'burger form'. The ingredients are always fresh and the meat is soft and juicy. Even the chicken is really soft. Their milkshakes are available in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions which taste delicious. \nI like the fries too which are on the thinner side although I wish that they make it more crispy.\nOverall it's a great burger place with a casual ambience.
