There are only a handful of times when you get a massage that actually relaxes you. This past Friday morning, 26Nov2016, Ireceived that massage. The first relaxing massage in my life, honestly!\n\nThis was the highlight of our day. We went to get a couple's massage and were totally blown away! I have had Swedish massages before and they have hurt more than anything and I couldn't relax from it. But Mariel took her time, made sure what I wanted is what she provided.... Just to relax. I got a 90min full body Swedish massage that was tailored just for me! I can't remember the name of my wife's masseuse but apparently she was awesome as well. We will definitely be returning customers, advocates, and promoters for Spa Espace Nomad!\n\nThanks to the staff for such a wonderful and fun experience and thanks to the awesome masseuses for an enjoyable massage and for helping us actually relax!
