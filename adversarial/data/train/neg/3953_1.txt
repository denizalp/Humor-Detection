I love finding little Phoenix gems. il Bosco did not disappoint. There were fresh herbs growing on the patio and wood being put in the fire. The menu was very small, but the prices were good for the size of the pizzas. You could tell that the pizza ingredients were fresh and top notch. The place is very small but feels cozy.
