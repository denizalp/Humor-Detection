Forced me to purchase insurance since I didnt have proof of insurance, forced upgrade since I was an hour too early and claimed no cars available for what i reserved, and the upgrade was as he stated \"a new 2015 with all the amenities\" which turned out to be a 2013 when I checked the sticker on the door side, indicated he was going to take care of me by extending the return time to 8pm instead of the scheduled 3pm (for a fee again without me understanding. And why?  My flight left at 5:30.). Reservation quote was $158, left with a contract at $405.  Good for you Payless, you got extra money from me this time.  But good for me, will never use your business again.
