Went for an early lunch and it's a solid spot.  Parking is kind of hit or miss...or walk a long ways.  But service was good and reasonably fast.  Ordered food and sat for maybe 10 minutes before it was brought out.  My GF had the waffle which was delicious.   I went with the carver sandwich which was perfect.  Ended it all with an incredibly good brownie.
