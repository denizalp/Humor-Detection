We got the steak and chicken fajitas. It was a very fun experience. The steak fajita was the better one in my opinion because the chicken one tasted slightly bland. Table side guacamole was good, they give you a taste so you can modify it before they serve it to you. Also a lot of TV's, no bad seats for watching games!
