I love this place- they have the best peanut butter sauce!  They have a great variety of flavors, and you can sample to make sure you like it.  Their caramel sea salt, chocolate peanut butter cup, and vanilla ice creams are my favorite and the best in town.  Plus, it always smells so good when you walk in... like freshly baked waffle cones.  And even if there are a ton of people in line, you never have to wait for too long because the staff moves pretty quickly.  Definitely worth trying if you have never been there!
