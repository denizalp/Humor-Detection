Horrible horrible experience! Stay away. The first time I came here was great, the last tim I went was the complete opposite. My husband and I arrived and were quoted a 30 minute wait for a patio table. We placed our name on the list with the hostess Phaedra. We went to the bar to get a few drinks and wait for our table . After one and a half hour I went to the host stand and Phaedra stated she lost the list and did not know how long the wait was. She then walked away. My husband and I walked away and will never return!!! Horrible and even the manager we spoke with was unapologetic
