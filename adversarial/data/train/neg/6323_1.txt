Backstory, im a combat veteran, cancer survivor. I was attending CCAC west hills campus, had enrolled in class for the spring semester 2016. I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, so obviously unable to attend. Was led to believe I had cancelled my classes for the upcoming semester. Now almost 6 months later a collection agency calls me saying I owe for the semester. I never received any mail, emails or phone calls in regards to money owed. After multiple attempts to speak with anyone that would hear my plea I still owe for the semester that I did not attend due to having cancer. My warning to all, get it in writting and expect nothing from them. Truly heartless and very disappointing...
