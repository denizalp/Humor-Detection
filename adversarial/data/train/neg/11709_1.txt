Been seeing this all over social media a while back and tonight I was in the mood for meat so I stopped in. It can be summarized as -love the burger hate the fries.\n\nLocation:\n16th and Leslie on an awkward plaza with a Tims  in it.\n\nDecor: \nNicer  than I expected. Clean. But it was the guy at the cash who sweeps and wipes tables. When he's busy it doesn't happen until there's a lull in customers. But it's honestly cleaner than almost all places I've been to in the neighbourhood!\n\nParking:\nAwkward. It's a right in and right out. Shares parking with a few other businesses including tims. So parking can be tough if everything is busy\n\nStaff: \nSo nice. The guy at the cash seems really fun. Perfect person to have there and the woman handing out the food to customers seemed super sweet.\n\nFood:\nYou have two burgers to choose from the fresh burger and the prime  burger. You can also get them as doubles. Fries. Poutine.\n\nThy burgers come with cheese, tomatoes and lettuce.\n\nI got the prime burger with mushrooms ($1 extra) and loved it. Kinda fatty (but not so bad that it ran all over the place the prime must have less fat) burger so it was juicy and full of flavour.\n\nHated the fries. Got them fresh from the deep frier but they were weirdly tough on the outside, not hard but tough. Hard to describe. Not how I like them but taste varies with everyone. They would probably be awesome poutine fries!\n\nConclusion:\n\nI'd come back. I might just buy a burger tho not the fries. Mmmm
