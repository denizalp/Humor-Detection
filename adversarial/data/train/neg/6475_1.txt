Located adjacent to the entrance of the mall. Generally good vibe. Always a din of sound due to the high traffic of people that frequent this establishment. \nAdequate seating for dining or for sitting at the bar. The TVs could be a little bigger. But the full bar makes up for that :-)\nAlways a good selection of unique burger combinations. Bottomless fries are a plus. But be sure to get the garlic fries. They are the best!\nThe servers were very professional and pleasant to work with.\nMid range prices for mid-range burgers. Overall very good.
