I do not care for Panda Express in Houston, but I must say this location within the airport is delicious and fresh. I ordered a small carte of their beef and broccoli for $4.12 with tax and it did not disappoint. It was so delish my hubbs wanted to order the same after he had disappointment he experienced from the organic market next door.
