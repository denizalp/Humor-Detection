This is a small family business that is incredibly charming.  Parking can be a nightmare, but the deserts make it worth the hassle.  The first time I went to La Piccola Cucina was for my birthday a year ago.  Walking in there's a display case filled with the different food they offer.  You get to choose your combo and they'll prep the food and bring it over to you.  The food was ok, but what I really liked about this place was the fun owner (who sang happy birthday to me and it made me blush) and the drool worthy desserts that they offer.
