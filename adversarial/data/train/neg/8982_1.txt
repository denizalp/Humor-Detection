Been here few times and was never disappointed. \nThis place is very nicely set up for an all you can eat sushi eatery. \nThe portions per order is smaller so it's good for trying out more items on the menu without getting stuffed on the same thing. \nHowever, due to the long line up, this would be a poor choice for a spontaneous outing and last minute craving.
