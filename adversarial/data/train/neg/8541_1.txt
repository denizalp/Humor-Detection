I went in at 10:28 this morning to order food to go. The restaurant had EVERY table full and still had a line out the door! Victoria was my server at the counter, and while it took 20 minutes it was still pretty fast considering how busy the kitchen and the restaurant was.\n\nVictoria was my waitress and she even expedited my payment because I was paying exact cash so that I wouldn't have to wait in the long line to pay for the to go. She was awesome and like your other locations this one rocks!\n\nI hope Victoria gets the Disney trip
