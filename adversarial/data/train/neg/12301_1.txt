I took my cat Fred in today for a bath, a potty cut, and a nail trim. The place is spotless. Dru, the owner, and Erin took care of my baby, and Dru called me mid-groom with an update on how he was doing. Prices are fair and he came home completely fine and un-traumatized. Highly recommended. I will use them again. And again. And again. Lol.
