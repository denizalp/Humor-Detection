Jeff is an outstanding window cleaner! How do I know? Well, I'm a professional window cleaner here in the East Valley also. Yeah, technically Jeff is my competition! He's about the friendliest competition you could ask for, though. Jeff has been a window cleaner for a number of years with another company and really knows what he's doing. That entrepreneurial bug bit him and he started his own company a few months ago. Jeff has really come through for me several times. I am helping out with an ongoing medical situation in my extended family and have been fortunate enough to be able to call on Jeff to take care of one of my residential clients when I had an emergency situation to attend to. Jeff treated me well, he treated my client well . . . and if you hire him to clean your windows . . . he'll treat you (and your windows) well! Jeff is an all around good guy that you can trust to not only clean your windows well, but also be honest, hard-working and trustworthy. If I wasn't a window cleaner, I'd hire him to clean my windows!
