Great food and service which we were not surprised about at all.  The most expensive item we ordered was a chorizo type of stew with fried egg. It was great and only $14.  Also really good house red wine on tap for $6 per glass. Will definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu.  We ordered about 6 different items ranging in price from $5 to $14 and liked every one of them.
