Average at best. The atmosphere was good but I went there for lunch and the food had nothing special to it. Their chopped salad was the worst thing ive ever had at a restaurant. It tasted like some Cole slaw gone bad. \nI've never been there for dinner or drinks but for lunch it's not worth it. You will be happier with subway or pita pit which is close by and not as disgusting.
