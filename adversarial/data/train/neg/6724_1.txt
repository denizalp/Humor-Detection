I am on the fence about this place. While I love the fact that they have so many tv's and the dos Equis is $3 all day long, the food and service is mediocre. We have been going there since last summer ( we moved in right across the street) and we have had good service and horrible service. Besides the wings and chicken tenders, the rest of the food is blah and over priced. When we started going to half moon, they had an awesome happy hour, now it's horrible. We used to go there 2-3 times a week and spend a generous amount of money to watch games, but now things have changed horribly that we might go there 1-2 times a month (and that's if we really don't want to go anywhere else). I won't discourage anyone from going there, but don't set your standards super high.
