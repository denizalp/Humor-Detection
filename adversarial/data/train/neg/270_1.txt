From the Spa Lady- Never again.   \"On one hand, the spa was beautiful, in a Moroccan theme, and as you enter, there are some beautiful stones and stories that get you in a relaxed mood and Camelback Mountain in the background.  On the other hand, I was disappointed in the service, massage,and the facilities within the spa. \n\nThe masseuse was late in picking me up from the Quiet Room, then spent about 5 minutes trying to sell me more expensive products and kept repeating thruout how much in demand she was to her clients, so by the time we got to the massage, she only gave me a 30 minute massage, that shld have been 50 min.  She totally forgot to turn me over and do the other side of my body!  \n \nI had trouble with my reservation when I arrived but then was led to the facilities and told that the sauna wasn't working due to a fire in it.  Sadly, I was not shown the steam room.  So I thought I'd try the spa pool first, which was pleasant and very shallow.  When I tryed the hot tub inside, found it was even shallower, with a very low bench seat around. All the jets were at the lower back level and there was no way you could get your shoulders or back in front of the jets.   The also had a room with a heated bench, which I didn't understand.\n  \nOn the other hand, the lady who gave me my facial was terrific, and she did a great job and massaged my neck and shoulders where the masseuse neglected to.  \n\nI was a member of one of another Omni Resort Spas for many years and it was day to night with this one.  Watch for my next review of a new local spa.
