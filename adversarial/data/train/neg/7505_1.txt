Worst insurance company ever! They don't allow you to update\/make an endorsement through them, you have to go to your broker\/agent in my case my broke moved to another city so I had to drive 45 min to add a driver to my policy and on top of that pay 50$ to the broker for the endorsement plus a 38$ to Legacy for adding him, this is a joke. I asked to speak to a manager because they were charging me money just for updating my zip code when they are the ones who made the mistake and put a number wrong, and when I updated it the lady from costumer service did not tell me anything about it until I got a bill to my house that is when I called and they transferred me to the underwriting supervisor which was very rude and just told me that is how Legacy works, just so many things I decided to cancel my insurance with the. They have the worst costumer service ever!!!!!! Do not go with this company.
