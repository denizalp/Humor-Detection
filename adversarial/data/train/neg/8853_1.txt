Love this place! They always have a great craft beer selection (Tues and Thurs beers are 3.50) and the food is also on point. I always get the cheesesteak but the wings are on point as well. Great atmosphere, and the perfect place to catch a football or basketball game. They have many locations but this one is hands-down my favorite!
