You looking for a sports bar? Holy cow, tv's galore, five sound systems! Great bar! Food was very good, hot, flavorful and plentiful. Glad we didn't take some of the reviews to heart, we would have missed out! This is the new place to watch any sport! Found out a guy from Australia opened it, not to decorate it like Australia ,but for a great sports bar. They have great beer prices too! 25 oz for $3.99.
