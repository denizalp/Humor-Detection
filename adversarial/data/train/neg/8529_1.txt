This place is average at best.  Only liked one out of the three rolls I ordered, and it was the one recommended in many online reviews.  Pink lady or something like that.  The sushi menu looked impressive but once we tried it out we were left underwhelmed.  All of their rolls were fairly small too.  I would say quality overall is on par with Watami's sushi.  And when you're a regular restaurant competing with a buffet, quality is the one edge you want to have over the competition.\n\nAlso tried the katsudon here and was left unsatisfied.  It was basically a deep fried pork cutlet over plain rice.  No sticky rice.  No extra veggies or egg. Even the pork was pretty bland. Try Asian Garden in Parma to see how it's done right.\n\nService is acceptable. Atmosphere is quiet and intimate. Was empty when I went, which was dinner time on a weekday. \n\nYes it's a Japanese restaurant in Parma so you can't expect much, but there are other Japanese restaurants in Parma that do it better. I won't write this place off completely. There maybe an undiscovered gem on the menu that will tickle my tastebuds. Unfortunately I will be eating the discovered gems at other restaurants. Do yourself a favor and check out Pacific East Eton or Tomo in Strongsville.
