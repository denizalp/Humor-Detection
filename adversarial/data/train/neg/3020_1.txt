I have walked, driven..stumbled by this place so many times and have never really noticed it. After an event at O&B a friend of mine and I were looking for an earlier (6:45) dinner spot nearby and after a little search this place came up. Called to make the reservation and walked over. They were unfortunately having an event on the patio but the inside is not to go unappreciated and I love a restaurant that has comfortable chairs!\n\nWe started with a dish I don't recall how to spell and I struggled pronouncing it but they were almost like lemon ricotta puffs - they were okay. I felt they could have been more flavourful. We split 2 entrees - the pan seared tuna which was done perfectly (even the Brussels sprouts were good) and the salmon penne. I prefer my penne to be cooked a little more but the taste was really nice. \n\nThis review falls short in terms of service. Our server was not attentive at all -- and the restaurant wasn't even that full. In fact, a cocktail waitress from the event outdoors even asked if we were okay. Good service goes a very long way, people and has it been on a greater level I would have been more generous with my stars.
