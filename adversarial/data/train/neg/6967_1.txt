The only reason why this place didn't get 5 stars was due to service was slow and the waiters were inattentive. However the food and atmosphere made up for that. One of the best sushi places I've gone to. \nThe chefs stand in the middle of the restaurant and make the sushi fresh, then place it on a conveyor belt that circles the bar. It's amazing, fun and interactive. They will also make any sushi \"special\" if needed. I tried the asparagus roll, which I've not tried before. It's was so delicious that I ended up having 4. :D\nThe prices are based on the color of the plate you grab. It's a perfect set up. As well as sushi, they have a full menu of items to choose from. I recommend this to ANY sushi lover. \nTip: Get there early and come hungry!
