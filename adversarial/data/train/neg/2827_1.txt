I love Dr. Cherrington & his office staff! My boyfriend actually referred me to this office because I was not having good experiences with my old dental office.\nDr. Cherrington is a very kind and caring man. Every single person on his office staff is extremely friendly and helpful in every way possible.\nThe hygienist did an amazing job cleaning my teeth and also recommended some great products for me to use. (I have some trouble flossing my bottom teeth because of my permanent retainer.)\n\nI have always dreaded going to the dentist, but I feel safe and comfortable coming to Dr. Cherrington's office.\nI definitely recommend this office to anyone! They are very professional and friendly.
