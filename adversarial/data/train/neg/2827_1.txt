I keep coming back time and time again!! I try and eat low carb so I usually get the donair combo salad and oh my gooooosh! So filling and tasty. I'm super picky with my shawarma meat too I hate fat and their chicken is perfect and no fat whatsoever. They also have a selection of imported pops which is awesome. Come here! Staff is also super friendly and it always looks like a fun environment when I'm there.
