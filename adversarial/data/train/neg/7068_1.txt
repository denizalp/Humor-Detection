This is the 2nd time I have stayed here once about 9 years ago fantastic clean rooms\nupper scale casino.This time I stayed upon checking in some 20 year old dropped there half rack of beer on the lobby floor . Ok got to my room 4th floor, the previous guests garbage still my room and light bulbs burnt out.\nthe 4th floor is the same level as the pool loud floor with a lot of drunk fowl mouthed\nyoung people throwing there plastic beer glasses on the floor out side the elevator,and taking about how big there parts are.would not stay there again if you are 20 years old and just want to party and get drunk and listen to loud music this is the place for you.
