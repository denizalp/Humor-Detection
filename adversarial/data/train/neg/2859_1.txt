I eat here when I go to the movies. The grilled cheese sandwiches are good, not great but good. The price is fair and the staff is amazing. Such friendly staff makes the long wait for your food tolerable. It's not a good place to order from if your in a rush. I've only ever been in the evenings and there's only one staff in there. They're pretty busy with orders from food delivery services. Even if your the only one there expect them to prepare someone else's meal before yours.
