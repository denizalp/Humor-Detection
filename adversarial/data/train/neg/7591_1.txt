We ate here our first day in Vegas. Since we were starving and the buffet was just downstairs, we decided to try it out. The food was good, not great for the price. There wasn't as much as variety as I was expecting. Though the hotel itself is wonderful, there are better places to eat. If you want a buffet worth the price try Planet Hollywood.
