Went to their store to buy a phone advertised on Kijiji.\n\n1: the item was not as advertised: what was listed was a 16GB iPhone 5C, I was sold an 8GB.\n\n2: The store opened late: I came at 12:00pm, they didn't bother opening until 1:30pm.\n\n3: They were supposed to send a bill of sale to my email - and I'm still waiting.\n\nThe phone works - even if the company sucks. So that's something, right....?
