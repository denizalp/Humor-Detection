Highly recommend Top Dog. Excellent experience for grooming for G$ and Oma. I can tell Top Dog is a caring and professional business. They were great on the phone from making an appointment to notifying me that the fur kids will be finished in 20 minutes. I also loved that they let me know that they had water and a bathroom break. Many thanks for taking great care of my fur kids!!
