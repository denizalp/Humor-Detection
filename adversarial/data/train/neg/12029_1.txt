They are horrible here. They give bad information and don't seem to know what's going on. I dropped off prescription and said I would be back for it two days later. There was an issue when I went to pick it up but they didn't bother to call me to let me know. When I asked if it was standard practice to not let customers know what's going on the employee just looked at me with a dumb look on their face like they didn't know what to say. I was told by another employee some wrong information and then went to pay and asked the other employee about what I was just told and she was confused and grabbed a manager. The lady told me the guy that just told me what he did was wrong. Wtf?! Get your shit straight people. I would definitely not recommended this pharmacy with so many other choices available. One more thing, they have a very stupid process for signing in. There's an ipad up front with a lady sitting next to it (who I would assume is supposed to greet customers) who tells you to sign in but seems very unpleasant and doesn't even smile. She's too busy playing on her phone\/tablet to really acknowledge people walking in.
