I've been to quiet a few of these foot spas. It's usually hit or miss with them. I didn't have an appointment for this specific Zen Foot Spa. I was greeted immediately by a pleasant front desk attendant. I selected the basic package. I was taken back to a very clean and tidy area. My therapist did a wonderful job and was very nice. The prices are great. The service is great.
