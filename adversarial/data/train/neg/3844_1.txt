Steve saved my life. I needed a new lens for my Nikon because my hubby dropped it. Our vowel renewal in Cabo was 4 days away. Thank goodness Steve said they had a spare and I could trade in my damaged lens for the already refurbished one. The price was also too good to be true.  Great place to come for repairs and good service.
