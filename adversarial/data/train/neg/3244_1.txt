I started seeing Dr. Nemanic to treat migraines, and he ended up fixing a 20 year old injury that I had given up on years ago.  I have been through many chiropractors over the years, and Dr. Nemanic is far and away the best and most effective doctor I have seen.  His knowledge and patience have been transformational for me, and I continue to feel better than I have in years after every visit.  Beyond the immediate fix, he has also taught me how to care for my injury so that I can continue to live pain free in the future. I am so grateful I found him, and highly recommend him!
