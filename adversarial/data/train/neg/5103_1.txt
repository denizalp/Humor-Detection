I rarely ever give 5 stars as that requires service above and beyond in my opinion. However I must say that Posidon deserves that 5th star.\n\nHow do you get a 5th star? Well you start off with friendly wait staff. Throw in fresh vegetables, excellently cooked food, and a visit by the chef as well as some good conversation as well as being very reasonably priced? Yeah. 5 stars.\n\nAfter having a bad experience just next door at the Clarion Hotel I went here for lunch. I tell you that they made the bad experience simply vanish.\n\nThe Gyro plate I ordered was excellent. Fresh, hot, and full! The chef, Dale, even brought out a soup sample gratis. It was a new soup and he wanted me to try it out. Lemon Chicken with rice. I am not a fan of lemon but this soup was delicious. Large chunks of chicken with rice in a lemon herb broth. The lemon was only a hint and I really enjoyed it.\n\nI talked with them while I ate the delicious food and had a good time. All of this for a ten spot? Call me impressed.\n\nI will most certainly make a habit of eating here as it's close, it's good, and it's inexpensive, and the people really made it enjoyable.
