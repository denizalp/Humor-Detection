This place has good food and great service. It definitely trumps a chain place in terms of quality. \n\nHowever, it also has quantity. When eating here, I advise to order 1 dish for every 2-3 people in your party, as the portions sizes are GIGANTIC. It also has a great atmosphere and general vibe. Overall, it's a great place to eat, with delicious food, good service, and a truly homely feel.
