I Cant tell you how awful this was. I was \"seen\" yesterday. 1) I cant rate a doctor I did not see! You make an appointment with a doctor and then get sent to a Physician assistant, not a doctor, 2) with no explanation of what happened to the doctor. They have no expertise, did not go to medical school and do not have a clue.3)He said \"We aren't trained for such things\" WHAT?!?! You are not a doctor you aren't trained for anything.Then they charge your insurance for a \"doctor\" visit. 3)They did not listen hear or assist in any way and  I will not only be writing here but to my insurance, the medical board, and I pray they do not think of charging me or my insurance for a non existent visit by a non doctor.
