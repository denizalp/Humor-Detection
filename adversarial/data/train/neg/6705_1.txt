DC Sound home runs again! Took in my 2013 F150 for a Double Din\/ Maestro install and the guys at DC Sound did phenomenal! Called around to a few places that quoted way to high and said it would take over 5 hours+, Dc Sound gave me a way better price and the install time was significantly less. Clean shop, bathroom, Water, couches and a TV with NetFlix and Firestick, cannot really ask for more then that out of a shop! See y'all in a few weeks to put some subs in the back!
