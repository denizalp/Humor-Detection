I used to love going to this place for cuts.  Great staff and always pleased.\n\nAfter today's visit I won't be going back.  Sat there after checking in and was completely ignored.  Finally asked about getting a cut after waiting 40 minutes and the girl at the desk told me that need to check in to be served.  \n\nThat's exactly what I did on their check-in kiosk.\n\n\nThey lost a long time custom\n\n\nUPDATE:  I tried to go again tonight.  Give them another chance kind of thing.  I checked in both times (on the useless app and at the desk). They told me it would be an extra 30 minute wait.  There were stylists standing around.
