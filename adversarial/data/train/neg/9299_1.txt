So this place is pretty, I liked the atmosphere. The staff were all very friendly. It was pretty clean. They have a pretty good selection of different smoothies, teas, and Diamond Pops. They are so neat looking which is what enticed me. I ordered the fresh strawberry dipped in dark chocolate, almonds, and waffle cone pieces. It was was a nice treat. I'd come back if I was in the area.
