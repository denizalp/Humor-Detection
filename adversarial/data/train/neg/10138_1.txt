Last day of my Vegas vacation and still had not had an amazing Bloody Mary...  Well thank God that I stopped by here for my last meal before departure!!!   Amazing Bloody Mary ( get the big one, you can do it ) and fantastic food!!  I'm from the south and we know our cornbread and chili.  Pretty sure that I just ate the best cornbread I have had in my life!!  Trash Can Nachos, fantastic!  And awesome presentation.  \n\nDef stop by if you are in the area!!
