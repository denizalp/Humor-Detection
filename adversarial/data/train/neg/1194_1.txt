My favourite restaurant in the neighbourhood. Great food, wines. My favourite appetizer is their Caesar salad, which is the best I've ever had, anywhere. \n\nHuge wine list, not too pricey, unless you want. \n\nAs for mains, everything I've ordered I like.  I moved into the area last year, and I've been to Prop probably 20-25 times. Service is a little hot and cold, but they bring you good food and that's enough for me. \n\nSolid Italian.
