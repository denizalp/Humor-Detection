I recently had to perform substantial repairs on my rental properties landscaping due to a severely destructive dog, and decided to use Advanced Gardening Service. They were able to meet a tight schedule between tenant move in\/move out, and help get things back on track. It's been a few months, and the new irrigation system & trees\/shrubs are doing great. I will definitely use them again for future projects.
