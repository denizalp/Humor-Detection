Save a slut get the Fairfax ;) I came here at midnight craving something savory and spicy and the Fairfax egg sandwich was my fix. It has soft scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, spicy mayo and cheese but I also add bacon, avocado, and sriracha to make it the best egg sandwich of all time. This place is consistent and has a really fun vibe. The line can be super long but it's worth the wait for the Fairfax. I don't really recommend the slut bc it's so basic. It is like $15 for the Fairfax my way-- expensive but still worth it. The slut is not really worth the price because you can master it at home.
