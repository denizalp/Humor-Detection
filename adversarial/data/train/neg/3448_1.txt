I'd have to say I'm disappointed in the quality of the brisket. I had the sliced brisket sandwich featured on \"DDD\" and paid for the upcharge for the fatty side.  It was very chewy and the fat hadn't rendered out. You couldn't even pull apart the meat. Ended up tossing the sandwich and eating my kids fries.  \n\nThe lean chopped brisket on the sliders was more tender.   For the premium prices they charge, my expectations were a bit higher.
