Lunch demo was good, however the participants were all over 80 & boring.  They must have filled the class with the local old folks home.  Made for a stiff & uncomfortable setting.  Maybe suggest age guidines for events.  Including teens or 8-12 year olds would make for more fun than having the ancients.
