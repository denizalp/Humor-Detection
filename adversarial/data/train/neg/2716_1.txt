We felt it necessary to write about our disappointment in the pizza we received.  1.  The pizza was undone.  2.  The crust was floppy, unable to hold in our hands.  3. Had to eat it  with a fork.  4.  WORST OF ALL, the pizza was all on one side of the box, crushed together, all in a ball.  Appeared that it might have been in a game on the way to our home. 5.  It was as ordered, an 18\" pizza sliced irregularly into 10 pieces rather than 12 as done in other places, and needless to say we were only able to eat the half that wasn't sticking to the side of the box.. 6. We gave it a 2 rating because the sauce deserved at least a small rating. We ill not order again from Palermo's.  Bob C.
