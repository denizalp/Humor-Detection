I am a working musician that lives less then a mile from this shop. When it opened i was excited because i thought it would be extremely convenient to pick up things i need like strings, cables, picks etc...today is now the third time i have went by this shop during what is supposed to be their open business hours, and the door is locked with apparently no one inside. When i called it went voicemail. It is a complete shame because i would love for them to be my go to place, but not being able to trust if they will actually be open or not isn't really what i'm looking for. Super bummer.
