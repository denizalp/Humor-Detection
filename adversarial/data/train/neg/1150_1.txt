This place is great! You get lots of excellent food for your money and the staff is awesome. Our last waitress, Jessie, was fantastic! Our drinks were never empty and our table was always clear of plates we didn't need anymore. She was very knowledgeable about the food, made great recommendations and was super sweet. 5\/5!
