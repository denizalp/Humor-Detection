I had a wonderful experience at the Halal restaurant  \"little Italy pizza\". I would simply say, if your tastebuds know taste of real varied food, than this is the place to go. on my trip to Vegas,i have been there 3 times, and for sure i'll be there in my next trip. Owner and staff were very friendly. Â \n\nI WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.
