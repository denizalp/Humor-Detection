As common as the Cheesecake Factory is.. I mean every outdoor mall or shopping \"town center\"... but anyway, I try to avoid mega-chains like this, but honestly, it's super good. Get past the fake Italian rustic wallpaper and you've got page after page of menu items to choose from. Their salads are unique and packed with stuff - my mom, sister and I went out to lunch together and each got a different salad, all three satisfying. Cheesecake aside, they actually do a good job with their restaurant food.
