Very unorganized restaurant!\n\nWe had come here for Chinese new year dinner and booked a table with a set meal ahead of time - with the reservation you get $30 off. Upon our arrival they seated us and we thought they they had acknowledged our reservation. We waited for our meal for 20 minutes. They then came to tell us that their smallest lobster was 6lbs so we would have to pay extra for the one lb which was $20 extra...we were ok with this, but not happy we were not given the option of getting the appropriate sized lobster on the set meal. 10 minutes later they came back saying we didn't reserve the meal ahead of time and that they didn't have the Peking duck available with the set meal. As well we wouldn't get the $30 discount either since they didn't have us on the reservation list. We decided to leave as they had the power to honour the $30 reservation discount and wouldn't. While we were leaving there were several other tables who had the same issue.
