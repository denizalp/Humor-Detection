Got a chocolate milkshake and chicken soup. Liked how the soup came with noodles on the side and the broth had good flavor. You don't realize it until you get to the bottom, but they do put a lot of garlic in the soup. The milkshake was very refreshing in the 106 degree Las Vegas weather. The prices have gone up a tad, but still very reasonable. Service was quick and friendly.
