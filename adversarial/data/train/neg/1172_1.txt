So nicely maintained and thoughtful. We enjoyed strolling through and especially liked the different areas with various themes like the Alpine area and Japanese garden. Perfect activity for the whole family. Huge bonus were the playground for the kids, and ice cream and beer in the same location for a nice break from walking around.
