Decided to head here because we wanted breakfast for dinner. I got the biscuits and gravy. Husband got the chicken and waffles. Both were just okay.  The biscuits were huge, but had a sweet undertone.  Hubby's waffle and eggs were over cooked and dry.   My Bloody Mary was good.  Maybe it was an off night or maybe we should go in the morning for breakfast.
