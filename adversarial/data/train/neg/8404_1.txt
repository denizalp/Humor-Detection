what a beautiful location!  we had 2- 2 room condos with full kitchens for a huge family trip to vegas (12 people).  the units accomodated 6 people easily- 2 people per bedroom and 2 people on the murphy beds.  the pools were always clean and well maintained.  the game room had a pool table- very nice when you just want a night off from the strip.\n\na perfect choice for a vegas trip
