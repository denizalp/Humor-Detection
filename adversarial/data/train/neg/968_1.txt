Worst dry cleaning I've ever had done.    Took my business clothing there twice now and they came back with stains on them, and now a hole in the collar because she claims she accidentally laundered the shirt and acted like it was no big deal.   I complained to the owner and all she said was she'd give me $10 credit, to ruin more of my expensive dress shirts.   Completely disrespectful and a horrible way to run a business.   Would not recommend this place to anybody.
