Can only rate the surroundings and casino and both are lavish and just beautiful.  The tile work on the flooring throughout is just amazing as are the fresco style ceilings.  Even the fake blue sky and clouds along the indoor gondola river look beautiful and lifelike.\n\nThe casino is high-end for sure but a bit smokier than the Palazzo next door.  Plenty of expensive shopping between the two hotels and nice overall placement on The Strip.
