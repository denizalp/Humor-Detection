I have been having the best eyelashes applied, Xtreme Lashes, to my otherwise stubby lashes for the past two years.  I have had many well-trained, perhaps the best and safest in the industry in the lash lover's opinion, Xtreme lash stylists apply my lashes. Saundra, by far, is the absolute BEST.  Her application technique makes it so that your lashes look VERY natural and last longer than the standard 7-10 days.  I've been on the back of my hubby's motorcycle for hours at a time and almost two weeks later, they look like I just got them done!  And ladies, it does NOT take half an hour to apply a full set of quality lashes nor should you be getting them done at the same place that does your bikini wax and\/or acrylic\/gel nails!  These are your eyes, for gosh sakes!  You ain't getting' a replacement pair if someone uses cheap glue.  PLEASE, spend the money and have it done right by a professional like Saundra.  You can even text her and she quickly responds and tries her very best to accommodate everyone's time constraints.\n\nWe are transitioning between Los Angeles and Las Vegas and I can tell you that Saundra is worth making the trip to get your lashes done by a personable and meticulous professional. (And no, I have no relation to Saundra.  I just am so completely pleased with her services.  I promise you will, too!)
