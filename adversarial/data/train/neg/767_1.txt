If customer service enters into your purchase, I suggest you shop somewhere else, because RC Willey has none .  Actually, I take it back.  They do have customer service and it is B-A-D!!!  \nI recently bought a kitchen full of appliances from a very nice salesman.  In fact, everyone was nice while I was spending thousands of dollars.  Once there was a problem, niceties were scarce.  On my first call to customer service, I was on hold for over thirty minutes before giving up and going into the store.  After standing in a long line, I was treated rudely by the customer service rep who tried to make me fell like I was to blame for the dishwasher not working, the light on the microwave not working and the refrigerator doors not being balanced.  One out of four appliances was problem free!  I jumped through their hoops to get things corrected and even accepted that it would be over a week before someone could come to balance my refrigerator.  On the day that was scheduled, no call from customer service, so I called them only to be told I was never scheduled and could not be scheduled for another five days.  So, here it is, 2:30 on the day they are supposed to be here between 10:45 and 1:45 and I just got a call that they have one more installation before they can get here!  \nThis is absolutely my last RC Willey purchase.  I wish I had followed my first instinct and had them pick EVERYTHING up and gone to Sears!
