Great personal service and reasonable prices.  Took my 92 van for an exhaust repair unexpectedly.  They took a look immediately, offered two options and completely understood when I took the $80 repair over the expensive one.  Completely supportive of \"drive it til it drops\" owners.  Definitely will be a repeat customer.
