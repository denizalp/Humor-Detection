Wonderful hotel, excellent check in and general hotel staff. Waited for ages on the casino floor for drinks though! Things are a little pricey, but if you want to splurge and feel great about staying in Vegas, come here. They also have a lovely pool area with tons of lounge chairs. Go early to get one near the big pool! It fills up fast. The beds in the suites are wonderful.\n\nThe only weird little things, some minor damage to the room. One of the mirrors was missing a decoration, it had obviously falledn off. And one of the bulbs in the bathroom was burned out. I was surprised. But all in all a wonderful stay.
