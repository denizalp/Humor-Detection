I have been a fan of bikram yoga for quite sometime now. I moved to Pittsburgh this past year, and was excited to find a bikram studio, moreso after learning that the owner was a Bikram enthusiast and yogi himself.  After attending a few classes, I purchased a package as the teachers Lori and Myra were genuinely very good. \n\nHowever, in the past 6 months, I for one have not gotten myself to go back to the studio. A friend of mine stopped going after just 2 classes. Our concern was that not all teachers are that nice, and some were also rude. They may not be that way for all students (and reading other reviews here some students have found the same teachers to be quite helpful), but my complaint is that there is no option to skip a class if a particular teacher's style\/personality\/etiquette just doesn't match yours. I was a little offended infact, when I found out that shortly after I complained about the teacher, the teaching schedule was completely removed from the site, leaving me no choice. After a long day's work, I really do'nt want to spend another hour and a half in the presence of somebody who will just make my day more stressful. As a business (which infact the studio is since we pay for the classes), it is not correct to force students to attend a class (or not come at all).  A few times I came to the studio and turned back around when I found the same teacher teaching the class. \n\nThe positives - the studio is beautiful, and very well kept. The facility is very updated, and having hardwood floors does enhance the decor (though I personally am a fan of the carpeted floors even if they may smell not so great at times). Being one of two yoga studios in the Pittsburgh area that offers the Bikram style, its nice that they offer a lot of classes. \n\nI just wish that the owner would respect our right to chose to skip a class\/attend with a different instructor  (without having to come all the way to the studio).
