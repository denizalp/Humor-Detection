My Kia acquired a bit of a funky smell after spilling some milk in the back.  On my call with Peter, he impressed me with his knowledge of my situation and explained steps I should immediately take in order to prevent the odor from settling in my car. He relayed previous experience he had with a situation far more grave than mine, and we set up an appointment and exchanged contact info via text.\n\nHe showed up right on time after communicating with me the same morining.  He and his guys were in and out in 45 minutes, with a job well done.  It has now been 4 days and the smell has not returned.  He told me that he will come back out at my request if the smell returns - a true sign that he stands by his work and values relationship over transaction.  I tipped him because the attention and professionalism he exhibited.  I will definitely be using him again and would be very confident in referring him to close friends and family.
