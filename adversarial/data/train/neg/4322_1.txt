Great Asian desserts! Mango ice, black sesame soup, walnut soup. They have little bites too - only had the Hk style steamed rice roll with peanut & hot sauce which was very yummy.\n\nIt has your traditional wood Asian stools and tables. Small place, first come first served. \n\nCome here every time I come back to Toronto!
