I've tried eggs benedict all over the country as it is my favorite when eating breakfast out and this place is head and shoulders above the rest.  Delicious!  Coffee is good, they bake cookies and they are great too.  Open for breakfast and lunch until 3pm but breakfast food is served even in the afternoon if you want it.  Service is spectacular, very attentive.  The only problem is it is very small so sometimes you have to wait but it is always worth it!
