I recently bought a new Golf GTI here. \n\nAt first the experience was a little odd - I'd made an inquiry via the internet in response to an ad that I saw about some kind of closeout sale. I got responses - in fact, I got them from three separate people, including one from the other Zimbrick VW dealer in Madison. I'm glad they cared enough to respond, but it was a bit overwhelming and seemed disorganized. The closeout sale ad that I'd responded to apparently was some internet lead generator which was unaffiliated with Zimbrick, so I guess I can't fault them for that.\n\nI stopped in one afternoon out of the blue and talked to a sales rep, who was more than happy to show me the interior of the car I was interested and even offered a test drive right then. I didn't have time to drive it at that exact moment, but he didn't pressure me to schedule one for later, which I appreciated. \n\nHe doesn't work at the dealer any more unfortunately, but Jay was excellent to deal with throughout the whole process. Down to earth, friendly, and definitely not condescending when I had questions about the car. Perhaps it's because we grew up near each other, which we found out as we were talking while checking out the car. We need more people in the car business like Jay, not fewer. Alex is now our contact there, and so far so good. He was helpful in arranging the window tint that we'd paid for. He even went so far as to personally drive me to work after I dropped the car off one morning.\n\nWe'll see how the service department responds when we finally need them (hopefully a long time from now), but so far this is the best car experience I've ever had.
