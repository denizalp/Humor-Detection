We could not have been happier with Darlene for our wedding cake.  From our first phone call to the fun in-person tasting to the wedding day, Darlene was awesome.  We absolutely loved the cake and several of our guests happily went back for seconds to try the different tiers.  \n\nBeyond the cake, Darlene is friendly, reliable and true to her word, which was invaluable when planning a Las Vegas wedding from out of state.  You can't go wrong with Cakes on the Move.
