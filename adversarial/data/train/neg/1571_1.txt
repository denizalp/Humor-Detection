I would give this place ZERO stars if it were an option! This place is absoutely HORRIBLE!!!!!\n\nI lived there for 9 months. I lived in a 2 bedroom by MYSELF-no animals!\n\nI moved out and received a $1,200.00 BILL for new carpet, countertops and PET SEAL! I did not own a pet! - This place raped me with fees. I've never seen more disgusting, disrespectful employees at one place. Seriously, DO NOT RENT HERE!\n\nThis place is GARBAGE! Absolutely DISGUSTED with them!
