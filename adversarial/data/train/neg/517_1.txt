this food is soooo good.  never had mexican asian fusion, but it is soo delicious.  the refried beans are to die for and the jade red chicken is wonderful.  my son loves the hengrenade chicken.  actually everything i have had so far is great.  it's always busy, but you don't usually have to wait to long.  i call ahead for the pick up!!!  it's also very inexpensive.
