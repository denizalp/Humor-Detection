This place is lovely. Very cute decor with minimalist bunny rabbit accents - adorable! \n\nI love to come here for coffee dates. It's a bit more private than the rest of the First Canadian Place food court. There's very long harvest table seating, and if you come during off hours (maybe 10AM-11:30AM, and any time after 2PM?) - there tends to be free spots.\n\nThe desserts are wonderful! I love the moist pistachio loaf, as well as the lavender blueberry loaf. They also have amazing cookies.
