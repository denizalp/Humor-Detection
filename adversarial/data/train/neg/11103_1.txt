My family and I have been going to Frank and Fina's for years - at least 8, I would estimate.  Frank (who is now retired) was always there and was full of personality and always greeted his regulars.  His adult son and daughter now manage the restaurant.  Here is where I have the problem.  I think the son needs serious customer service training and\/or an attitude adjustment. Typically restaurant managers are all about making customers happy (you know.....\"the customer is always right\" and that kind of stuff).  We had a very, very minor issue at dinner that could have been very easily fixed; however, it just served to annoy this guy and he didn't even attempt to hide his irritation.  He was anything but gracious and couldn't have cared less.  Offered no assistance with the issue, and was short and curt with us when I brought it up.  \n\nThe staff there is great and always happy to see us.  Service is typically wonderful.  However, there are other restaurants in town that would actually appreciate our business.  When Frank and Fina's manager can't even be courteous - it takes the enjoyment out of a dinner out.  Anyway, I've decided to spend my money elsewhere.  I know he'll never miss us, but we won't be back - which is a shame because we ate there at least once a week.  The son needs to realize that the way he treats customers (especially regulars) is what makes his restaurant stand out from the others.
