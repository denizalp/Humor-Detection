The Pick-Up Artist came and removed old appliances and yard waste from the home I had just sold. They were able to schedule an appointment almost immediately, they gave me the best price quote of all the companies I contacted, and their customer service was excellent. I was very happy with the job they did, and they did they were in and out in about an hour. I would definitely recommend them and use them again!
