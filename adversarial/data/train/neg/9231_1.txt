I really vacillated between a 3 and 4 for this review.  I've been here before and loved what I had, but this visit was not so great.  \n\nLet's start with the moral of the story first:  never order something out that you make at home and love.  I find that I'm usually disappointed, and that was the case for this meal.  I ordered the chicken marsala.  The sauce was........not what I expected, and the chicken was very tough.  Fortunately for me the side dish is a heaping serving of spaghetti with a delicious red sauce, which I devoured.  My dining companions had the calzone and the lasagna, both of which looked good. \n\nDon't come here and expect to be seated unless your whole group is with you.  I ended up standing outside (when it was 105) until my group got there, which was about 10 minutes later.  This would have been very acceptable if the restaurant had been swamped, but there were several open tables (4 or 5) when I got there, and also when we were seated.  Perhaps that colored my attitude because I really didn't enjoy what I ate and maybe we just got off on the wrong foot because of the seating.  \n\nWill I go back?  Possibly.
