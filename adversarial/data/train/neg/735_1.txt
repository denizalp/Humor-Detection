Older property. Staff is friendly. Club Level Lounge Room was small and the snacks lacked appeal. Very Blah and Inadequate. Not at the level you would expect from a Sheraton Hotel.\nLove Arizona, but hated the area and sadly will not return. If you do decide to stay here, FuddRuckers across the street is good and filling! The pool when I went was PACKED with kids, and NO towels to be found! Hotel was booked, so was unable to enjoy a quiet lobby, pool or spa. :(
