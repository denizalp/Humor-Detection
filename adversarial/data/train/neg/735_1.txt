Finally! A non-corporate place in Chandler that doesn't try too hard, yet knows how to please with high-end ingredients: local and organic when possible!\n\nI ordered the Chef's Burger from their lunch menu. Grass-fed, ground in-house 8 oz burger with arugula, Gruyère, and onion rings.  I personally would have liked the arugula melted under the Gruyère or tossed with the Russian dressing.  It was too ordinary undressed on the top bun. But, it IS the Chef's Burger and if that's how he likes it, then that's the way it should be enjoyed. Oh, and the onion rings are awesome.  \n\nThe service was genuine and friendly. The food came out reasonably fast and HOT!\n\nIt would have been nice if you could hear the music...it was just too quite.\n\nI will definitely come back and try other menu options and I highly recommend BLD!!
