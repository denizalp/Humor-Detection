This practice's front office has great customer service. It has to  be as the clinical team is unfriendly, poorly educated, condescending and unable to read a history. They require unnecessary visits and blood draws. Should you question or disagree with a policy the will refuse your medications or their \"compliance manager, \" Chris will be glad to repeat himself monotonously over and over that it's an office policy and he has no interest in your health or your needs.  I guess no one told him part of medicine was helping people.
