We went here for dinner a few weeks ago on a Friday night and it was extremely busy with a good relaxed neighborhood vibe.  Food was mixed, we shared two appetizers, one was a giant meatball which was ok,  nothing special, similar to a Martha Stewart recipe. Second app was a red pepper spread on flat bread which was quite standard as well.  For mains, my husband had the risotto which was absolutely TERRIBLE! Can't believed they served it, it was uncooked rice. I had the seafood linguine which had absolutely no flavours.  My friend had pulled pork wrapped with bacon which was very delicious and the pulled pork was nice and soft.  It's a good spot if you order the right items on the menu. Price was quite reasonable: 2 apps, 3 mains, 2 deserts, 2 bottles of wine, taxes and tips came up to $200.
