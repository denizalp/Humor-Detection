This a great stop n go or stop n stay for a week. I stay here whenever I work out this way and must say its not to bad. Free hot breakfast and social hour in the evening. Plus they provide a bbq first Wednesday of the month thank you for management appreciation. So if your around or passing through here give it stay and check it out for yourself.
