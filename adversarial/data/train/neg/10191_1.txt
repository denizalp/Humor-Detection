I came here for lunch with my family and ordered their bento lunch boxes. Very good quality bento box and lunch selection. The portions were of good size. The value here is good for lunch. Their sushi roll menu is quite diverse. They do not offer AYCE which is a reason I chose to eat at this place (higher quality fish).\n\nDishes I ordered:\nSuper white tuna sashimi - 3 good size pieces. Not as tender or flavorful as other places I have been to. Decent fish quality, though.\n\nTempura and terriyaki beef bento box - typical bento box. No complaints. Very satisfied.\n\nSpicy tuna roll with tuna on top (raw fish roll) - I really liked their ponzu sauce that they used. It was not over bearing and complimented the tuna nicely.\n\nCalifornia roll with avocado and white sauce on top ( I forget the name) - standard roll. Tastes as described. Not a huge fan of mayo based sauce.\n\nOf the many sushi restaurants that I have been to, this one if definitely one of the better ones (fish quality is better than goyemon, i love sushi, blue fin sushi, and most other AYCE places in vegas). I would come back here to try some of their other rolls.
