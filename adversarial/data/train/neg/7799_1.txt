My favorite restaurant from our trip to Montreal. We were able to get a reservation without a problem, and I'm so glad. The cocktails were amazing. The list of wines by the glass is really short, but every one we tried was excellent (and reasonably priced). The decor is relaxing and the staff is welcoming.\nMy husband started with the bison tartare, and I ordered the special of scallops two ways. Perfectly cooked scallops sitting among pickled-this and fruity-that--it was a really fun dish. My husband had deer steak (also a special) served with hummos and chick peas--great combination. The smoked duck was the highlight for me. It was so many flavors: tender smoky meat, soft mustardy something-or-other on top, pickle, crunchy rye. Put it all together, and I wanted to never stop eating it.\nWe didn't have room for dessert, but that can wait for our next visit.
