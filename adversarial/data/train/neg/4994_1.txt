We went for dinner before the 3 doors down concert. Amber was very good at her job. She was pleasant, knowledgeable and an all around nice person. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the variety of drinks. The plum, ginger Mojito was different bit very tasty. Dinner was equally delicious. I had the steak special and my wife had the lemon stuffed chicken. Both meals were excellent with just the right portions. We were full bit no stuffed. Kudos to the staff as the restaurant got crowded they we never lacked in service and did not have anyone loud or obnoxious by us. Although this a bit of drive from our house we will make the trip for the service and food
