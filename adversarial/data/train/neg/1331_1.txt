This was our first visit and we both ordered the same thing - thank goodness because I would have been reaching over to my friend's plate! The brisket tacos were a perfect balance of slightly sweet  slighty spicy, and opted for the 'tomato gravy\" instead of the sauce that came with it.  We both give this dish a 10!
