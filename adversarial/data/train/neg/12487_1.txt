Phew. That was a rough night. Time for some hangover food! \n\nShrimp sliders and mac and cheese. Awesome. The bread on my sliders was toasted well, and the sauce on the crispy shrimp was great! Their bloody mary selection is good too. I had the Bacon Bourbon Bloody Mary... I mean c'mon, that's not even fair anymore. My hangover was pretty much gone after I finished everything!
