This review is for the pool bar service.  Been here quite a few times and love the place but the pool servers are totally inattentive.\nWe use the pool a lot and make at least six visits each year.  The servers sit at the end of the bar and chat to each other and pay very little attention to the people at the pool wanting drinks and food.  We have had to get out of the pool walk to the bar and ask for service.  We talked to the servers but they gave us attitude.  Come on guys get your act together.
