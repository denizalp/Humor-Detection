Stopped going to this place for about a year because the service was deplorable.  Decided to go back today and the service changed...it's much worse now.  You need to clean your own table if you are deciding to dine in.\n\nWhen you ask them for a napkin to clean the table they are more then happy to give you one and I mean only one piece.  Tell them its to do their job and they might give you 2 pieces.\n\nAnyhoo, lets get straight to the food.  It is really good especially the half chicken Tandoori without rice.  If you get rice they charge you an extra $2.00 and that's not worth it.\n\nI don't think I will be going back anytime soon as their are more Afghan food places that have opened up in the area.\n\nNo matter what you order on the menu is sure to be tasty.\n\nJust remember one thing....The service is crap!!!
