I was a loyal customer to Pint Central but I can honestly say after tonight, I'm never going back there. Long story short: we ordered online through THEIR website. We showed up when the food was ready and after we received confirmation of payment and the food being placed. We waited about 15 minutes for them to find my order but They didn't have anything. We had to reorder everything again and wait a good 45 minutes to get it. The short, tan waitress with a buzzcut dealing with our order was in a terrible mood and didn't help at all. We then received a receipt to pay yet I already payed on THEIR website. It was absolutely insane. I was asked to pay double due to them not knowing how to work their website and waiting for about an hour and a half after ordering online. It was completely disorganized and the service to help solve the problem was useless. It was a waste of time and now I'm eating dinner at 8:45 PM in my home, which is insane. I'm never going back there. I'd rather give my $$ to other local businesses who treat their customers better.
