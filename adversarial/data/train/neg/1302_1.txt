Breakfast at Bertha's is a beautiful thing. I grabbed the in-laws and schlepped them down the street for a fun-family morning of delicious treats and this place did not disappoint. Here's what we ordered, and loved:\n\nBrioche Egg Sandwich\nBreakfast Wrap\nTurkey Jalapeno Egg Sandwich \nHam & Havarti Panini\n\nIt was all fabulous. I'm so happy we stumbled onto this spot!
