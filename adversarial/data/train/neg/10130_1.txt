I ordered via SkipTheDishes. I had fried chicken wings. It was nicely battered. Not my type of fried chicken. I'm thinking more seasoning would do the trick. I also ordered green curry Thai chicken, not my type. Maybe a little bit more curry would do the trick. However, the ration between chicken meat and vegetable is 1:1. The portion is appropriate to price. I'd order something again, try other dishes. In the end, I was full but not bloated. Thank you :) \n\nThe delivery was not picture worthy. Maybe I'll drop by in the restaurant.
