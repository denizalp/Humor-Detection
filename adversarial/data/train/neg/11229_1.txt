This location specifically is going to give the other locations a bad name.  Dirty looking, old decor, cluttered sushi prep area.  One of the conveyor belts was out of order so I was sat, by a server, up at the bar.  I watched the chef, whom I don't think was an actual chef, slop roll after roll together like she was trying to fold fitted sheets - everything looked loose and sloppy.  As the rolls belted by me I saw little variety compared to some of the other locations I've been to.  I chose the squid salad which was actually awesome.  I then chose a rainbow roll.  Oof. \nIt was bland and the roll itself was actually warm.  Like it was sitting out far too long. Gross.  I wasn't sure I wanted more but decided to dare myself to eat another roll.  I can't even remember what it was but it was more rice than anything, falling apart and straight up tasted like I ate a spoonful of mayonnaise with each piece. I felt my stomach give me the middle finger.  I didn't finish it.  I paid, I left. I won't go to this location again.  I didn't get sick but maybe the health department should take a gander in there.
