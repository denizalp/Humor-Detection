Staff was friendly for sure. Good attitudes at 12:45 on a weds night. Unfortunately the food was blah. Ordered a few things, fried pickles burgers wings salad. 2 out of 5 is pretty bad. Pickles were undercooked fries hot were undercooked. Burger meat wasn't great and over cooked.  It felt half assed and unfinished. Should have guessed,  tables were barley bused and crumbs on my new plate. Thanks for being open. We were hungry. Wanted to like it. 74 dollars was too much for what was offered. Cook was obviously tired. Our Waitress Rachel was great. Attentive and positive. She made us smile and we liked her a lot.
