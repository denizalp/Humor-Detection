The great work CAST is doing is the reason my wife and I keep coming back. Never having been theatre folks, we were unsure whether CAST would just be another ho-hum one-time experience for us...never to return. \n\nWe were completely blown away by the entire experience and have yet to miss a show since moving to their new NoDa space. The multiple performance spaces are intimate - putting you practically on stage with the actors. It isn't hard to see every facial expression and hear every line - which if done badly, could be a disaster. However, the CAST cast are some of the best, and the stories they tell are so well done. \n\nNoDa is the perfect location for CAST to grow and we look forward to many more shows in the years to come. And...the addition of NoDa Brewing Company beer on tap only adds to the sheer awesomeness that is CAST!
