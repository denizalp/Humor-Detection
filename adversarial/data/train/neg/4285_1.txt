Terrible service!!! Takes them at least 10-20 minutes to seat you, so have fun standing cramped by the door waiting for a table while the staff doesn't even acknowledge you! The food is mediocre at best. They also can't add your bill correctly!! We ordered 16 dollars worth of food and the lady charged us 26 dollars and then argued about giving us our money back. None of them could even do math. What concerns me the most is the amount of elderly people who dine at this restaurant. I hope the servers don't take advantage of them by charging them double! Honestly sickening DO NOT DINE HERE! Take your business to Moon Valley Cafe!
