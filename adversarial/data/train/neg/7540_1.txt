So-so Asian Restaurant \nA mixed bag at our recent Restaurant Week visit. Waiter Mike was cheerful and tried to please but service was very slow. It wasn't busy and there appeared to be plenty of staff but our beer samples took forever, then a looong wait for our lettuce wrap appetizer (how much prep time could there be?) Entrees were tasty and abundant. The highlight of the night was the Volcano Cake -warm, gooey, lovely strawberries topped with ice cream and whipped cream. \nPatio looked nice and is dog friendly so we'll probably give it another try.
