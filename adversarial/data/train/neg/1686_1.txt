I really wish we would have read reviews prior to booking with Advantage. Reservations were made over a week ago for a standard SUV. Pick up time at 8:30 pm. We arrive and they don't have the car we reserved. They can give us an upgrade to a mini van or larger SUV for $10 more. Then once my husband explains he isn't driving a mini van or paying $10 more for an \"upgrade\" and he wants it for the same price for the car we reserved they then tell him they do have a SUV BUT it needs to be cleaned and he along with my 3 year old daughter would have to wait for them to have it cleaned. Reservation was at 8:30, car is \"getting cleaned\" by about 9:30 and they finally get into the vehicle around 10pm. What is even the point of making a reservation for a certain car or time of the company can even honor it? The customer service with Advantage is terrible. I now see what they only have a 2 Star review. Try harder next time Advantage. Treat your customer better... ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH with the RESERVATIONS!
