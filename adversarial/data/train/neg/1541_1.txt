Stumbled across this place almost accidentally -- what an unexpected treasure. Lovely room with a lovely ambience. You can hold a conversation!  We took some gambles with unfamiliar menu items and our boldness paid off for the most part. I loved the pan-fried pumpkin dumplings, and the Bao were as good as what we eat on Sunday mornings in Monterrey Park. Noodle dishes were excellent and served very beautifully. This is an extensive menu requiring some leaps of faith and bit of the explorer's instinct. We got lucky and had a simply wonderful  meal.
