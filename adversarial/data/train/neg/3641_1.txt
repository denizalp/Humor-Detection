I just had lunch here with my sister. It was my first time, and i am not impressed. The food were either salty, TOO sweet (especially the eel sauce they use in almost everything) or too spicy.... Nothing caught my eye. Service was a 2.5\/5 - forgetful waiters, and didn't know english. I showed her my coupon and had to repeat myself like 6 times... She said she'd ask her manager about it which she didn't. The food was OK... Ive had way better. The menu is pretty easy to understand and is pretty much like other menus from head to toe so you know what they have to offer. Menu is some paper and yeah.... we only ordered one round of food and left after 35 minutes or 30. I dont recommend this place... But give it a try if you wanna waste your money.
