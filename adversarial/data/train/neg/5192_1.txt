The people who work at this store are nice enough, but I'm getting sick of being treated like a criminal by their store polices.   It used to be a pain to try something on here because you had to track down an employee to open a dressing room, then the number of items you could take in the dressing room was limited.  On my last visit, I was looking for ski clothing.  Half of the ski jackets are locked to the racks so you have to, once again, track down someone to unlock them.  Then I wanted to try on some ski pants and I was told outwear, such as ski pants, aren't allowed in the change rooms.  I was told I should stand in the middle of the store and try them on.  Since I don't wear ski pants over regular pants (or a dress!) this wasn't going to be helpful in determining the fit, at all and I wasn't about to stand in the middle of the store in my underwear!
