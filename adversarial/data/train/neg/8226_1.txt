Always a bad experience, but never shopping here again. The owner tells me everytime about how she was a body builder and tries to push the same pump fuel on me. I finally ga e in and bought it and it smelled like rotten eggs. I was never refunded and she refused to admit something was wrong with the product. This is definitely the most unprofessional GNC I've been to. If you want to here someone tell their life story and push one product shop here. The owner is awesome and don't worry she will tell you she is.
