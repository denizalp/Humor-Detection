Perfect donuts! I got the apple fritter, the maple long john, some twisty glazed donut and a chocolate glazed cake donut.  They were all fresh and didn't taste like they'd been sitting out all day (like some donut shops that shall remain nameless).  They were moist and frosted just right (not too much, not too little).\n\nThe lady in the shop was very friendly and even threw in a couple extra donuts!  Ladies and gents, it doesn't get any better than free!  This place is going to be the place I go for donuts whenever I'm in Vegas, which is quite often.\n\nAs a side note, the pictures of the policemen on the wall are a pretty good indicator that the LVPD loves this place, and cops know their donuts so you can't get a better endorsement than that!  \n\nEat at the Donut Hut, you won't be sorry!
