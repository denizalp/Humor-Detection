I'd say I'm a fan. I always order the Kona pizza because it's the closest I can get to ordering a Hawaiian pizza. The Teriyaki sauce is really what pulls the entire pizza together. I definitely recommend trying this you like pineapple and chicken on your pizza. The small is more than enough to feed one person. I usually save a slice or two for my dogs and they never complain.
