I had high expectations for this restaurant. I was extremely disappointed!! The pizza was soggy from the middle, the pizza was burnt from the bottom. Every bite tasted burnt. I ate at the SLS location. The employees working tonight weren't very friendly either. I wouldn't come back. The most expensive bad tasting pizza I've had! $34 for 2 basic pepperoni pizzas with mozzarella and 2 drinks.
