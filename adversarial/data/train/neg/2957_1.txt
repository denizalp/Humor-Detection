We rented a GMC Yukon it came from another state with high miles 40000 and a bald tire. When we went to the park lot we saw other newer SUVs but they gave us that one. My spouse and I will try national or hertz next time.  Seems budget as they grew and bought  Avis they know when you buy the competition you can give poor quality vehicles. Bald tires means that on a vacation you have more chance for a flat tire which means time you loose on vacation thankfully the tire lasted.
