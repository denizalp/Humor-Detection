If I had to describe this restaurant in one word I would say unpretentious.  \n\nI'm in town on business and tonight I just wanted a simple meal of a really delicious steak and salad without all the pomp and circumstance that goes along with it at a place like Morton's or Sullivan's.  I had thought of seeking out the more casual Outback or Longhorn, but the food quality there is less than desirable.  Beef & Bottle really fit the bill.  It looks like a dive on the outside, but on the inside it's dark and cozy and a heck of a lot more welcoming than any of the aforementioned chains.  The steak was of very high quality, and I felt it was well worth the price tag for what comes along with your meal.\n\nFor $34 I got a fresh, crisp salad with a delicious house-made dressing, a tender, juicy filet mignon cooked to a perfect medium-rare topped with melted blue cheese, and a creamy baked potato on the side.  The service was warm and friendly, and the manager made it a point to make the rounds and be sure that everything was up to par.\n\nSo if you're in the mood for high-quality, simple food executed well without a side of attitude, do yourself a favor and check out Beef & Bottle.
