Another winner! This was the second show I enjoyed on my latest trip to Vegas and it did not disappoint!! Mac King was funny, engaging, and his magic tricks were excellent! We were in Vegas on a vacation with extended family, and this was one show that EVERYONE went to together (kids and grownups) and it was completely appropriate and enjoyable for all ages. Go check it out, you will absolutely not be disappointed.
