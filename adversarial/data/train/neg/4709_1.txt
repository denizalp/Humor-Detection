Had an emergency issue on my 2007 335 cab.\nVehicle was over heating and going into limp mode.\nI took it in on Thursday night to the service department. Met with Mackenzie a service advisor and she said they could look at it that  Friday morning.\nThe next morning Mackenzie got the 335 in and was able to replace the water pump & thermostat.\nHad the vehicle back by 11am that morning ready to go & washed up!\nI was very impressed with the fit in and fixing my problem!\nHats off to Mackenzie & her service team for assisting me in this emergency!
