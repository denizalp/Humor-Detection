The coffee is great- my favorite is simple- just an Iced Hazelnut coffee. \nThe only issue I have is how slow they are at making the drinks sometimes. A few weeks ago, I went in before work, so I arrived there at about 6:30, and there was a about 3 or so people in line before me. There were TWO people making the drinks and one person taking orders. I left there at 6:50. It was kind of a bummer to have to wait 20 minutes for some coffee. I will be back because the coffee is great. I usually hit it up during lunch, but would love to get coffee before work, but don't want to risk it again with almost being late for work.
