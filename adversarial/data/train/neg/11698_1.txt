They have a new menu! I had gotten bored with their old one so I'm glad. And they are going to have a new one every 3 months (this one is Sept-Nov so next one out Dec1). It has some unique salads.The cold noodle salad is the best I think but also spicy (in a hot Thai chile sense) so be warned if you are spice-averse. The green apple and prosciutto was really good too, especially if you like blue cheese as much as I do.  I remember when the only big salad they had was the roasted veggie one.Their buffalo chicken soup - whether with real chicken or tofu - has a good taste and just right spiciness, but I wish they would cut the tofu into cubes instead of tofu strips too long for a spoon. Pierogies were just perfect.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the sandwiches (heresy!). They are more of a novelty to me. I thought it was fun trying them once or twice and still get enticed by some of the descriptions. I did try the new Shrimp Po Boy, it's mostly hush puppies.\n\nFive stars because this is my favorite place to go tor relax. The dim lights, laid back atmosphere, short wait time (unlike Lakewood...), good beer, always great servers. It's not a place where you feel like they are trying to flip your table. They are keeping the menu interesting even if it's not always a hit. But often it is a hit. I hope they keep up the salad\/vegetarian expansion.
