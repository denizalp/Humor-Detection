I just waited 2 hours for a salad to be delivered. The soda was warm. \n\nI asked for utensils as I just moved.  I have a back injury and couldn't  get out. I have proof that I ordered utensils  and don't  appreciate  being called a liar. \nThese people  are rude and incompetent  imo. I'll  call Marcos  next  time. \nThe salad was awful
