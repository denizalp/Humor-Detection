IKEA is great for so many things - but you have to really prepare before you go. My best advice is as follows:\n\n1) Go to ikea.com and get the family card for discounts and perks. (or you can get it at the store at a kiosk when you first walk in)\n\n2) Go to ikea.com and pre-determine what you want to buy and see if it is in stock at your store - then get the Aisle and Bin numbers. Make a shopping list and print it out before you go.\n\n3) Wear comfortable shoes and take a car big enough to haul anything you plan to buy. \n\n4) Always check\/ask if there are additional pieces needed for any furniture you buy - for example - a chair might not come with the cover you saw on it in the show room - a bed might be a head and foot-board with no center support bar. These are things you will need when you get home and try to put the thing together.\n\n5) Know if you just want to go to the marketplace and buy your items or if you want to take an hour to walk the showroom path to get ideas. You will buy lots of random stuff this way - it's very enticing - but it also gives you great ideas for how to use items. Experts will usually skip the showroom and go right to the market place to grab the items they want and avoid temptation.\n\n6) Stop by the cafe or the market area and try the lox, coffee and chocolate. Everyone talks about the meatballs and the lingdonberries - but I really like the Swedish coffee best of all.\n\n7) They don't provide any bags, but they do sell big IKEA bags for 50 cents each. They are great for all sorts of stuff - so buy a few for your future trips.\n\nLots of great kitchen stuff, cute knick knacks for all your rooms, great lamps and wonderful textiles. \n\nGood luck!
