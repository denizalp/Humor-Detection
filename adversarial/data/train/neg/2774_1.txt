Had dinner there tonight. The food was fine. Not particularly distinguished but not bad either. Unfortunately, the service was brutally slow.  It really should not take an hour for food.  Meal was over two hours; no desert.  Sorry but wouldn't go back to find out if this was an aberration. The other reviews suggest its not.
