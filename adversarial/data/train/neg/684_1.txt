First off--it's pretty expensive for the dinner buffet. It was 29.99 plus tax for my husband and I to eat as well as our teenage daughter.  Our youngest daughter was a bit cheaper.  Our total bill was 122$ However, the food was delicious. There was a ton of variety and it was absolutely great. There was a section of shrimp\/crab legs, Italian, a rotisserie, asian\/japanese, and the dessert area was phenomenal. There were some other sections I can't recall.  I think it's a great buffet and it is worth the price IF you are really hungry from walking the strip.
