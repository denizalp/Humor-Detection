We came in for a bachelorette party & Sugar Factory did not disappoint! Part of the group was late - but they held our table & were really nice about it! The drinks are AMAZING. $36 for big bowl drinks but they are SO awesome! Even if you don't want to eat, you should come in just to try the crazy drinks they have. We ate the \"over cooked bacon, sliders & the mac & cheese\" for dinner. It was all delicious! Really good for an easy bite! I will definately be back!
