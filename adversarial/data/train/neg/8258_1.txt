This is my go to pizza place when I want something good and quick. They have good pizza with great choice of toppings. They also have a gluten-free dough if you want to avoid the comatose-induced feeling after having eaten breads and pastas.\n\nThey also have a good selection of salads and they make a mean lentil soup. Yes! Lentil soup. It's extremely tasty and hearty. Good for cold days! \n\nSo if you are looking for a better option than your local 2 for 1 pizza joint, Dominos, and Pizza Hut. Tasty food is a way better option.
