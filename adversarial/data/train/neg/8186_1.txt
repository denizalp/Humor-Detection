HORRIBLE COMPANY!  If I could give them negative stars, I would.  First off, I called and asked what I needed for a 4 bedroom, 2200 square foot house and the customer rep ordered me ONE POD to be sent to my home.  Obviously, one POD would accommodate maybe the garage.  When I called back they said I actually needed 5 PODs and that would be over $700 a month.  I was furious, had I been advised correctly on the number of PODs I actually needed and the cost, I would never have requested service.  Rather than refunding all of the money and picking up the POD immediately, they charged me $120 for the POD that I cant use and have left the POD sitting in my driveway for over a week, making it difficult for us to actually get a moving truck to the home.  I called 3 separate times and made arrangements for an earlier pick up date (which I was told would be accommodated) and SHOCKER! The pick up date was never actually updated and the POD is still scheduled to be picked up for a date that is AFTER the house is sold and the new owners are supposed to move in.  The customer service rep I last spoke too was extremely rude, continuously spoke over me and was practically yelling at me, did not listen to my concerns, and put all of the blame on me for having the incorrect number of PODs and incorrect delivery date.  She also kept me on hold 45 minutes to speak to a supervisor, who never resolved my issue.  Terrible terrible customer service!  I will never ever recommend this company, and will advise anyone that listens  to not use PODS for any moving or storage needs.
