This place is really great is you are looking for vegan and GF options in pizza comfort foods!\n\nWe had no idea this was here until we were searching for a new place for lunch. As a vegetarian, having vegan options for sandwiches and pizzas is amazing. I ordered a vegan wedgie and was a little disappointed in how tough the bread was. It was hard yet really chewy and just overall challenging to get through. I didn't let that stop me though because it was still delicious and I went back a second time!\n\nThe pizza is also really good. We had just a plain vegan cheese pizza and it surprisingly didn't taste like cardboard. It had good flavor and was very filling. \n\nStaff were really nice and the wait was not long. Looking forward to trying more options!
