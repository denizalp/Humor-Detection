My family decided to make the plunge and get an alarm system. We spoke with Richie at Clear Protection and received a very reasonable quote. We were impressed with the same day installation and the customer service. When James came out to install the camera he was very personable and went out of his way to make sure our wifi was working at the best speed for the alarm system. He added a booster to our home to ensure our security system was going to be at its best. We also appreciated the initiative that the guys took to clean up our home after they drilled into the wall for the install of the screen pad. We have been pleased with our service, thank you Clear Protection.
