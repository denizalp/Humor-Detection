I'm so torn.  I really wanted this to be an exciting experience...but it just wasn't.  I went on a Wednesday with a friend to check out the Science Center when we knew it wouldn't be insanely crowded.  We only got the basic entrance because we wanted to explore just the science center.  Which we did.  In under an hour.  There is so much space to this and I just felt disappointed.  There should be more here, but a lot of the exhibits were things I remembered from my last visit close to twenty years ago.\n\nIt just feels outdated with all of the new technology and what not.  I felt the space wasn't utilized to it's full potential.  I have hope though, because with everything that's now at a child's finger tips, what the science center is showing isn't really groundbreaking.
