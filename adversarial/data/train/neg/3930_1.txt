This is, to me, the best place to eat and relax. The staff are very nice and welcoming and the food is extraordinary. My boyfriend that I have been seeing for over a year now is Serbian and he has introduced me to foods I will never forget. Try the Sarma! Trust me! If you have never tried Serbian cuisine and want to, this is the place to go. No cons about this place! Delicious and life changing. Worth every penny!! Don't think twice... Indulge yourself and enjoy.
