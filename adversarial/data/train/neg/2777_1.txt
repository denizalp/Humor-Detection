My carpets had been left very dirty by tenants.  There were some black marks on the carpet and pet urine down in the padding.  Aside from that though, the carpet did not look very worn and I wanted to see if I could save it instead of buying brand new carpet.  Of course, the guys from Stanley Steemer said they could save it, but I would have to pay for some upsells.  I decided to go ahead and do the upsells because it was far cheaper than replacing the carpet.  Of course, when all was said and done, they couldn't get rid of the stains or the smell and I had to replace the carpet anyway.\n\nI would much rather deal with a company with the integrity to say that they wouldn't be able to save the carpet than one that peddles upsells and can't deliver on their promise.
