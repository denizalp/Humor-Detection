Extremely friendly staff and very helpful!  I called in advance about Autism Day at the movies and they answered every question I had and was very friendly about it.  Then today, when I brought my 2 young boys here, they were so helpful and friendly and VERY PATIENT!!!\nThe food is normal theater food, but again, very patient as my boys picked out what they wanted.  The theater itself was very clean and orderly.  Everything in working order and the bathrooms were great.  Clean and neat!  Would come here again!
