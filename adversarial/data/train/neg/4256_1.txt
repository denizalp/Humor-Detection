The experience was certainly a memorable one. As others have mentioned, Cecilia goes out of her way to provide personalized service and get to know you. She even introduced me to her husband when he came out with my order. The friendliness here is a major reason that I will be coming back to this place.\n\nFood was quite good as well. I had the small curry goat, but it was anything but small. Came with lots of meat and some side vegetables, and it was very obvious that the curry was infused with lots of herbs and spices--definitely had a great kick to it. The only slight modification I would've liked is probably a bit less sauce--other than that though, it was delicious. Can't wait to try other things like the jerk chicken or oxtail next time.
