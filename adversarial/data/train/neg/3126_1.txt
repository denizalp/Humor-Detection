I find the process of finding a tailor to be very frustrating because I can never find the prices for services before arriving and being surprised. I went to Pro Tailoring because reviews had included prices - so I felt more comfortable.  \n\nI had two dresses altered - one knee-length dress taken in on the sides ($25) and one maxi dress hemmed (dress and liner - $20.50).  Those prices were reasonable to me.  The quality is good.  My one comment on the knee-length dress being taken in was that the dress is striped and after alteration, the stripes don't line up perfectly on the sides.  It's not totally obvious, and no one will probably be inspecting.  However, the maxi dress and liner were perfect - stripe integrity was maintained. So it's 50\/50 for stripe integrity.\n\nI took a pair of pants to have hemmed - $10.  Very reasonable.  \n\nI will continue coming here because the price is right and the turnaround is about a week.
