We were so excited to try this place. We didn't come as soon as they opened. Having seen the other reviews saying they were waiting too long for their orders, we waited, hoping to give them some time to settle in. It has, unfortunately, not been enough time. THE SERVICE. From the time we placed our order and received our last item, it had been 45 mins. The store forgot\/lost a drink on our ticket and we had to go up and ask the whereabouts of said drink. No one acknowledged how poor this makes a customer's experience. But after a few more mins, we were handed the drink. THE FOOD. As far as how things tasted, everything was just \"eh.\" I will say the split cup idea is really genius-an aspect I did enjoy. I got pink lychee and strawberry horchata- they both were intensely sweet. We ordered hot Cheeto elotes and cheese fries along with the infamous, mangonada. Corn and fries were intensely salty. (Ru noticing a theme? Side note-this spot could benefit from a water station.) The mango drink was beautifully made. And as a lover of tajin, I never thought there would ever be such a thing as \"too much\" tajin. Again, it was just too overwhelming. The mango was nicely ripe, though. Sadly, the mango chunks would be the only thing we finished. Generally, I give leeway to places who's great customer service makes up for not so great food or vice versa, occasionally, I'm lenient on so-so service if the food is bomb.com! But again, it was unfortunate our experience here lacked both. But please, don't just take my word for it. Definitely try it if you're interested, I hope your time there is better than ours!
