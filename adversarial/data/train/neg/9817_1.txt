Like everyone else this WM Neighborhood market is conveniently placed, but whomever manages this place should be retrained or let 'go'. There are only (2) lanes open, and the staff working the checkout are slow and little ghetto, I don't necessary need a hello and thank you ...but I do cringe when I hear employees 'swearing' at each other, especially when there are children around.
