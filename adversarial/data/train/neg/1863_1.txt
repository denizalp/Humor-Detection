Such a disappointment. After paying over $60 for myself and 2 young daughters (who could NOT wait to go here) just to enter....we spent 5 hours fighting Mesa public school children for our turn on anything. I feel tickets should be discounted to the public when there are this many children on a field trip or they should close one day a month for field trips only. My kids were pushed out of line, cut in front of, had balls literally taken out of their hands while they were playing and their castles knocked down while they were building them (on purpose). I Don't blame the kids, I know they were excited but there should be some sort of supervision by the science center staff in each of the rooms. The \"staff\" on the field trip were young and encouraging fighting with styrofoam swords (building blocks) and not paying attention to the kids at all.  Both of my kids said they never want to go back to this place again and after dropping over $120 dollars on entrance, food, Grossology, skybiking, I can't agree more. Never had a more unpleasant time with my kids than today.
