CUSTOMER SERVICE won my business!\n\nThey carry major brand name water heaters you can purchase at ANY big box stores but what sold me was the customer service I received. \n\nA gentleman named Heath was who I was transferred to answer my questions when my water heater failed.  He not only was kind, patient, understanding to my questions and concerns he provided me with options and educated me about tankless vs water tank and the concept between the two. \n\nThe mere fact is when I called other competitors including the big box stores everyone else was either too busy to take the call, wouldn't have the answers to my questions, rushed me off the phone or shuffled me through a phone system.   Heath did not. In fact once I made my decision to go with Access I made sure to thank him for his time and to let him know why I chose to go with them to replace our water heater. \n\nOn day of install, we received advanced telephone call from driver confirming he would arrive on time and was in route. Clean, courteous employees performed the install noticed we had some corrosion on one of our pipes, fixed a small leak without any additional charge (outstanding customer service once again) and charged exactly what I was quoted over the phone. \n\nI'm all about referrals and this company I would highly recommend!\n\nThank you to your entire crew including the office personnel who handled my initial inquiry telephone call!
