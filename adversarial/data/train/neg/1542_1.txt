April did a wonderful job with my botox and juvaderm injections. She took the time to listen to my concerns and the results I was looking for. I had always wanted fuller lips but have such a small mouth, I was worried that it would not look natural. She offered to do half the syringe of Juvaderm now and I could come back at no additional charge for the other half for up to 3 weeks later. I just had the procedure done yesterday and have minimal bruising and nice natural fuller lips. Thank you April. I think I might go back for a few more units!!
