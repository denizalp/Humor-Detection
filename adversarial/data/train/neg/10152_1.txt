Came here for dinner and WOAH!! Best tacos I've ever had. Hands down. Ordered the Chicken fried steak and oh my lanta... What a fantastic dish. \n\nHad SUCH an amazing waitress (Ashley) who made the entire experience memorable. She's a veteran at what she does and completely genuine. Her attitude was positive and full of energy the entire time which was appreciated. She recommend the best margaritas and convinced me to try a palette of shots. (She repeated the name of all the shots at least 5x and for the life of me I cannot remember.) \n\nWill absolutely come back to this location and specifically ask for Ashley with hopes to see her again. \n\nOn top of her perfect customer service the food was beyond expectations. Check them out! You won't be mad.
