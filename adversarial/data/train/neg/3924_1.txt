Finally stopped in for coffee.  Been driving past it for ages. Atmosphere is not fancy but clean bought a regular cup of coffee. Best way to test a brand is regular coffee nothing exotic. Coffee was great. I like coffee strong but not so strong it is bitter. Coffee was strong but not so strong it drove itself home. A hidden gem. Worth the trip into town.
