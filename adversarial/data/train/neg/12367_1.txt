I really like the cleanliness of this indoor and outdoor Starbucks location. I like the early morning staff because they relate to the early morning commuters. The early morning staff is very pleasant  compared to the afternoon team. This location appreciates Military personnel. Every one drink gets me a free 2nd drink. I think this is so awesome.
