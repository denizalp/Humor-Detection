The food was pretty decent when we ordered take-out a few days ago. \n\nThe three stars is mostly due to value for your money. We ordered a chicken skewer platter that came with rice and a side salad, as well as a greek salad with grilled salmon. Bill came to $38. Wayyyy too much for takeout imo. For this price I rather we go to a sit down dinner and we probably would have received more food for that price tag.\n\nThe greek salad was ok but not very greek. Fresh lettuce and veggies but they went really light on the veggies and the feta. Salmon portion was small and not enough dressing for the salad.\n\nChicken and rice were decent but dry and no sauce was included. Should come with a hummus or something as this dish greatly needed some moisture.\n\nWon't go back. Food was good and fresh but small portions and big bill. There are way too many other alternatives that surpass this place.
