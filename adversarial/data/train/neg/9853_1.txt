This is my favorite sushi spot in Arizona! It's worth the drive. I live in Gilbert area, but drive to downtown Phoenix for Harumi Sushi. If you want fresh fish and great service, this is the spot to be. Restaurant is small, cozy, and seems like always busy every time I come here.  Definitely has a moms and pops atmosphere. There is a line, but it goes by pretty quickly and worth the wait. Chef Juno is awesome and is always is good spirits! The Must try is the OMG roll! It will make you shout \"OMG!\" And they also have fresh real wasabi which is rare to find at sushi restaurants. Ive never been disappointed. The prices are reasonable. I love Harumi ! Highly recommend
