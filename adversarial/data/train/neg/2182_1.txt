Doctor is probably great but you would never know that because after calling 3 times day for over a week neither me nor my insurance was successful at getting the scheduling staff to answer. Finally started pushing every single extension to try to make some headway and the lady that answered the phone sounded irritate and flustered before I could even say \"hello\".
