Very good service and excellent food and a reasonable price FOR being inside a major casino.  Lunch was $12.95 and very good.  Generals Chicken was top notch.  Sweet and spicy.  Atmosphere was very nice as well.  Waitresses were super friendly ans on the ball.  Frankly, this was a surprise for being inside the Hard Rock Casino.  Main surprise was the affordable price and the fact that it was top notch Chinese food.   I recommend to anyone who want a great Chinese lunch for under $20.  Obviously that is rare in Vegas.
