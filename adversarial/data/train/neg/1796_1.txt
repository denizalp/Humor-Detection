When we arrived and checked in the front desk Person named Dee gave us two complimentary breakfast buffet tickets that were valid from 8am-2pm and we went at 9:30am and waited five minutes and were seated. It said $12\/person on our receipt. I assume this was already included in the hotel room stay but others also had a voucher as well. For a free buffet I was impressed with the cleanliness, the organization, the service and the food as well. Not a broad option but enough options for breakfast to satisfy you to get more than one plate.
