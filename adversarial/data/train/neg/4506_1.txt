We had a brand new house and 4,000 sq. ft. back yard.  We interviewed 6 other pools companies before stumbling onto Thunderbird.  From our very first meeting we know we had found our pool builder.  Cohl and his team are friendly, helpful, dedicated, and do phenomenal work!  These people love building beautiful pools.  Cohl is an artist with the eye, knowledge and expertise to guide you through the entire process.  \n\nWe got weekly calls from scheduling so we always knew what was happening.  People showed up when they were scheduled and worked very hard. There were no surprises along the way.  We felt comfortable and knowledgeable through out the entire process.\n\nAt each phase of construction we were amazed at the skill, quality, and beauty each person put into their work.  Everyone was friendly and polite while on the job.\n\nWe cannot say enough good things about this great company.  We are so very pleased with our results.\n\nHighly recommend this company!
