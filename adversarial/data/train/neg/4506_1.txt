The chef promised three choices for entree...there were two...salmon which was fair and short ribs..a cheaper cut of meat.\nThe tables were too small...not enough room for dishes, glasses and a wine bottle..\nthe desert promised was bread pudding...but a cobbler was presented.\nCorkage of $10 per bottle, but glasses were not exchanged from red to white wine.\nThe Chef asked about the meal but did not listen for a response...I will not go back
