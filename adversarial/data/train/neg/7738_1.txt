My boyfriend and his friend stayed here after going riding at Ram Jam Sportsplex. While they said the hotel was alright, they woke up the next morning to find both of their dirtbikes stolen. Not only were their bikes gone, but the thieves also stole another kid's minibike and cut a lock off a trailer with dirtbikes.  \n\nI am not discouraging you from staying at this hotel. I am just encouraging you to be wary if you plan on staying with your bikes, even if you have them chained in a truck or locked in a trailer. Thieves are becoming better equipped to steal stuff, even if it is chained or in a trailer. I'm just another motorcyclist looking out for fellow riders.
