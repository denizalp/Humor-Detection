Love love loved this place.\nMade a reservation for 12pm on a Saturday for brunch and I was not disappointed at all. They have an option for unlimited small plates and unlimited mimosas and bloody Mary's for two hours.\nThe food are very small plates but it's perfect because you get to try a bunch of different food and they bring the food out quick and you can order more than one at a time. \n\nThe chips & salsa they brought out first was very good. I had the steak & eggs,chicken & waffles,Eggs Benedict,and the shrimp and grits. I have 0 complaints about any of the food because it was all delicious.\n\nThe mimosas were good because they had many various flavors to select from. Our waitress was bringing them out 1 at a time but we had a group of 7 so we kept refilling pretty quick so she accommodated us and starting bringing pitchers of mimosas for us.\n\n5 Star food,5 Star drinks,and 5 stars service.
