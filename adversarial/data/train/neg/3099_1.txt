Excellent service!  We called at 8:00 am and by 10:00 am Josh was here.  Josh quickly determined what the problem was and solved it.  He pointed some other potential problems and gave recommendations on how to save on major problems.  I highly recommend Mojave Air Conditioning and plan to use  them again in the future.
