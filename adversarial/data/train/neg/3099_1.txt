Good service but the food wasn't good, which was saddening because I was looking forward to the Philly cheesesteak and the classic pizza. Neither were good.  The Philly was made with white American cheese and I wasn't aware that the cheese came in it so it was super salty and weird tasting simply because processed cheese was in it. Pizza was bland.
