Absolutely the best coffee in Pittsburgh. The baristas know how to make a wide variety of expresso. I often just ask them to make me whatever they want and I have never been disappointed. For those that like a little bit of sweets they also serve Dave and Andy's ice cream! Try the affogato for a special treat!
