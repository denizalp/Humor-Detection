Sorry, this was a place to hang out before we left the LVH for the airport after our conference. It was meh...margarita prices were good during the happy hour; however, it needed more alcohol...very sour and tart but all I tasted was the margarita mix.\n\nThe waitress was very nice and very helpful; however the happy hour deals were rockin margaritas, Mexican beers and appetizers were 50% off. I didn't care for the margarita and I don't drink beer, so I ordered a glass of Cabernet. It was meh...nothing to write home about.\n\nWe ordered the chicken taquitos and noted that they were the same as the frozen ones that she buys for her kids at Costco...no good! Meat was mushy...sorry Vince Neil, it was just ok.
