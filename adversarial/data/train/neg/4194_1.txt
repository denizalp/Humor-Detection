This Pho and Vietnamese restaurant in a small strip plaza across from UNLV is just about a 10 minute drive from the Strip.  \n\nWe went in on Thanksgiving Day, after leaving the airport, at about 2pm and found it not that crowded after lunch.  \n\nWe were quickly greeted and seated. We ordered some Smoothies with Boba, which were amazing.  \n\nUnfortunately, I do not recall exactly what I ordered; however, the taste was great. It was appealing to the eye, tasted great, and the price was reasonable with large portions.\n\nDefinitely would recommend.
