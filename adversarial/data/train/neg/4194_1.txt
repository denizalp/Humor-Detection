Went to the Chili's on Dobson road now that the Mill Avenues Chili's is closed down.  In comparison it was totally disappointing.   Ordered the Classic Sirloin, as the photo on the menu not only made it look tasty but large.. (Great Photography) \n\nMy classic sirloin I did NOT take one bite out of!  it was not only smaller than you can believe it was most unappealing in look.  what was brought to the table was nothing more than bait and switch in comparison to the photos on the menu..\n\nLastly having 5 people at the table with us, the discussion about the food brought us to one conclusion, this has to be what food in a nursing home tastes like !
