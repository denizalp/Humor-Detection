Ordered the chili dog with onions. \n\nThe ground beef + onion combination was alright but that was an awful, awful hot dog. I would have been better off buying a street hot dog.\n\nThe hot dog itself was dry and most rubbery I've ever had anything. I couldn't fully chew through it and ended up giving up halfway (the portions aren't even that big) because it was just not worth the effort to eat it. Definitely not worth the price tag at all.\n\nOtherwise the store itself is nice and clean with decent decor. Really awkward placement for a menu (its on a side wall at the far back or the restaurant in chalk.) Staff was friendly and the food took a little bit long but not unreasonably so.
