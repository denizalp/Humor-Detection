Heard a lot of great things about this popular and trendy dessert place so I decided to try it out. They have their signature Ice Cream Fish Waffle dessert here. For $5, you get two scoops of ice cream (red bean, green tea, vanilla, mango or sesame (for extra) in a fish waffle. I thought it's a great price for such a dessert. The fish waffle was nicely designed and it was good when it's hot. It does get messy though if you don't eat it right away as the hot waffle starts melting the ice cream. It's a nice little mom and pop shop. It's quite small with very little seating. Overall, it's a great dessert place and I'm bias because I love ice cream waffle. Definitely give it a try!
