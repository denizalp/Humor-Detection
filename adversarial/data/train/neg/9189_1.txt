I went here for the first time with a group of friends that highly recommended the place. I checked the reviews and I was very hesitant based on yelp reviews but I had a wonderful experience there! \nThe service was top notch. I believe the servers name was Nicole; she was wonderful and the food was amazing! Crab cakes were delicious, shrimp scampi was delicious and the shrimp were nice size. I had the fettuccini and scallops, it can easily feed 2 people. My husband had the filet and shrimp and he was very happy with it. He said he cut through his steak so easily \"like butter\" and the flavor was perfect. The Bartender was very friendly and made excellent drinks. I am so glad I came here and we will definitely be back. I wish we had room for dessert but maybe next time...
