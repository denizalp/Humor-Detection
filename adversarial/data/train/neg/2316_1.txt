The food is not that great but they have select beers for $5 Mondays. I tried the chicken nachos (the chicken was really dry), a fried cauliflower app special (there were giant pieces of cauliflower,you'd think they'd cut them into bite size pieces?), and ordered the braised oxtail as a main. It was a lot of fatty meat with a pineapple salsa and 3 pieces of bread.
