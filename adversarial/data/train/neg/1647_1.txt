If you want to get unpasteurized goat cheese from Quebec or France at Marche Jean-Talon, Fromagerie Qui Lait Cru is the place to go.\n\nThe staffs are friendly, knowledgeable and patient.\n\nEspecially if you are not sure what you want? and even what you like? They able to help you to find out what you may like.... \n\nMy Yelp Friend ended up picking 2 different cheese for us to try.....\n\na soft goat cheese from Quebec and a hard goat cheese from France\n\nBoth are quite mellow, great if you are not into strong flavoured cheese! Kudo to the staff for his recommendations!
