Came here on the way out of Phoenix and had an amazing special iced coffee called a Toddy.  They cold brew it for 24 hours which retains all of the flavors and caffeine, but because there is no heat involved, you don't get any of the bitterness that you would find with an espresso.  It's super caffeinated though--I drove back to LA high and wired!  I got the spiced version, which has subtle flavors of clove, cinnamon, and cardammon(?)\n\nThe owner was so nice and even explained to me how a Toddy is made.  They even have supplies in the store if you want to try and make your own at home.  Everything in the store is FAIR TRADE and ORGANIC.  You can also purchase loose leaf teas and coffee beans by the pound.  I got 2oz (about 10-12 servings) of Blueberry Rooibos tea for $5!  What a steal!\n\nDefinitely check this place out--I read a sign on the door that said they are trying to change ownership, so hopefully this place will not go by the wayside.  There's yummy breakfast wraps for $4 and the bagel with homemade sundried tomato and basil cream cheese ($3) was also a great way to start my morning.  \n\nSupport Bunna Coffee and organic\/fair trade goods--'nuf said!
