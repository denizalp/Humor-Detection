This is a great little bar.  I live walking distance to it and enjoy walking in to a nice clean place.  I always sit at the bar.  The bartender Amanda - is super nice and knows everybody's name.  She even knows what to pour me each time.  I like the burgers a lot.  It's not a creepy crowd or a high and mighty stuck up crowd.  It's the perfect in between mix.  The Ranger is good beer but I wish WISH WISH they would get Four Peaks on tap.
