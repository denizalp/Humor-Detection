Met friends at Roy's on Saturday for Happy Hour and although the food was okay the service was below par. Our first complaint was the overly loud music which the waitress commented that he is known to be loud and plays there only on Saturday's, we then asked if we could eat outside and were told no because it there had been a little rain on Friday and the marble could be wet, hello this is Phoenix! It was 92 degrees on Saturday! The busboy must not have been properly trained because he almost spilled soy sauce on my husband's white shirt and then poured reg water into his sparkling water which we had paid for and then when we told him he didn't make any adjustments, no offering to replace his sparking water or even apologize. I complained to the waitress about our busboy and she went directly to the manager and no response from him either! I doubt we will be back.
