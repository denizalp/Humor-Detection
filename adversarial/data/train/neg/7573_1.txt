We have been here 3 times since moving to Charlotte and have ALWAYS been happy with our service.  The free testing they do is great and has saved us a ton of money. They are quick to diagnose and if you need your battery replaced, quick at the sale\/installation. Specifically,  Cliff, gives great customer service and genuinely cares about your visit to Autozone. I think it is a shame that there are haters out there that try to give this store a bad name but it is only because the people with good experiences don't come on here and rate them as they should. People like to complain though, as you can see from their rating but I am here to tell you that this store is trustworthy & I pray God will continue to bless them and get them the true 5 star rating that they deserve. Keep up the good work Cliff & staff!
