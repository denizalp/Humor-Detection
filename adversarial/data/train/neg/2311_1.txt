This place is terribly run and unorganized. Unless you have hours to spend waiting for you food, go somewhere else. I tried to place an order over the phone but there was no answer, which should have been a sign. I walked into the restaurant and placed a take out order. After about thirty minutes, I asked the friendly bartender to check on my order. She came back and said my order was being bagged. After another ten minutes, I walked over to the take out packaging area, where the owner told me my food was being bagged. I told her I wanted my money back. I also said that someone came in fifteen minutes after me and already received his food. The owner told me that I ordered chicken so it would take longer. She said it was a family owned business and couldn't afford to waste food. I insisted on my money back because I could not wait any longer for my food.  Forty minutes is a long time to wait on a take out order of a gyro, chicken wrap, and a chicken salad!
