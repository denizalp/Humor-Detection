The customer service has serious room for improvement.  Purchased a $700+ grill to be assembled and delivered.  2 weeks after the purchase date, still no grill.  The delivery date changed 3x from 6\/15, 6\/20 & now 6\/23.  ACE has not called with delivery status updates. \n Every time a delivery date passed with no delivery, I have had to call and ask for an explanation.  Each time I was informed that it was a warehouse shipping issue??  They realize they are inconveniencing you and don't really care.
