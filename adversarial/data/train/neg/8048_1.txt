The food was OK - typical fast food chinese fare, with some sushi and desserts, american food like fried chicken. Extremely popular and cheap (comparatively - 10.99 for a Sunday buffet with all you can eat seafood (crab legs, shrimp, mussels, clams). \n\nHowever, it didn't seem the cleanest place, and while you were waiting in the buffet line the floors were pretty greasy. I just didn't get the best feeling and don't see myself going back ever.
