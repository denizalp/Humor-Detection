I would say 2.5-3. I'm undecided.  I probably wouldn't go back here because I'm not the biggest crepe fan and because I got extremely sick after (that was my own fault), but if a friend invited me I probably wouldn't say no either. \nI ordered the chocolate milkshake and a banana strawberry crepe. They forgot the strawberries even though I paid extra, I didn't say anything,  our server was too nice and busy.\nThe milkshake was good but nothing special,  I prefer Licks' or William's' milkshakes over this one (and they're a tad cheaper).
