Black Cat Tattoo  (formerly Eye Candy)\n\nI have experience with two tattoo shops in Pittsburgh (and six others outside of town), and Black Cat was far and away, hands-down, the best tattoo experience ever.  Cara did an amazing job with design, color, shading.  The shop is so clean, so inviting, so calm, with such great energy from both Cara and Jason, we just wanted to stay and hang out after the work was done!\n\nPrices are beyond reasonable, and I recommend this as the tattoo shop to get inked at in Pittsburgh.
