This is one of those gems in the neighborhood. If you want delicious French treats sold by a knowledgeable (but unpretentious) staff this is it. \n\nI got the French macarons on a few occassions and they are probably some of the best I've had in Toronto. They have that chew you want, not hollow or brittle and not too sweet (a problem with a lot of the ones sold here... just taste like sugar!). These are imported straight from Paris so it's the real deal. \n\nAlso the butter palmers are heavenly. the perfect pairing with tea. I also quite like their croissants (both butter and chocolate). I haven't tried the chocolates but I always see people getting them when I come in.\n\nThey definitely prefer cash when you are only buying a few things so come prepared!
