Ru San's has a lively ambience. Our waitress was very attentive and quick. My coworker and I dined here without prior research and we realized after we got our food why they call themselves 'innovative sushi'.\n\nHalf of the soft shell crab appetizer were fried vegetable chunks that shape like crabs. One of the sushi roll served was fried. Plum saki tasted like cherry flavored cough syrup.\n\nIf you enjoy fried dishes inspired by Japanese cuisine in large portions, this is the place for you.
