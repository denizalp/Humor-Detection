Hi - I'm Cuban and went here mid week last year. My husband wanted to treat me to my favorite food. Sorry, this was not only a major disappointment but the place is an old Pizza Hut with dirty walls and questionable food. Did not enjoy this experience at all. We need good Cuban food in Phoenix. Until then, I will be heading to NYC or Miami. Nice try.
