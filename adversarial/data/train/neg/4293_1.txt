I work in the same plaza. i started going when they had only been open a few days since their official opening. Wonderful decor!! Wonderful food!  Ive ordered the pad se ew two times. Once for dinner. And once.for lunch. I love that the lunch comes with a spring roll. Was so great! \n\nThe hostess is so nice! My coworkers ordered the mango and sticky rice, said it was great but just needed a little more sauce. And pad thai portion was large and excellent. \n\nFor spice leevel it goes from 1-5 . 3 is quite heavy but doable.  I reccomend 2 for those with a hankering for spice but flavor as well!!
