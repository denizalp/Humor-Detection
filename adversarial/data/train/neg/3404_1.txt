Sooooo yummy I had to try to eat extra slowly just so it would last longer. I wasn't excited about the lunch specials, it'd have been nice if there were better variety there. But I paid a bit more for what I wanted a la carte and thoroughly enjoyed it. Black rice is awesome. (I snagged a couple bites before snapping the photo)
