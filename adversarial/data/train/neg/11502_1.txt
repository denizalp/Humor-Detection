This is a little gem fof a restaurant in Plaza-Midwood.  French inspired menu with some southern twists and altered seasonally to cater to what's available locally for the season.   For example - you can get steak and pommes frites, mussels steamed with wine, garlic & thyme but you can also get a fried green tomatos and pimento cheese dishes.  The bar is small, the venue accommodates small groups and there's outdoor seating.  Service has always been very good and I've never had a bad meal here in about 8 visits over 3 years.
