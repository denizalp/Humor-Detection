Omg my goodness....where to begin?!?!?\nThis place is so good. \nMy husband went here for lunch yesterday and it was so good that he made me come here for dinner tonight (he couldn't stop raving about it)!\nWe got the pork gyro...it seriously, was unlike anything I've ever had. Everything was fresh; the meat, veggies, pita and the tzatziki sauce. Speaking of the tzatziki sauce.....TO.DIE.FOR. it's thick which is different from all the others I've had but so delicious. We also had the fries with feta and fresh squeezed lemon on them. The family across from us ordered the pizza, which looked and smelled very appealing. The 2nd best part of my first time experience, was the customer service from the moment i walked in til we left. That in itself is rare to find now-in-days....all the guys are family or friends...and the whole vibe of the restaurant was amazing.  I am sold. I will continue coming here and hope they never leave. They are tucked away in the back and i know they just opened but wish they had more advertisement promoting this place because i feel EVERYONE should come here.
