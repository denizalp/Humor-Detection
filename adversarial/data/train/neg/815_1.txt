On a lazy Saturday night, my party of 4 adults decided to stay indoors, consume obnoxious calories and watch movies. Blaze Pizza online ordering to the rescue!\nThis was my first experience with them and I'm pretty unbiased considering I haven't tried any other wood fire pizzas. I love the concept of being able to \"have it your way\" with your toppings. Trying to figure out what should go on a pizza for more than 2 people can start some serious fights.\nI ordered 2 hot links pizzas and 2 green stripe pizzas. To get a little fancy(and so we could differentiate)each of the pizzas had an extra different topping added to each. \nI picked up the pizzas and the line was through the door. Thankfully, there was only about 3 people standing by the pickup area. One gentleman who seemed very overwhelmed by the register getting the pizzas together didn't even look my way as I'm staring at my obvious 4 pizzas chilling on the counter waiting to be claimed. I had to kind of yell towards him I'm here to grab those 4 and he just nodded towards them and continued on his pizza making journey. Poor guy, this place seems understaffed. \nUnderstaffed to the point to where only ONE out of 4 of the pizzas were correct. I could understand if the additional toppings we ordered on the preset pizzas were missing but some main toppings were missing. \nBut they still get 4 Stars because the pizza was delicious and flavorful. I'll try them again on a less busy night.
