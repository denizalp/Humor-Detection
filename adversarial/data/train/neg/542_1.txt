Been there a few times now on two trips.  \n\nFirst trip the pizza was hard at the end, but it was near 2am, and I dont think they were making anymore \n\nThis trip we went 2x , first time was great and selection was good, \n\nsecond time it was the weekend, and there is an inside and outside order station, since we had a group we went inside.  There were 4 pizzas while in line, staring right at us, but one person was working the outside station and was quick as hell, there were two workers inside who were helping at the register, they took your order there.  We stand in line for 20 minutes and get to the register, we ask for pizza and she says is there any there???  I said there was while we were standing there, maybe one of you should help with pizza while the other does the register, she says if you want it faster maybe go outside and order it.  I then try to explain that if there is none inside for us, there is none outside for us right, she says maybe next time.  \n\nI deduct a star for this but only one, I like their pizza, it's cheaper than sabbaro and taste better.  2 slices and a soda for 10.80!!!!\n\nD
