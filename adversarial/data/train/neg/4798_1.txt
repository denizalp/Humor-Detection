Made the switch to State Farm because I needed gap insurance Sam nunez helped me out with awesome customer service and awesome feedback. My job is very demanding and it's hard for to answer phone calls. Sam kept me up with everything through text message to help me out. So on top of getting gap insurance my car got refinanced for a lower payment and my car insurance wen down as well. Thank you Sam for all your help
