Ballet classes at InStudio are top notch! I also tried a pilates class which was a great workout. Instudio really has classes for everyone.\n\nPros: Very seasoned and qualified teachers. My personal favourite is Jonathan Renna (first soloist with National Ballet) and Kate Kernaghan (Director). Jonathan is very energetic and makes the class fun and exciting. Kate is really sweet and breaks everything down. The studio is big and spacious and white. The bars are great, lots of mirrors so you can look at yourself as you dance. The dancers that come range from total beginners to professionals, so you really feel challenged and that you are dancing among the best! There is a live pianist in most ballet classes which is really an added touch (I hate taking classes where the teacher is fiddling with their iPod!)\n\nCons: In the summer, the AC is not so high and it will feel like a sauna in the room when there are 30 other students sweating. Also, class sizes can get quite big, and then there isn't as much individual attention. I also find that a lot of teachers don't focus too much on technique\/alignment\/physically correcting students the way a smaller studio would.\n\nPrice: There are many packages to choose from. Drop ins are $18 but classes are cheaper if you get a 5 class or 10 class pass.
