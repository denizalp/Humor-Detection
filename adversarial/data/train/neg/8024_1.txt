Don't understand the bad reviews by Amber M & Ania K? Don't forget girls, this is a fast casual chicken wing & tender joint, everything freshly made to order. it's an insult to compare this place with Wing Stop or any other mass produced fast food chain. I ordered the combo with 5 tenders with habanero and garlic parmesan sauces I think? And boy was it amazing? It was thick and full of flavor, and the home made ranch I could just drink it, the toast with a perfect crust, and crispy french fries. Too bad I live in Spring Valley, otherwise I'd be at this place every week. Wingtime, thank you for not using cheap ingredients...
