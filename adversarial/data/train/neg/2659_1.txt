I have been to Patron for the first time now. I love Mexican food! I really like the way this restaurant looks inside. It's fun, colorful and the restaurant is huge!\nStaff is really friendly, from the receptionist to the waiters, everyone was exceptional. \n\nWe have ordered a huge bowl of guacamole, which they prepare in front of you to your liking! And I loved it! There could have been more cilantro (but then again there can never be too much cilantro, right?:))\n\nI ordered the enchilada suprema and while it was good, it didn't really blow me away. You get 4 enchiladas, each of them filled differently. One with chicken, ground beef, cheese and a bean filling. The chicken was definitely my favourite as it had the right amount of everything. \n\nI think Patron is quite expensive for what you actually get. The quality wasn't the best and even though the staff was good, the food was just okay, so 3 stars it is.
