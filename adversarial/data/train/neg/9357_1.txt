Small and simple family-run restaurant serves curry that really fluctuates from great to okay. It gets nostalgia points for carrying me through some days in postsecondary.\n\nCurry used to be a golden standard here, but it doesn't taste as good as I remember since the potaties are a bit harder and the meat less tender than before. There was a time when I'd order two dishes for myself here every visit: one curry, and something else to try*. It's not on that level anymore, but still a spot for a fast meal.\n\nWhat I'd Get Next: Malaysian curry with beef brisket\n*The fried noodles and the porkchops were AMAZING, but I haven't gotten them in a couple years now.\n\nTheir curry roti is more expensive than their curry rice... And the roti is real good, but is literally two (maybe three) bite-sized.\n\nAlso, I am nitpicking now, but I've always found their tea a bit strange.\n\nAll in all, my postsecondary memories of this keep bringing me back once or twice a year...
