Do not eat here. Don't let all these good reviews fool you like they did us. We had a reservation for four... Our waiter took our drink order then completely forgot about us until our food came out. At that point, I'm paying $55 for 6 oz of steak and it comes out overcooked so I sent it back. Not only did the waiter rudely bring my exact plate of food to the table back and argue with me about what temperatures are but he later returned out of no where and spooned off one of the medallions that was overcooked off my plate and said oh this one you said ok let me remake it. It came back out 30 mins later now undercooked. The waiter treated us like we were second class citizens. I will not return here. We should've just went to outback... At least their steaks have flavor and aren't burnt to a crisp on the outside. Yuck.
