Disgusting!!!! The bathtub was black and brown, sick. none of the ice machines work and no fridge in your room. No blow dryer in the room, but yet a shower head that's directly above your head forcing you to get your hair wet. Slippery slimed shower floor. Also, we had a worker walk into our room unannounced cus the front messed up. NEVER staying here again, DO NOT RECOMMEND. CHEAP REMODEL. Pathetic
