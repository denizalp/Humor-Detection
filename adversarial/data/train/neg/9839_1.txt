I got one wig here and loved it the next day I came and got another one. Today I tried to wear it and the net that the hair is sewn into sticks out and is very noticeable. I called and talked to someone and they said they can send it back but nothing they can do. Never once offered to replace it not to mention they put very little hair on the wig to were you can see right through it. They are very unhelpful I have spent over 300 in that store in two days and now I have to find another wig store to replace the crap one i got from them. Very disappointed I really thought this place had more respect for their customers. They would of made alot of money from me seeing how I will be wearing wigs for the rest of my life.
