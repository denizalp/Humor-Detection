It's absolutely fun: good music, fine drinks.\nThe unreasonable thing is their service. The bouncers were really unfriendly. My friend had an eyedrops, which only sold in Japan. We kindly asked them if we can keep it somewhere maybe in the locker but they rudely trashed it without our permission. It's not airport, what the hell they had the right to trash someone's important medicine?furthermore, the airplanes allow you keep the eyedrops ! \nThe club had the check point before the locker room, that is unreasonable too. They should consider to give the guest some choice to keep their belongings! Not everybody who's first time there knew\n they didn't allow eyedrops.
