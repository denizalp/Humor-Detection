I usually only write bad reviews but as you can see by the stars this is not the case. The food overall was good. Not great and not terrible. My salad was excellent but my girlfriend wasn't a fan of her sandwich. We also got two apps and cheesecake afterwards. What I really want to talk about was our service. It was incredible. I think our waitresses name was Lynn (could be wrong). She was very engaging and knowledgable about the long menu. We asked a lot of questions I mean a lot and she answered all of them and was very patient. We eat out way too much and this was the best service we have had in a long time. I'm done. Food was good service was fantastic! We do not eat at the cheese factory and only went because we had a gift card. We would have never gone there but would go again because we had an awesome waitress. If only everyone was loving life like she was!
