It's 2:20pm on a Sunday, decided to come here with my parents. Very country style restaurant, love it!! The food was okay, my beer tasted a bit flat, but no biggie. Shame they didn't have something to snack on while sitting there waiting for you food to come. My parents dishes came out and I was sitting and waiting for mine to arrive and it didn't for 15min. I was sitting and drooling. I'll be back, but probably not going to go when I am super hungry.
