Got here in the middle of the day and was seated after only 5 mins wait. I had the Blue something entree (Sorry I forgot the name). The chicken was so juicy and the skin was not to crispy but just right. Comes with spiced watermelon and a biscuit. The mac and cheese tasted like bland cheese. Not southern at all but it was okay. The drinks were well done and just right. Seating is up high and cozy. Great place to eat alone, with family, or friends. Its right off the strip. The place is clean, comfortable, reasonable. At one point the waitress accidentally filled my friends vodka with water (it was so funny) but they were apologetic and replaced it free of charge. The people here are genuinely friendly and great at customer service and quality food. Highly Recommended\n\nTip: \n-Can take parties as large as 8-10 ppl\n- Dress Manhattan Chic\/ Business Casual\n-The place is good for talking because its quiet. You know the food is amazing when u don't hear voices !
