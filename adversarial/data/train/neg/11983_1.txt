Food was delicious but this has been the worst service I've experienced in a while. There were only two waitresses on a Friday night - both EXTREMELY inattentive. We had to wave them down multiple times when we wanted to order, get some water, get water refills, and get take out boxes. I also saw one of the waitresses drop some napkins onto the floor, pick them up and put them back on a dining table.
