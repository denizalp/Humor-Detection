Gordon Howie,\n\nIt had been over 3 months and not one person has come out from Coast Appliances to fix the $12,098.00 SubZero Wine Fridge that was Installed Improperly.\n\nJim Pepe & Wayne Wanamaker have promised and assured multiple times they would take care of it over the last three months they have done \"NOTHING\"!!!!\n\nWe spent $58,082.00 with Coast Appliances and your Company won't even follow up.\n\nThank You for the Horrible Customer Service after the Sale.
