Decent enough place.  I'm not a big fan of the Old Town Scottsdale scene and this is one place I could go without gagging on the pretention.  Food is nothing special but certainly better than typical bar-food.  Great patio!\n\nTo Melissa H below, what's wrong with Kansas bball fans??!  Rock chalk Jayhawk!!!
