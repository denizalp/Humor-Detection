This place has really gone down hill.  It use to be a favorite and one of the best, but now I wouldn't recommend it.  \nJust came back again in 2018 and it's gotten worse than before.  Prime rib was so tough, crab was picked over small and never refilled.   The next night I went to the Wynn and that is much better.   I recommend the Wynn Buffet
