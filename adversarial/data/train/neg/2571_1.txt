To be honest I have zero complaints. The atmosphere was very calm, from the music to the dim lighting. Our server, Clenard was very genuine and an all around caring, helpful man. It's rare to find a place that has good atmosphere, food, and a genuine staff. I'm not the best with words, but I trust if you go you won't be displeased.
