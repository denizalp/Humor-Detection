I have been here many times, but have only just discovered Yelp. The store is slightly difficult to get to, parking wise, but it is clearly defined by a large wall mural facing the road running parallel to it.\n\nWalking inside, the left wall behind the counter is almost overwhelmingly crowded with tubs of popcorn in every flavor. I ordered the $3 cup of popcorn (I could have gotten a bag for the same price; for a gift or easy storage) and thoroughly enjoyed it! I would completely recommend coming here for a snack on the riverfront. (For those if you who use Belly, bring your card too!)
