Four stars is right on with what this place is. \n\nThe only downside is that it is always so busy, but it is always worth the wait. \n\nThe atmosphere is very much a Miami Vice type which I read in another review. \n\nI think the food is a 4 star, the portions are too big though, but it is always quality I have had nothing but good food and good service here.
