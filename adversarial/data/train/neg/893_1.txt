Love this place. Awesome beer, always cold, unique taste. I have tried about 7 different beers here and everyone is great. I love to try all different kind of brewery's in Akron area (tried almost all of them) and this place is very hard to beat. Not to mention the place is huge, has a fun vibe to it; fun things to do there while your drinking. You must try this place out you won't be disappointed
