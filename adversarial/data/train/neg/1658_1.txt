The restaurant is very clean and has a great interior. We ordered some cold noodles, the xiao long bao (with crab meat), sticky rice roll with dried pork, onion pancakes, dumplings in spicy sauce, and red bean pancake dessert.\nI liked the overall quality of the dishes. Especially, the xiao long bao had the hot rich soup inside that kept me going for more. The bill was a bit expensive, but I'd say it was worth it. I would like to come back and try other dishes.
