I'm giving this a bad review not for the store, although it is overpriced. But for the red head employee who was extremely rude to me. (She had no name tag.) She didn't want to work with me on 1\/2 cash and 1\/2 credit like any other business would. Not a big deal as she was making it out to be but it was almost closing time and I'm sure she wanted to go.  She said she wanted to save a \"credit card fee\".  Instead of keeping a happy \"regular\" client who ALWAYS buys cases of 24.  Instead I put back a lot of the cans. She didn't want to do 2 separate transactions either.  Total prior was $52- Total afterwards was $21-  she must really want to penny pinch more than I did!!  So she saved her \"cc fee\" and also undersold me quite a bit of cat food. I hope her boss is proud.  Store policy! Store policy! Store policy!! That's all I keep hearing. All I wanted was to keep a bit of cash on me.  I also have a 10 week old pit bull that eats tons.. I won't be going there anymore.
