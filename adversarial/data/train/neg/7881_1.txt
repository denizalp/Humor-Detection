This places is just awesome.   Really good variety of food, a surprising beer selection as well as non alcoholic beverages.  The dining area is open with smooth music playing and full of colorful artwork adorning the walls.  When I return to AZ I will be back.  Don't shy away just because of the vegetarian title!  I had a bowl of Kong Pao with mock chicken that was exploding with flavor.
