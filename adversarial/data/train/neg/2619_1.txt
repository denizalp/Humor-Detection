Found them in Celebration Square, which is across from Square One.  Had the jerk chicken sandwich.  It was $8.  \n\nChicken was very tender had a soft bun and came with some chips topped with yogurt.  The sandwich was quite tasty, but it wasn't spicy.  I think I would describe it as a \"chicken brisket\". Still good though.  \n\n$8 is expensive, but all food trucks are.  Still, pretty good though.
