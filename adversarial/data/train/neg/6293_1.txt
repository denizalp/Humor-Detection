The food was delicious.  The service was a bummer. We had calamari for our appetizer. It was good, however it took maybe 10 minutes before we got plates from our server, who just dropped it off and didn't seem apologetic at all. Then we had a basic salad. It was okay, presentation was poor. It came with mixed greens, then UNDER the greens were some chopped up veggies. Our entrees were excellent. I had the curry swordfish and my husband had the shrimp risotto. The server walked by several times while both my husband and I had empty cocktails. Never did he ask if we wanted another. However the help was great and kept our water glasses full :)
