We ate here in December of last year and I can't recall exactly what we ate. I do recall that the food was super tasty and very well prepared. The restaurant is pretty stylish, but laid back and not too pretentious. When we ate, it was mostly a business crowd, but as we were enjoying a romantic evening meal they let us sit at the other side, near the bar. We were totally alone, and had a great time. I think I drunk too much....
