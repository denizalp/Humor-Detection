I had a very good waxing experience with Tiranda. In the past I haven't had such great experiences with hard wax but she did a fantastic job. It went very well and fast. Only a few places that hurt but those are the usual. I would recommend exfoliating prior to waxing to assist with hair removal. The price was good too. I would recommend and go back.
