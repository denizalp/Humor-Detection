My family and I love Totts! Lots of options and everything I've had has been amazing! I usually order the Hong Kong stir fry and my husband gets the Kung Pao. Both dishes come with mushrooms, which we don't eat, but the staff is very accommodating and will sub out the mushrooms for carrots, broccoli, whatever. Our daughter likes to watch the cooks making the food right there - lots going on for her to watch. Since we have a little one we probably eat a little earlier than others, but we always find a table inside when we dine in. Take out is great too though- hot food in separate dishes with lots of rice. We live about 20 minutes away and will drive there for their great Asian food over other places near us! Get over to Totts if you haven't tried it yet!
