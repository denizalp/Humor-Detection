Dr. Rehl is amazing. He is knowledgeable and thorough.  I went to him for a second opinion as I was told I needed sinus surgery by an ENT in Scottsdale.  After careful  examination and deliberation he concluded that surgery was not necessary.  His expertise saved me a $40,000 surgery. If you have sinus problems Dr. Rehl is astute and extremely honest.
