Cox Communications.  DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY IF YOU HAVE THE OPTION.  \n\nWe have had issues with our phone and internet service since my Dad passed away in February last year and we had it changed into our name.  We dropped the call waiting and the caller ID, as well as long distance service. We also canceled our cable service to save some money.  \n\nIMMEDIATELY thereafter, we could not KEEP a call on our landline phone.  I called early on (they say November of 2014, I am DAMN sure I called earlier than that) and they \"pinged\" us and told me the problem was on our end.  We knew better because the ONLY thing that had changed was the service to the phone and the canceling of the cable, and things had worked relatively \"well\" before that - though our (HIGH SPEED) internet was never up to par.  (They told us it was because of \"traffic in the area\", and that it slowed down the service when a lot of people were using it. WhatEVER.\n\nMeanwhile, this past year has been FULL of crisis for us, and I had not had the TIME to call them (or the ability to REMEMBER to call them, since I was a little busy trying to SURVIVE), but the continued loss of calls (often it would ring and there would be no one there - and I mean OFTEN, like many times a DAY), and our internet was still dogged, and MANY times when I was ON A CALL, it would drop and the person on the other end would receive a \"cannot complete this call as dialed\" error recording FROM COX.   \n\nI called SEVERAL times early on, they only have record of the ONE time in November.  But that's not the WORST of it.\n\nFinally I call a couple weeks ago, and they send a guy out.  What he FINDS is that the BOX on the side of the house is ANALOG and that this is what is causing ALL of our problems.  It is WHY the calls are dropping, and it is WHY the internet was only half (WE MEASURED IT - HALF) as fast as it was supposed to be.  HALF.  And the phone hardly ever working.\n\nOur crises are at their pinnacle, and we are flat broke.  When I realized the charge for our service was making us OVERDRAWN, I called them to request SOME partial credit for their shitty service for YEARS (my DAD paid HUNDREDS of dollars a month to them for a service WE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH THEIR ANTIQUATED EQUIPMENT) - saying I KNOW we could only recoup within the time the account had been OURS, but that I felt several months' worth of credit would be FAIR.\n\nI had to request a supervisor.\n\nHe was already ready to tell me no, based on the number of calls we made for service - MIND YOU, TWO OF THOSE THEY SENT NO ONE OUT, AND TOLD US IT WAS ON OUR END.  When someone DOES come out, my DISABLED HUSBAND helps the guy run wire out to the box in the street.  WHAAAT?!\n\nAnd after all this, this POS company will ONLY give us a FIFTY DOLLAR CREDIT.  Are you fucking KIDDING ME?!  Wonder how many JOBS I missed because of this crap.\n\nYeah, DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH COX COMMUNICATIONS, if you at ALL have another option.  As soon as we CAN make that change (and we will likely be canceled long before that), WE sure won't.  And PLEASE share this story with your friends.  THIS IS HOW THESE PLACES MAKE SO DAMN MUCH MONEY - they cheat you out of what you are PAYING for and then they shaft you.\n\nAnd I am sure the many tens of thousands of people I have in my network will be glad for the PSA.  You're welcome.\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/coxcommunications?fref=ts
