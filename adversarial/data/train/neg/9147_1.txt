Went to get my tires checked as the air pressure gage was on.  It was about 3 in the afternoon and I was  told I could wait for about an hour and a half if I wanted to and they'd check it out.  The guy was super helpful and said if I came in the morning at 7:45 they could get me in quick.  So I came back the next morning.  I was worried at first as there were four other people waiting outside the door. However, they got me checked in quickly.  I was told 45-60 min but they had the screw out of the tire and patched up in 30 minutes. Clean store, friendly staff, and no sales pressure.  I was told I should think about getting new tires as the treads were pretty bare.   He gave me the list of different options and said they'd love to help when I was ready to change them out. I'll be back!
