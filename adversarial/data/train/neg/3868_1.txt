Maria and the crew at Senza are professional and tops in their field. I have used them for years for electrolysis, switching to Maria when Sophia realized her dream of becoming a nurse. They are knowledgeable and know exactly how to make you comfortable, and I have referred many people to them for small and large electrolysis and laser hair removal jobs who are all completely satisfied. And the prices cannot be beat!
