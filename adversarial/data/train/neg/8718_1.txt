I have never seen business with more erratic hours than this place. After checking the website and Google and seeing that was open from 12 to 9, I got there at 1 and surprisingly it was closed?!?! After calling the telephone number to see if it was closed for good or if there was an emergency, the message said they changed their hours from 3 to 9, 5 days a week. That's 30 hours a week! That's not enough to even consider it a full time job! This is the second time I've tried to eat there, I found out the hard way they are closed Sunday and Monday the first time. There won't be a third try.
