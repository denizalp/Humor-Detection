Ordered sesame chicken with fried rice, ribs and 4 piece chicken wings with fried rice. Was not that good should have just stop at my regular spot for Chinese. The sesame chicken was a bit to soggy they forgot to add the veggies and pork to my fried rice it was just plain yellow rice. Ribs were over cooked and hard. Chicken were ok didn't like the concept of them placing the fried chicken over my rice which makes it soggy also. Probably will not return.
