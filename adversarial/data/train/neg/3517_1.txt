I enjoyed it here! A lot bigger than expected and service was great.  We went on a Sat around 1pm, it was busy, but not unbearable or overly crowded.  The service was prompt in the beginning when getting the order but it dragged a bit towards the end.  It took about10 min to get a box and our check.  Not a huge deal, but we did notice the difference.  Also, their lunch special is only on weekends, which is normally how specials work.  Overall, the food was great.  Each entr√©e you pick, you get to choose which protein you want with it.  Shrimp, pork, chicken, etc.  \n\nThe plates are great size to share and portions are not bad.  Pork fried rice came on a huge plate and all the entrees with came with white rice.  Restaurant was clean and overall, I would come back and recommend.  Their stuff chicken on the appetizers were really good, I will definitely get those again too!!\n\nLocated right next to movie theater so parking was a little of a pain, especially since it was a Sat.
