I usually try to steer clear from corporate businesses and go to small local music shops but so far Guitar Center has been the best option for getting guitar setups done. Their guitar tech is super friendly and honest and he always does awesome work. Sure, you might have to wait two weeks or more but when you get it back it's perfect and exactly how you want it. They ask how you want it done and keep you in the loop.
