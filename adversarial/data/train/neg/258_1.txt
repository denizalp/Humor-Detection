This is a great salon.  I have had two great haircuts from Christy! My hair is curly and takes forever to cut, blow dry and straighten.  Stylists take their time, are excellent and are also friendly. The prices are fair.  Cards are accepted, but tip cannot be added to your card, remember some cash.  I would recommend this salon to friends and family.
