I wanted to choose a bank that mostly deals with Arizona and read the reviews on here about MidFirst Bank and it sounded like what my husband and I were looking for.\nWOW! We were very impressed by the bank when we arrived and found ourselves actually enjoying opening an account and Adrian Erivez. Not only did he greet us but he made us feel very much at ease and comfortable about being there. He not only gave us information on the bank itself but advised us on all the services they provide.\nWhat struck me the most was that this is how banks used to be. Open and friendly yet business like and not at all like the \"big\" banks out there. \nThe tellers welcome you and really enjoy being there. We were offered cold bottled water which was greatly welcomed since it was a HOT day.\nWe want to see the other branch locations since Adrian let us know how nice alot of them are as well as from what I've read here.\nThis is the bank you might want to consider if you're tired of the mega banks.
