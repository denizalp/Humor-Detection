This show was a slight up grad from a high school musical. Yes the girls are topless, but after ten minutes who cares. The show has no substance and the storyline is stupid. I did like the domestic violence scene where the guy almost chokes the girl.  The music is good, and not one song is sung. It is all lip singing.  There are way better show in Vegas to go see. Don't wast your time. This is why you got ride of Raiding the Rock Vault.
