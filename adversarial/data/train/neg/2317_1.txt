Zhana at the bar was so sweet! Recommended great wines to go along with our meal, a great white to go along with our octopus appetizer and an amazing red to go with the lamb chops. Both Were so. Good. and made a fabulous espresso martini to go with our baklava dessert. We recommend Milos to all of our friends. Great fish menu and red meat as well. Definitely returning. Amazing food and service. Try the malagousia wine!
