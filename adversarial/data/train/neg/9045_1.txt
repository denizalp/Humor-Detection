Stephanie was extremely helpful! I really appreciate her taking the time to help me find the style of shoe I was looking for, being that I'm kind of an indecisive customer sometimes. She also helped me find the right size in each style of shoe and brought out several in order for me to find the perfect fit. She was so patient, honest and down to earth. We had a nice chat after finding out our favorite tv show is the same :) \n\nI was greeted and felt welcome here from the moment I walked into the store. They had a few items I liked that were out of stock but she offered to look them up at other locations and also gave me the option of having them shipped to me from a different location out of state. I ended up picking a shoe that was in stock. I also got a few of the nail polishes and they pretty much had all the colors in stock of those. The store had a good mix of classics and new\/seasonal stuff on display. The department stores that sell them are not as good with knowing how the brand runs in terms of sizes from shoe to shoe. I've also noticed the department stores have the classics out of stock quite a bit in my size. Buying these online without really knowing how each shoe will run is difficult, I speak from experience since my husband ordered a pair on Net-a-Porter and we could never find the right fit. \n\nSince we don't have a store nearby in San Diego, I will probably wait to go to Vegas and go back here to buy my Louboutin's from this point forward especially since it's the hotel we stay in (Palazzo). I was extremely satisfied with my purchase due to the superior customer service and variety I had to choose from. Thanks Stephanie and Monica the other sales associate was nice too!
