We were picky out-of-town buyers. During the search process...that stretched for months...our goals changed substantially. We ended up looking for a very specific property in a limited geographic area. Mark Wyant of the Bill Olmstead team not only tolerated all of these challenges, but remained committed and ultimately found us the perfect home. During and after the purchase, Mark, Bill, Kendra, and the entire team were supportive and provided valuable guidance. All of this resulted in a great outcome, and we very satisfied.
