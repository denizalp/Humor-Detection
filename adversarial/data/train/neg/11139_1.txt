Last I checked a BISCUIT was NOT a Mcgriddle. Had to get back into my car drive all the way back because your employee couldn't get a one item order right... McDonald's wouldn't have such a bad rep if you guys focused on hiring GOOD, Well dressed, well educated employee's. Look at In and Out... fast food, good employee's, AND GOOD SERVICE
