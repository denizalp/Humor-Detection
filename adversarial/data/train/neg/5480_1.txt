I have not reviewed any place on yelp before, but felt this place deserved it. Seeing the two other people who have posted negatively about their experience at this venue last night reinforced my decision.\n\nTerrible bar service, even when it was slow. Got blatantly ignored several times by bartenders who were hanging out with their friends instead of working. Finally got the drinks and they were a bad pour.\n\nREFUSED TO SERVE WATER. Was shocked. Who does that?!?\n\nWill not return, nor will my friends...
