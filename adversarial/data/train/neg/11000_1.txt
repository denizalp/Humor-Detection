We went to Pickart & Son to have a second opinion  for a leaky radiator. The other place said we needed a new radiator, thermostat and hoses costing $850 for repairs. Pickart found the hoses to be loose and worn. We brought in our own hoses and was charged only $80 for repairs.\nPickart & son is a fast, reliable and honest shop.
