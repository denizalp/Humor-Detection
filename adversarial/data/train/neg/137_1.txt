This was my second visit and I must say I was pleased overall. The staff is very nice and the atmosphere is full of energy, although it can be a bit loud and hard to have a conversation without having to raise your voice. The food was delicious! I got the beef burger with the shredded pork on top!! I love meat so it was perfect and the fries were nice and hot. My major complaint is that I'm a big chocolate dessert lover and so was my lunch date. Unfortunately there's NO chocolate cake, pie, torte or brownie on the menu, only variations of caramelized bananas with the exception of these deep fried mini puffs that come with a side of chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce that the manager suggested. It was okay but didn't hit the mark of what we were wanting.
