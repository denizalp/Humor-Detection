One of my favorite breakfast spots. I love their scrambles but my favorite thing is the warm coffee cake. The piece is pretty big so I usually share with on of my daughters. \n\nService is always excellent. But it's a busy place so be prepared to wait. The portions are smaller than egg works but still a good size
