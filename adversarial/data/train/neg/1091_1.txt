Have played several times this year.  Conditions seems to have deteriorated.  Some of it could be the really wet spring, some just a lack of attention to detail.  So many bunkers are declared 'ground under repair' and others are just in terrible condition.  I really want to like this course, layout is best in Geauga County, but it is regressing.  Played on a Sunday morning (Mother's Day) and had the place to ourselves.  Can this course survive?\n\nPlayed on July 4th.  Would say that conditions have improved significantly.  Bunkers have all been cleaned and new sand.  Fairways were in very good conditon and pace of play was good.  Course was as crowded as I have seen it quite awhile.  Much more upbeat about the course and it's future than I have been recently.
