Service: good\n\nDecor:  A serious diner setting.  \n\nFood:  Good.   Breakfast foods and burgers\/poutine.\n\nReview:  Being a Yonge street it was a bit hard to find parking, but then again it is hard to find on Yonge anywhere.  The food was good but it felt a bit  \"gimmicky\".  I felt like you were buying into the \"diner\" atmosphere more so than the food.  Personally, I go to restaurants for good value food, not the atmosphere.\n\nReason for stars:  I felt like it was too \"gimmicky\" for me.  The food was good but I felt like I was paying for the \"scene\" and not so much the food.  It reminded me of a \"Wimpy's\".
