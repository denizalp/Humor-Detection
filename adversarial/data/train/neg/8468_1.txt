Good Asian food that is more authentic than you would expect for being in the Venetian Casino. The prices are all around $15 and the food is good but not amazing or anything. We went because the lines for other restaurants were really long. Luckily there was no wait here. My main complaint was the poor service. I had to show my hostess where an open table was while she looked around for a few minutes also I had to ask 6 times for water. It took me asking the manager for me to finally get water halfway through my meal.
