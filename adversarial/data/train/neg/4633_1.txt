We recently met a couple friends for dinner at Casa Rasta on a Friday night. We did not make reservations so we decided to eat outside rather than at the bar (which is now used for seating only as they are BYOB). Everything was going well until it started to rain and we had to attempt to sit a toddler with us at the bar. Make reservations.\nWe started with the chips and guac. I loved that the guac had a nice heat\/kick to it. Most guac tends to be bland. I also tried the avocado fries but they were not for me. The creaminess of fried avocado was not a pleasant texture for me though, others at the table liked it. For my entree, I got the flautas. Spicy chicken and onions wrapped in crispy corn shells topped with more guac and onions. The meal came with a side if rice and beans. Overall, I enjoyed the meal. The flautas were tasty but very small for an entree. Other entrees ordered at our table were much larger and contained more meat\/fish.
