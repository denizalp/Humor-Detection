This place is cool but food and service sucks. I've been a few times and food was horrible. First time got fried chicken salad.. Chicken came out cold. Second a bunch of apps. Fried tomatoes, don't have any flavor. Nachos we ordered without pork and came with it. Chicken tenders were what you expect anywhere. I can't imagine returning other than to drink.
