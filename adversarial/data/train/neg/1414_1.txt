Went yesterday (Thursday night) for AYCE. \n\nPrice-wise, it's quite expensive for a weekday. The servers were decent, cleared our plates quickly and served water\/tea efficiently.\n\nThe salmon sashimi was not the freshest, it was just ok. I liked the brown-rice option for 5-6 of their maki rolls, however, if you prefer brown rice for their other rolls, it will cost you extra.\n\nAlso worth mentioning, they don't offer all of their maki rolls from their regular menu on their AYCE menu.\n\nTeriyaki beef and salmon were both quite bland. Oh, don't order the eggplant teriyaki, it was just a lump of tasteless mess.\n\nThis was my first time going to Echo Sushi, and it will be my last. There are better AYCE sushi restaurants out there.
