Asia Tea House is super conveniently located- I'd come here all the time, even if the food wasn't good. The spring rolls and vegetarian tofu is always top notch. The veggies are cooked well and the portions are huge. I love trying all the different bubble teas here. \n\nThe only word of caution I have is that the General Tso's tofu here just flat out isn't General Tso's. It's honestly just watery nonsense, so if you're going for tofu, get the vegetarian tofu instead.
