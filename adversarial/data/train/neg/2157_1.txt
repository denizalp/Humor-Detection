Was excited to try this place after reading the reviews. In town on business and didn't feel like sitting down so popped in here for takeout. I got a large chicken burrito with everything + guac. The chicken was shredded and flavorless (I was half expecting pollo asado- may bad for the assumption) the entire burritos lacked flavor and I can't be sure the guac was even in it. I was also confused by the ordering. Two POS directly as you walk up, you order there then 2 mins later they call your number to ask you what you want in the burrito. Then you sit back down and wait to be called when finished - why wouldn't you just confirm what you wanted when you ordered instead of walking away and being called back up?
