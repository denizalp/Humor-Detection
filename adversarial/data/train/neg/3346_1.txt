Great breakfast panini van\/cart on Banksville Road in the parking lot of Sonny & Jo's.  The panini's are sold out of the City Oven food stall van.  You drive up to the side of the van, order and receive your breakfast panini through the van window, all while staying in your car.  This is a side business for the City Oven restaurant across the street on Banksville Road.  This cart only sells paninis, both sausage and bacon, and they only accept cash.  The sausage, egg, and cheese panini is $3.25 (total with tax), and $3.00 (includes tax) for the bacon, egg and cheese panini.  Additionally, they sell La Prima Coffee.  \n\nThis is a great way to grab a very tasty breakfast sandwich during the M-F morning hours.  The paninis are a great size, not greasy, and have a good proportion of egg, cheese (& meat).  This cart is not affiliated with Sonny & Jo's whatsoever, but uses their parking lot during the morning hours to allow for super convenient in & out traffic while going northbound down Banksville towards downtown.  \n\nStop and try!
