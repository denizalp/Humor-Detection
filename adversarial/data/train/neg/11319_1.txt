My girlfriend and I just ate here. Sure, it's overpriced and not the most delicious food in the world, but the kindness of the staff is really out of this world. The manager is awesome and greets you with a smile and makes you feel warm and welcome and the servers are kind, which really counts for a lot. We'll be back!
