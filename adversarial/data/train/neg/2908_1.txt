Yup. Loved it.  Went with my meat-loving bf (I'm a vegetarian) and he loved it as well.  We got the Kanapki (favorite) and the Cykoria (also good but not nearly as good as the Kanapki).  The Salatka (the only salad on the menu) was the only item we considered not worth it, because it was just a salad of mixed greens with what appeared to be a few pieces of pickled potatoes.  The menu said it had shallots and apple but the dish we got didn't have those (unless that was like infused into the dressing or something?) also the salad's dressing was so spicy that we couldn't really eat it, I'm huge on spice but that amount of spice just concentrated on mixed greens wasn't great.  We also got the pierogies which were amazing.  My boyfriend got a cocktail with tequila and citrus and he loved it, I tried it as well and thought it was awesome. \n\nOverall would highly recommend to meat eaters and vegs alike, with the particular standouts of the meal being the Kanapki and the pierogies.  The only disappointment was the Salatka which I would not recommend due to the spice as well as the disappointing lack of ingredients considering it is nearly the same price as other much more complicated and hearty items on the menu.  Will definitely return.  \n\nAmbiance is chill and casual cool.  Wait staff was very nice and attentive.  You order your food and then get a number and sit wherever you want and then the food comes to you that way, you don't have like a waiter to yourself.  This wasn't a problem and actually I liked it.
