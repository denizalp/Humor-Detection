I have no idea how I lived here so long and have never eaten at this location. It seems sacrilegious. I even worked at the Pointe when it was located at South Mountain for many years and still never went to this Phoenix staple. I was determined to go today since I had an event nearby.\n   If you like Tex Mex then you might not agree with my three stars and I say go ahead and give it 4 or 5 stars- probably one of the better ones in town. Wow, they even won a Zagat. I'm impressed. \n\nPros- \n\n*Spicy-- Yum\n*Chile Rellenos- Huge meal for A La Carte, but that could be a con- too much food. They were tasting okay. Spicy yes but you could still taste the ingredients. That can be a trick in itself to get it right.\n*Great salsa\/hot sauce- I did not find this salsa very hot though, weird. I liked the salsa a lot. I worked at a lot of Mexican restaurants in my day and I am picky in this regard.\n*Guacamole is not that bad for a Tex Mex restaurant. Not the best but good. \n*Wonderful funky decor. It is like a mini Mexican village. Very eclectic. \n*Carlos is amazing!\n* I liked that they serve water in actual beer glasses and left me an entire pitcher of water for myself. It was very hot today and their food is pretty spicy. \n* Their bathrooms are cool. \n\nCons- \n* The door was locked or hard to open when I got there. Good thing I called and did not leave. Since I was the only one there at the time I thought they were closed. \n*the girl who sat me and first served me was not very friendly\n*far away in the middle of nowhere, at least for me. \n*very spicy if you are a lightweight. lol I am not but if you are, beware. Please, ask the server what you should order instead. I overheard him tell others they do have mild choices. \n* I found this restaurant to be very expensive browsing the menu. \n\nI asked about the gift shop and Carlos laughed at me. He then told me it was closed 14 years ago. I swear I read somewhere they had a gift shop. Oh well. Ha-ha to me. The birthday gift has to be purchased elsewhere, \"friend who will remain nameless for now.\"
