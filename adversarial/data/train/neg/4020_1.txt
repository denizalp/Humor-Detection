I love this place. If you register on their site you can get a freebie for your Birthday! The boutique is really cool, I always find nice clothes or jewelry to buy. The place is extremely clean and the nail technicians are great. It is always a nice experience. They have a movie playing most times and that is fun too. The salon is set up with cushion seating and is very comfortable. Then there is a bar setup too!
