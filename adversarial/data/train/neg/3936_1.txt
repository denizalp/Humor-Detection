Before I ate here I didn't like Mexican food but this restaurant has completely changed my mind. This is the best Mexican food I have ever eaten in my life. This place will turn anyone on to mexican food for sure. It is delicious and you get so much food for a very very low price. \n\nI loved the steak fajita and the california burrito was also really yummy and unique. The churro dessert was very good as well. They also provide you with so many complimentary appetizers like fresh tortilla chips with multiple dips and they will give refills on chips or dips. We refilled our refried bean dip about 3 times because it was so delicious. They also provide a complimentary soup which was reminiscent of noodle soup with chicken broth. We went home with full bellies and lots of leftovers. \n\nThe service here was amazing. We came in 7pm on a monday and it was packed with a 25 minute wait. Somehow we were seated in only 5 minutes and our servers came by very frequently always refilling our drinks and dip and chips. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place & I would love to come back again.
