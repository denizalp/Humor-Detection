I brought my dog Smokey in to get microchipped and have her vaccinations brought up to date and the experience couldn't have been better. The office is very clean and the lobby is huge which is always a plus at the vet. Everyone at the front was very nice and more importantly the dr was wonderful. She was great with my pet and I really liked the way she explained things to me. I called around before choosing a clinic and homeward bound saved me a lot of money. I will definitely be recommending them to friends and family.
