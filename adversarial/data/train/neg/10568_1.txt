I live right down the street and would love to go to Bradshaws for convenience but the food selection is so bad and mixed drinks always taste bad I never go anymore. Too many times being disappointed and saying to myself \"never again\". There aren't any healthy options, no decent salads, just greasy bar food. There isn't even any pasta. I get beer to be safe because the drinks always taste weird and like they weren't made right. They have good bands though so that keeps people coming in spite of the food\/drinks.
