Been here during the day and it's open but if you come after midnight, chances are they're closed. I've been here 3x in the past week and they've been closed. It's not a holiday and it's not even a weekend that I come on. If you're not going to be 24\/7 then don't claim you're 24\/7. The McDonald's on University and McClintock are at least open 24\/7 but they start breakfast at 3am for any late goers like myself that just wanted fries.
