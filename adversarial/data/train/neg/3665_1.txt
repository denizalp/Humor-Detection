It's tough to give an awesome restaurant like this only one star. They have great food but their terrible service kills the experience. My boyfriend and I have gone here a handful of times and keep giving it the benefit of the doubt but we wait at least 15 min before our order is taken and our waiters never come back to check on us after dropping off our food. They aren't the most pleasant people either. Multiple times we have gotten up from our seats after waiting for our server to come over and just walked out. All of the servers see us sitting there but don't bother to acknowledge us. I've never been to an establishment like this before. We only go on Sunday's now for Brunch & sit up at the bar. The bartender is awesome & makes a mean mimosa!!
