I've ordered here twice so, totaling 6 or so items. You couldn't ask for better Thai delivery. Very nice sized portions with great flavor. When you ask for hot you get hot! The crab wontons and pad Thai will be in my regular rotation. Don't hesitate when it tells you 45-60 minutes, both times have been delivered in under 30 minutes. I've gotten the same guy both times as well who is very nice and polite. Keep up the good work over there guys you've earned a regular customer!
