Sneaky fees! Everything looks like deal when your reserve and prepay for your car online. Then you get to the renting dealership and it ends up costing you 3 times more the original price. A car that I thought was going to cost me around 160 ended up around $455. with all the hidden fees!!!Unfortunately I was on a schedule and wasn't going to spend anymore time looking for another car rental. I was forced to except the price and get my day going. I should of looked at everyone's reviews before I booked.
