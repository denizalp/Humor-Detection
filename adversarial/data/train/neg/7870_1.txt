I have my go to Chinese\/Cantonese's restaurants that have never failed me....tonight I decided to try a new spot..... Big mistake. \nLemon chicken was extremely dry, even with sauce. \nBeef and broccoli, tasteless. \nCantonese noodles was on par with the rest of the meal.....tasteless.\nOverall overpriced and plain. \nDon't waste your $$$.
