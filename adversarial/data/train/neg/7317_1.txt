I live in Dilworth and have been a client of Leah's for over 2 years. I can't find any excuse to go somewhere else. \n\nI recommend Leah to everyone I meet-- because of her, I get compliments on my skin daily and run out of her business cards monthly. I love her location, professionalism, products and most of all knowledge about skincare.
