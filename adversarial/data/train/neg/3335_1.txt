Despite being leery of any place that calls itself an \"eatery\", I have been to Combine twice now (with 2 and 3 people) and ordered different items each time. Sad to say it's hit and miss with nothing in between: either wonderful fresh flavours, or utterly bland. Decor is also lacking flavour. Gotta say if you're depending on a hot sauce for flavour then the food is not doing its job. Also: what's with the pepper mill pushing in a Mex-ish restaurant??? ...another signal that Combine doesn't stand behind their flavours.
