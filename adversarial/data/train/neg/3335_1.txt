The food was ok not the best I was not super impressed. The variety of food was there but it was not fresh. The fried chicken was hard. The Asian section was below average and the scampi shrimp that was advertised was not that of something scampi but more like butter and cream with pre-cooked baby shrimp I was not a fan but will give them a second chance.
