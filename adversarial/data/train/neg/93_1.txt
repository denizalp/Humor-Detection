Poor quality food, cook does not seem to care what they made, and bad service. I went there twice, the first time I ordered non spicy version of tilapia and the waiter acknowledged my request for NON SPICY, but in the end they still bring a spicy dish. When I asked, they said they did not have non spicy version. Then why they did not mention it when I order? Second time I went there, they served cashew chicken with one big piece of chicken that is still raw and cold. It seems that the cook just did not even look at when he is cooking. And the waiter is very rude and just say it is very normal to have such things. I never eat there again.
