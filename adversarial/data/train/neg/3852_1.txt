It's nice to have Taco Y Taco on Eastern. The restaurant is so clean and the service is good. The food is very fresh and I liked the ingredients they use. However, the portion size of the tacos are so tiny for the price. I sometimes go to Roberto's, and the tacos are packed with meat and ingredients for about the same price. I also found Roberto's taco's tastier because of the seasoning they use on the meat. However, I still like Taco Y Taco because they're tacos are a bit different from typical tacos and are very fresh.
