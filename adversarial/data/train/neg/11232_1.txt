Very affordable~about 5$ a taco, and it's a big serving. I only needed one to be satisfied. Not for people who have a low tolerance for spicy!! The service is lackluster but the concept is hardly a restaurant--it's more of a counter\/take away service, even though there are tables. The decor is cheeky and a bit kitschy. Good for a quick bite, not so much for a first date.
