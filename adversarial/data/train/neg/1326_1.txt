Strolled into this eclectic trendy restaurant on Mother's Day before the Nashville concert. My husband and my daughter were with me and we were seated right away. Our waiter was helpful and cheerful. I noticed the wait staff all had sleeves if tattoos and skinny jeans. They were out of fish and chips so I ended up getting a burger. It is build your own and it was very good! But my favorite was the pretzel bread with cheese fondue, so addicting  had a bacon Bloody Mary to go with and caught a little buzz. It was the mild version but woo, did it have some kick!! The cost was reasonable, and the overall vibe of the restaurant was worth it. We had a great time
