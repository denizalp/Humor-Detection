Disclaimer: I think I've been to too many AYCE sushi restaurants that if a space only offers standard items on their menu it's getting a mediocre rating in my eyes\n\nAt Sushi Kui you order off of a list of items on the paper. Unfortunately they don't include any pictures of any of the items, but some of them do tell you how many pieces is in a serving. \n\nI went for weekend lunch, which was $15 a person, you could also opt for the more expensive dinner menu for $25 at lunch as well. Most of their foods are alright, nothing stood out in particular for me. Though I gotta point out that they don't use the proper round sushi rice to make their nigiri and rolls. The rice they end up using is kinda rough and feels undercooked. Portions wise I'm not a big fan of how little fish they give you on the rolls, it's basically just eating a chunk of rice with some cucumber and avocado. \n\nBtw if you order enough items they might serve you in a boat, which is a really touch that I don't usually see at many other AYCE sushi restaurants.\n\nI probably wouldn't come back again, but for anyone looking for a decently priced AYCE sushi restaurant this place isn't too bad...Didn't get an upset stomach afterwards, which is a plus :P
