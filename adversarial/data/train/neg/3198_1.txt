I saw this place featured on a food show initially, which was located in the Midwest.  Then I saw a write up in AZ Central or some new source about a month later.  It's not that far from my house and had been meaning to stop off and try.  Checked out some of the reviews on here.  Well, today was the day.  I had the day off and wanted to try them while they had a nice selection (based on some of the reviews stating that they don't have a full selection later in the day\/evening).  Upon entering the surprisingly large dine-in area, you are immediately drawn to their display case.  There is a large selection nicely decorated creative pastries (donuts).  Naturally, I wanted them all; however, the reality of a \"sugar coma\" would follow shortly, if I did.  The gentleman behind the counter was very patient as I looked in awe of the selections.  Once I was ready, he was there ready and willing to bag my selections.  I don't recall his name, but he was very courteous and friendly.  I opted for the maple bacon bar, red velvet w\/cream cheese frosting & the Bavarian Crème.  Just note, the Bavarian crème, seems safe, but I noticed that it is larger than most other shops offer.  Instead of eating immediately, I did bring them home, so I could enjoy one as afternoon treat.  Well, it was a treat, I ate the Bavarian crème one and it was definitely a cut above the rest of the shops in the valley so far.  The chocolate that topped the donut was different, it seemed thicker and more \"chocolatey\" than others and it pretty much surround the donut, including the sides.  The crème was more of a custard\/pudding consistency which is nice.  Some places are more loose\/runny.  I will definitely go back to try other flavors\/types.
