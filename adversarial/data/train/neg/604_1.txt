The WORST experience. A worker named Jasmine was extremely rude to my family and I. She cursed out my sister and smacked her fist against her hand when we walked away. All of this because SHE handed us the wrong size soda and we corrected her. When we confronted her she lied and said she was the manager and insisted that my sister \"was rude first\". Another worker then tried to make us believe he was the manager and when we asked for a business card from corporate, they gave us a post-it with a random number written down. Save your money and go elsewhere to not have to deal with such ignorant and immature workers.
