Ate at the Arrogant Butcher for dinner. Service was excellent.  However, it too so long to get our drinks we were done with dinner.  Had their famous salted carmel pudding - yuck.  Waited 10 minutes for a cold premaid dessert that was so salty we couldn't eat it. Thank goodness the whip cream was good.  Overall a good dinner but expect more for the price.
