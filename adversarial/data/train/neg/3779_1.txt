We ordered takeout pizza from Il Bosco after reading the Yelp reviews. My pizza had a burnt bottom...like it was dusted in flour and then burned. It ruined the whole thing. The sausage was just fair. My husband's pizza was soggy and \"wet\" as he called it and he said it was one of the worst pizzas he has eaten. We so wanted to like this place--the patio and interior were charming. Still, food is what makes the rating for us and this hardly deserved even the 2 stars.
