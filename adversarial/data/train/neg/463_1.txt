I moved in a week ago, and I have been blown away with the genuine hospitality of Alpha, Hailey and Justin. They have all been unbelievably helpful  with all move-in questions and making sure everything is perfect for us. I have needed maintenance help with two small issues (if I were handy at all, I'm sure I could have done it myself) and Justin has been here within the hour to lend a helping hand. Both times, he has fixed the problem in under 5 minutes and always asks if there's anything else I need help with.\n\nAside from the beautiful apartment\/facilities and great location, the staff here has been, hands down, some of the best I have dealt with. I am so excited that I chose to live here.
