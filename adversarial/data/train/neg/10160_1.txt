This is about 5 min away from my house so I always stop here. And every time I go they never fail to disappoint me. Today I ordered 4 cheese burgers 1 large fry and 2 drinks. I had to wait 20!!!! Min for FRYS?!!!! Ohh and guess what THEY GAVE MY ORDER TO THE OTHER PARKED CAR!!!! had to wait 10 more min and was given 2 EXTRA DRY OLD PIES as a compensation. PLEASE READ THESE REVIEWS! they state nothing but the truth! Horrible service and food because when I got home guess what?! The burgers were cold and the bread was dry!!!!! If there is another McDonald's close to where you are headed please go there and skip his location! They will waste your time!!!
