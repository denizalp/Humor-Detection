Bought a pre owned vehicle two weeks ago. Was promised that the tire pressure light was going to be taken care of. 4 visits later and still not being able to fix the issue. Today will be the 5th time they look at it. Good thing is this time i dont have to drive 45 minutes back and forth to drop off the car, they will pick it up. \n\nI want to give this place 5 stars because they are a good dealer but this situation is becoming extremely aggravating. \n\nPs - will update my review if this issue ever gets fixed. Its definitely been a sour experience.
