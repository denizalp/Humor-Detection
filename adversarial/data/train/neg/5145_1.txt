I brought my vehicle in at 10:00am on Saturday for an oil change, alignment & tire quote.   They said they were busy but would have the work completed by the afternoon.   I reviewed their quote and saw they offered to provide a lower grade tire that was more expensive than Discount Tire.   I decided to go with tires from Discount.\n\nPep Boys ended up just completing an oil change and when they returned my vehicle, it was at the end of the day.   They did not do the alignment because my tire was too damaged.  At this point Discount Tire was closed until Monday.   \n\nI wish they would have told me about the tire issue instead of having me waste a Saturday.   An oil change takes 20 minutes and the vehicle was in their possession for around 7 hours.  I could have gotten the tires put on first or made some other arrangements.   \n\nThe lack of communication and excessive amount of time for the work done has severely inconvenienced me for the work week.   Now I will go somewhere else to get the work done.  I do not plan on returning.
