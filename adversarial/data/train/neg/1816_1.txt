We were not planning on having dinner at this casual restaurant, but our plans changed and it was convenient to where we were staying.  I ordered macaroni el forno, a dish recently touted by restaurant reviewer Max Jacobson, as my entree while my wife chose the chicken marsala. Both entrees included fresh garden salads that were enhanced by house made dressings. My entree, similar to lasagna sans the ricotta, was accompanied by a flavorless Parmesan cream sauce. The pasta was layered with a meat sauce that proved to be little more than an under seasoned ground beef mixture. My wife fared no better with her over sauced and overcooked chicken marsala.
