Great foodie place in Broadview Heights. Who would have thought such great restaurants existed outside Cleveland?\n\nDrinks were great. Tried the Stellar which is a foamy peach vodka drink. Delicious--couldn't even taste the vodka. Also tried another drink which was just whiskey and ginger beer, which was made perfectly.\n\nEveryone is served pumpernickel bread with spinach dip--a nice change from usually getting bread and butter.\n\nWe started off with chicken and waffles and the Reuben ribs. The chicken and waffles is served with a spicy butter. The syrup compliments this very well. The Reuben ribs were awesome and would definitely recommend.\n\nSplit the pork paprikash as our entree. Very delicious.\n\nHad a deep fried brownie for dessert. Interesting taste. I wish they had a better dessert selection.\n\nOur server was great.\n\nThe decor is pretty bad but I wasn't expecting anything super trendy.\n\nWould definitely go again!
