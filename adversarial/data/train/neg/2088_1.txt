I made an appointment to completely change my color - dark brown to red, which was a first time change for me.  I was lucky to find Jody, who did a fabulous job!!  Jody even called me  to explain the process before I went in and was very knowledgeable about what was needed.  Jody was so detailed and took her time in ensuring my hair color was exactly the right shade and she gave me a great cut as well.  I recommend Jody and anyone else here!! I've been in Phoenix for 7 years and have finally found a great stylist!!!
