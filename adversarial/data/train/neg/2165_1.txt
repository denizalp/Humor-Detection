Stopped in for lunch got seated quickly. Server was nice and helpful at first but only brought 4 rolls even though there was 5 of us... He didn't even bring anymore rolls until half way through our meal upon request... The drinks were always full which was a plus but we had to call him over several times to get condiments. He would drop the drinks off and would be gone before we could ask for condiments. The steaks were not cooked the way we ordered and were actually more on the raw side... Had to be sent back because they were too red. I've been here before and it was pretty good just must have been an off day.
