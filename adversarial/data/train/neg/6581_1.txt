We eat here at least once a week. Zucchini and Turtle Soup are the same as we remember from the original Carmody's. French Dip is my favorite! Actually, everything that we have ordered so far is excellent! Nice atmosphere and very clean! Everyone from the greeters to the owners are always friendly and make us feel at home. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to unwind.
