We had a bad experience at the restaurant. We ordered fried rice and their country curry; the fried rice came out 10 minutes before the curry and it got cold, the servers did not check up on us to inform us about our curry dish or even help to improve our experience, and the country curry was not prepared up to its usual standard. As we were leaving the restaurant, the owner was standing at the register and counting cash, and he did not acknowledge our complaints. There are better Thai restaurants all around town that maintain a standard of service and this restaurant did not have it.
