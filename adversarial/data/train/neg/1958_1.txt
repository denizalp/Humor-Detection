It was truly an amazing experience. To be able to only use 4 of our senses - touch, smell, hear, and taste. After our meal, the moment we stepped back out I actually felt thankful that I can see. \n\nI felt adventurous so I ordered surprise everything (appetizer, main dish, and dessert). It was quite interesting trying to figure out where my food was. I fumbled around and probably dropped food on the table without realizing. I had to feel for my cup of water and napkin. Which wasn't too too bad. The food was only decent, but hey.. I didn't come here for the food. I came here for the experience. Instead of \"eating\" my food, I was \"tasting\" it. \n\nThe service was marvellous and the place was very nicely decorated (can't say for the inside though lol).\n\nI would definitely recommend O.Noir.
