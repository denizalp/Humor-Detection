The place is way overpriced for What i got. I understand that theyre located right in the middle of downtown but the food was really just average. I tried the Volcano, which just had brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream on the side. Took me less than 5 minz to finish because the brownie had coconut and some other stuff in it (I hate coconut) and the ice cream serving was just small. I gave an extra star for the fast service and the really nice presentation, because first when you look at the plate first, mouth starts watering automatically. BUT, definitely was not worth 7-8$ that i paid excluding taxes. \n\nTip: only come here when you're in downtown with no where else to go..... and with big $$s to spare
