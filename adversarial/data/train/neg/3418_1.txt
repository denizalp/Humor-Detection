I ordered a to-go Southwest Chicken salad from here. I ended up pulling out basically an entire stem with flowers coming off of it that was meant to be my greens I guess (flowers?? what??? I get that they're greens, but at least trim off the flowers), avocado skin, and the black bean and corn salsa were crunchy. I'm willing to give this place another try, but I doubt I will try this entree again. The people who I picked up my order from were very kind, and the place seemed clean, at least.
