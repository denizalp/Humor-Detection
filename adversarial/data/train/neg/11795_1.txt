Softmoc has a decent selection of \"functional\" shoes - winter boots, Uggs, \"sensible\" work dress shoes.  They generally have some pretty good prices and a range of brands including their own Softmoc brand, Merrell, Clarks, Sorel, Franco Sarto, etc.  If they don't have your size in the store, they can usually find it in another location for you.  The service is decent - not overbearing or pushy.\n\nWord to the wise though - I would caution against signing up for Club Softmoc.  I don't know what it is about all of these stores that get your e-mail address and send you an e-mail EVERY SINGLE DAY.  If you aren't interested in daily e-mails, I'd recommend declining or unsubscribing.
