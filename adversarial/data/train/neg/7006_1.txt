My husband recently ordered my birthday cake from this bakery.  It was beautifully decorated, but very dry.  While the taste was good, it really needed moisture.  Since it was an almond flavored cake, we poured some amaretto on the cake to solve the moisture problem.  It was very good with that addition.
