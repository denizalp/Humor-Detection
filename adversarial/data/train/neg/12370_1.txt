I came in to the office 10-16-17 I was in pain and I was a walk in. They didn't take full X-rays I think because of my insurance over the phone the girls told me in's may cover what I needed and I told her what I needed. Waited about 4 hours to tell me Insurance won't cover it. I was so up I'm in pain and they waisted my time because I could have paid somewhere else cheaper I only went because they told me the insurance would cover it. Make sure you have an appointment when you go in. Expect to be there for a while. Depending on your insurance they will prioritize.
