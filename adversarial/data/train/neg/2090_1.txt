Amazing burger place!! Honestly I can't tell the difference between the regular fresh burger and the prime version, they're both so delicious to me! Their burgers are super fresh just like their name - buns are crispy on the outside but soft oh the inside, patties aren't drenched in oil and make the whole bun soggy, lettuces are fresh and crispy, and oh boy their burger sauce is amazing. Very friendly staff and is always very clean inside. Remember to pay extra to get their hamburger sauce on the side - they're heavenly as fries dip and extra burger sauce!!
