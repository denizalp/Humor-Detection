My first time trying a bahn mi from anywhere and it was delicious! \n\nThis place is amazing, great customer service, and really good variety of tea options. \n\nI ordered the lemon grass chicken bahn mi and lychee tea with passion fruit jellies and both tasted great. Just be aware that there are fresh jalape√±os on the sandwiches so if you don't like spicy i advise to ask for it without the peppers.
