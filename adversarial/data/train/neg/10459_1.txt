Lana is simply amazing! I would recommend her to absolutely anyone and everyone who need an alteration done, especially for bridal. I called up Lana one day at the recommendation of the shop where I bought a lovely yet intricately beaded body suit for my wedding (Lovely Bride, which I would also recommend), and Lana was SO nice and accommodating when I spoke with her. She was willing to have us meet her at her shop outside or her posted hours and just really made me comfortable and excited to work with her.\n\nLana exceeded my expectations! All of her alterations were completely hidden (this is a nude\/mostly see through and completely beaded body suit, so no easy task), plus she came up with a way entirely on her own to take the weight my boobs off my shoulders by inserting a hidden strap inside. It worked like a CHARM and my shoulders were no longer red from the straps. I got my bodysuit back several weeks before my wedding so I had ample time, and what she charged me was so reasonable compared to other places I was shocked and so happy!\n\nI plan on bringing all of my alterations to Lana. She's a gem, you will not regret working with her!  Thank you Lana!
