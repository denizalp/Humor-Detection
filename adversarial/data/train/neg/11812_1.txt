Great place the staff was very helpfull and friendly.  This is the perfect daytime beach party in Vegas and if you can do the cabana service then go for it because it just takes the party up another notch.  Even without having a personal cabana this is a must see place in Vegas the people are nothing short of beautiful and the DJ keeps the party going to the extreme with hot tracks.\nJust be careful though keep your personals close or  locked in your cabana safe as in close and lock the safe because some of the staff are known to have sticky fingers.
