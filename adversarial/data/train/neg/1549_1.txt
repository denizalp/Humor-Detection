My first visit to Snakes & Lattes was on a Tuesday around 1:30 pm.  The place was pretty empty when we got there...didn't have to wait for a table.  Friendly, welcoming staff, explained to us how it all works.\n\nMy friend and I looked through the tons of board games and decided on Quirkle.  Just as we were about to read the instructions as staff member came up to our table and asked us if we wanted him to show us how to play the game.  \n\nThese thoughts started running through my head...\"Who is this weird guy, who's just set his latte on our table?\"...\"Mind your own business\"...\"Get your own game\":...then I realized, he works here and I'm being horribly anti-social(residual subway forcefield)...\"this will save us time if he just tells us how this game works\".  Fun game, no complicated rules.\n\nI think the guy that sat us at our table told us there was table service, but no one came by our table to see if we wanted anything.   Not a big deal.  We walked up to the counter to place our order and they brought it to our table.  I had a sandwich, nothing too exciting, but was ok.  Almond latte was excellent.\n\nWe left around 4:00pm.  Started to get busier with all the uni kids coming in.  We had to wait a bit to settle up as the girl at the cash was explaining the reservation poicy to seomeone over the phone.  She apologized for making us wait.\n\nWould definitely go back again.
