I'm not sure when this opened, but I noticed this gorgeous store today while at Yorkdale.  It's basically a home d√©cor store by Zara.  They sell stuff like bedding, linens, dishes, cutlery, rugs, cool cabinet knobs, candles, etc.  \n\nThey also sell various styles of slippers and limited 'Zara Home' clothing, but most of it looks like they can be worn on an everyday basis.\n\nHalf the store had sales stickers on the merchandise so I wished that I actually needed to buy something!
