Service was faster than some of the other (but better) Indian restaurants I have been to in the area. The food was so-so. Nothing special. I enjoy spicy Indian food, but the \"hot\" was not. The only reason we ate there was the buy one get one free in the Phoenix area coupon book... no that, was a good value.
