When I have my Asian snack craving this is the spot for me.  Prices are average but they don't carry much of the snacks I like, however, I can get easily carried away.  \n\nThey do have a food court and several other shops that carry clothing, makeup, and the like.  I mostly go to the food court, especially, for lunch.  The prices are fairly reasonable and to my surprise pretty good.  \n\nParking is ample making it easy.
