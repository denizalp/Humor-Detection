It's a great deal for the price .  I got the original Batter waffle covered in strawberries with some whipped cream and powder sugar for only 5.00.  You can't beat the price .  The only thing that I was disappointed in was how long it took to get my order especially considering I was the only one in the store on a Saturday afternoon around 3.  The staff was very kind.  I was bothered that it took so long.  I also realize it's the middle of the summer here on Las Vegas so it's hard to control the temperature of your businesses.  I was sweating in the store waiting for my order to go.  Great food, great prices and slow service this visit.
