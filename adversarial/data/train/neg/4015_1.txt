I have walked by this place for almost a year and never even thought about going in to try it until I saw a picture of a couple of the ice cream sandwiches from here on the Offline app. The one picture I saw was of a strawberry shortcake ice cream sandwich, and then I knew I had to give this place a try. I'm so glad I did!\n\nI recently had a friend in town so it gave me the perfect reason to try something local and new, and who doesn't love ice cream. We went in around 9pm, and business was boomin! The weather was beautiful, so lots of people were out and about, and the place had good vibes. My friend tried one of their donut ice cream sandwiches, and it looked delicious! I ended up trying one of the R U Cereal macaroon ice cream sandwiches, because I couldn't pass up the opportunity to have ice cream and lucky charms! Both were delicious. This place is a must try if you're in the university area!
