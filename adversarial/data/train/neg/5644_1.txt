The service was ok. the food marginal. Ordered the lunch special.\nThe fried rice was lousy, Ive never had fried rice as rice only, no vegetables at all and dry. The food itself very little. Curry chicken and beef has much salt. The sweet and sour pork was about the only thing edible. Businesses need to learn you have to give a good value for people to return.
