This is a pretty big Dollarama with a decent variety of products. It's new, so it's clean, and the people who work there are friendly and helpful, which is great because it's pretty tough to find what you're looking for. The aisles are all numbered, but they could really do with a system like you see in other stores where they list what is actually in those aisles. Every time I've gone there, I need to walk through every aisle to find what I'm looking for. It's kind of frustrating since I'm never there to browse, I just want to get what I'm looking for and get the hell out.\n\nThere are two entrances: one on Bathurst and one on Vaughan. On Vaughan, street parking is free after 6pm, Monday to Friday, which is pretty sweet.
