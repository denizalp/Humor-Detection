I've been taking my vehicles to Scott Repman since 1994, so when I heard he had moved here, I had to bring my 2016 Tacoma in for weird delay issues and clunking in the transmission. Scott let me know that this was normal behavior for this new model of transmission, and rotated my tires for free!\n\nSame great service I've been given for the last 23 years now!
