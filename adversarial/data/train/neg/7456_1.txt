Absolutely, hands down...5 stars. \nHere on business but I feel like I'm getting a little vacation in the process. \nThis place is so cool. Funky, eclectic vibe. Gorgeous decor! \nRooms are lovely and cleanliness is superb. I witnessed a manager fluffing the pillows in the lobby :)\nThe Blue Hound has great specialty drinks and the bartenders were extremely attentive. \nThe entire staff gets big cudos from me...from the front office staff to the valet guys. \nI will be back! Maybe next time for a real vacation. Regardless, I recommend this place whether for business or pleasure. \nThank you Palomar :)
