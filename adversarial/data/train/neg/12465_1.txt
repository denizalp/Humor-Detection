I dont agree with the comments some have made.My mom went here and she bid on a mattress that was the wrong size.She was given a $70 credit note - most auctioneers make you take it after you bid- its doesn't get any better than a bit of understanding for an honest mistake at the auctions. Their honest and fair .
