I've been a few times and wish it weren't so far away from my place! Such a chill hangout spot, had a great time every time. Servers were super friendly and loved the atmosphere. Definitely recommending to friends! Loved that ping pong was free, along with corn hole, giant jenga, and darts! Bowling was a blast and it's set up super cozy and nice.
