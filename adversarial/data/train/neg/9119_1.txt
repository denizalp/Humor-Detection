bought 5 of the same lights in 5 separate lots. One had water in the lens, one was non-op once installed, the last had a broken fixture arm. the 2 that worked had the \"24 hour\" guarantee. the 3 that were busted had the disclaimer of \" Untested - We are unable to test this item. This item is being sold without a warranty of any kind.\"   Why would they guarantee 2 out of 5 lights? because they knew 3 were busted,  and didn't want to disclose this.  pretty crappy.  If you see and item doesn't have a guarantee, I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because it is probably busted and you will not get a refund. \nLastly, they extend auctions without notice. I am bidding in an auction that ended in 6 days. Went to check the auction today, and saw they extended the auction out another week.  aaaand to cap it all off, they sell mostly crap. like \"my grandma died and we liquidated her left over yard sale\" estate type crap.
