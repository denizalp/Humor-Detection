Ms. Lintz helped my small moving business set up quick books. We did it remotely. Very conviniant. She was able to answer all the questions we had and knew quick books inside and out. She was able to simplify it for us so that we could understand it. Very helpful. The rates were very fair. Low hassle, fair rates and very imformative.  Thank you!
