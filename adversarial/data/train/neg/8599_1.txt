Turning into an area & local destination.  \n\nGreat decisions by the owner\/developers to include a gourmet coffee bar opening at 7am daily. Ambiance is off the charts including its Staff and wonderfully caring people like Jake (at the coffee bar).  They also have scintillating breakfast items which we found out this am.\n\nHave now lunched here 3x's and the menu is so creative.  You will not find a roasted vegetable & hummus plate (with homemade pita bread) anywhere like The Covenant.\n\nExecutive Chef Richard is a quality freak as he surveys EVERY meal before it is delivered by their wonderful Servers. We witnessed him telling our Server that he refused to prepare the daily fresh Ahi as that day's delivery was not up to his standards.  Very refreshing to know that he equally wants to uphold the Brand while protecting the newly minted & coveted Covenant clientele.\n\n Not to be outdone, Chris was a passionate foodie\/server & outstanding gent.  Have to love how The Covenant has attracted such talent.\n\nThe love for this place just amps higher & higher. A destination appeal while earning its 5 Star stripes.....
