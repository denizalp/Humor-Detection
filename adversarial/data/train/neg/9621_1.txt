This is a positive 3* review. Food was good, drinks were good. Recommend the pot pie of the day. \n\nIt's really more of a summer spot in my opinion (the rooftop patio is lovely). Service can be a bit hit\/miss and the main floor smells like old beer. Also, they serve meals but don't have hot water\/tea\/coffee. Not a big deal, just seems like such an easy thing to remedy if they want to be more than just a bar. Anyhow, it's a nice local spot that I would recommend for a cold beer in the summer on the rooftop patio.
