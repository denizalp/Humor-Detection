I came in 3 weeks ago to get my phone fixed, my screen was completely Cracked before I came in, they told me it was $100 plus tax to get fixed which no problem at all and they were very nice at the time. As soon as I got my phone the same day everything looked perfect but after these past few weeks I noticed my screened chipped and I have no idea how it happened because I didn't dropped it at all. And it started cracking more from the chip so I go in the other day and explain what happened. They just told me \"the best they could do\" for me was $80 plus tax to replace it which I have told them the quality isn't good if this might happened again. I'm not spending another $80 since I already paid for $100 before and might as well get another phone if I could fork out more money and he started accusing me that I dropped it because it chipped. I totally understand that this is your business and you need to make money and a living but don't accuse your customers! Don't you remember the saying  \"Your customers are always right\",  if you want the great reviews  but I really thought you could really help me out but I'll take my business somewhere else and not recommend at all.
