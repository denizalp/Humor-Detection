I was bummed Calli relocated farther away from me. But it didnt deter me from still seeing her every 4 weeks like clock work. As another professional in The beauty industry I know talent when I find it! I've never had a facial even come close to comparing with what a great job she does and I know if I didn't see her, I would just be continually disappointed by other estheticians. Her space is so cozy and inviting and she has such a warm, friendly personality. I'd say she's become more of a friend to me now and I am so glad I found her!! So is my skin! I get all my skin Care products from her too and I get endless compliments on my healthy skin now!
