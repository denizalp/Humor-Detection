First time here. No appt. Had a special of $25 for gel manicure. There were customers being helped so I hoped for the best and waited. Nail tech was rough on my cuticles and caused raw\/redness. I reshaped and filed when I got home. Price was decent but I was not pleased with quality. I won't be returning.
