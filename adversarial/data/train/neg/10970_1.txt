Wow!  I can't believe this is the same place that Bill's used to be.  I didn't want to like it because I loved the old school atmosphere that Bill's was, but they did an amazing job.  It is gorgeous!  This has to be the best view of any of the mega clubs.  Watch out Vegas, Victor Drai has stepped it up!
