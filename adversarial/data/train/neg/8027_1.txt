For my birthday my fiance and I decided to check out The Cheesecake Factory and we had a wonderful experience from the time we arrived! I knew from reading other yelpers reviews to expect a wait so I was totally prepared for waiting and to my pleasant surprise our quoted wait time of 15 minutes went by fast while we looked over there enormous menu. The time finally arrived for us to be seated (patio) and our waitress Emily was very friendly and also very knowledgeable of the menu. Upon her suggestion I ordered the Jamaican Pepper Shrimp and Chicken with black beans, rice, and fried plantains. All of which was delicious. My only complaint would be the temperature of my was not very hot. My guy had the rib eye and fries and he devoured Evey bite! I ordered the 30th Anniversary cheesecake to go because my entree was sooo big but that's a good thing. You guys helped make my day that much more special and we will definitely be back!
