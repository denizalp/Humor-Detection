I moved to Toronto recently and was nervous to get a new aesthetician for my brazilians, so I did my research and The Ten Spot seemed to be a good place to try out. \n\nI booked an appt with Raquel, and it was pretty painless! I was really happy. I've gone back to her another time and I think I will continue. The salon is organized, and I like that I can book online. They have always been on time to take me in for my appointments, and the wax doesn't take long at all.\n\nGood place!
