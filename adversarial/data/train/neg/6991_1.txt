This place is one of the best places to get hot pot because I haven't had one broth that I didn't like! My personal favourite is the sukiyaki. I prefer this place over any all you can eat hot pot because they give perfect portions in fact more than I can eat so it's perfect and only $15. They also make really good bubble tea here too definitely come here if you haven't tried it yet
