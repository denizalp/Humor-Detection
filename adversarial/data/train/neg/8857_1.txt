I have used this location 4 times in the last 4 months. The first time was tire replacement for my GX460. Glenn and I discussed the options, settled on the tires and he explained the rebates. The next time need tires for my daughter's RX350. We ordered hers. When they did not arrive as promised, they upgraded the tires at no charge. \nMost recently I was told my brakes needed new disks. Not trusting what I was told by another company(that another review) I took it to here. They checked out my vehicle and stated the brakes were fine. The same day, my daughter's car navigation system shut down. We're we're unable to get it into Lexus so we took it here. Glenn got it in and did a check and confirmed what we expected. Need a new system.  They didn't charge for either service. As long as Glenn is here, I have confidence that I will get honest service.
