Great location and having market in building is excellent. \n\nBad residents. Not a place for serious workers, serious students, or families. People are inconsiderate with their music, drugs, and obnoxious behavior when drunk. It's seriously gone downhill in the past 6 months or so.\n\nApartments get very cold in winter.
