I love that there are still smaller hardware stores like Ace.  I mean, Home Depot and Lowe's are great stores, but you can get lost.  Also, customer service means a lot to me.  My whole purpose of coming here was to find a specific light bulb for our kitchen table.  I walk in and was immediately asked if I needed help finding something.  I was lead to the right aisle, found the bulb, picked up some plastic wall hangers, paid at the counter, was given a thanks for coming and out the door I went.\n\nThat is all I look for in places like this.  The atmosphere doesn't seem sterile and cold.  I actually felt welcomed coming in, unlike some of the other places I have been to.
