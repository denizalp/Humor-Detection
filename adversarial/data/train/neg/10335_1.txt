Our family was celebrating the return of my nephew from his mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where he served for two years in Africa. After being out of the country for two years, the first place he wanted to go to eat was Nandos Mexican Café. All 39 of us, family and friends who met him at the airport, joined him for dinner, and the staff was so friendly and accommodating everyone of us, and did so with a smile! They entertained the children, (and a few adults) with crayons while we had chips and the best salsa ever, While we waited for our entrées. The food here was so delicious, I had the shredded beef tacos, which were so addictive that my husband ordered extra tacos to bring home!! The portion sizes are such that if you ordered an appetizer, the entrée could be shared between two people. We will definitely come back here again!!!
