I was pleasantly surprised, and I'm very hopeful for this place!\n\nAfter seeing a handful of restaurants come and go in this location, I truly hope this one sticks around!  \n\nMy friends and I stopped by for happy hour, even though this place is still under it's \"soft opening\".\n\nWe had beer and wine, and then ordered some bruschetta, a meat and cheese plate, hummus and an ahi tuna panini.\nAll of the food was very tasty, and the drinks were equally delicious.
