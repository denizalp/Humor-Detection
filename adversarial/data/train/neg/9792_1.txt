A solid 3.5-4* for soon tofu in the city!\n\nI prefer Chodang, but when I don't feel like driving, Buk Chang will do the job...especially when the weather gets colder!  Buk Chang is slightly cheaper, by ~$0.50, less sides, rice is a mix of white\/purple, as opposed to just purple (Chodang), and the flavours here are \"stronger\", less subtle tasting.  The menu here is also shorter.\n\n(One of the main reasons why I prefer Chodang is that I know they make their own tofu, in-house, and don't use MSG.  Although I don't feel the MSG symptoms @ Buk Chang, the taste is just more in your face!)\n\nNever had an issue here with service, although you may hafta ask for your water\/tea to be refilled.  Contrary to other reviewers, portion size is more than enough!\n\nOrder comes with 4 banchans:  bean sprouts, kim chi daikon (sweet side), sweet brown soy beans, & of course, kim chi.  I don't really like the kim chi here 'cause I find it too salty to enjoy.\n\nI usually get Regular Spicy, but my friend ordered Extra Spicy today and it was also waaay too salty as well.  So keep that in mind!
