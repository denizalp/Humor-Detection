This place has really good food. Owner is super kind and friendly, as well as staff I met. \nYou get lots of good flavor with entrees. lol I short ribs are fed worth coming back for! \nDidn't like the smoothies though. I don't think there was any real fruit or even fruit juice in it at all.\nIt's rather hidden away, but worth it when you get here!
