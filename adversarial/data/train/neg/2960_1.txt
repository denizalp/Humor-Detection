Even with this Vegas heat, these guys were able to take care of me with ease. They were friendly and accommodating. Their lounge is conveniently located in a store where you can wait and eat or try your luck on the slot machines. I received a free car wash with the oil change I got for $50.  Will most likely come back again.
