Really like and enjoy this place, it's great food and entertainment all rolled into one.\nThe food here is really fantastic at a great price and then on top of it they entertain you with a great experience with their chefs preparing the food right in front of you in an entertaining, fun way which makes for a great experience all the way around.\nVery reasonably priced, very tasty and very entertaining. I honestly don't know how they do all they do for the price they do it for.
