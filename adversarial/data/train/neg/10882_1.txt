I was told that my insurance company would not cover a needed procedure so  I agreed to pay for it.  My insurance company did cover part of the procedure.  when I requested a credit I was fed a story that I had agreed to an upgraded procedure and therefore no credit. This is totally bogus.\n\nAdditionally, my face was bruised for two weeks after treatment.  Never have I had bruising after a dental visit.\n\nI won't be going back.
