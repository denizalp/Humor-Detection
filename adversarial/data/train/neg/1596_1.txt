I've been coming to this shop for What seems like forever now! Hands down Kevin is definitely THE best nail guy I've ever had! I will never go to any other place ever!! I get so many compliments on my nails everyday! Very affordable and staff is very friendly! Make sure you call ahead because it can get very busy! But definitely worth the wait!! See you in 2 weeks Kevin!
