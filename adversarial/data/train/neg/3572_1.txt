Promising health spot! My hubby enjoyed his protein bowl with the salads he sampled. My 3 year old had the quesadilla kids meal. He liked the quesadilla but the sweet potatoes were kind of burnt and he was not a fan of the cookie. I was hoping to try the grilled chicken sandwich or salmon but was told they were out of both (6pm on a Thursday?). The chicken my hubby had was slightly spicy for me, as were the salads. Good if you can handle spice! \n\nThe girls behind the counter were really nice. Not sure why the kids meal came out last (and after another party was served who came after) but willing to try again.
