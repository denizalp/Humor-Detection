This is a gem.  Food is interesting, super tasty and so different from the boring Thai that you find in every Toronto street and food court.  We were a group of 3 and tried about 12 dishes and left very satisfied.  If you are looking for cheap this isn't the place for you.  If you love food and flavour definately worth the night out.
