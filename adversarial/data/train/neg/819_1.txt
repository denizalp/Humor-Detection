Attended early August 2016, 9:30 showing. Our seats were about 6 rows back from the stage; next time I'd like to sit a bit farther back, but we had a great view of everything on the stage and were able to interact with the performers (so cool!). \nI'll admit this was the first Cirque du Soleil show I've seen, but it won't be the last. This show was absolutely incredible: the music, booming from the seats around you, is of course wnderful. But the performances were beyond anything I expected (and my expectations were REALLY high). The \"Octopus Garden\" scenes with glowing jellyfish and the \"While my Guitar Gently Weeps\" sequence where a female dancer interacts with an animated beau were my favorites, but the roller skaters shouldn't be overlooked either! \nThe tickets weren't cheap, but they were worth every penny. I can't wait to go back and see it again!
