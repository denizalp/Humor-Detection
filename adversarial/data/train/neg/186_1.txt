We found this vet after being to 3 other vets in the Scottsdale area. My only issue is I wish I would have found them first. My German Shepard had a nasal problem that turned out to be cancer. No vet would help me come to some type of affordable treatment system without an expensive x ray or ct scan which can run in the thousands. The fact that I did not have that kind of money did not even raise an eyebrow with this vet. Dr Ryan is who we saw and he did a thorough examination of my dog and spent as much time as we needed to answer questions and give us alternative forms of treatment to keep her comfortable. When it came down to the time we had to make the very tough decision to let her move on, he came to our home and allowed our dog to be surrounded by the people that loved her. He and his assistant both had such a great disposition and treated her with the dignity and respect she had her entire life in our family. The entire staff has been kind, and genuine throughout this difficult process. We have other dogs and cats that will now be lifelong patients at this vet. Highly recommend this vet if you want honest, quality, and thorough service given by genuinely kind people.
