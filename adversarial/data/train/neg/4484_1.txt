I love this place. I have had the good fortune of dining here on a number of occasions and I must say that the food is fantastic and the service is equally as fantastic. All the Chefs and servers are really friendly and helpful. The clam chowder is a must have and the crab legs are great because they are already split. I've pretty much tried everything on this menu and all items are really fresh and well-prepared. I don't know why the other reviewers keep comparing this to the Palace Station because to me there is no comparison. This place has better and more flavorful food.
