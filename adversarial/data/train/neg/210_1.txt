I visited Cecil's West for the first time last week. I had a pair of flat riding boots that was too wide and tall at the shaft plus a purse with a loose handle. I went to Cecil's and showed him the boots. He gave me great advice about the boots, and prevented me from ruining them by moving or adjusting items on the boot that would have made them look worse. He was the voice of reason, and was not going to undertake a job that would not make me happy at the end! I really appreciated that! He did a great job on my purse. I highly recommend this for any shoe\/purse repairs!
