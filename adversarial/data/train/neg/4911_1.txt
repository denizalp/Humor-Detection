Went in yesterday to fix a nail in my rear tire and the auto service attendant Denis was not only super professional and timely, but also very kind and approachable. I did not feel like a nuisance as a girl that didn't know much about vehicles and I was so impressed with how welcoming they were. He gave me a time and price quote which were both accurate. Very impressed!
