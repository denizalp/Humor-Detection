I absolutely LOVE this place! Any time we are in the area, this is the only place we eat. Their food is delicious, cooked fresh daily (soups and the like), and the server always have a smile to calm your spirits.\n\nThis place has a quiet and cozy feel to it and, since it's run by a family, you definitely get a sense of mama's home cookin'.\n\nThe experiences we've had here have always been a pleasure. My wife ordered their fresh soup to try it out and they brought two bowls and said, \"This one's on us!\" so we could both enjoy it. The cheese sticks are to die for and their Philly cheese-steak sandwich is amazing!\n\nStop on by and support a great local restaurant on your way to Hoover Dam!
