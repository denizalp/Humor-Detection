Read so many great reviews that I was skeptical. But for me, they do deserve a 5 star review. Courteous, on-time, thorough. Great price. Saving $15 a month by switching from ADT to JPG. What I expecially like is that if you have a problem, they'll come check it out for free, unlike ADT. We got an updated key pad, additional sensor and two additional motion sensors for no out-of-pocket cost. I really like that we can activate our system using smart phone, especially if I forget, I don't have to turn around and come home, etc. Jim gave me several ideas about other things to do to increase security. Just overall they seem to be a great company and nice to deal with.
