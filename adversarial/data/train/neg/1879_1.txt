My family and I were visiting Pittsburgh and happened upon this restaurant. It was really good. It's not a conventional style like a lot of restaurants where you order at your table. At this restaurant, you order at the counter and the waiter\/waitress brings it to your table. \n\nThey have breakfast and lunch. We were there for breakfast. They also have lots of good looking and tasting pastries. I had the grits with cheese, chopped bacon, and egg on it. It was one of the best grits I've ever tasted. My dad ordered the quiche of the day which had butternut squash and fennel in it. He liked it. My mom ordered the fruit parfait. She liked the granola in it. \n\nFor dessert, I had their scone of the day which was cinnamon raisin. It was good. It was very dense. It was not too sweet though which I liked. My mom and dad ordered the bread pudding of the day which was maple blueberry. They liked it.\n\nIf you're ever in Pittsburgh, you have to try this place!
