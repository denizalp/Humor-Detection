So I see this pop up when I'm searching for another burger joint and remember when I used to work close by and coworkers and I would visit here fairly often. I haven't been in awhile, but what always struck me about this place was that while they were  usually pretty busy, they were never so busy to the point that there was no one around to serve you, a common issue with a rising number of bars and burger bistros. \n\nThe W has been around for awhile, and the food is fantastic. Flavorful, generous portions and service is also good. I think the only reason I don't go very often anymore is merely because it is not close to where I work. \n\nDrink specials and burger deals I do believe are still offered and a draw, and there is plenty of seating available. Atmosphere is laid back but polished, music is not too loud, and there are TV's to keep you up to date on the game.\n\nWorth the trip!
