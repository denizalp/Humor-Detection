I won't go on and on about how this may be the best sushi place in town, cause let's face it, who has tried them all? If you are thinking to yourself that you have, you're a sushi-loving liar. A new one opens almost nightly!! \n\nThis place is definitely high quality food. Super nice staff, fast service and a variety of seating options if you're with a big group or a loner that just had to kill that raw fish craving. My 2 favorite things about this place are the variety and the price. Most places that do all you can eat (this place does not) price their rolls so high they force you into getting it. The Sushi has reasonably priced rolls, where you can leave super full and still feel like you didn't get robbed because you didn't get it all for $27. I think we have even eaten more food here and paid less than when at their competitors. The variety is awesome. If you like some cooked fish mixed with a bit of raw, all raw, all cooked, they've got you covered. The sushi special is great, so is the candy cane and the put your hands up. Oh and when they warn about the spice it's not a joke. \n\nGreat, now I'm in the mood for sushi.
