Pre-paid for a car, flight arrived on-time (maybe a little early), waited 50 minutes for the shuttle to show up, they finally came, the lady got out, said they had no cars, laughed, and drove off.  Yes, LAUGHED!!  So I'm standing there at 11:10 pm, a hour drive ahead of me, and no car.  I did not find that funny!\n\nI suggest paying a few more bucks and go to a real rental car agency.
