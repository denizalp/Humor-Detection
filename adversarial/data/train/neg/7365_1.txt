We were here 3\/24\/16 for the George Strait concert, ad it was a wonderful experience.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The place is clean and has lots of bathrooms.  The acoustics were great.  There are plenty of televisions to see the action up close.  There are lots of refreshment stands and booths.  The beer was too expensive at $12 a tall boy, but that's about par for the course.  We didn't have to pay to park because we took the bus from our hotel.  We did stop into NY NY and have a drink, and that was nice, too.  The entertainment they had on the plaza before the concert was also excellent!  George Strait was amazing, and we had a wonderful experience!
