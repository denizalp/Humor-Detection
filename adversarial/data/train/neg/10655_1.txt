Love this restaurant.  Great location in summerlin. Open 24 hours so I can have  Anything on the menu any time during the day which is fabulous. Sunday steaks are half price. The fillet & rib eye are always done to perfection.   Large portions and if you can manage the chocolate cake for dessert is delicious. Friendly wait staff And perfect cocktails!
