I heard about this medical practice because it's right by my work and it's where my father goes. I've been here twice now and I love my doctor. She's very kind and professional and walks you through the exams so you don't feel uncomfortable. They're very good about getting you in same day in case you need an appt ASAP. Their entire staff is friendly. I would recommend this practice to any and all my friends. The only thing is that they charge a $60 administrative fee that they're very clear about on their website and up front on your first visit. This fee accounts for paperwork and the convenience of being able to schedule same day appointments. Several people from my work also go to this practice and have nothing but nice things to say about it. Don't let $60 dissuade you from amazing health care!
