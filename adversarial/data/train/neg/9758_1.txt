I absolutely love this place!  Any time a visitor or family member comes to town, I bring them to here to eat. Every single person has enjoyed the experience and loved the food.  The staff is incredible and always friendly.  I would recommend eating here, or any of the other locations they have in the Valley. I am fortunate to have one so close to my office.
