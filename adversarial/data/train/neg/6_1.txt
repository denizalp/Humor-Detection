I was actually really excited about this place when I came here for the first time. Then, when I tried their burgers, I wasn't impressed, I've had much better elsewhere for the same price as Fat Burger. It was good to try once anyway...The only way I will get this next time, is with Groupon probably..maybe even not. \n\nIts way to too crowded, again not worth. Also, the chairs outside, not comfortable. I like how they have a bar outside though. Not sure what they sell there, as I didn't order any alcoholic drinks, but still cool they have a bar outside. Fat Burger is also 24hrs, which is convenient. I think I'll come here next time when I'm way too drunk, not just to eat. LOL
