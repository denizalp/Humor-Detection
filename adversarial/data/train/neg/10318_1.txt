Vile!  Food was awful. Went for lobster rolls at happy hour, but they have moved happy hour to 3-5. So we had clam chowder and cioppino.  It was awful. Chowder was very strange.  Cioppino was mostly tomatoes!\n\nWaiter asked us to write review about weird happy hour time.  He said most people order a drink and leave!  Place is empty on Saturday night!\n\nRick, where are you?  It used to be good!
