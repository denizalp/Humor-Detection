Rob and his team of home magicians are fabulous.  If you are looking to get work done on your home by skilled professionals then use them.  Rob and his team do it all.  I had them do electric which another contractor couldn't complete (they said it couldn't be done).  Rob's team handled it without difficulty.  I had a nice night light put in my garage with a occupancy sensor so when I walk or drive into the garage I have light.  They also installed my kevo blue tooth lock without an issue.  We are tackling issues here at my home slowly and it's great that I can book them in advance and know they will show up.\n\nThanks Rob.\nDr.  Garner
