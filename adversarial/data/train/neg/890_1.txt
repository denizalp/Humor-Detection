I heard Seoul Taco recently opened on\/near campus so the girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot for dinner on a Thursday. \n\nThe inside of the place is simple, but nicely decorated and very clean. \n\nThe menu is also very straightforward. It's basically Mexican-style foods like burritos, tacos, quesadillas and bowls, but made with Korean BBQ\/Asian ingredients. \n\nI opted for a spicy pork bowl, and she got the chicken quesadilla. \n\nMy bowl was very good. It was a mix of rice, spring mix lettuce, carrots, pork, a special spicy sauce and a fried egg on top. Everything blended together quite well, and honestly the fried egg is probably what made the dish. The pork seemed to be of good quality and had a great BBQ flavor to it.\n\nI tried her quesadilla and that was also quite good. It had a particularly tasty sauce on top that I couldn't figure out, but it was delicious.\n\nMy bowl was $8 and her quesadilla was almost the same. The portion of the bowl was good, though I'm not sure quite as large as Chipotle's burrito bowl. Still, for $8\/person, we had a unique, tasty dinner and we were both pretty happy. \n\nDefinitely coming back!
