I would say the best roofing company.  Javier takes pride in his work and went above and beyond making sure that everything was in pristine working order. He was quick to come out to provide a reasonable quote and setting the the repair was just a couple days later.  If you are looking for someone who will treat your roof as they were working on their own at a reasonable price, Redstone is the company.
