I purchased a Barbecue at Barbecues Galore 18 years ago, yes 18 years ago. The brand was Cook-On, which was made specifically for Barbecues Galore. While believe it or not it still works, it was starting to show its ago. Since I had such good luck, I thought I would go back. Upon entering I was Greeted by Ramiz Cajic. When I mentioned my 18 year old BBQ, he knew exactly what I was talking about. We discussed many options including rebuilding the old one (which still can be done).  I opted instead for a new one. Ramiz is an exceptional Sales Representative of this company.  He reviewed with me in detail what my needs were and helped me make the correct choice, helped me load the BBQ in my truck and made sure everything was done correctly. Unfortunately after getting it home and unboxing, it was found to have a defect (no fault of Barbecues Galore), must have occurred in shipping from manufacturer. I called Ramiz and he said to simply bring it back. He even stayed late after his normal end of day to wait for me. Ramiz made the return process smooth as silk, no issues  no questions asked, and made sure the refund would be processed quickly. I would have just exchanged, but they were out of stock on that model.\n\nIf you are in the Market for a new Barbecue, or need to replace parts or get accessories, this is the store for you, and Ramiz is the guy to ask for! (I am sure the other guys are great as well), but Ramiz went above and beyond to assist me so I highly recommend him.
