We came in for summerlicious 2016. The menu had a lot of great options so we decided to try it out!\n\nStarting off, service was horrible from our waitress. Our server was very hard to find and she rarely came even near the table. We ended up having to catch other waitresses and the bar tender to help us find her so we can refill water or grab the bill. \n\nFood was good though. We started off with calamari and the crab lobster soup. I found the soup a bit salty, but good flavors and I love the puff pastry over the soup.\n\nFor mains we ordered the morrocan lamb and steak. The steak had a great crust of pepper and salt seasoning on top and was cooked as I preferred. The lamb was well spiced over a lovely bed of veggies and couscous. \n\nDessert was nice. We had the cheesecake and grilled pear with ice cream. Nothing overly sweet.\n\nOver all food was good, service (for our particular waitress) was bad, atmosphere was okay. I don't think it's somewhere I'd be looking to return to.
