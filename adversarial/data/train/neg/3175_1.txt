Stumbled across this adorable shop by accident.  Checked them out because of the name, and was so happy I did!  Cupcakes were delicious!  Extremely soft, wonderful flavors, and some of the prettiest\/most creative I've had.  (Disclaimer- I have eaten A LOT of cupcakes in my lifetime!)\n\nThank you for the tasty treat!  Will definitely be back next time I'm in the area!
