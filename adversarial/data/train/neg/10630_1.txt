As I returned my vehicle this morning, they attempted to blame me for a chipped windshield that had been noted on the pre-rental inspection form filled out when I rented the vehicle.  When I asked the \"attendant\" to produce the inspection form, where the chip is very clearly noted, he stated they no longer had it.  I made it very clear that wasn't going to fly.  Ultimately, I was cleared to go.  However, I don't trust that they won't find a way to charge me for the damage anyway.  Am waiting for the charges to appear on my travel account.  If you plan on using this agency - take advantage of your cell phone's video option, and video tape the car (as well as photograph), as they are ready to take you down the river to make any last dime off of you that they can.  BE WARNED.
