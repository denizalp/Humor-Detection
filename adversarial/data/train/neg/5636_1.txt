Matt responded to my email inquiry quickly and immediately set up an appointment after the weekend.  He arrived within his promised timeframe, discovered that the dryer vent in our new home was completely clear, and refused to charge us for the inspection.  Unbelievable!!!!  We insisted that he accept a tip for this trouble and to cover his gas.  Overall, a very positive experience.  Matt's the real deal.... proceed with confidence.
