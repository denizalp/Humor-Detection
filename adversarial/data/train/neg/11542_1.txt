I live nearby and eat here about once a week. The food and service are consistently good. Plus you can buy alot of groceries and the staff is helpful. I have had most of the menu and haven't been disappointed yet. But, since the staff is so helpful, sometimes customers get really carried away asking questions at the register which can cause a slow moving line of customers in the small space.
