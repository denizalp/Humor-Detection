I've been here 3 or 4 times now and I feel can make a fair judgement.  They have stepped it up since they opened. The entrees come with salad, veggies and rice. The portion was easily 2 meals and everything was fresh. The Salmon Teriyaki is good, but find it inconsistent depending on who is cooking. Chicken & Beef Teriyaki also good.  Veg is that perfect spot between still crisp yet soft. I love simple, good, fresh food and that's what you get.  They also added a $5.95 lunch special.  The cook and cashier was very nice.
