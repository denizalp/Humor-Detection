Morton's is not what it used to be.  Steaks were great, service was terrible. It appears service is very inconsistent and at a steakhouse of this caliber you should be able to count on the service.  I would suggest more training and also perhaps caring about reviews.  \nWhy ask for feedback, if you don't care.
