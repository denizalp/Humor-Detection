Like everyone has stated, appointments are worthless now a days! Since the owner no longer works at this particular location ,the business has become a mess, no leadership, no cleanliness of environment,  customer service has deteriorated significantly, I've encounter angry customers walking out furious about the wait even when they had appointments. \n\nNot what it used to be when it started .
