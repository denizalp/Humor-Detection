Unfortunately, we recently had to put our 16.5 yr old cat, Toby, down. He was our 1st addition to the family & it was our 1st experience with that type of heartbreak. Dr John Ensign was more than caring & gentle in his words and actions for the entire ordeal. We couldn't be more satisfied and appreciative of Dr Ensign or his staff. Always a 5+ stars in our book.
