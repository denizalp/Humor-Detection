Indus used to be right around the corner from me, and I used their beads as a reward for a job well done.  like if i finished all of my ice cream.  indus has quite a selection of beads ( and ties with burnie's as my fave bead shop).  indus has lots of funky and from-all-around-the-world beads like my very favorite mali wedding beads.  there are lots of bright colors and choices here.   it is a great place to find a one-of-a-kind centerpiece for a necklace, though there are also ropes of beads to be had. another favorite are the skull beads that seem to be made from a nut.  you could buy a whole rope of them or just a couple.\nanother cool nook in this store is devoted to local music, just coffee, and peruvian belts and blouses.  it's always nice to promote local.\nthe shop itself has a sleek and uncluttered feel which is nice in a bead shop.  with so many fun choices, the blonde hardwood floors are soothing.   downstairs is used for art shows and such, while the back rooms offer classes.  there's even a table near the window where i suppose you could sit and string, but it's probably better for reading. the shop can be a bit pricy, but quality beads are. besides it is just like going to a candy shop where one or two pieces can satisfy.
