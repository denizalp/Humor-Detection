I love this place! Amazing service, food, location and love their live bands! I wish they were open all year long. Their melon sangria is the best sangria I've ever had in my whole life! \n\nThe place gets crowded very fast. I suggest you wait in line and sit at their terrace in the back which offers a live band and an awesome atmosphere. We love the chicken wings as an entree! The american pizza is also delicious. Although, a bit pricy, it's worth every penny!
