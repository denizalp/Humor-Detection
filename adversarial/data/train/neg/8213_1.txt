I accompanied my roommate to her visit today since her platelet count was critically low and she had been telling me how impressed she was with this facility... Today, her and I were greatly disappointed... Considering her situation, I would have expected better customer service. Her MA, Marleth was very terse and short with any question she had. She just handed her the lab results and said, \"here are your results,\" and quickly left, leaving us to interpret these results on our own. When we questioned what the lab results meant, she was unable to answer any question and did not bother to clarify or express any concern. In fact, when she tried to answer the question, she answered it wrong. Aside from the lack of compassion, she lacked knowledge and explanation of the dosage or our next steps. If we didn't have to come back, I would not. For an office as nice and well organized, I would have expected the staff to be the same. I hope her next visit is more pleasant.
