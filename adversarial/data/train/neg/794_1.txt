My girlfriend and I came here for her 23rd birthday dinner, we were seated immediately with a reservation. The decor and furniture were chic, but comfortable. There was a lot of seating but it didn't seem like we were smushed into other tables. Our waiter was very attentive from the start making sure our drinks were exactly as we ordered them.  We skipped appetizers, but it looked like there were some items I might try our next time here. We both ordered sirloin steaks, $25 a piece that came with twice baked potatoes and \"fresh vegetables\" (happened to be saut√©ed zucchini and onions). The steaks were a little undercooked (still tasted fine), the garlic butter that was on top helped define the steak flavor. Our zucchini was perfectly cooked, not too hard and not too mushy. The twice baked potatoes stole the show! Bacon, chives, garlic and cheese really accentuated the potato guts! Since it was her birthday, Bonfyre bought her a little dessert cup with her choice of flavor with 6 to choose from. She ended up taking the Cookies and Cream Mousse, which was delightfully delicious! Definitely one of our favorite meals in Madison. \nBravo Bonfyre!
