Love the vibe on this place! The waiters are really nice and friendly too and the food is delish. You get just the right portion which is worth the $$ you pay for. We had the bulgogi topoki and seafood cream sauce base topoki and popcorn chicken. White topoki is hands down the best dish for me but if you like something sweet go for the bulgogi. Definitely coming back for more!
