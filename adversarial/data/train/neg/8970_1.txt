Went there the other night for dinners. Our server was nice and very good. I know it can be a hit or miss but she was very good. Our drinks were always full, gave us plenty of time to read the menu, and the food came out in the way we order it. At first there was a table next to us and they were loud even for me being hard of hearing. I think they were hard of hearing too. I will go back but not to sure when.
