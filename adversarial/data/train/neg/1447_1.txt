This Izakaya is mediocre when compared to the likes of Kinka and Zakkushi. The atmosphere misses the spot. Upon entering, there is not the usual loud warm welcome from the staff, but instead you see numerous plasma screens in all corners of the restaurant. The overall feel is more like a sports bar than an izakaya, per se. \n\nThe quality of the food does not hit the price point. We got the Hangetsu sashimi combo, the grilled salmon collar, the grilled squid, and the spicy pork. \n\nThe hangetsu combo came with a limited selection of fish. It was all you can eat quality for the most part and had all the usual suspects of salmon, tuna, mackerel, butterfish and snapper. They did have hamachi, but the quality was not fresh and the taste was off and a bit fishy. \n\nThe salmon collar and grilled squid were decent. In particular, the salmon was on special so we got it for a steal at 5$. The squid was also nicely grilled. \n\nThe spicy pork was too saucy and tasted like it had been marinated for a month. The pieces were also not cut to bite-size portions. \n\nAll in all, the menu has some decent grilled items, as should be the norm for all izakayas, but the sushi\/sashimi options on the menu should be passed on. It's not a bad place for drinks and late night food while watching sports, but there are better dinner options around for the same price level.
