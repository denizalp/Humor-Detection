Their coffee is AMAZING.  The flavor is something that is so unique and delicious.  I usually get a cappuccino and it is truly the best one I have ever had and I drink cappuccinos every day.  One day I had their mocha.  Can you believe this, they make their OWN mocha syrup.  It is incredible and you can add as much or little sweetness as you want.
