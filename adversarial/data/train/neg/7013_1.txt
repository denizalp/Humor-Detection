Stopped at the gun garage while we were staying in Vegas and oh my god was it the best decision we made all weekend!! Everyone especially had a great time shooting the .50 cal!! That thing is insane and you could feel it in your chest every time they shot it! Got a pretty decent deal on a package for 3 people. 3 guns including the .50 cal for each person was around $300. Sounds expensive but it's not considering what you get to do. Wait times are a bit long but the staff was awesome offering water and stuff while we waited. Paul was the one who helped us out and let me tell you he's a sweetheart!! He made sure everyone felt extremely comfortable and was very helpful!! Can't wait to go back and bring more friends!!
