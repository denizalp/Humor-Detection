So sorry to go against the grain, but our dinner at Yardbird sucked. The wait staff was great. The service impeccable. But the food was awful. My friends and I all ordered the burger. It came with fries which were lackluster and under seasoned. But the biggest disappointment was the burger itself. It was so greasy that the bottom bun was so soaked through with fat that we couldn't pick it up. Had to pick apart with a fork. The red onions on the menu description were missing. All together a total bust.
