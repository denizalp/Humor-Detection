I would say 3.5 stars.  Got a massage when visiting from out of town.  The staff was so friendly but nobody told us to get there early for the massage to fill out paperwork and change.  So my \"60 min\" massage ended up being closer to 50 min.  The massage was a swedish massage and was pretty good.  Facilities looked nice but we didn't get a chance to use them.
