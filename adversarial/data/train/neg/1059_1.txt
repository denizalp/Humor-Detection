I used to take all of my vehicles here a lot, and working in the promotions department for a local radio station, I had quite a few cars that were constantly needing something fixed.  I worked with several of the managers, and they were very accommodating and helpful for my own vehicle problems.\n\nHowever, recently I had some electrical trouble with my van and had to take it in, they had to run a round of tests, and then ended up charging me an exorbitant amount of money for the repairs.  The guy behind the desk was not friendly, and seemed like a failed used car salesman who was just trying to sell me a new battery, something that had not been mentioned to me as a problem before.  I hate feeling like I'm being screwed over, I think everyone does, and unfortunately that's the way this AAA facility mad me feel the last time I was there.  They charged me too much for what they did, they added on repairs that were not originally discussed, and their counter guy seemed way more interested in closing a sale on a battery than keeping a long-time repeat customer.  Too bad for them, I will never go back to this shop, and I strongly caution anyone from going here as well.  \n\nNow, I take my cars to Performance Auto Repair off Albemarle road, the guys there know what they're doing so you don't have to pay huge costs for \"Diagnostic Tests\", and they are honest, about their prices, and their service, in the auto repair industry that goes along way.
