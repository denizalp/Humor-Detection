True hardware store. They have everything. Go here before throwing anything out, you can probably find what you need to fix it. Also, go here BEFORE a project, because you'll find things to simplify the job. Staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. One star short because they don't put prices on most items. Fine if you're buying on a company acct and don't care what things cost. But for me doing personal projects, I have to know what I'm spending. Plus, in a place like this, I may buy things I don't even need yet if the price is right. But you have to chase down a salesman with an available computer to find out.
