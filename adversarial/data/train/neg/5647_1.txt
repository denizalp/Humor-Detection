LOVE THIS PLACE!!! there is a new face at this location her name is Fareshte she calls her self Fare, she did an amazing job, I get a bit nervous when someone new doing my eyebrows, but today I will never feel the same again about her EVERYONE should go to her, if there was 10 stars I would have chosen it that's how good her work is, she has a very positive vibe about her, I will definitely send all my friends and family to her.\n\nEyebrows R Us offer awesome deals as well, they have pre-paid cards I got the one 4 for $25.00 with comes out as if I am paying below $7.00 for my eyebrows. I bought 1 for my mom for Mother's Day :-) can't get any better than this. So guys go to this location it's the best!!!!
