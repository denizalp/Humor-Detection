Fantastic quality and customer service. I have nothing but great things to say about Spa Lamar, and it's my \"go-to\" place for massages. I fully recommend them for a quality and well-valued massage. It's worth it. Great location just north of Fashion Square. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. They will explain everything, especially if it is your first massage.
