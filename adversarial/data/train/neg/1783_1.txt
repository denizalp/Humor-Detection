My first time at this burger joint. I will be rating this plsce according to the service,  atmosphere and food.\n\nService 4\/5: the perople working there were all very friendly and nice. They were helpful with our order. \n\nAtmosphere 3\/5: nothing special typical burger joint. I found the tables and chairs were a little dirty and also most of the tables were wobbly. I had to wipe \nof the table and chair before sitting at the table.\n\nFood 3\/5: again these rating  are for my liking. My friend and i ordered two prime single burger combos. She had regular fries and i poutined mine. In my opinion the burger was way too oily and made me feel a little sick after eating it. I couldn't finish my burger and my friend had to eat it for me. She found it a little oily but she was okay with it. Also with the burger i didnt taste their sauce at all. I am kind of sure they missed that. The poutine in my opinion wasn't that great the gravy wasnt hot enough so the cheese curds did not melt. I barely ate the poutine because the burger just made me feel a little unsettling.  The fries were good. \n\nAll in all i would give this place a 3.5 star.
