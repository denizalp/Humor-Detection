\"Executive chef. Mike Minor Dropped by the table to ask ,\"how was brunch\". It was amazing, eclectic, weird, and fabulous. Our waiter, Jeff was accommodating , friendly, and he made our experience one of the best meals ever. Eat it all and let Jeff decide what to serve. Our favorites included the pork belly waffles, the steak and eggs, the peanut butter and jelly biscuit with bacon and jalapeno, brisket in any form, lobster pancakes, in other words everything was great. \"
