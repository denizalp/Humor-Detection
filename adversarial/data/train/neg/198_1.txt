Ahh Fatburger, how do I love thee?? Lucky for me, I was born on the west coast and have always had access to In--out and Fatburger. The raging debate goes on as to which is better. Well duh, they are different!! They both have fantastic things to offer. Fatburger is fantastic, because a. they cook your food when you order it, b. you can get a fried egg on top of your burger, and c. you can fax in your order. Fatburger tastes so great and you get your choice of skinny fries, fat fries, or onion rings. Also, you can get a turkey burger which is so good!! I crave Fatburger once in a while and I absolutely cannot satisfy the craving otherwise.
