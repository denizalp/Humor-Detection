My husband and I have been wanting to go to this restaurant since they opened. I'm glad that we've finally able to try their pastrami and brisket sandwiches. \nAs you can see in the pictures, they weren't shy in stacking the meat generously. It was delicious and flavorful! Although the pastrami with coleslaw was yummy, I preferred the brisket better. It's moist without the overwhelming flavor of spices.\nAll in all, our experience was very positive. The environment was quiet and the server was attentive. It's Friday night, and we were told that it's    unusually quiet for them when we were there. \nThis is a wonderful place to go if you're looking for pastrami and other mouthwatering sandwiches\/food.
