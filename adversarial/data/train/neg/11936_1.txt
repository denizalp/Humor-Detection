While I'd read some questionable reviews about Fast Fix other jewelry shops at the mall didn't want to take on removing a ring that wouldn't slip off. Fast Fix stepped up to the challenge for $20. After a specialty designed ring removal tool failed to cut through the stainless steel ring, they took me in back with their master craftsman ( I think his name was Antonio) and had him use an air powered ryobi-like tool to cut it off. He made a shield to protect my finger then spent 20 minutes diligently working his way through the sturdy metal. I really appreciate this as the ring was starting to dig into my hand and started causing real problems - If Fast Fix hadn't stepped in I might have needed to go to the ER to get it removed (likely more than twenty minutes and $20). BTW $20 for a watch battery installed or $10 to remove a watch link is fair when you consider mall rent - your simply paying a premium for convenience.
