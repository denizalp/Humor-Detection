Customer support is Non-Existant...\n\nBought the 8 camera system from Costco.  Installed it and found out the 8th Camera was dead out of the box.  Spent 40 minutes with overseas customer support located in the philippines before they agreed to send a replacement.  After getting a ticket # and submitting proof of purchase, I'm still waiting for my replacement camera 4 months later.  Can't reach customer support due to wait times over one hour on the phone and the auto call back never calls me when an agent is available.  They also don't respond to email with the ticket # referenced.\n\nIf I hadn't spent 8 hours in my attic installing the 1st Seven camers, I'd rip the whole system out and bring it back to costco.
