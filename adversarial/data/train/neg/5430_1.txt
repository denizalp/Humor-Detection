worst scheduling system ever, appointment for 12:45pm and did not call me 1.5hrs later,  other patient in the lobby are complaining and everyone is agitated about the situation. Dr is not helpful, not listening, no care, total waste of time and effort. Clean facility and friendly front desk staff but the system is unacceptable.
