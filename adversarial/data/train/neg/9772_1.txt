My best friend and I had reservations on May 28, 2017 at 6:00 pm. We wear seated and told the waiter we had tickets to see the Celine Dion concert at 7:30 pm. He assured us we would be on time since \"... we are fast and everything is woked.\" He took our order, we waited patiently then by 7:05 pm we had to ask the waiter where our food was. He went and checked and he told us our ticket got skipped over. Our food had to be cooked on the fly but by the time we got anything to eat it was 7:10!!! We ate what we could but for $66.00 per person we got ripped off. Let me clarify, we didn't eat . We took small bites of our food and from what I could taste.. the food was ok. The manager took $23.00 off our bill for the inconvenience! I will never come back. And, we were the only ones who had issues. We rode the evaluator down with a couple who just told the manager to Kiss him because he expects a kiss when he gets F**ked. Then, at the concert a couple behind us was complaining of the \"... hard time they had at Mr.Chow.\" Save yourself the trouble. I expected more from an establishment such as Mr.Chow. I will never go back.
