I eat at Basil Thai all the time, as it's right around the corner from my house.  Food is excellent, I've tried the Mango Salad, Soups, Pad Sew, and Red Curry Chicken.  Prices are very reasonable - under $10 for most entrees.  Service is good as well - the manager\/owner is very nice.  They remember me every time I come in.
