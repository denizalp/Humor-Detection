I have been here a few times. Always just getting food to go. The pastas (gnocchi and ravioli) is nothing to write home about but is pretty good. The calzones however are amazing!!! The dough is fantastic!!! A must try. (Beware the staff can be moody but they mean well - a family owned restaurant - I hope they never retire)
