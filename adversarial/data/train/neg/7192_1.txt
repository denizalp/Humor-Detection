I went to Michael's at the old location and had always liked it.  With the move to a new location, I had higher expectations.  \n\nYesterday was my first time to the new location.  And I really do like the decor and the various levels.  But I do feel like the main entertainment area is too small for the crows that you draw.  \n\nThe service last night was awful!  My group sat at a table for 20 minutes and never saw a waitress.  I I went upstairs, figuring we had to order at the bar and bring it back.  I waited at the bar for 10 minutes, for the bar tender to make three drinks and add ice to a drink.  And when I asked how we get food and drinks  downstairs, she informed me that there were three waitresses down there.  Now that area is not so large that I would miss the waitresses!  Anyway, I went back downstairs and waited.  A waitress finally appeared and we ordered drinks and food.  We got our drinks fifteen minutes later.  ONE HOUR later, we finally got our food!  We ordered another round of drinks.....They never came.  We just gave up and closed our tab.\n\nMoral of the story....Don't go for the food....Or make sure to bring a bag of chips to tie you over!!\n\nThe entertainment was awesome!  Flight 407 is very talented, energetic, and engaging.
