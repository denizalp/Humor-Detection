I want to start off by saying that I have been to many Mexican restaurants in my life, having lived in the Southwest for many years and traveled the world while in the Navy.  This is one of the best I've ever eaten in if not the best! The service, drinks and food are all outstanding. The atmosphere is fun and upbeat and the decor is authentic and unique. I can't recommend this place enough.
