Went on a Groupon with 3 other family members. We did the Library and ended up grouped with 5 others. Most of us had done at least 1 escape room before and we felt this was at least comparable. If you have the option, I would consider getting a private room so you don't have to work with people you don't know (who could potentially make the experience either better or worse). In our case it worked well. The negative of having a small group is that you have less help collecting clues all over the room, though the positive is that it reduces the chaos\/potential personality conflicts. If you want to break records though, the staff keep a record of top times for each size group to help account for this. We set a new record for our size group in the Library!
