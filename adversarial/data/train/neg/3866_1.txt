Best value you'll find for a great plate of food. The pork spine is so good and worth a try if they have it.\n\nYou can't beat the price and the selections are interesting. There is no English or French menu. You just punt at the prepared buffet style food and she loads up the plate. Best meal in the area for under $10.
