I just wanted to let people know that Della in the Deli section was awesome today! She noticed our large pre-order wasn't quite right and fixed it for us. When I thanked her, she said she was happy to do it and wanted us to keep coming back. That kind of service doesn't exist much these days. Thank you!!
