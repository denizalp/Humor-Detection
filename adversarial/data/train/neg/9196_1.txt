Individual hotpot | Beer | Paid per dish | Not AYCE | Berkshire pork | Waygu beef | Angus beef | Seafood\n\nMon - Fri: 4pm - Midnight\nWeekends Noon - midnight\n\nPrices range from $3 - $9\/ small or large pot (soup base only) to start. Then each item and dipping sauce is extra per order (see menu attached in photo). \n\nThis hotpot is not an all you can eat hot pot restaurant.\n\nBecause it's not like your usual AYCE, you order and you forget the cost of it after a while. You'd be surprised at the total at the end. But the quality is there for their meat, seafood and other items. They do offer platters for their categories so you can try a bit of everything. They do have draft beer for $9 a jug. It's equivalent to about under 4 pints. \n\nThe meat platter came with pork, beef and lamb slices for $8\/order.\nTheir seafood platter came with shrimp, oyster, squid tentacles, surf clam, cuttle fish, mussels, squid, and imitated crab meat. \n\nOverall I enjoyed the quality of food here. Their restaurant is clean and bright. I would come back here.
