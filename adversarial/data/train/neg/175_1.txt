My husband and I have three rescues: Enzo, Andraia and Brylee. Enzo and Andraia can be washed by us in the provided self-wash tubs or at home but Brylee needs to be professionally groomed. \nToday, when my husband picked up my TEN POUND dog from the groomer, we were informed that Brylee had become so stressed during the grooming, she popped A blood vessel in her eye! \nBrylee is 3, and we have been told she is not the best behaved while being groomed... However, the groomer said: \"She is not a good dog and she bit me\"... Then tell me why they continued to cut her hair and trim her?! The second she was showing signs of high digress (crying, biting), the groomer should have stopped and called us to pick up our bad dog; not continue and traumatize her more... Brylee does not have one popped blood vessel, she has several, in BOTH EYES.\nI was not the one to pick her up, but if I had I would not be writing this review; I would have said what needed to be said to the owner. \nTo add insult to injury, the store still charged us... What I would give to have her not fully groomed, but also not have popped blood vessels FROM STRESS!\nAs I said, all of my dogs are rescues, and I do a lot to ensure I give them a good life- for them and to somewhat honor all the other dogs I wish I could save. It breaks my heart she was abused in such a way and had to live through such a traumatic event; I feel as if I failed her. I will no longer do business with Barking Dogs and I will do what is necessary in order to ensure no one I know takes their beloved pets to such an establishment... I hope the owner reads this and can understand how big of a deal this is; I don't care if it is common in stressed pets; she should have NEVER been so upset in the first place.
