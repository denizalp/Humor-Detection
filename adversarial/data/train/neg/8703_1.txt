This shopping center seems to struggle to keep restaurants around. My family has been wanting to try Stella since it opened (reopened? Not sure what exactly happened with Central Bistro, which I really liked) and we didn't make it in until this weekend. The decor and vibe is very similar. It feels like it wants to be trendy.. but we went in for dinner around 6:30 on Saturday and were shocked to see hardly anyone there. Maybe two other tables and a few people at the bar. The lack of patrons made our appearance pretty obvious and we were sat and greeted by a waiter quickly. I felt the food menu was limited but what I did end up ordering I loved! I really felt like the taste and quality of the food was top notch. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal. The service declined throughout the night though - the place eventually started to fill in and we had a difficult time getting our server's attention. A food runner brought out the meal and a busser took away the dishes and we didn't see them until we really wanted the check. Not sure what was going on. Was it just an off night? Are we boring people who went to dinner too early? Was there some sort of bad omen we didn't know about? I think we'd go back and give it another shot, it just didn't wow anyone.
