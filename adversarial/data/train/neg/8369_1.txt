Well we were very stoked to come check this out. The menu changes all the time. Today was the 40 day dry aged sirloin. We ordered it medium rare. Sadly it came out medium. Pretty disappointed being this is a place with a butcher on property and it was their cut of the day. Our waitress was awesome and apologized many times. We also never got our lamb ribs. But on a good note, all the other food we ordered was fantastic. Calamari, cauliflower, steak tartare, shrimp and grits, smoked cheddar sausage,  corn dogs, and the bone marrow. All delicious. We do recommend it. Come get u some!!
