It had been many years since I went to this Friday's location, since my wife and I used to venture that way to go here, or Max & Erma's next door when it was open.  This will probably be my last time ever.  I ordered the 'Dragon Glaze salmon', and it was just average, and 'honey they shrunk the portions' too, apparently.  The amount of rice and veggies they gave me, as well as the salmon, was pathetically small.  They also did not have the 'Jack Daniels salmon', as they had years ago, and the prices have shot way up.  Lately, i've noticed many chain restaurants cutting their portions, lowering food quality, and raising prices.  At this point, methinks i'll just stick to smaller family owned and run diners and restaurants where I can get good portions at good 'value driven' prices!  Dissapointed.
