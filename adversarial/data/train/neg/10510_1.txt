We tried Stumpys after a recommendation from a friend when we moved into the neighborhood. Nothing but great things to say. The pizza is bomb, the sandwiches are fantastic, and I think I foodgasmed just a bit over my calzone tonight. It showed up 25 min after ordering, hot, fresh, and delicious. Our new go to pizza place.
