I stopped in for some brunch 10.30.16 and scored a nice little comfy seat outdoors. I did get the opportunity to check out the inside will do next visit. \n\nOur waitress recommended a seasonal apple cider Sangria and to be honest I regret her pleasant recommendation. By far the worst Sangria I've tried.\n\nThe Truffle Grilled cheese was absolutely amazing and I enjoyed every bite. Worth every calorie!! $13\n\nI ordered the Weekend Fritatta (w\/o chicken) and it was pretty bland. $14\n\nMy first time sampling Monkey Bread and it was delicious. $9\n\nDessert was a bread pudding banana foster with ice cream and it was warm sweet and yummy! \n\nI definitely see myself returning for dinner only though. The calamari looks so delicious and I can't wait to try it!
