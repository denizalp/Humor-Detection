I have ATTEMPTED to order from Augies 2 times now.  the first was on a Sunday around 2pm........was told they dont start delivering till 4pm.......didnt order that time.  the second time was this past weekend.  I called Sunday to order a small pizza.......was told i needed to order $15 worth of food to get it delivered.....needless to say i have not tried this place nor do i have the desire to.  Why make it so difficult to get a pizza delivered?
