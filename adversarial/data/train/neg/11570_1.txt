They packed  the wrong order. Ordered chilli chicken handed my friend chicken balls or something. No cutlery, napkins, soy sauce or plum sauce for the veg roll. My friend who had no idea what my order would or should have been was kind enough to bring it over.  I called back to inquire and the lady on the phone told me that those chicken balls are in fact \" Chilli chicken\". Although I could see it with my own eyes at this point, She wasn't convinced. I said never again and decided to not pull missions to get back to the store. I can tell you now that the Chicken balls and friend rice were bland and tasteless. I dont know what parts of chicken are being used to make those as I got alot of hard cartilage and hard bits. It had to be tossed after 4-5 bites.
