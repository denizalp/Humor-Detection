My husband and I came here for our first wedding anniversary. We had been looking forward to it for weeks after reading very positive reviews, but unfortunately we were a bit disappointed. We were expecting a relaxed romantic meal, but instead it was rushed. The server forgot our appetizer, which mean that all of our food came right away. They gave us free dessert, as a result, which was nice, but we still felt we spent a lot of money for a meal that felt rushed and not special. The pizza was really good, so I might go back, but probably not for a special occasion.
