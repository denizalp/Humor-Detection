The place to go when you are craving just about anything. Theres meat, carbs, veggies and that hint of spice if you are into that...plus the guac is free! \n\nI always saw the place completely packed Saturday nights and there was a reason to it. The portions are large despite the price and its a easy meal (cant call it a snack due to its size) to down after an insane night out at a club. The only problem is the lineups!! Other than that just wish the place was more spacious. \n\nGo for the halibut! But safest bet is to go with the chicken:)\nP.S. If you ask for a mix, they give you more!
