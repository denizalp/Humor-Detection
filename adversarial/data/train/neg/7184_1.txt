I went into Auto Zone today to purchase windshield wipers for both of my trucks.  I walk in, no one said hello.  I walked over to the section where the wipers are and there was a guy associate there who walked off when I got there and there was a lady associate there as well that was making small talk with someone else.  I noticed there was a book to which I assumed I needed to look for the wipers so I did.  I picked up one set but certainly was confused because heck, I've never done this before.  \nI walked off for a quick second and another customer came in a went to the book looking for the same thing.  I waited form him finish.  I looked up the other blades and grabbed those too.  \nI went to the register to check out and asked the guy if he could tell me if they could make a key for one of my trucks.  He said, \"uhhhh I don't know, I'm one of they new guys.  One of those could probably tell.\"  Do you think he asked one of those guys? Let me answer, he did not.  He did however talk about how he was ready for lunch so he could go home.  Do you think he asked me if I needed help putting them on? Let me answer that as well, no.  Maybe there aren't supposed or maybe the rain deterred him, I have not idea.  I do know that even though they literally right across the street from where I live, I will think twice about going there again.
