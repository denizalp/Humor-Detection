The quality, speediness and taste of the sandwiches of this location is no different than the awesomeness of the Camelback location. So this review is to comment on the employees. As I pulled into a parking space, one employee was leaving on a delivery. He smiled big and waved to me. What a nice gesture! \n\nIt was late in the afternoon and there were no other customers inside. There were two employees, with their backs to the door, leaning against the counter, up against each other. When they heard me walk in, they quickly turned and separated. Now I know they are teenagers, and madly in love, but it was very unprofessional. They should at least be turned to see the door, so they when a customer is approaching! They were still polite and sold me some of yesterday's bread (soooo delicious and so worth the $0.45\/each!). He was even friendly and asked what I'd be making with them. Sandwiches. Duh. I did tell them, though, about the yummy carne asada tortas we had made with them a couple weeks ago!
