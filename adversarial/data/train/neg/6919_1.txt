Dishonest sales mislead you to get you into contract then hide behind it.  They are however very friendly. This location is a franchise so beware signing up at this location. Was promised a special travel pass for corp locations that allows you to go for 6 months. After signing contract went to a few days later for this pass and was given a 14 day pass. In my current location they have only corp gyms so I was unable to use my membership here. Barely 2 weeks as a member and already with the games . Called and spoke with the mgr at this location and he could care less. You cant believe anything they tell you. Also they use a 3rd party billing company so needless to say they don't communicate one refers you to the other and you never get anywhere. Finally I was told by the mgr at this location that once i signed up with a corp gym that would cancel my franchise membership without any fees or charges . I'm still going back and forth because i now have two memberships some how. ******beware do not signup at this location **** i signed up with 4 friends present witnessing what the sales rep lied about and the manager would only overtalk and yell at me .
