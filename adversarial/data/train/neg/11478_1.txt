It's a solid 2. \n\nThere is a plethora, PLETHORA array of items. Almost too much, because they have no specific genre, everything looks a tad off the mark. \n\nFrom the salad, to the carving station, to the sushi, to the Mexican food... it is just all over the place.\n\nThe free mimosas kind of suck. Not the actual drink, the drink is awesome all the time. Mimosas never disappoint. The line though sucks, you can only get one at a time... \n\nIf you have a coupon or its free, then eh. Sure, go for it. But if you're paying full price, there's better out there for your money.
