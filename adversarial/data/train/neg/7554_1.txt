Table booked few days before. Arrived 15 mins early, the waiter told us they gave our table to another person.  We notice on the table booking sheet they wrote 'haven't arrive' beside it.  So we question the remarks bedside our name.  The waiter told us it was mistake.  It was very disappointing.  \nFood wise parents come here for dimsum.  To be honest, food are mediocre.  There are way more chinese restaurant have better standard.
