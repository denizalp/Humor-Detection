Other than the fact that the hotdogs are pure deliciousness, JP saves the night when you have a late night craving! If available, try the Barnyard. Shredded chicken, pulled pork, bacon, sriracha and cheese all atop a perfect dog, it is always my go-to! When he doesn't have all the fixings on deck, you still won't be disappointed with JP's knack for perfect flavor combinations.
