I went there with my own fabric, asking her to make some curtains for my girls' room. The Dimensions were small 2 windows at 20 in X 20 in, and 3 at 16 in X 16 in. She quoted me at $500. Ha ha ha good one! That's crazy! I don't care how good she is, that's ludicrous! I found someone on Craigslist who did same work for $60.
