If you're going to eat - go early and go hungry! Wings are very good. Sandwiches are MONSTERS! Flatbreads are good too. We actually prefer the bar seats - less wait time and we like to see their beer taps. Speaking of beer - bring your growler cause you're gonna wanna take some beer home with your leftovers. No growler? You can buy one there. PS: Last time I checked there is a gift shop discount at the bottom of your receipt you can use to buy your growler (not good on the fill up though).
