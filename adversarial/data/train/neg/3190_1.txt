It's the worst place in Phoenix to be a parts runner & have to go get parts. The lady who accepts the payments is horrible.. She either makes the office fax over all kinds of forms to pay over the phone, or if your company gives you a credit card to try & get around her, she will make them fax the form's over anyway because your name is not on the card. \n\nShe knows you because she has done this to you many times before & she will make you wait about 45 mins every time.. Your company has to pay you for standing around waiting. There have been 4 or 5 parts runners waiting in there with me more than once. \n\nThis is 100% power trip.. she thinks it's funny, will laugh about it.. says it's because of fraud.. but when she has seen you as many times as she has seen me, and she has a copy of my drivers liscense with my address on it.. it's not like I could get away with anything.. this is all power trip.. & it is far from amusing...
