Usually when I'm super hungry everything tastes good. But this place is disgusting. I'm not even picky about food that much - especially Chinese food. Their noodle sauce was sooooooo bland. We ordered class and when we got our dish, half of the clam shells in  DID NOT have any clams inside. The beef sauce tastes so salty and weird - it tasted more Korean than Chinese. Their service is terrible. Terrible terrible terrible. Waited like 7 minutes to be seated when there were plenty of seats available. Never checked up on us. The worst Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. DONT GO HERE
