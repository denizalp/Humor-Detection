A hidden gem in the strip mall on 40th and Thomas. Super friendly and welcoming. I have really thick eyebrows and they did an amazing job cleaning and shaping them without making them look like McDonalds \"m\" arches, would definitely recommend checking this place out, oh and for $8 it's definitely a steal!!
