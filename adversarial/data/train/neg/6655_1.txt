This place is super legit. I needed to get my frame checked after a sideswipe and also had some odds and ends to get done on a friend's car, they squeezed me in last minute more than once and banged out the work in short order. Miguel is a great dude, explained everything that was going on and even apologized for putting tiny scratches on the underside of the hatch of the car when putting new struts in because they basically needed a wrecking ball to get the old ones out. The car is 18 years old so it wasn't even a thing, but that kind of honesty is refreshing and basically unheard of in this town. He has skills and definitely knows what he's doing. Lily up front is great and always friendly and accommodating on the phone. Their prices are very reasonable, I won't be taking my cars anywhere else.
