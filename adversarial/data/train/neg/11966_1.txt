My first visit here was awesome (5 stars), so I returned with a friend. \n\nSadly, the second visit was disappointing. My friend ordered a side of cole slaw and didn't like it. So he asked for a new side of fries instead. The fries that were brought out to him were very dark, greasy, and inedible. We looked around at the other diners around us to see if everyone's fries were like that, and they were not. It definitely felt like we were given bad fries because he didn't like his first side of cole slaw. We would have gladly paid extra for the 2nd side, rather than getting burnt fries for free. \n\nThe rest of the food was spot on but I think this instance shows the restaurant's attitude about complaints. They can't accept a complaint when a customer doesn't like something, and they will retaliate by giving you another sub-par side.  Maybe I'm looking too far into this but it was telling that everyone else's fries looked perfect and delish.
