I really enjoyed the food here!...almost everything we had was great!\n\nI like the play on fusion tapas, while still putting out solid sushi!  Some of my favorites were the Poke Nachos, Wagyu Sliders,  Hookipa Roll, and Screaming Da Kine!\n\nI am not a huge fan of the layout inside.  The restaurant is long and skinny...a little tight feeling...the seats aren't jam packed in here, but it's obvious that seating and serving was the focus as opposed to ambiance...not a place a I want to go for a date...not nice enough to be nice or gritty enough to draw me in..stuck in the middle. \n\nCome here for Happy Hour (weekdays before 6pm)\nCome here with a Village Square Ticket Stub\nCome here for a playful\/subtle take on Hawaiian  Fusion\nCome here for solid Sushi
