The worst chili's dinner I have ever had. It was an unpleasant dinner experience for the whole family. The service and the food was horrible. \nThe food may look good in the pictures, but it was not. The fajita was burnt and I didn't enjoy it at all. They didn't get the orders correct for any of us. \nThey crammed a family of 8 in the front of the restaurant. It was cramped and we had to have two separate tables away from each other. \nWe waited for an hour and a half for this horrible dinner. \nI don't recommend this restaurant nor would I return to give them another opportunity to disappoint.
