I was really excited because this looks like a really cute place. But the service was awful. I came in and stood by the hostess stand waiting for my party, no one greeted me or came to the front. The manager? and the bartender also ignored me, even though I was 3 feet from them. When the hostess finally came, it was to tell me she would be with me in 10 mns, like I was bothering her. Then we sat at our table for 15 mns before anyone came over. Food was good, HORRIBLE service.
