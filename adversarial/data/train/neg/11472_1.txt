I had been here once about three years ago, but didn't remember much. I went again for a late Saturday night date night with my boyfriend. It was pretty busy, so we were sat at the bar. We thought it would be unpleasant to sit at, but it was awesome seeing the chefs work and there was tv in sight too! \n\nAt the bar seat, you can see all the fish that the chefs are working with and it's awesome. I ordered a rainbow roll and he order some chicken udon noodle soup. My rainbow roll was personally handed to me by the chef that made it, which was awesome. Later, my boyfriend and I split the tootsie roll! It was delicious and the eel sauce was awesome. \n\nThis is a great place to have a date or just a nice sushi meal to yourself. The goldfish neon lighting above the bar gives it a good aesthetic. Definitely coming back for my new favorite sushi spot.
