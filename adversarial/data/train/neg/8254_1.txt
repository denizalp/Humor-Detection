My husband and I stopped in here for the first time last lift for late night happy hour - on a Saturday! Which was really nice to find since most restaurants don't have happy hours on the weekend.\n\nThe service was fantastic! I couldn't tell you who my server was because it seemed like every time something was brought to our table it was someone different. But not in a bad way at all. It felt as if everyone on the staff cared about all of the tables not just their own.\n\nIt is a smaller restaurant - nice ambience with a sushi bar or tables to sit at inside. I saw they had tables outside as well. \n\nWe got the California roll and Shrimp Tempura & they were really good. \n\nWe decided to try the crazy roll which was a fried cream cheese, avocado, crab roll. Very good and very rich!\n\nWould definitely come back to this place. Great service - good came out quick and always had a fresh drink.
