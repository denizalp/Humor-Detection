Had dinner with a group of 14. The staff was amazing at accommodating our party. They moved tables and seats to make us comfortable. The food was great I tried the shrimp lettuce cups...they were delicious! The oyster shooters were also very good. The music and atmosphere was very upbeat and fun. our waitperson, Taylor did an amazing job getting us our food and drinks out quickly. The manager, Dave was also very accommodating. Very good experience!!!! Definitely going back!
