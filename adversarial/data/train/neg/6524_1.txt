Love this place!! \nI saw Annie for my first visit at EWC and she was fantastic! My Brazillian was 50% off b\/c it was my first visit and she even squeezed in an underarm for me at the last minute. I never felt uncomfortable at all and she was super easy to talk to. European Wax Center is great to their clients and offer many incentives for pre and rebooking and referrals. I will definitely be back and would totally recommend this place to anyone looking for excellent customer service and a quick, efficient and almost painless wax service. As a woman who has worked in the beauty industry for 6+ years I can honestly say that the wax used here is much better than what you would find anywhere else! The wax they use is so easy on the skin and practically painless. Book your next wax service here!!!
