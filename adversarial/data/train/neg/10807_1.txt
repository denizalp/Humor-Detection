We went in on an early afternoon. The place was busy but not packed. Placed our order and waited and waited and waited. We notice several people sitting next to us getting their orders ten minutes after sitting down. We went to complain and they said that the pesto chicken crepe takes longer. I'm not buying that. 40 minutes later our crepes came.\n\nThe food was good but I think the looonnnngggg wait left a bitter taste in our mouth.  Coffee very good as well.\n\nWe will try this place again but if we wait another 40 minutes and see other people get their orders before us despite seating after us, this review will be changed. We really want to stay in Chandler and support the small biz but we didn't like being insulted on our first visit here.
