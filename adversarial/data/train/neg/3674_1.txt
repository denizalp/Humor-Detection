I have had nothing but problems with Charter's internet and occasionally the digital cable boxes, on top of the sky high prices. The WI-FI is always going out, I mean always. I have been in the middle of completing an online assignment and had to turn my work in by a certain time and day, but was late due to the internet going out (another outage). The outage lasted until the next morning. I just had to call Charter again today because now, the Wi-Fi box is now completely bad!\nThe bill is outrageous and as one other reviewer put it, they give good prices to the new customers while the prices for current customers constantly rises. The digital boxes are confusing when ordering movies and slow when loading the Guide.\nIt's a Monopoly with Charter, but hopefully some real competition will come in and have better prices and quality services.
