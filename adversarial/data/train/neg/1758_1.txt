the best thing about TMI is their happy hour where you can choose from about 7 draft beers for $2.50.  i tried their humboldt brown ale which is brewed with hemp seeds (go figure) and added it to my list of favorites. i also tried their main ale which was decent, had a kind of funky after taste but light enough to compliment the warm sunny afternoon.  for food, i went with the cooney dog while my friend opted for the grilled cheese and my gf went with the tuna. the hot dog was definitely the standout.  anything made with schreiner's sausage is going to be delicious and the baguette it was served on gave it an interesting twist. nothing says a wednesday afternoon like an ice cold beer and a delicious dog.  \n\nthe other two sandwiches were forgettable, as were the house-made chips which were greasy, soft, and lacked any flavor (they needed salt).  the sun was beating in on us at 3 in the afternoon and the shades they had in there did little to block it out. our service was spotty, it took about 20 minutes to get our food when the place wasn't that busy. i was rather disappointed in this cute coronado grub spot.
