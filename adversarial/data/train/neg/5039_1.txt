It's a very typical sized NoFrills located inside a small commuter mall\/arcade of  the two residential buildings attached to it. The aisles are clean and they do a good job at keeping it organized unlike some NoFrills where it looks like a hurricane hit them. \n\nNoFrills isn't just a name, it's a concept where there are NO luxury items and the store is full of industrial lighting and industrial open rack shelving. The employees are there for stock purpose only and not to help you hand on foot. Some may answer, but it isn't their job to so - so stop complaining about poor store ethics... NoFrills isn't just a name it's a concept NO FRILLS...\n\nWhich also means no luxury items like organic foods or other specialty foods normally found in their Loblaws version of the store. So marking them down based on their lack of organic's. It's a discount store and because they're affiliated with Loblaws but don't operate the same rules or service. Their employees are not there to help you in any way. You can ask, but ultimately it isn't their job to do so. \n\nI love how close they are to a subway station (Sherbourne). Now only if that station had handicap facilities in both directions it would be helpful. They have an escalator that goes UP, but to go down we have to trek down the long three flights of the usual 12-15 steps found in the TTC system.
