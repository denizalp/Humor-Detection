I came and ordered their pistachio macaroon, velvet cupcake and chocolate mousse cupcake, all of which were simply too sweet. Being sweet is not necessarily a problem, but ither than that, there was nothing else. Was quite disappointed. However, their customer service wad pretty good, hence the two stars.
