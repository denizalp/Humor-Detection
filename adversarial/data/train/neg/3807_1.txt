had the rosa, wiseguy and margherita pizzas!  all excellent!  Tried a local wine from cochise county and was pleasantly surprised.  Server was very good; however the hostess was hesitant to seat us.   We arrived on a saturday at 5:30 and they had reservations arriving at 7pm.   I had to promise we woukd have wine and pizza fast.  All ended up just fine.  Mangia!!
