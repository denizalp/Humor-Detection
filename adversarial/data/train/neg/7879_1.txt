I read an article online, \"The 100 most delicious foods\",  that said that  Massaman Curry was the number 1 most delicious food. Obviously I had to try it. Fortunately, I found the Pan Asian restaurant and was amazed at how good this dish is. I went back a second time to see if it was as good as I remembered and it was even better since I asked for a little less spice. Both times I was there, I was the only car in the lot and the place looked closed to me. A small sign said \"open\" so I went in. \n\nI'll be back soon.
