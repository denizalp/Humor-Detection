I took my colleagues to their first escape room. We chose The Mayan Curse because the description implied that it would work for that sort of group. Having been to other well rated games in the GTA and heard rave reviews about Escape Games I was underwhelmed. Now I've also heard that this was one of their older games and it's due for a refresh, so I'm still willing to try out the others. The puzzles themselves were overall well done, and quite tactile at times.
