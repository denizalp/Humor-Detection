The location is literally on the subway line right at Jane station. The salon is clean, bright and very welcoming. Karla did my wax, Brazilian and upper lip. She was fast, thorough and professional.  The services were exceptional, down to the toiletries provided in each room.  Would definitely recommend and will be returning!!
