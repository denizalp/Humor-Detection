I was recently meeting someone who didn't know the neighbourhood too well around Yonge and St Clair, and I suggested Scallywags, simply because you can't miss it. It's a yellow, three-storey monster (rooftop patio included) with a dozen or so international flags hanging off its fa√ßade. I didn't get the full appreciation of Scallywags' capacity at the time, since it was early on a weekday evening, and the place was pretty dead.\n\nThey have a respectable, if not too exotic, selection of good beers on tap, and seem to strike the balance between sports bar and pub. Their website even lists upcoming international sports broadcasts (mostly soccer), so you can know when's best to go (or stay away, depending on your tastes).
