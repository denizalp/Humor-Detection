I went here for nye. Great service from the staff. Liked the Gin menu. Nice atmosphere. Table for 4...we love sharing...so we tried several things. Some of the dishes fell short. There were of course some good ones though. It was a 50\/50 toss up of good\/needs work. But for the price, we were hoping for a higher winning percentage. We will come back in a few months after things are a bit more solid.\n\nGood: BACALAO EN ACEITE; my husband ate a lot of this growing up with Mediterranean food. He thought this was done well. CHORIZO; excelente. OXTAIL; rich and tasty. PULPO; the octopus was cook perfectly. Not a pencil eraser rubber. PATO ESCABECHE; this was a smoky flavored duck that resembled pork (although I would have rather had the duck flavor not be overpowered by the smoke). The fruit it was paired with was marvelous. \n\nNot my style....could be yours:\nCRAB BUTTER AND TARRAGON CHURRO; definitely for sharing with more than 2 people. Too rich by itself. 2-3 bites and everyone couldn't do anymore. PIGS FEET AND CHEEKS; 1 from my table liked it, I was indifferent. Wasn't bad, but didn't wow me. Was like an egg roll. LAMB EN MORENO; a bit gristley.\n\nMissed the mark for everyone:\nSPIDER CRAB DEVILED EGG; I love deviled eggs. They are meant to be a vehicle of flavor. These were surprisingly bland. QUESO DE CABRA; something about the overly smokey cheese & spiced quince that combined to have a plastic flavor. This was the whole tables least favorite item.
