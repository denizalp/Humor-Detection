I went in to experience a few tastings during happy hour, but ended up experiencing a culinary delight! The staff was very helpful in suggesting what to begin with so we tried them all! Garlic chicken- crisp yet moist and flavorful. Garlic edamame spicy and tantalizing. Fried eggplant with a wasabi mayo dipping alongside a tropical saketini. At prices from $5-10, half off sushi, and $6 saketinis it was a great deal for awesome food and drink. We will go back!
