Great food. We started with the beef yorkie. FANTASTIC. I had the butter chicken and it was better than most Idian restaurants.\n\nI was also with a business associate and he had the Ruban sandwich. He said it was great and recommended it to his friend who arrived after we finished eating.\n\nAs the place got busier, the service started to decline. This location only has bar top tables inside.\n\nThere is two patios. One on the ground floor and one on the roof. I hear the upstairs patio has a limited menu.\n\nOverall, we agreed that we would return again.
