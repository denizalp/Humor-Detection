Both the food and ambience left a memorable experience, which is why I am reviewing this place.\n\nVery cosy environment for dinner.   We came with a big group but it is suitable for dinner dates too.\n\nDefinitely want to come back and try other items in menu.   \n\nThe meatball and Brussel sprout slaw were quite memorable.
