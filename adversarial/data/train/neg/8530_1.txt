My husband and I frequent this establishment often. The staff is always very friendly and quick, which we like. We love their Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza, but they've taken it off the menu. Most of the time they'll make it for us anyways, but a couple times, when ordering via phone we were denied our special request.
