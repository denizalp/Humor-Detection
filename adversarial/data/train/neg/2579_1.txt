One of my favorite french brunch places in pittsburgh!!!\n\nI've tried several of their crepes and french toasts, and they've never failed me once! When I think of crepes, I think of a sweet dessert so I've only had one savory crepe here - the Alaskan - but even that one daring switch to savory wasn't a bad try at all. I love their french toasts the most, though. They're as fluffy as can get and never too sweet. I've tried their regular french toast with added strawberries on top, and during my most recent visit I ordered the Amsterdam French Toast. It came with turkish sausages, two eggs and a side of maple syrup. It was the perfect mix of sweet and savory. \n\nThere's a rustic yet modern vibe to this little cafe. All the workers and servers are extremely friendly and always give the best service. They all seem like family, which makes me smile when I see their happy interactions in the business.
