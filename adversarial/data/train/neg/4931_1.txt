My wife got the Hokkaido Ramen and the broth was good. We like a rich broth. I found the house tonkatsu to be lacking in flavour. I think a ramen place should have great noodles and the ones here seemed very generic. Price was cheaper than other better ramen places so from that perspective I guess you get what you pay for.
