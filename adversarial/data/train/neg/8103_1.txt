This place and the people that work here are one in a million. It's obvious everyone here has a passion for animals. \n\nI also really appreciate how knowledgeable and honest they are. I've never felt pressured to buy anything or left feeling unsure of what I bought. They are also more than happy to give you (generous) samples of any food you're thinking about buying. They truly want what's best for your pet and care about your satisfaction.\n\nI've been going here for years. There are several places that are much closer to me but I won't go anywhere else. I have 2 tiny dogs so I don't need to go in that often, but they still remember me and the specifics on my dogs. That type of customer service is tough to come by.
