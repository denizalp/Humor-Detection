Walked in here on a Saturday morning. I waited for about 30+ minutes for them to even START on my nails and there were only 3 other women in there.\nFirst off, my nails look terrible!!! I got a gel french tip full set...\nThere are so many air bubbles in my nails that even people notice how there are a bunch of air bubbles in them. :( \nI didn't even notice until I went out in the sun and saw how terrible they were. Second, a woman did my eyebrows... They look WORSE then my nails. They are so thin now. I have naturally thick full eyebrows, and I can't even explain to you how thin and ugly they are now. Completely uneven and unshaped and just terrible. I almost cried when she told me to get up and look at them.\nThe total came to about 35 for nails\nAnd 10 for eyebrows.\nI REGRET EVER GOING THERE! Will NOT be going back!!!!!\nEver!
