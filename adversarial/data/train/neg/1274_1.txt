Hearing about this place for a while from many friends I decided to try it about a year ago now, but have been back many times since. I love that it's comfort food, and my absolute favourite thing to order is the unchicken and waffles ! \nEverything I've had is delicious and personally I always love going to places where I have more than one option to eat. My boyfriend who isn't vegan\/vegetarian also enjoys this place a lot.
