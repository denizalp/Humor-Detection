Overall, the burger was pretty good. But I fear that if I eat here too often, I'll die sooner!\nMy burger was a little overcooked, but I really loved the complimentary condiments that W Burger Bar offered. The patty was a little bland, and could've used a little more seasoning.\nOn the other hand, the thick-cut onion rings really blew my mind off. They were sooo delicious! I totally neglected the fries after tasting the onion rings!
