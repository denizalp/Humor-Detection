They have your standard fast food fare but also several healthier alternatives (would like to have seen some calorie info on the menu, though).  Clean restaurant, polite staff, really good food served FAST!  I had the taco salad and the wife had the crispy chicken salad. Both were very good. The fresh squeezed lemonade was just tart enough to give it a kick and was equally good. It's a little out of our way, but I'll definitely make a point to come back whenever we're in the area.
