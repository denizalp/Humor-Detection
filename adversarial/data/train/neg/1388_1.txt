Jubilee was a truly spectacular and wonderful show.  \nThe sets, the costumes and the performers were all first class.\nNothing vulgar or offensive - just beauty at it's best.\nI heard from a good source that this show is coming to an end\nand won't be around next year. This is really a shame because\nit was truly fully entertaining and I would go see it again and\nagain whenever I find myself in Las Vegas.  \nThe tickets are $99. for better seats, and there are some booklets\naround that have 2 for 1 offers, so with that it is a truly great deal.\nJubilee, Jersey Boiys and \"O\" are my very favorite shows in Vegas\nat the present time.  Don't miss Jubilee....see it now before it\nterminates.
