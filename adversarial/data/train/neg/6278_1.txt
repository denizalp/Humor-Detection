The food here was great. I've walked by this place a dozen times while going to LoLo's Chicken & Waffles at least a dozen times with the kids but never stopped in. My wife and I finally got a chance to go and loved this place. Pho was great, spring rolls were very light and fresh, the peanut sauce for the spring rolls was tasty and the ginger lemonade was very refreshing. The staff was very friendly and would have given 5 stars if our server wasn't so forgetful. He forgot about our drinks and garnishings for the pho twice. The first time I flagged him down for these, then after waiting about 5 min, I walked to the back kitchen area to find him. At least he was apologetic and very nice, so no big deal and I will definitely be going back.
