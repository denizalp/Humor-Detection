This place gets really packed and quite loud. There is a huge beer selection as well as a good food menu. I wasn't in the mood for drinks so I ordered two things off the menu. The lemon pepper wings were awesome, buttery and seasoned just right. The wings were also very large with plenty of meat. The beet chips on the other hand was not crispy at all, and didn't have the best texture. The sauce that came with it was fresh but didn't really taste like anything. For my group, a few of the orders were mixed up as well.
