If you want to bring a woman to a place that she will remember for a long time as a special memory ' take her to the farm house for breakfast - the place is an actual farm - you sit outside under massive trees and look out over natural herb gardens - there is I'd guess a couple acres filled with picnic tables and shaded trees - there was an event with maybe 30 women today and you hardly noticed they were there - they were tucked away in small groups throughout the property - food is all natural - Mexican \/ American while you wait have coffee or lemonade and walk the peaceful grounds - large portions excellent prices friendly wait staff it's just an amazing concept very well executed
