Carleen was amazing. She greeted me with a smile as soon as I walked in. She immediately went to a register and asked me if she could help me. She was GENUINELY very engaging and interested in how my day was going. Upon paying and receiving my order she thanked me and asked me to return soon. \n\nWhile I was sitting my meal, a toddler was crying and the parents were trying to pacify him, but were unable to. Carleen observed from behind the counter. She brought over a small toy for the child  which made him stop crying. The parents were delighted and thanked her. She didn't have to do anything, but she did. It's great to see brand representatives do nice things for customers because they want to...not because it's their job or want to be noticed doing it. Bravo Carleen...Bravo!!!!
