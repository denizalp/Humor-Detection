We got into town and were hungry. We looked up pizza on Yelp reviews and found Payless pizza with good reviews. After we saw the variety and pictures we decided to go with cheesesteak sandwiches (with onion, mushroom and bell pepper), salad and garlic knots. My brother-in-law came along and they ordered a large meat pizza. Vinny (the owner) and the guys working tonight we're very friendly and helpful. We got back to our timeshare and everyone started eating- the food was very warm\/hot and fabulous! There was complete silence, other than a few \"mmm's\" for a few minutes. I would highly recommend food from here. They have a few tables you could eat at, a mini mart just around the side of the building for adult beverages...and did I mention the food was still piping hot when we got back to our place?\nWe went back for pizza three nights later, this time we ordered the Payless Special and a cheese pizza for the kids. Both pizzas were scrumptious and my son, who normally just eats cheese had some of the Payless Special, said it was so yummy he wanted seconds! \nEverything we've had from Vinny's Payless Pizza has been fabulous! Highly recommend!
