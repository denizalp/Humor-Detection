Crazy good bbq and an equally crazy wait!\n\nWhat to get:\n- Brisket.  This is definitely the best brisket I've ever had. The fatty brisket is melt-in-your-mouth-good.  \n- Cole slaw.  It's on the lighter side with not a lot of dressing.  \n\nTips:\n- Get there early and avoid going on a Saturday.  I arrived at 10:15 am on a Saturday and had to wait in line until 1 pm.  They were definitely running low on brisket by the time I ordered.\n- The line takes a while because there is typically only one person cutting and serving meat.  There is also only one cash register, which definitely adds to the wait.  The food is worth the wait, but having such a small staff definitely makes the wait longer than it needs to be.
