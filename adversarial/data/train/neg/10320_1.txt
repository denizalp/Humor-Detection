Save your time, money, and future frustrations...shop elsewhere!  In November we purchased a vanity stool and although it was marked as a 22\" stool when we got it home it was too tall for our space.  We called and were told that if we returned it same day they would just cancel the transaction but if we we returned it tomorrow it would take 2 weeks for the refund.  What????  Okay... well we live in Chandler and weren't likely going to make it back by their closing time so returned the stool the next morning.  A month later we still didn't have our refund.  We called. They said they'd take care of it.  In January still no refund.  We called.  The 'bookkeeper' said that she'd had a death in the family and was out for two weeks so she was behind in her paperwork and no one had done any of her work while she was gone.  I'm sorry...what? You all were running a business over the holiday season without anyone managing your books???? Uhmmmm...okay.  Well, let me give you my name so you can pull out MY refund and process it.  \"Oh no,\" she says. \"I don't need to take your name.  I'm going to catch up on all of them.\"  Famous last words.  February - no refund. March - no refund.  Every time we called - same story...we'll get to it.  We finally disputed the transaction through our bank and got the refund that way.  I'm not sure this place isn't a scam!
