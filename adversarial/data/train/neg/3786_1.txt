It took a while to get the service up to par but it is guided by Chris Bianco... who takes exceptional pride in everything he creates.\n\nSo take advantage of the opportunity...the food is uniquely prepared and outstanding !!!\n\nOne of the few places in the valley ..I recommend without qualifying. Just go !!!!
