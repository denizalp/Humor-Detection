It is so much work to deal with this company.  I need something special ordered.  I have in store credit of much more than the 20 % deposit required, but they will not let me use it.  I called to talk to someone....we are busy and will call right back.  3 hours no call. I called the salesman.  \"I will get the order going and call  you right back....2 hours later I called and he is at lunch.  I have to deal with them to use up my credit...then I am done.  They stand to make money from me, and I feel like I have done all of the work.\n---UPDATE TO REVIEW-----They called me to see what could be done and left a message, but when I try to call back, there is no response.  I don't know what they could do anyway.  I am sure that they are not going to revamp their entire business plan for me.\nI stopped in the store today to talk to a manager about my problems.  She listened, said she was sorry, then turned and walked off.\n----Costco here I come----
