After booking our car here through Costco travel, THEN reading the reviews AFTER, we were quite worried. We've had bad experiences in the past with other companies, and were like oh no, Not again!\n\nWe used this same office in May, now here it is September. We go to pick up our car and the lady tells us that we cannot rent the SUV with a debit card without a deposit, credit check, and two bills. I said we rented here a few months ago and used the same card as always. She said sorry, with debit you can only rent up to a mid size car, no SUV, plus all the other stuff I mentioned. We said how come that wasn't explained to us last time. She said she did not know, and it was probably the people that worked there previously that were fired. Funny, it was only 2 months ago.\n\n We canceled our reservation and went to enterprise. Much better service and only a $300 deposit without using a credit card, and no bills or credit hit required. (Which seems ridiculous) Hit my credit, I'll hit you! \n\nNo wonder they have such bad reviews. It's the terrible customer service, and the way the lady explained it to us, like so sad, too bad for you. \n\n\n \n\nOverall - Terrible. Renter beware
