I loved this caf√© and I'm so glad I found it! The place is so adorable; it's small, well decorated, and authentic! The little terasse where I ate was in a super cute street, with a mural right behind. The food is delicious, and extremely affordable. I love it and I come back from time to time to show off to my friends the amazing resto that I found on yelp
