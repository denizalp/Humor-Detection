Bartenders Jeremy and MichelleMichael were at the top of their game! \nIt was both happy hour and tinga taco night! Jeremy was able to arrange for my tacos to be wrapped in lettuce! \nAmazing. \nWe also got the guacamole (which has pomegranate) and I used as salad dressing on my cien salad. \nIt was all so good!
