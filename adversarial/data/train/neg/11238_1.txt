Had breakfast here at 10 on a Friday morning. There was a 15-20 min wait time so they took our numbers and texted us when our table was ready... \n\nAs we sat down at our table we were instantly greeted with a smile, felt welcomed,and given menus. It was small , almost cramped space but seated comfortably. Nicely lit and bright. We ordered the Nova Scotia with side of Red Velvet pancakes, Steak n Eggs, and the Daisy with a side of sujuk (beef sausage). For drinks we had iced coffee and their juice of the day (mango, turmeric and carrot). \n\nEVERYTHING TASTED GREAT! Food took pretty long but it might just be me spoiled to the fast NYC lifestyle lol.\n\nStaff was great and overall we had a memorable time. Highly recommend and will definitely return when in Toronto.\n\nP.S - Everything is organic and hormone free! their sugar is brown sugar!
