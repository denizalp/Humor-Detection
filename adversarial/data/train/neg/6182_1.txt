Love the food here. Pleasantly surprised. We ate lunch only to return for dinner. So good. The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because the I have ordered 3 different drinks and hated them all.  A regular lemonade: just ok, a mango green tea: no way tasted black and I hate black tea, and a cucumber mint lemonade: hated it but I will say my husband loves that drink so prob just personal choice.
