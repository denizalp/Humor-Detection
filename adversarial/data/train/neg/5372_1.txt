I must say this place is very extra with their decorations. It's very aesthetically pleasing and I love the vibe of this place. We came in a late afternoon and it was our first time so I really took my time and asked allot of questions. I end up getting a Leya with almond milk and honestly I would give the drink a sold 3.5\/5. It tasted a little water down, and the tea flavor is not there yet. I do like the texture of the edible flowers on top and it makes it more interesting. \n\nThe barista definitely took a little bit longer but he was the only one there so I understand. He was very nice and definitely tried his hardest to get our drinks fast. \n\nI'll definitely be back an explore other drinks!
