This place has a wonderful vibe. Think about a place with great confort food, amazing choice of toppings for your hot dog (you can be brave on a scale of 1 to 50 toppings), large selection of beers and add some live music, nice service and big TV screens showing live sports. This is a great place to go, specially to hang out with your friends on a late afternoon.
