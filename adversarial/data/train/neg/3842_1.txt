I think it was rated number 2 restaurant in Montreal on tripadvisor. We actually went to the number one place (europea) and this place was 100 times better! Getting reservations for a Saturday night was pretty difficult, so we ended up having dinner at 9pm.\n\nThe restaurant is small in a cozy not cramped kind of way and all the servers were super sweet. They have an open kitchen concept, so you can watch the chefs do their thing. I asked our server why the place is called \"two monkeys of Montarvie?\" I could totally be butchering this story, but he told me that the original owners were doing some kind of  motorcycle race in a village and got lost. Ever since then they were referred to as the two monkeys. The staff thought that maybe the village they got lost in was Montarvie, but apparently such a village does not seem to exist. I was in a semi delirious state when he was telling me this.. this could all be made up?\n\nThe bread they brought out was warm and very fragrant. I think they sprinkled some cinnamon on it. It came with delicious whipped butter.\n\nSince I was still full, I decided to order the duck ravioli in entree (appetizer) size (4pcs)  and try to leave room for dessert. BIG MISTAKE! The raviolis were very, very thin but chewy and OH SO DELICIOUS. I can honestly say it was the best ravioli I ever had in my life. WAHHHH.. I was soooooo very sad that I didn't just order the main portion. I'm crying inside right now =*(\n\nMy fiance ordered the \"boar belly, braised with beer and soy, accompanied by a parsnip and cauliflower puree, and roasted almonds.\" This was also very delicious but not as delicious as my precious ravioli. \n\nAs much as I wanted to try their desserts, we were both incredibly full and super tired. How much I'd pay.. to have that ravioli again..
