VERY rude and acts like she hates her job. She forgets the meds she has you on. I was on a certain medication PRESCRIBED BY DR. BELLOTA and when I went in there for my appt., she asked me where I got those meds that SHE prescribed and argued with me telling me that it wasn't her even though her name was listed as the prescriber on the bottle. She then switched my meds and gave me two meds that Walgreens wouldn't release to me because they have a reaction if taken together. Her waiting times are over an hour and she sees you for 5 mins tops. Worst psychiatrist ever with the worst attitude EVER and she makes you feel uncomfortable. I have NEVER seen this lady smile in the 6 times I have seen her. Run far away from this \"doctor.\"
