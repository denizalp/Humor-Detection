I really wish I could give this place a better rating as the concept of a quick manual hand wash is appealing as so many automated places miss key spots or don't reach parts of my smaller and probably a bit low riding car. \n\nUnfortunately, while service was fast and the attendants were friendly, I rate a car wash primarily on the wash itself. While I did appreciate that the guys did clean the inside of my car and did a fairly good job, the outside left quite a bit of even dust I suspect came from some of the towels they used to dry the car. There were also a few areas that needed a bit more attention. \n\nI want to try this place again as again being a manual car wash - this could just have been a bad experience but at minimum this place has some advantages as a manual car wash, but also disadvantages as they aren't always consistent in their quality. \n\nBottom line - I can't bring myself to recommend this place because my one data point resulted in an inconsistent clean. However, being a manual wash that cleans outside and in, it might be worth a try if you're in the area.
