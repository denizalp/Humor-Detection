Was sceptical before coming to this place because of the mixed reviews and was pleasantly surprised that it was a decent experience here. \n\nWe came with a party of 8 people with reservations made a week prior. The welcoming was flawless. Our table was set and ready upstairs and there were two of the wait staff around at all times. Very friendly and attentive. I can judge how attentive they were because my friend accidentally knocked over his tea cup and less then a second later a waiter handed us some serviettes. It was like the matrix yo.\n\nAnyway, the food we ordered were all tasty and delicious in my opinion. I really enjoyed the soup filled pork and crab meat dumplings and Peking duck. \n\nThe jianbing was also pretty scrumptious with just the perfect crispiness in each bite.\n\nI will definitely be back here again soon. Keep it up!
