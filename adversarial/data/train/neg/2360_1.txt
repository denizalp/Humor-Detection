This restaurant was in the neighborhood where we stayed while visiting Toronto.  We arrived around noon on a Saturday and told there was a 20 minute wait.  We sat down and flipped through magazines.  We noticed about 6 people left and 2 went in ahead of us and we were quite surprised to see about 6 or so empty tables.  It took forever to order our food.  It took forever for it to arrive at the table.  It took forever for us to get our check.  I hope they were short staffed on that day. Otherwise they don't know what they are doing.  The food was fine.
