Still love this place. We get takeout often and the flavor is always outstanding. When I do dine in it's for lunch and always get the rice bowl. Great sampling of all their wonderful food for a great price. Always had good service and found the place very clean and the staff professional. I had no clue about Indian food until Bay Leaf opened up and it's now become my favorite foreign cuisine.
