Even during CES we managed to get a table and have a delightful dinner. They do have some vegetarian options but don't worry you guys - you'll be satisfied! We ordered the grilled mango salad and I wish I had ordered 3 of them. A super light, refreshing salad that was so tasty. The macaroni and cheese was heavy, rich and to die for. It's a super small serving but you'll want to split it so you don't feel guilty for eating the whole thing. We also ordered the cheese waffle and the only complaint I have about it was that it was lukewarm when it came out. If it was hot like I'm assuming it should have been, then I would have enjoyed it ten times more. The fries were good too but just regular fries. I ordered a coca cola and opted to drink from the bottle which I haven't seen in years so I loved that. The dessert selection was sinful. We ordered the M&M bread pudding with caramelized popcorn and it was just awesome. The bread pudding took almost 15 minutes to come out which was extremely long but when our waiter brought it out, he said it was taken care of because of how long it took. I like that sort of customer service. Didn't give us a chance to make a remark or anything. The atmosphere was spot on - southern rustic. Next time we're in Vegas, we're definitely coming back.
