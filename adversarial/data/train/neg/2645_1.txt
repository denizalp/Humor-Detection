I noticed this place has a banner for the best eggs Benedict, so I decided to stop by and try it.  Ordered a cup of coffee and a spinach and tomato Benedict.  Half way through my coffee and over an hour past the time they open I find out norm can't make the sauce, the waitress asks if I would like something else.  No tell norm to get in the kitchen and do his damn job.  Needless to say I'll never be back.
