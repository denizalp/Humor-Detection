Came here because I was visiting Phoenix and I saw the reviews and I really wanted a cupcake. When I arrived the shop was So cute and I was greeted with friendly service. I was craving a red velvet cupcake and I saw the assorted cupcakes on display all super cute. I picked up one red velvet and one snickerdoodle because it was recommended by the cashier. Did I mention the cute packaging for the cupcakes again super cute! So when I finally dug into my cupcake I was SUPER disappointed because it was nasty! I did not like the icing and I couldn't even eat the rest of the cupcake :( and the snickerdoodle was just ok and I scrapped off the icing because it was also nasty. I don't plan on returning to this place.
