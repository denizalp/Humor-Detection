I used to really like this place, but I ordered online yesterday and was very disappointed.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (which is what I always order from any Indian place) and it had just a really bad flavour to it. I am not sure if it was burnt charcoal or some other burned spice but it overwhelmed everything and was very unpleasant. I believe the flavour was in the tandoor chicken itself. The chicken was tender and the portion was huge, but I just couldn't enjoy it.  The naan bread was also burnt and the veggie pakoras were too doughy.  \n\nThere are many other places nearby that are better...My vote is Banjara for veggie pakoras and definitely Jaipur Grill for Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter chicken - and for vegetarians the Sabzi Malai Methi is great there, too).\n\nNext time, I'll go with the higher prices and go for Jaipur Grill.
