Service was atrocious. First my order was forgotten, for nearly the entirety of the meal. I was only given my order after asking them about it multiple times. That is also when I was told that there is only 1 cook in the kitchen, thus hard to keep up with the orders. Upon finally receiving my order, it came without salt. Unsalted food from a restaurant, unbelievable.
