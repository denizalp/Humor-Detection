I went here on a Thursday afternoon right as they opened up. I ordered the pizza puff that came with fries for my son and the jerk chicken salad for myself. The salad was amazing! I've honestly never tasted jerk chicken with so much flavor. It was delicious! I have to go back soon to order the jerk chicken tacos. I am also looking forward to getting myself sum chicken wings with mild sauce. And eventually trying the waffles as well. The pizza puff tasted no different than any other that I've always had.  The only thing that sucked was there wasn't any Ice for the free punch that they offer ...... Or that their soda machine was out of commission. But that still didn't take away from how delicious the food was. I am glad that I got to go there and eat. Will be back again soon!
