We were flying in to Glendale airport on Saturday and my wife reserved a car for us to be picked up at the airport.  \n\nFriday afternoon (the night before we were supposed to leave) we received a call from \"Armin\" saying that the car would be an extra $40 if we wanted to pick it up at the airport.  He said if we could arrange transportation to his place of business in Peoria he would honor the promised rate.  \n\nI told him that we had made arrangements with his employee to pick the car up at the airport but he said he couldn't honor this arrangement because it costs too much and his employee was \"new\" and didn't know better.\n\nFortunately Hertz had a car that they would have for us at the airport without the surcharge for airport pickup.  While I have nothing against Enterprise, I won't rent from the Peoria branch  on Cactus Rd. again.
