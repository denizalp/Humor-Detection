Aeroplan is truly zero when it comes to customer service.\nAs a top-rated frequent AC traveler, I asked AP to waive a change fee on a short-haul reward flight from Calgary-Vancouver.  Due to the floods in Calgary, AC rules allow for no cost changes but AP would not budge.  The agent said no AP seats are available and refused to call AC to open up a seat.  I asked to speak with his supervisor.  After waiting half an hour, I got the same excuse!\nAvoid AP customer service if you can.  They are truly zero.
