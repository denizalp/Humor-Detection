Sunshine is...a ray of sunshine!  She is an incredibly talented photographer who is also super upbeat and personable.  I met her at a corporate event where she was taking headshots for the thousands of attendees.  Her work was beautiful, and I watched her coax the best out of those before and after me with the same energy and enthusiasm.  She excels at making people feel comfortable and her joy in her work is infectious.  I am already using the headshots she provided for multiple professional purposes and getting great feedback.  Highly recommend!
