Every time we're in Vegas and want some good Vietnamese food we always go to Jenni Pho.  They have the best bun bo hue and egg rolls!   My kids also love the beef pho, the broth is so tasty and authentic.  Their com tam combination is my husband favorite especially the  pork chop very flavorful and he loves the portions!!  \n \nJenni Pho is so nice and clean not dirty like other pho and Asian restaurants.  You can actually see the kitchen and how they cook through the glass window that is so awesome I've never seen that at any Asian restaurants.  I love the atmosphere and the service.  You never see that at any Asian restaurants!!\n\nThanks Jenni Pho we had a good weekend every time we're in Vegas and definitely be back again for the bun bo hue!!!
