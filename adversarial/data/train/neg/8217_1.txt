Exceptional customer service provided by the bartender and staff at Landrys. Enjoyed an appetizer before ordering some take-out.  Quality of food was good but not spectacular.  (For that reason, am unable to offer a 5 star rating.)  The restaurant was a pleasant break from the strip and the casino action.  Strongly recommend this eatery.
