My world just got rocked and it wasn't even Natalie Portman.\n\nTo most of the reviews that spoke to sitting in the balcony, I would agree as well.  There's definitely a better vantage point from sitting up top to see everything.  This is my first Cirque du Soleil show, and to my astonishment, there's a lot going on.  \n\nI've been wanting to see this show since 2007 and it took me a good 6 years to finally see it.  No regrets paying the steep ticket prices, it's all \"LOVE\". =)
