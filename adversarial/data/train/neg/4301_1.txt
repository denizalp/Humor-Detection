I support my local business owners. This is neat thrift store for finding \"Odds and Ends\". Don't expect to find any carnival glass or gold and silver at this thrift store as the owner keeps all those items for himself and resells for top dollar. But if you're looking for that hard to find \"Odds and Ends\", then this is the place to go. I recommend this thrift store.
