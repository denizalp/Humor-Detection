In need of something with very sexy fuel economy because there are two gas guzzlers in my garage, I make the rounds at the used car departments at large dealerships in Tempe, Scottsdale, Phoenix and Peoria.\n\nI've got a cash deal to offer for something cheap and economical and I want to be around $13k out the door. \n\nBait and switch at one dealership. Astronomical retail prices at another. Nothing in the inventory w\/ under 100k miles in my price range at another place. Trying too hard to convince me to finance when I have cash and lying about attempting to run a credit app at the last dealership I visited. Private party deals prove to be flakes, want to trade vehicles or total BS.\n\nAfter two weeks of searching, I was discouraged. Then I researched Hertz Car Sales program. I did A LOT of reading, looked over a ton of information and customer feedback and decided that it's the best option for my particular needs.\n\nThey price their vehicles for a no-haggle deal. They offer coupons for $300- $1000 off the purchase price online. You get enough Hertz Gold points for a week's rental if you buy here, too. \n\nScott was great from the start of our email communication to when I drove off of the lot with my new (new to me) and very miserly 34 mpg average car. \n\nHe still owes me some floor mats and a small interior trim piece that were missing from the car at the time of sale, so I will be following up this review with that outcome, but I was shocked at the great selection of cars and how easy this transaction was.\n\nHertz should work well for you if A) you want a no-frills second or third\/fourth car B) you don't mind a car with (relatively) higher mileage C) you hate the nebulous pricing and car salesman\/woman games D) you have your own cash\/financing.
