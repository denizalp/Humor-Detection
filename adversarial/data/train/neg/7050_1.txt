Came here a couple of weekends ago. The place itself has a very \"dive bar\" look and feel. Super nice waitress and bar staff. Only had a few drinks and it was really quiet on a Saturday night so that made it easy to talk with friends. But... I got very sick the next day and at first I thought I was just having a very bad hangover, however, I learned a few days ago that everyone who had draft beer (one person only had 1 pint) were ALL very stomach sick so that leads me to believe that they might not clean their tap lines often. I wouldn't normally write a review like this if it were only me who got sick but the fact that everyone did made me feel I should speak up.
