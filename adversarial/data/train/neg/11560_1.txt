I am not a fan of the new management. I used to love the old nail salon. The place looks fancy but the people there are rude now. I tried to get in without appointment and they couldn't fit me in even though it was a weekday morning. They weren't nice about it either. Will be taking my business elsewhere. Disappointed in it now.
