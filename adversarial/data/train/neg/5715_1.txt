Exquisite seafood! Our group had a scrumptious dinner here including apps such as lobster tangine, roasted octopus, spicy shrimp lettuce wraps, and the best calamari I've ever eaten! Mains were tuna with incredible sesame ponzu sauce, scallops, salmon & sea bass. We all were thrilled with this delicious dinner & I thought the service was excellent. We decided on cocktails that included a lemon\/ginger vodka mix & a blackberry Manhattan.  Fabulous drinks!
