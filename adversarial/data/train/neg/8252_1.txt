This review is about the bathrooms. I visited Las Vegas in December and went shopping with my mom and grandma. With me being pregnant, of course we went to Babies R Us and of COURSE I had to pee. \nThe first major issue isn't this particular store's fault but it IS a huge design flaw. You have a store that caters to pregnant women, right? So why is the bathroom ALL THE WAY AT THE BACK of your GIANT STORE?!?!?!?! Why should I have to coax my poor bladder into holding it another minute to get to the back of the store?\nAnd here is the big issue that I had with this store. I am about to pee my pants, baby is kicking on my bladder with full force, I finally walk back to the bathroom and it is the most DISGUSTING bathroom I had been into in a loooong time. There were several open stalls but 3 out of 5 of them had poop or pee SMEARED on their seats. Another stall had feminine hygiene products (used) on the floor. And the smell. A store for pregnant women should go out of their way to make the bathroom look and smell nice. Our hormones are out of control and our pregnant sense of smell is insane.\nSo...if you visit this one, try to go with an empty bladder.\nOh, and also, you can't try their Motherhood Maternity clothes on, even the bras, so you may want to maternity shop somewhere else.
