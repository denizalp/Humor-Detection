OK - this is not a review per se but a testament of their character.  \n\nI was in a real bind to get an electrician out to my house to run a low voltage wire for my upstairs AC that went out.  I got a quote, from the AC company who came out and diagnosed my issue, of $1,500 to run the wire.  Uh, no go.  I have used C Read & Son before so I contacted them first.  They said they would love to help but they are booked solid for the next few weeks.  Well, when it is 107 degrees outside and your AC is not working, waiting is not really an option.  However, as my wife and I were driving out to get something to eat my phone rang.  It was Jacki from C Read & Son.  She said she read my dilemma and wanted to give me a call and some pointers that Clarence wanted to convey.  They told me that even though they did not know the details of running the wires from the attic, down the wall and out to my AC unit, but they did tell me what to possibly expect from someone who would be doing the work and just as important on a very rough estimate on what it would cost, tops.  So, the $1,500 was way out of line.  And they gave me a referral to another electrician. (Sorry but I did not go with them as I forgot their name and went with another company).  But with the knowledge that they provided, I was very comfortable with the electrician that we did ultimately go with and they too did a great job.  However, even though the other electricians did a fantastic job for us, C Read & Sons will continue to be our go to company for our electrical work.
