Just finished dinner and as always it was delicious. It's been a while since we last ate here and the menu has changed. Took my favorite Ravioli off the menu. I went with the Crab Stuffed Chicken and my husband had the Prime Rib. We got the Spinach Artichoke as an appetizer. As always the food was great. But the Customer Service was by far the best we've had anywhere in a long time. Steve our server was on it. Hands down awesome. Our cups were never empty, I would see him watch his tables diligently. It was restaurant week, a game night and they were busy but he never faltered. I'm was extremely impressed!
