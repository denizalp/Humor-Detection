Very fun place for a girls night out or when you are looking for a cheap outing with your group. The only downside was that the bowling balls were very greasy. It seemed as if the balls were greased on their way back to us as they were collected and returned. My group got the lane closest to the wall and it seemed as if the lane was canted on one side. I had no complaints since I had a pretty lucky night with the amount of spares and strikes I got, but my friends might say otherwise. So try and grab a middle lane if you can if you decide to come here!
