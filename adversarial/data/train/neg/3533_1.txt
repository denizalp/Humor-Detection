Dr. Singh is a wonderful top notch doctor who takes the time to listen. I would recommend him highly for treating the condition of dry eye or having cataract surgery. His staff are attentive and professional. Dr. Singh discussed all aspects of my cataract surgery-the best outcome and the worst outcome. I had realistic expectations because of his explanations of the various types of lenses, the procedure and the price. The surgery was successful and I do not need glasses when driving (far distance) and watching TV (mid-distance). In low light I use reading glasses for seeing up close. He continues to monitor my condition of dry eyes and the cataract surgery and looks for any negative changes. I am completely satisfied with the outcome and will continue to use Southwest Eye Surgeons.
