Do yourself a favor and go to another kinkos location. This one is the absolute worst I've ever encountered across the country. Slow is an understatement. They are under staffed and they don't care at all. I waited 25 minutes for 5 pages of black and white text to print. FIVE PAGES. There was literally not one person in there when i walked in. In that moment, they were over staffed and still didnt care. At all. Consider yourself warned.
