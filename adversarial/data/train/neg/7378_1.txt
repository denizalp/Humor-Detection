I've been back a couple times since my original review...this place has a great brunch. Bloody Mary and Mimosa bar and live music. Love it. The guy they had playing guitar today was really good and while we waited a long time for our food, the music and drinks kept us entertained. My husband got the steak and eggs but my mom and I went for sandwiches. She had a BLT and I had a grilled cheese. My sandwich was delicious- lots of arugala and tomato kept it fresh and not overly heavy...and it was served w perfect french fries :-*
