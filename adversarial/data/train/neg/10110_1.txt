If you want southern food in Vegas, Yardbird is the place to go.  Our fried green tomato appetizer with crispy pork belly and pimento cheese was very good - easily one of the best I've had.  We then had the blue plate special - fried chicken (breast and wing), biscuit, and watermelon.  The fried chicken was good, very, very good.  Lick your fingers good.  The biscuit, with some apple butter, was great without being to much.  The watermelon was a nice light, and sweet, complement to the meal.  The service was friendly and fast.
