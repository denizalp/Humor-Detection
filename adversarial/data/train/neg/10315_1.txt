This show was pretty disappointing to be honest.\n\nI actually dozed off a few times. The opening was okay, but the rest..?! Wish we can get our money back. Sigh. After about 10 mins, we realized we have made a mistake, this show is more for seniors. Yes, seniors.... The only part we absolutely loved was the 2 guys doing the robot during the titanic scene, which lasted about 15 mins. Everything else was blah. We are so glad we got one ticket for free, we still feel as though we got gypped due to the fact we paid $117 for the first ticket to get decent seating. By the way, there weren't many audiences, barely filled up about half. Yeah, I wonder why. \n\nIf you like slow show with lots of repetitive moves, then this show is for you! Serious, don't waste your money, go watch something else.
