I have been with Geico for years..... always  thinking well this is the best I will ever do for insurance... I happen to be online looking around for some more reasonable priced insurance one day. I don't even remember checking out Farmers insurance, but I received a nice letter in my mail box with a quote on insurance that I could not even believe was true. I work some crazy hours and Ashlee dealt with all of  that and all my emails back and forth on info and setting me up with this awesome low price but excellent insurance for my home and my 2 cars. I will  be saving over 700 dollars a year with this insurance,,,, thank you Ashlee for all you done and assisting me... I really hate change but this change was wonderful because Ashlee was caring and so helpful
