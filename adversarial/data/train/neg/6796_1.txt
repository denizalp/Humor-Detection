I wouldn't even give them one star but I had to write this review. My mom went in with extremely high blood pressure and was put in a hallway and left there for 2 days. Mind you she also has CHD and prone to blood clots. They didn't even have her on a blood pressure machine which are on wheels and portable . She could have stroked out right there and no one would have known. They asked her if she would like ear plugs or face mask. Disgusting. Never ever again!!!!!!! Do not go to this facility especially if you need a cardiologist or any doctor for that matter. They will just leave you in the hallway. Not ok!!!!!!!
