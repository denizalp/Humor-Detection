I didn't realize that Bluephie's was gone until a friend invited me to check out an awesome new restaurant and I pulled into the lot to meet her. Not a problem, since Bluephie's was a bit \"meh\" IMHO. I tried Everly during restaurant week and chose a 3-course lunch: Celery Root Bisque, SoCal Grain Bowl, and Chocolate Mousse. The bisque as unexpectedly rich, decadent, and delicious. I could have just eaten that and left happy. The grain bowl was a bit of a hit-and-miss for me. Perhaps my palate is just not sophisticated enough to appreciate that particular combination of flavors: the mix of toasted oats, sunny-side-up egg (perfectly cooked, BTW), hot sauce, avocado, kale, and quinoa just didn't quite make a happy family in my mouth. The dessert was delish: although it wasn't described as such, the mousse had a delightful hit of orange flavor from the addition of orange zest, and chocolate + orange are one of the greatest flavor combos on Earth.\n\nI had a look at the regular menu and I'm excited to come back. The prices are very reasonable, and there are a ton of really tasty-sounding, fresh, healthy dishes that I can't wait to try.
