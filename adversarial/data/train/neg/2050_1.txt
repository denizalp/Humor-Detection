Chiming in with what others have said, the customer service here is phenomenal. \n\nThe tacos served here are very similar to those offered downtown and they're just as tasty! \n\nI came here at night and after ordering our food and sitting down, I realized they were gonna close in 10 minutes.. I so did not want to be that guy that stays past closing lol. \n\nI preceded to scarf down my food as fast as possible and despite almost closing, the guy who worked there took some time and made small talk with us. Greatly appreciated.
