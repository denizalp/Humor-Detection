Grazie is a super cute pizza place on the outskirts of old town Scottsdale! The atmosphere is nice; they have a brick oven, a good-size patio, and a cute poodle pup sleeping by the bar. To start we ordered the burrata. It's listed as a salad but it has very little lettuce. It's mostly delicious burrata with a thick and sweet balsamic sauce. We also ordered the Toscano pizza. The crust and sauce were perfect! But the toppings weren't my favorite. It had way too many mushroom and the fennel sausage lacked flavor, making the pizza bland overall.
