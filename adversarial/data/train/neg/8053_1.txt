Went to Mercie J to have them check out my battery.  I have gone to Mercie J a few times.  They even replaced a battery for me back in August 2014.\n\nThe only reason I went back again about a year later is because the local Nissan dealer when he was doing some routine maintenance tried to convince me that my battery failed his test, and that I need to consider replacing it.  I never experienced any concern since August 2014 with battery performance.  My car was running fine.  I called Mercie J and asked them to check my battery.  When they tested it, there was no issue.\n\nThis leads me to believe one of two things or both:\n\n1) The Nissan dealer has technicians and mechanics who lack appropriate skills or training\n2) The Nissan dealer is trying to hit me up for \"money\"\n\nI will tell you that Mercie J is fair, honest, and very transparent in their dealings, and they are ready to explain to you what is up (even if it is not good news).  Given this, I definitely will recommend Mercie J and Rick's crew to anybody who needs a good mechanic and car service, and not a dealer.\n\nGo here if you want good, honest, work.  If it is not their forte, they will tell you, but they will do their best to refer you to someone who can help.
