Century link not only has the WORST service in town, but they also TAKE ADVANTAGE of the elderly. I have been telling my parents for over a year now to switch services but they keep telling me that they have been in touch with CenturyLink and that they have promised to fix the issues. NOTHING HAS BEEN FIXED. Their tv NEVER has service....their internet is ALWAYS DOWN....and it's not even a secure network. I am so disgusted with these people it's unreal. My parents are good people raising a BLIND daughter and the fact that these people are taking advantage makes me sick. Please NEVER use Century Link.
