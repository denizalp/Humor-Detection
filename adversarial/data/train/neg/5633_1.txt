Checked out the zoo with my son.  This was our first time and we both thought it was a great zoo with a great price...free.  Well, we did give a donation.  I like zoos that are small enough to conquer in a couple of hours and don't make you feel like you have to stay 10 hours to get your money's worth.  We were fortunate to find a parking space near the entrance.  This is a fabulous zoo for younger children.  Come prepared for the heat when you are there in the summer. There aren't too many indoor areas to cool off in.
