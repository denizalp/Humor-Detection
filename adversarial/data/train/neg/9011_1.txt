**4.5 stars**\n\nThis place was buzzing with people on a Wednesday evening at 7:30 pm. I was pleasantly surprised by the hip vibe and cool buzz of people in here - I definitely didn't feel like I was in a strip mall in Mississauga.\n\nOur server got us off to a good start - the service is very worth mentioning here. She was passionate about the food and raved about everything we ordered. I would be happy and proud to work here too if my restaurant had such incredible food!\n\nOn Wednesdays they have a $5 craft beer special so we opted for that but next time will take advantage of the VERY affordable bottles of wine ~$26-$40!\n\nWhat's most impressive about this place is their food. The menu is exciting - lots of fresh ingredients and creative flavours. Parmesan Truffle Fries, Korean Short Rib Tacos, Almond crusted chicken tenders and Bay of Fundy Salmon salad to name a few. Glancing at all these options, I was already planning my next visit here. Good thing I work close by!
