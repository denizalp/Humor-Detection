I love this place!  The ambiance is perfect for a quick dinner or for happy hour.  The margaritas are blissful.  I like the Organic and the Jefe.  As for the food-their salsa is delicious and their food is pretty consistent.  I have tried the tacos, the chili relleno and the tres enchiladas and they are all delectable. Service can be a little spotty in the dining area but it is always quick in the bar and where they have high tops to sit at. I always leave full and happy!
