I really love this place. When my husband and I have had a rough week, we usually end it by coming here, getting some great cheese, prosciutto and craft root beer. I would give them 5 stars but there is one man (i actually think he's the owner) who doesn't make the experience fun. Everyone else that works there is so nice and helpful but he usually acts like you're bothering him...
