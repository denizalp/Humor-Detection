\"Best sub you ever had\" is printed on the wrapper and wow they were not kidding!  The first time I tried their subs was at a lunch meeting we had at work a few weeks ago.  They won me over from that 1 quarter of a sub and giant 1\/2 pickle.  Stopped by tonight after work and was thrilled that there was no line.  We got a cheesesteak sub on everything bread and a roastbeef sub on everything bread plus 1 whole pickle to split.  The bread is so fresh even for 6:30pm.  We ordered 2 small sandwiches and split between us.  I think I really enjoyed the cheesesteak a little bit more, but maybe because it was warm and juicy on such a cold CLE night.  The price was beyond fair considering we are both completely full.  I cannot imagine eating a large sub in one sitting.  Staff was super friendly!  So glad we had that meeting and discovered this place! We will definitely be here more often!
