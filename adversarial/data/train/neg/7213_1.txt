We've been here three times so far, we are definitely big fans. I discovered this place VIA a great deal on a coupon site. It was for $40 worth of food for only $20! Since I'm such a sushi addict, so we figured we would try it. \n\nThere's a unique-ness about this restaurant. It's Hawaiian\/ Japanese fusion. All of their rolls are really fresh. On their special menu they incorporate a lot of Hawaiian ingredients. Their Kaki (oyster) shooters are to die for. They're in shell shooters with a vinegary ponzo sauce, tobiko and onion. \n\nOur last visit we tried the 808 sliders--wagyu beef, shatake mushrooms, with Hawaiian ginger wasabi mayo. They were really good, two nice sized sliders per order. They were very filling. After all those rolls, we almost had to be wheeled out of there. \n\nWe prefer cold dishes so we usually stick with their sushi but it's nice to know that all of their hot dishes are amazing too. \n\nIll definitely post some pictures because words simply cannot do this place justice.
