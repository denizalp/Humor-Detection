Dr. Zedek is excellent! He is well trained in his field and a remarkable human being. Not only did he help me control my ADHD, but he and his staff treated me like a PERSON and not just a NUMBER. He is never too busy to ask me about how I am doing, how's my wife, kids, etc. He encourages questions, comments, and concerns and always gives thorough explanations of everything. I wish more doctors were as kind, caring, considerate, and honest as him. I HIGHLY recommend him for anyone with psychiatric needs!
