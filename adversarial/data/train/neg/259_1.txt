pretty bad service. I paid 6 bucks for a iced coffee w\/ whipped cream on top, the coffee was made much too sweet, esp when i asked for low sweet.\n\nI went back to ask and they woudln't do anything about it, i can either get more ice to dilute, or they can add more water.\n\nFor 6 bucks... pretty bad service IMO\n\nCoffee itself tasted like over sweet, and very little coffee taste.
