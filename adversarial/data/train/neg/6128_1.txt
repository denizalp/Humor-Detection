I loved how dark and seductive this club was.  The tables are built into the wall so it was like having your own little cove.  We met one of the owners and he was super nice, letting us sit at his table even after he left. Gogo dancers were hot and the bathroom attendant was the sweetest lady! On a friday we got bracelets for free champagne all night, which I loved!
