This place is the Best Home made Persian Food in Arizona. My favorite dish is the mix grill Chicken koobideh \"Ground beef\"combo with Rice and salad. Everything on the menu is so delicious. I would eat this everyday if this place opened up down the street from my house.\nIt's a good 25 min drive to get some awesome Persian food from where I live but it's so worth it. The staff is very nice and the service is Fantastic. If your ever in the neighborhood  show some support and Please stop by and Try this Great Restaurant . I would highly recommend it to all my Friends and Family.
