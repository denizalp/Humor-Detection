It wasn't as crazy as I feared, which was good. The guys were all very good looking and ripped, so there's that.  There were a few parts that were just gross and silly i.e. the orgasm contest.  We also never saw a waitress. Half way through the show one of my friends got up and got us all drinks.  Overall it's  an ok show, inexpensive as shows go in Vegas, but not really memorable.
