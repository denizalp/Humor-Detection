I lived in Japan for 4 years and ate at many restaurants there just like Nagasaki Grill Toh Zan.  The food was so authentic that I got immediately homesick for Japan and the owner is a wonderful Japanese man who is gracious and friendly.  If you want really authentic (not Americanized) Japanese food, you need to eat here!
