Ok it took me a while to think about what's going on with this place but now I think I understand.  We've been to the College location a number of times and had 'the usual' - good pasta, good pizza, etc. I think the food is actually quite good - a solid 3 stars, especially for a chain restaurant but it's not fine Italian. At this price point I shouldn't really expect it. \n\nThe problem is that it's a delivery and take out place and the front of the house is a distraction and the poor step child to the rest. A steady flow of Uber delivery bikes shows this to be the case. The wait staff is inexperienced, inattentive (eg 15 - 20 min before taking drink orders, not circulating to check on basics like water, not bringing the bill) that makes eat-in dining painful even for a casual drop in dinner. \n\nWe went when it first opened and chalked up the uneven service to opening jitters. That's not the case.  Unless you are in grade 11 going on your first date - don't bother with the dine-in option.\n\nI don't blame the wait staff (only one) - she's spending 90% of her time packing takeout food silly!  The reality is that there is no one running the front of the house.  Actually, I don't even think there is a manager of any sort - some sort of egalitarian cooperative seems to be at play. Stuff gets done eventually but no one is really running the place (basics like here are your menus, waiter will be with you shortly, did table 2 get their bill, did you ask if they want dessert, maybe you should bring a glass for the drink,...) - you know, like a restaurant. \n\nAll told the food is ok (skip the awful salads - dump and run of too much green stuff with some sort of gelatinous dressing), minus one star for 'it feels like we just opened this week' service and AWOL management. \n\nTake it for what it's supposed to be - a delivery and takeout joint.
