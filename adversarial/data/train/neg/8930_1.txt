The ambiance is more 'fast food' and the meats are already cooked, but the food is good. We sampled the chop char noodles, chicken, and beef bulgogi. All were good, and the meat was lean enough to meet my standards. Portions are large, and prices are reasonable: $30 with tip for 2 dinners and 2 sodas.
