The meet was super good, the buffet was limited. The service was amazing\nWould I come here for 60$? No. But I had a restaurant.com gift certificate so I tried it. The let is request additional meat, ask for extras of our favorite, and kept up a lot on our drinks. Based on service it's a five, food a four (because of the limited buffet) and price i would make a three.
