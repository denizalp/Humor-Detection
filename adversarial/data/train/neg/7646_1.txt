Been a customer with Progressive for 5 years, paid every premium on time without fail. First claim ever with Progressive due to an unfortunate run-in with a very large buck, and was forced to replace my vehicle. Progressive wouldn't even pay me enough to buy the least expensive replacement I could find in the area comparable to the vehicle I am replacing. They claim I should be able to negotiate a better deal with the selling party. I don't buy insurance and pay your premiums every month so that I have to negotiate to get my car replaced. I didn't ask for a better price from them on my premiums, why should they expect me to ask for a better price to replace my car. Long story short I will be taking my business elsewhere, and I advise you to avoid them if you haven't already
