Came here directly after flying in from the airport and the cab fare was relatively inexpensive (less than $15). Since I arrived super early on a Saturday, there wasn't much foot traffic to contend with. Lots of stores, but definitely lower end compared to the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets. I liked checking out the kate spade outlet here as well as the Disney outlet. There's also a Ralph Lauren here and a Brooks Brothers outlet for prepsters. It is very easy to get to the Strip from here if you take the SDX bus. The fare is $6 but the credit card swipe wasn't working on the machine at the stop, so be sure to have exact cash as no change is provided. It's 1-1\/2 hours from here on the SDX bus to the North outlets. Overall, if you're a tourist and you only have time to visit one outlet mall- I would choose the north over the south!
