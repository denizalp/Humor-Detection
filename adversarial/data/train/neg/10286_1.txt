I came to Pastel during a double date with a couple friends and it was really fun. The place is small and cozy and they have a lot of variety in the menu (at least for a dessert place). I ordered a latte and a shortcake waffle. I thought the waffle was really good. It was around 12$ if I remember correctly. I really do recommend this place if you decide to splurge on a waffle and a latte. Their food is a treat!
