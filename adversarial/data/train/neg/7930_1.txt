I really like this hotel overall. I have stayed here a couple times and enjoyed my stay each time. The pool and exercise room are both sufficient, the rooms are clean and inviting, and the hotel lobby is large and comfortable boasting a Starbucks too! I have stayed here on a personal trip, and also attended a conference on site as well: the conference facilities were also great, and the staff were wonderful and very efficient. \n\nI also love the location of this hotel - on the water and within walking distance to mostly everything you might need including an LCBO, grocery store, and all sorts of restaurants. \n\nI would absolutely stay here again.
