This is my favorite taco place.  This place could be a little confusing for first-timers.  There are several lines that you can order food from.  The menu is above the line you would wait to order your food.  The Al Pastor tacos are awesome!!! Order it with everything!!! It's the last line on the right-hand side. They cut the meat right from the rotisserie.  It's pork if you're wondering what it is. I'm not a huge pork eater but I promise you it'll be the best thing ever eaten.
