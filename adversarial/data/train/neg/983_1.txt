Really good and affordable brunch\/lunch prix fixe menu for $29.  The appetizer, main, and dessert was a lot of food and I was stuffed at the end. Had the salmon tartare, which was standard and well seasoned. The dorado royale was excellent - filleted whole fish seasoned with capers. Had the cake with ice cream for dessert which was sweet and reminded me a bit of a rum cake. Service was very good. Be warned, ordering anything off the regular menu can drive up the price of lunch quickly (see: $19 mimosa - which was good for our celebratory lunch, but probably a bit steep for a regular lunch). Would definitely come back for the prix fixe menu!
