Decent sushi, came in the afternoon. Not a bad price for lunch and its all you can eat. Hard to beat $15 in my opinion. The issue was the service was so slow, like intentionally couldn't eat as much as I wanted to. Simple orders took a long amount of time. Hard to do for lunch. My favorite was the yam and crab stick rolls. The sushi quality wasn't bad, but I'm not a sushi critic by any means.
