Came here for drinks\/foods & I fell in love with this place! The interior really makes you feel like you're on vacation and not in this cold, cold city. It was super busy so you should definitely make a reso if you're coming on the weekend. I got the honey garlic wings ($6) only !!!! I had the rum barrel to drink - it was delicious (it has Appleton in it which I'm not exactly a fan of but surprisingly loved the drink). Will definitely be returning!
