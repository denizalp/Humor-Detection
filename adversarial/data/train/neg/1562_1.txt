Wasnt the best pedicure I've had but not the worst, just average. The staff wasn't that friendly and seemed to be very disconnected to their customers. The nail tech doing my toes kept answering his cell phone and having to stop just to have conversations on his phone. When other customers would walk in the women seemed to be annoyed that they would have to stop watching their shows on their iPads and get up and do their job. They all spent more time outside sitting and talking then doing anything inside. I have no problem that they speak their native language while they work. the problem I have is when they ask you a question and you say no you dont want that service done they all look at each other, snicker  and speak to other in Vietnamese and talk shit. I find that to be very unprofessional and rude. you are providing a service that customers are paying for, at least have the respect to speak damn English. Is that rude, YES but as a customer how do you think I feel sitting there witnessing this. Makes me not wanna tip then for the job.
