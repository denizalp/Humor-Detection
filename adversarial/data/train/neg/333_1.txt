Very nice and professional grooming salon. I actually had them groom my guinea pig, which sounds strange but she needed a little help... I didn't even know if they'd cater to a Guinea but they did and were very professional too!\nI'm happy and when I get more pets that need grooming I will definitely go back to this place.
