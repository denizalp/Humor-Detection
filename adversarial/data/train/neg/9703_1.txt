I received a discount card of $19.00 just by joining the Birthday Club at Tony Roma's.  $19.00 is not too bad a discount, methinks!   You must use it during your birthday week. Our table ordered:\n\n- Tony cut - Prime Rib - ordered it rare - it came out slightly pink all round the thick cut of meat.  It was quite good and I enjoyed it.  Sometimes when you order rare prime rib, it comes out with the blood still oozing.  This prime rib dish had no blood oozes whatsoever but the meat was still juicy and very tender.  The dish also came with a little bowl of au jus.  Had the 2 sides of garlic mashed potatoes (need more garlic flavour) and seasonal vege (steamed brocolli - quite green and tasty).  Don't forget to ask for horse radish.\n\n- Linguine and meatballs - quite good.  Meatballs of good size and quite tasty as was the tomato sauce.  Maybe need more garlic in the tomato sauce.\n\n- St Louis Ribs - 1\/2 rack - Tender and juicy pork ribs - delicious - ate with 2 sides of beans and coleslaw.  The coleslaw was quite tasty and freshly made.\n\n- Beef Short Rib - a chunk of meat with the bone in the middle.  The meat fell off the bone!  It was THAT tender and moist, braised to perfection!  It was braised in a nice brown sauce. Supposed to come with garlic mashed potato and roasted vege but switched the mashed potato for baked potato.  I would order this dish the next time I hit Tony Roma's!  \n\nWait Service - Very courteous and fast.  Great wait service!
