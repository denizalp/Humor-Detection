So i get the hanker-in for a braut. Not a hot dog but an ol' Chicago Braut. So i remember seeing this place in Glendale with some good reviews and grab a coworker and head to lunch. \n\nFirst the pros.\n\n1. Clean\n2. Nice Menu\n3. Friendly Staff\n\nCons.\n1. A bit pricey for hot dogs\n2. Way too Average food.\n3. Slow getting food to you. \n4. Serves Coke products (subjective I know)\n\nSo I get the Braut with frys and a coke. The Braut is grilled but on the small side. Sort of thin and short. The bun is steamed with poppy seeds and the frys are crinkle cut and thick. The food was alright at best. \n\nThe coworker got the Polish Dog with chili cheese frys. The Chili was good, the cheese was good, the dog was average and a little dry. It was not thick and juicy like it should be. \n\nI would try again but not for awhile.
