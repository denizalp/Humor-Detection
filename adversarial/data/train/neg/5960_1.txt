We went to Block & Grinder on Valentine's Day weekend. We had a reservation, so no problems getting seated. We ordered the pork belly pancakes as our appetizer and they were phenomenal. I'd go back just to have those again. I ordered the special cut and tiger prawns, which I highly recommend if it is ever offered as a special again. I can't wait to go back and try one of their burgers
