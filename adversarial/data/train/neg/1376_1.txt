This is one of my favourite comfort restaurants in downtown Montreal! Why? It's open from 11am until 3am! Hurray for late night eats!! Even though they're open until wee hours, the quality of their food is very consistent and yummy every time. \nThey do classic Japanese eats like ramen but also have cool street eats of Japan that are very tasty. I've never had a miss from their menu which is really rare (and trust me, I've tried a lot :D). From their appetizers, main dishes, to dessert, every single one of them seem to be almost perfect on my palate. I definitely recommend their desserts and milkshakes as they're really refreshing and creative!
