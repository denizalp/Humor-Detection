Instant regrets. I decided to make a last minute appointment to this nail salon for my friend and I. I requested a bio gel refill with shellac ombre design. When I showed the photo of what I would like, 2 nail technicians advised they didn't know how to do it, one said \"oh ombre nails will take a long time\" and I waited 30 minutes after my scheduled appointment  to have the same nail technician come and finally take me in. \n\nA red flag came when she filed my nails with a small cheap portable nail file, my nails were burning!  Once she shaped and filed my nails she brought out the \"bio gel\" I even questioned if it was actually bio gel she said \"yes\" and then I said \"I want make sure this is bio gel\" she said \"Oh I think it's bio gel... Yeah it's bio gel\" I am certain she didn't even know what kind of gel it was! Cause the first bottle she showed me was not even bio gel until I corrected her. I took a closer look at the container and it said \"GEL HARDENER\"  (this was a fresh new bottle so I know product was not poured in) I've gone to many nail salons and this is horrible, I paid $50.00 for false bio gel! The moment my nails hit the lamp my fingers BURNED! And it was not from the lamp, but from the product  used! As my friend also felt a strong burning sensation. I am so dissapointed with being misled!!\n\nShe then proceeded to do an ombre design. It looked like a 5 year old painted my nails, she spent 40 minutes trying to make it work. I showed it to my friend who is getting married, she wanted the same nail design as me, she immediately changed her mind after seeing mine. Why advise on the phone that you can do ombre designs when clearly your technicians can't? The nail technician then insisted that \"your nails will not look exactly like the photos you see\" I advised I'm not happy and would like to just do a colour. She then said \"well if I do that it'll be to thick..\" I knew if I kept them on I would've been so irritated. I asked for a light pink, she said \"no, just do white\" she then painted my nails white without my approval. Are you serious?? \nI stopped her and said no, I do not want white. She scoffed and went to get HER choice of pink and continued to do a rushed job and painted on top of the sad ombre design...Now I'm rocking A sloppy paint job and a thick top coat of shellac. She wanted to just get me out of there! She didn't ask if I was happy once, there was no massage, no apology, no cutting of any of my cuticles and she immediately left to help someone else... My nails look sloppy, and splotchy. \n\nMy friend has crooked nails, bleeding fingers and they even left shellac on her fingers!!! She is so dissapointed, her wedding is in 2 days and she paid $70 for her full set. She came in specifically requesting ombre, and left with a horrible uneven coffin shape and paint job. \n\nIf I could rate this establishment a ZERO I would. \n\n*DO NOT COME HERE FOR BIO GEL, THEY LIE ABOUT THE PRODUCTS*
