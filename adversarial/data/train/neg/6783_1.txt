I really enjoyed this place. Made a reservation but it was a Monday night and didn't really need it. The server was super friendly and attentive. She filled our drinks constantly. I got the chicken and cornbread pancakes. It came out wrong initially but they were super quick to fix it. They gave us free dessert to make up for it which was amazing. The chicken was super moist. The pancake was ridiculously huge and awesome. I could have totally made a second meal out of this except that I had nowhere to put leftovers. My husband got the Cuban sandwich which was also pretty good. It was nothing super out of the ordinary but it tasted good and had everything I would have expected. The chocolate cake was to die for, even after it sat in my purse for several hours and got crushed a few times. They had some really interesting items on their menu and good happy hour specials. I'd like to go back and try more things. Also, their prices were really reasonable. We had two sodas and both meals for a little over $40.
