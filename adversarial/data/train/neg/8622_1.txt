Wonderful spot for a deliciously prepared meal. Had the pulled beef with a side of curry squash and apple soup. First the roll bread was heated nicely for the sandwich, the crust was crunchy but soft inside making for a really nice bite. The flavor from the pulled beef was well balanced with the cucumber and pickled veg. The soup was just right in taste, not over strong with the curry and a slightly sweet undertone with the apple. \n\nAn excellent spot for lunch ... we will definitely be back.
