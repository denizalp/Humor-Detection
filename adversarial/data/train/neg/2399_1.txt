Delicious Chinese food!  Not typical take out...this is the type of place I expected to only exist in Mesa or Chandler, but thankfully its further up north.  We ordered the black bean sauce chicken and house special chow fun noodles.  They were both amazing and we will be ordering from here regularly. Plus, the name is hilarious...
