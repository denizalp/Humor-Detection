If I could give this business a zero, I would.  I had extreme dizziness being on their program.  It was to the point that I could hardly go to work.  I saw two different doctors and they confirmed it was due to the program.  I asked for a refund for the weeks I did not use and even spoke to the owner of the company.  She stated, I would receive a refund but I have been waiting over 2.5 weeks and still nothing.  I followed up over 6 times via email and over 6 times on the phone.  I kept hearing, we will get back to you by the end of the day.  Good business practices are to follow through with what you promise and a sense of urgency.  This business obviously hasn't heard of these common ideas and needs to go back to school.
