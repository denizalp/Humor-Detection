I purchased a Travelzoo coupon for a massage here.  I didn't really get to explore the grounds that much, but I have to say that my massage was great. The front desk was pretty slow when I got there, but this could easily happen.  The spa seems a bit small, and nothing over the top fancy; but clean and very well kept.
