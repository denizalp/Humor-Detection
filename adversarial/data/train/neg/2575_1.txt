So delicious! Their pho is traditional and tasty! Comes with all the goodies you would need to assemble your very own pho! \n\nThe outside looks a little questionable but the inside is very clean and cute!\n\nMy order was ready right away and nice n hot. It was made exactly how I wanted it.\n\nI will definitely be back to this place! The other menu items look promising! \n\nYay!
