I saw this place on \"You Gotta Eat Here\" and thought that I gotta  eat there.  However, it wasn't great. I had the Franks Got Seoul hit dog ($9.00) and regular poutine ($6.50).\n\nThe hot dog bun was very soggy  (I guess from the kim chee). The actual hot dog and the bun were the same  kind that many hot dog karts have. So, nothing special about it except the price.  The Korean part (kim chee and beef ribs) were ok.\n\nThe poutine, on the other hand was very good and it was a pretty good portion. The poutine makes it 3 stars. Without poutine, it's a 2.\n\nI would not go out my way to eat there.
