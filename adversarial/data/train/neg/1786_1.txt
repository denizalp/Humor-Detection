At first I was thrown off by the tacky, pun name, but the food here is awesome.  I had the soup which was hearty and delicious.  I also tried the fried falafel which was quite possibly the best version of falafel I've ever had.  Crispy and flavorful, these little squares were quite the joy to eat.  :]
