Loved it in its entirety! The vibe in the place is very mom and pop and everyone working there is super nice and authentic with their customer service. Pizza is delicious and can't get enough of the knots! My only complaint is that I forgot to try the dessert :(. Only another reason to go back!! :) Thank you for a yummy lunch today!
