I had a chance to stop by this place for a late lunch. I felt in love with the simplicity decoration of this place. I had pork bun for appetizer. It was phenomenon!! The pork was flavorful and so tender and juicy that the fat is melting in your mouth while you're eating it. A+ for the bun. I also ordered miso ramen and added spicy pork into it. The taste of miso was very light. My friends had fire and ice ramen and the signature one that I can't remember the name right now. All the broths are flavorful and distinct from each other. Only down side is, I'm not sure if I was full from the appetizer or there was too much ramen. I couldn't finish it. Overall this place is great ! Everyone should come check them out!
