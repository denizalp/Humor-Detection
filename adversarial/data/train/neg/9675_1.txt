I like this place for fast BBQ.  I always get the pulled pork and the baked potato casserole.  Their rolls are terrific too.  They have 3 different kinds of sauce in self-serve warmers.  I prefer the sweet.  They also have free ice cream cones for after your dinner.  On Sundays, kids eat free.  I can feed my family of 5 for under $30 and that is with drinks.
