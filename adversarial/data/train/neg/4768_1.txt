Such a relaxing, calm place with delicious, healthy food. The people who work there are friendly, too. You don't need to be a vegan or vegetarian to enjoy it. I loved the quinoa bowls and also the mango mung bean sandwich. I went here a few times during my vacation in Montreal because it's one of the few healthy options in this area.
