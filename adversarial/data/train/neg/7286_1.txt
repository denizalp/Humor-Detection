I loved our meal at Kaya. The Dark and Stormy cocktail was a great way to start. The Tropical Payaya and Rainbow Salad w\/ crispy tofu were ordered by several in our party, which they raved about. I had the Tempura Avacado Mani Mi Tacos and they were delicious. The molten lava cake and chocolate banana bread desserts were amazing. Would definitely go back!
