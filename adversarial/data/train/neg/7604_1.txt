This was a great massage!  You can tell he is very knowledgeable and experienced.  He is super professional which is important since he is a male therapist and I am a woman, which can be awkward sometimes.  The only downside is I was not a fan of the building it is in, its a little old and smells kind of funny, but his space\/room was totally fine.  I would definitely recommend it, especially because the prices are AWESOME.
