Not a fan of the Asian flavors in burgers so I've only got the chicken katsu here. It is seriously one of the best crispy chicken sandwiches you can have.\nThe crack sauce and katsu sauce add so much flavor and the chicken is cooked perfectly every time.\nThe jazz fries are delicious as well. They're the only ones I order.\nService is always great. I love that you leave a nickname with your order. Environment is also awesome. Board games and nice urban art. Always good for a late night craving too!
