We went here for a round last night.  I think the concept is very cool\/spacious\/comfortable. I'm not sure what size draft beer we received, after ordering a \"tall\" (12-16oz maybe)....but at $7 each, what a joke! We would return, but likely only with a group to play a quick yard game or something.
