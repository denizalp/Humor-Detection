Slow, old, unclean. This place.demonstrates the need for competition in imaging. I will not come back. Small loud waiting area with a tv for extra noise. I'm sure I'll get some cursory response from someone at the company. I will complain to my insurer and employer and encourage you to do the same. We deserve better than this crudhole.
