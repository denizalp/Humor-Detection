Solid dry cleaners.  I started taking my clothes to this place because they don't use toxic solvents, so it's better for the environment.  Plus, there's usually a 20% coupon in the local 891-- coupon book that comes in the mail.  \n\nAlbeit, it's a couple more dollars than my old cleaners but I think well worth it.  They do a great job; my clothes always come back nice and spiffy.  And best of all, I don't get that weird smell my clothes sometimes had after I took them to the regular cleaners.  I like to think it's because they're green.  So yay!  I really am a fan!
