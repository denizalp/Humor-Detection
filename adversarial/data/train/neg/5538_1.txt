I love SUSHISAMBA! I was very familiar with the London location and this was actually my 2nd visit to the Vegas location. The food never disappoints at either venue and if you are new to the brand I would recommend having the server either order for you or working closely with them to craft your own \"tasting menu\".  The concept of Japanese, Peruvian and Brazilian can be intimidating and unfamiliar to most but you have to just go with it! \n\nWe let the manager, Jason P, order for us and we couldn't have been happier! He was super friendly and asked about any allergies and dietary restrictions and got everything on point. We had an assortment of small plates: green bean tempura, edamame, pardon peppers, a spicy tuna roll, some crispy scallop lettuce wrap, assorted taquitos of yellow tail \/ lobster \/ crab and mushroom tobanyaki with duck breast. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the staff even made a point to let us know which items to eat first to enjoy at the best possible temperature. Everyone we encountered was friendly, engaging, knowledgeable on the menus and so hospitable! \n\nTo sum it up, Jason P and the whole SS team know what they're freaking doing and I can't wait to go back!
