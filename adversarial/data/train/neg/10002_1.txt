Had breakfast here on Saturday after being recommended by our hotel. We were nicely surprised by the atmosphere and food. We had a breakfast bagel and the American breakfast. The food and service was great. The server was pleasant and very friendly. Would happily recommend this place. \nLocation is also great and plenty of staff.
