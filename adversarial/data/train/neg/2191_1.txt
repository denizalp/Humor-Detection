SO MAD \nI ordered online a half hour before I came to pick up my 3 rolls. \nWhen I got there the lady told me it would still be 10 minutes because they were waiting on a fish to get into the kitchen.  \nSo I told her I didn't have time because I had an appt in 10 minutes.  \nI tried asking which rolls I ordered that needed that fish, and was going to just change my order to something that they could make sooner.  \nInstead, she cut me off as she picked up the phone , \nThen didn't put them on hold ... she just totally cut me off and ignored me and continued to help the other person.  \nI WALKED RIGHT OUT \nZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE \nTHANKS A LOT
