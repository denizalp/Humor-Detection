I have been going for 3 years  I should have changed to  another office but I was lazy.  They do not have any cell phone reception in that building. They discontinued their guest wifi to save money obviously. So do not bring your work with you to keep you busy while they make you wait that extra hour in their lobby. \nIf you do request to see an actual doctor, instead of a PA, they will keep you waiting longer. While you wait, someone may approach you and remind you that you can be seen earlier if you see a PA.  \nThey refer you for imaging at a place called EVDI. Is that the best place they have to refer? They have such old equipment. I wonder if they give a kickback to the center for their referrals. It makes me wonder. \nThe doctors do not care about the patients. They don't look too hard for any real issues you may have. They are content to take your money. That is the feeling I get. The place is one big cash register. Go and see for yourself. I personally will be switching to another office.
