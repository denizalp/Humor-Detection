I lived here for 6 months.  Had a difficult roommate situation and give 5 stars to management for helping us out.  There were multiple issues of car break-ins and towing so you definitely need to know the rules.  The lot fills up fast and it would be helpful to buy the street pass for $30 a year so you're not up a creek if you get home past 9 pm. The apartments are older so you get what you pay for in that sense.  They've done renovations in the kitchen and the 2 bedroom floor plan is a decent layout but I saw a cockroach in my closet and things just broke a little quicker than I would've liked so I felt like we called maintenance every 2 weeks. It was worth it to me to pay a little more to live alone peacefully but it's really not a bad deal to live a few blocks from the Epicentre and BB&T ballpark\/B of A Stadium.
