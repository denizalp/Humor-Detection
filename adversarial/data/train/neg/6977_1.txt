I made an appointment with this office and they gave me a timely one. Before my appointment they sent me the forms I needed to fill out. That saved time at the lobby. When I arrived, they checked me in and got seen immediately. They performed a routine checkup and dilated my pupils for the doctor to check. (Expect some blurriness for a about 1 hour)\nI got seen by Silvia and Dr. Ortiz, with Gladys assisting. They explained the procedure and were very nice about everything. They performed the checkup and got the results. All was ok and was on my way back home quickly. They are very efficient on what they are doing and felt comfortable at their office.\nI would recommend Wellish Vision Institute any time.
