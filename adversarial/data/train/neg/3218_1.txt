First of all- there are no pad Thai joints in Bloorcourt Village and that's what we had our mind set on. We ordered the chicken and shrimp pad Thai, to go (as we are close and had other things to do) and were surprised to open it to minimal chicken and 2 shrimp!! The tofu was hard like it was reheated and the onions were so thick we were surprised this person even obtained a kitchen position. Finally, no forks or napkins on a takeout order. Waste of money for a meal of 90% noodles, with little meat, veggies, and tofu. I want to support local restaurants but I want good food in return for hard earned money.
