I think this place serves HK cafe style fast food based on my basic understanding of Cantonese food; ordered Western style fried rice (sai caau faan) and hot and sour soup; fried rice was was tasty with great portion but my partner said he did not like the taste of the hot and sour soup.\n\nSo food was decent here. Why two stars only, you may wonder? \n\nReason was the cleanliness of the food court: actually last time I was coming for the rice noodle rolls at Da Ke Yi in the same food court, it wasn't that bad. But this time it was so gross I was able to remember clearly; there was uncleaned food mess on most tables and I could see oil dripping down the waste bin in front of me while I was eating. It was that disgusting. Wish I took a picture of it for Yelpers to see.\n\nVery unfortunate as the food is actually not bad, and the main point of my review is not meant to be critical of the food quality from the particular food joint. My advice is to order takeout maybe if you crave their food as the hygiene in the food court could kill your appetite.
