I LOVE Vegas Voice Institute. I've been going to Linda for speech therapy for a few months now and she has made significant changes to my voice. Not only does she help patients go through the exercises needed but she educates on how to think about your voice so that you use it more strategically. In addition to the therapy she is just so much fun to talk to. This is a top notch medical practice.
