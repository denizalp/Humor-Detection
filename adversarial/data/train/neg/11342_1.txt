Stumbled upon this place after going for dinner at the Drake Hotel, had some ice cream and saw that they had a full menu of soft tacos.  I vowed to come back, and surely enough I eventually dragged some friends out with me to try the tacos.  We shared a root beer float and the ice cream was even better than I remembered it the previous time.\n\nI was hoping to be blown away by the tacos, but I was disappointed.  The soft tacos were double stacked so each taco had 2 shells and I think that the soft tacos were reheated in the microwave, or at least it had that soft floppy feel like it was.  The tacos were incredibly messy to eat and I flavours did not come together very well.  I recall the pulled meat in one taco was completely overcome by the coleslaw on top.
