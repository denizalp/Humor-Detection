This was one if the most satisfying lunch meals I've had the pleasure of enjoying in quite a while. The flounder sandwich served upon a high end whole wheat bread was fried expertly and served with lettuce, thinly sliced tomato and homemade tartar sauce. It was crisp and juicy! The home made  chips and blue cheese to dip them in were scrumptious. The young waitresses were so polite and great at their job!!! Do yourself a favor stop by for lunch or dinner. Oh yes the fried green tomatoes were some of the best!!!
