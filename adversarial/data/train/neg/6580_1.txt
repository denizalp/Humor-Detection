We were able to snag free tickets during Teacher's Appreciation Week so we thought we'd check it out. We aren't huge Marvel fans but had seen a few of the movies and thought it would be interesting. That being said, it was okay. I can't imagine paying $35 a person to see this.\n\nPros: Interactive. The employees do a great job of keeping up the act that you are training to be an agent. The handheld devices are fun. And there are a few games you can play along the way.\n\nCons: It is small. You could easily walk through it in 10 minutes. There is a lot of reading. If you are with young ones then it may be hard to keep them entertained.\n\nIf you are a HUGE Marvel fan, then this is perfect for you. If you are any less than that, don't waste the time and money.
