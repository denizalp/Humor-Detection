Fantastic !  We ordered fresh Turkey for Thanksgiving and Prime Rib for Christmas.   The best we have ever had.  Well worth it.  Ham for Easter is next up.  They have a great selection of sausages, and they will prepare any cut of meat for you if you call in advance.  The employees are very friendly and helpful.  I travel out of my way now and will only purchase my meat from them.  I know it's local, humanely treated, and hormone free.  Love these guys
