If I could give the manager 0 I would. He was rude. Flat out called me a liar. My son and I went in because the drone we bought there, flew away. I was just trying to find out what to do. He said \" that never happened,  I've never heard of that before.\" I said so you just sell crap, that you know nothing about?\" He said \" we do not sell s!Ã—+\" I said well your no help can I speak with the manager, he informed me he was the manager, no name tag mind you.  So I turned and started to walk out, he said something in Spanish, that's when I said so if I were Mexican you'd help me? He then told me I was not to come back to his store again. I've been a loyal Verizon customer for more years then I can remember, and this little man treats me like this? No worries I will just continue to take my business to the Green Valley store where they treat everyone with respect and curtisy.
