Finally got to try this place. Nice decor, great bingsu, and look at the portion man. Instead of their oreo cheesecake, i asked for the sesame ice cream, taste was suprisingly good. Their shaved ice was fluffy and very creamy - not icy\/crunchy at all. Well, price could be better but the milkiness makes up for it.
