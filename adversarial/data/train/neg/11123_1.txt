Stopped into the Public House for a bit while waiting for pizza next door, and was pleasantly surprised.  Completely chill coffee shop, great aromas, and well picked beer selection from the cooler.\n\nIt's a bit sparse inside and the tables have you sitting awkwardly far apart if you're not by yourself, but otherwise the accommodations are quite comfortable and I could see this being a nice spot to get work done or just hang for a few hours on the laptop.\n\nThe coffee looked and smelled delicious, and had it not been 8pm when I was there I would have absolutely indulged.  There will be a return visit without a doubt to sample.\n\nWe were greeted when we came in and the staff was very polite overall.  This is a much more solid choice then many other coffee places if you just want to relax and not deal with a corporate or rushed atmosphere
