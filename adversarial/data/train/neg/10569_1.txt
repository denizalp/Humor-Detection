Terrible Customer Service. Rude. Snarky. Inattentive. \nOn 16March2017 I tried to purchase a 2 Person Tour with a Living Social Voucher. Voucher amount was $130.00. Tours cost $35\/person, but was expected to pay an additional $20 for using said voucher, $10 for being on a weekend, and $5 for booking online. The voucher only covered the $35\/person charge. I was expected to pay the additional charges, ($35+tax) out of pocket. (This was the cheapest... if I wanted a private tour; add $25\/person, Tour booked on a Holiday; add another $10\/person, Booked a Sunset Tour; add $10\/person... none of which can come out of the $130 voucher) Not to mention, there is a \"mandatory gratuity\" due before the tour starts of $10 cash\/person. \n\nBut that's not even the real issue... When I inquired about the additional charges and asked why the voucher doesn't cover them, is when I got irritated. I called them and immediately received a text message from the company, while the phone was still ringing. I asked about the charges and was ignored for exactly 29 minutes before I replied with \"I will have to ask for a refund.\" To which I received this reply; \"You couldn't wait 20 minutes for a response?\" and \"Living social can assist with the refund for your voucher. Sorry I was assisting other clients and dealing with a staff meeting and couldn't jump through hoops to immediately respond to your text.\" (Mature, business-conscious response, right?) \n\nTo Las Vegas Trail Riding:\n-Answer your phones. If you want to run your business with text messages, reply to them in a timely manner. 29 minutes is about 25 minutes too long to expect a paying customer to wait. Do you find it acceptable to leave a customer on hold for 29 minutes?\n-Don't be rude. Snarky responses to potential customers is unacceptable in any manner. I didn't initiate the refund process until you started being rude. I was truly hoping you would have tried to convince me to give you another chance to become a customer.\n-Be clear and upfront about pricing. How do you expect to increase clientele, new or returning, when you have hidden fees and erroneous up-charges to those who want to give you money? \n-Mandatory Gratuity?! Pay your tour guides! I will certainly tip them for a job-well-done... not before the service is complete. Terrible business plan!\n\nTo Potential Customers:\n-Be careful when choosing this company for your excursion. Las Vegas is chock full of businesses that cater to it's clientele and has up front pricing. \n-Be selective. Be informed. But most importantly; Have fun!
