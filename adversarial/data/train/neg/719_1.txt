Probably the BEST customer service experience I've ever had.  They truly care about their customers.  Unfortunately the mattress was a bit too firm for me (but it really was an excellent quality mattress!)  To be fair, I prefer the most ultra plush mattress on the market.  I really wanted to buy from Tuft, because I believe they are the most ethical mattress store on the planet.  Anyway, they made everything so easy & convenient when donating the mattress & processed my refund the day Salvation Army picked up.  Just amazing.  THANK YOU T\/N!
