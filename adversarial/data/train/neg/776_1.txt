Second time I used HPI service and it didn't disappoint. Kevin was very professional and went through the house with a fine tooth comb to pick up on even the most minor of things. At the end gave a detailed explanation about each item he noted (pictures and all!) explained the impact of each. Very easy company to work with and they do an outstanding job each time.
