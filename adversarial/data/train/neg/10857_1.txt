We waited almost 1.5 hours to move approximately 100ft to the enter the buffet at 2pm on a Tuesday.  The buffet seems kind of small compared to others I have been to.  The food was pretty good, but the choices were limited and it was hard to justify because of the wait. The prime rib, roasted salmon, pesto mashed potatoes, and the Kobe beef roast were delicious!  Their coffee is also very good. Would I go again?  Maybe - if the line actually moved at a somewhat decent pace. There are others that are better.  Check the Wynn or Caesars Palace.
