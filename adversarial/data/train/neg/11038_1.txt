We tried Maxwell's Tavern out for two reasons. One was because of the reviews, and two was because its relatively close to us. Also, since moving to the south I have basically become obsessed with deep fried pickles, and need to try them wherever I go. :)\nWe got to the restaurant and were spoken to right away. The girl was super sweet and told us she would seat us shortly. We were seated within about 3 minutes. \nWe were sitting down and our waitress came over right away. He name was Sarah. She was friendly, prompt, and extremely helpful. Our beers arrived within 5 minutes (if that). She came back and took our order. And our appetizers came again within about 5 or 6 minutes. The fried pickles were DELICIOUS and my husband said the wings were also perfect. We finished our appetizers and it was about another 5-10 minutes before our main came out, which was great. I hate when restaurants bring out your mains minutes after you've only just started eating your appetizers. So Maxwell's tavern had everything times perfectly. \nSarah also made some suggestions to my husband regarding beer to try. He loved what she suggested! \nOur entrees arrived hot and fresh. Everything was delicious (the slaw was some of the best I've had here). \nWe will definitely be back again! Keep it up Maxwell's tavern! Everything from the service to the food to the prices was excellent!
