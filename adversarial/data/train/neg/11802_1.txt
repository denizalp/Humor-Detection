Decided to check out Fish N Bowl for a light lunch with my girlfriend.  Ordered the Crazy Jalapeños, Bento box with bulgogi and nigiri and the FNB tacos.  Jalapeños were good... nothing special though.  Bento box was very good, bulgogi was good, but doesn't compare to most korean places... Komex comes to mind.  Nigiri was very good, not too much with the right amount of sashimi.  The star of lunch were the FNB tacos... Fried wanton skins were perfect as a shell, and the depth of flavors was great.  A must order again next time.\n\nAlso tried an interesting Japanese Creamy Mango soda which was very good.  Light refreshing and good but not overpowering mango taste.
