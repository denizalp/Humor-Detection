I've taken my MKC in for routine service several times. Loaner cars are almost never available (a guarantee when one purchases a Lincoln).  I even called to get \"on the list\" for a loaner car.  Four weeks later and still no call back.\nWhile the people are very nice, the service experience at this dealership is sub-standard.
