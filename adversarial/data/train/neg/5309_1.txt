I'd tried the Cheesecake Factory about 6 years ago in the States and had an amazing meal, so undoubtedly I was thrilled when they opened up 10 minutes from my house.\n\nIt was day 3 after opening, so we hoped the wait would be a little shorter. We got a buzzer around 1:45pm, did a little pre-Black Friday shopping, and were seated around 3:15pm. \n\nI ordered the ahi tartare and crispy crab bites, while my friend got the fettuccini alfredo with chicken. I am such a sucker for the combination of avocado + raw fish, so I absolutely loved my choice. We then shared the 'coffee & cream chocolate supreme' cheesecake (each slice is HUGE we could barely finish the one between the two of us). We had originally ordered the 'white chocolate caramel macadamia nut', but were informed a while later that they had run out. Service was overall slow, which was to be expected during opening week, but we were especially confused when the cheesecake took 20 minutes to bring out.\n\nRegardless of the extra time spent here, the food is delicious, and I look forward to tackling the rest of their vast menu in the very near future.
