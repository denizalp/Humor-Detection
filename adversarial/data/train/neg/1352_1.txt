It was okay, had a groupon for this place to try out. One of the workers speak very little english so it's hard for her to understand what you're trying to say or order. I am not trying to offend anyone, personally.\n\nTheir service is kind of slow, maybe 2 chefs working and 2 waitresses but that's about all. Some of their meals are too sweet or really salty. I was only looking for a place away from the strip since all of their restaurants sucked. The Thai Tea was really sweet you can taste the powder and the boba along with it, and it was ok.\n\nCompared to the other Thai place I always eat to in OC, this place was okay, it didn't meet my standards but it's was also kind of expensive. Total cost was around $70 but the groupon covered more than half so it came out to be $30.\n\nI would just recommend the Tom Yum Soup and Fried Rice, the soup can be salty but adding a little lemon would make it better. If the food was somewhat better, because I do feel bad that they're understaff and trying to make meet ends with the restaurant as well.\n\n\nPS dont order the curry, majority of the presentation of the food is horrible..\n\n\n\noh and i think my stomach couldnt handle this it was hurting a little after
