I love Fern. The food is innovative, unique, delicious, and filling... a combination that is hard to come by in many vegetarian restaurants. \n\nI love that they use local ingredients as much as possible, and the menu changes with the seasons. The Indian Tacos and Beet Tagliatelle are a hands down favorite, and hubby enjoys the Om burger, which is massive! The Buddha Bowl is another go to dish that never fails to impress. \n\nThe decor is just plain fun. It is also a great spot to drop in and order a juice from, especially with the lack of raw juice bars in Charlotte. \n\nDespite the absence of a kid's menu, the staff has always been wonderful and kind when we bring our 4 year old daughter along. The soups are delicious, and make the perfect serving size for her dinner.\n\nWe have yet to try any of Fern's desserts, but if positive exclamations from nearby tables are any indication, they are delicious indeed. :-)\n\nWe have also brought both sets of our parents to eat at Fern. Both my family and his are meat-lovers, and they were pleasantly surprised at how much they enjoyed the vegetarian fare, with compliments rather than complaints.
