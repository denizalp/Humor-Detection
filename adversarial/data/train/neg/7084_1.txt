Thunder from Down Under exceeded my expectations and was a ton of fun for myself and my girlfriends on our last night in Vegas. It wasn't the most amazing spectacle I've ever seen, but what can you really expect from a strip show?\n\nMost of the men in the show are actually the ones you see on the billboards and advertisements, so it's cool to see them in person. They may not be the best dancers and some of the group numbers were a little cheesy, but $30-$40 bucks for an hour and a half of entertainment is a great bargain, especially in Vegas. The show is very interactive and most of my friends and I got to touch the boys, even though we were in the very back row. \n\nThe room is pretty small, so VIP tickets are not necessary by any means. There is a bar in the back but it's only open prior to the show, so if you're trying to get drunk during the show, I would suggest doing so before the show begins. \n\nThe host has a great personality and makes everyone in the room feel special for being there. I would highly recommend this show to any female who has a sense of humor and an appreciation for attractive men. I would not, however, recommend bringing your boyfriend or male significant other if you are a female. The men in the room all looked horribly bored and embarrassed the entire time!
