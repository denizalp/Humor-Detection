This place was packed for the Calvin Harris show. There was barely any space to move around in the pool.\n\nAnd not only that, we were promised a specific deal for getting in, but instead when we reached the door we had to pay $100 for guys and $30 for girls. Not cool.\n\nI can't really attest to much else about the place. I was too busy nursing myself back to health... too many toxins.
