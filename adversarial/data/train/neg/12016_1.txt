We got there when it was opening. The atmosphere is nice. I especially like the outdoor bar that connects to the indoor bar through a window. I got the turkey, bacon, guacamole wrap. It was alright. I didn't love it but I didn't hate it. I may have just ordered the wrong thing. My friend ordered the steak sticks and they looked delicious. He also said the side salad was great. But I dunno, it just wasn't my favorite place.
