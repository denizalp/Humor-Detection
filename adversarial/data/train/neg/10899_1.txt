My complaint with BJ's Brewhouse has little to do with this local restaurant in Mesa; it has everything to do with the Rewards Program and the corporate offices and policies.  In short I lost the equivalent to $150 of Reward Points that I had acquired.  We frequented BJ's quite often and had decided to save up the Rewards Points for a special occasion that happen to be my wife's birthday.  While the waitress wrote down my Rewards number I noted that I had zero points where at the last visit I had something over 350 points. I immediately went to talk to the front desk folks. I was informed that the points expire without much of any explanation as to when or why. I wasn't aware of that nor was it ever mentioned on our visits.  I basically told the front desk folks I was really ticked off at this situation and didn't receive an apology or an acknowledgement of my dissatisfaction; and I walked away. I'm a frequent enough patron at that restaurant that the wait staff remembers what our drink order is most visits.  \nI've talked to the manager on more than one occasion personally.  I did expect to have the front desk staff inform the manager; and I more or less expected the manager to at least come and talk to us, but nothing of that nature happened. When we left the restaurant; obviously the front desk recognized me as the complainant and wisely said nothing to me, not even a thank you, or have a good evening.\nAt home I emailed the corporate office my complaint and haven't ever received a reply.  I can only assume no one cares about this; not the local restaurant nor the corporate offices.\nAs I mentioned, we frequented the local BJ's quite often. I have no intention of patronizing this restaurant in the future due to this situation and the lack of response. Be aware that your BJ's points expire at some point during the year; a fact I wasn't aware of nor ever warned against.
