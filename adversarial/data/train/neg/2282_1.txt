Shari & gale have been my doctors since I was 15. I've never felt more comfortable with any other doctors in my entire life!! They go above and beyond to actually listen to you and you can tell they genuinely care. I recommended them to everyone I know and I'm honestly excited to go to the doctors when I'm sick so I get to see the staff, nurses, and doctors. Lol.
