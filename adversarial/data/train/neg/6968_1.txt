TIP: Skip the appetizers - Small amount for the price. We had the fried spring rolls.\n\nWe had the Beef Pho and Beef Pad Thai. Both were freshly made, great taste, and good presentation.\n\nService was good, but nothing exceptional.\n\nPrice is good for the main entrees.\n\nI only gave it three stars as the their spiciness scale is crazy! We love spicy food and normally order closer to a 7 or 8 on the 1-10 spicy scale. We got a 4 on the Pho and a 6 on the pad thai and both us could not handle that spiciness. A little fair warning would have been nice. \n\nThe restaurant is on the small side, but is comfortable and clean. \n\nWe will be back, but will order something less spicy and will try some of their more authentic dishes.
