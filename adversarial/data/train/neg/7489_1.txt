Really enjoyed my experience at Turnhouse Grille. I live nearby so I popped in here by myself for a glass of wine and potential take out order.  Small place but very cozy and great decor. Sat at the bar which was full on a Tuesday and ended up ordering the Salmon BLT with side of saut√©ed spinach. So delicious! Brooke behind the bar was a pleasure - very welcoming. Also this Tuesday was 1\/2 priced bottle wine night. Definitely check out the turnhouse grille!
