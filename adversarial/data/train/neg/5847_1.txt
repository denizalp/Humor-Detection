We stopped in for lunch to try this new place and we weren't disappointed. I am very picky on my Middle Eastern food and this is the best one in the West Valley. \nWe ordered their Kurta plate. The meat had the right spices and the rice was delicious.\nThe chicken plate had moist chicken and delicious rice with a yummy Greek salad.\nI tried the Tabuli which was as good as my home made.\nHighly recommend this place.\nI am thrilled that they opened in my neighborhood. \nWill be back for sure.
