My back took a beating after a recent vacation... maybe someday I will learn to pack lighter.... probably not.\n\nAnyways, I came in here knowing that I just needed a little adjusting and the price was waaaaay cheaper than my copay for a chiropractic visit at my family doctor's practice.  I was seen quickly and efficiently. They don't do the amaaaazing muscle stimulator that my regular chiro does, which always sends me into a fantastic nap, but by not doing so is also how they keep the price low, so I don't mind. Both the doctor and the front desk clerk were pleasant and helpful.\n\nThere was an issue with the computer crashing and it turns out that it charged my card twice, but I came in when I noticed it and the second charge was refunded promptly on the next business day.  The guy at the front was very apologetic... not his fault, computers...can't live with them..can't live without them.\n\nI will definitely back next year after my vacation again, even paying the single visit for a non-member, non-first time guest is way cheaper than my chiro co-pay, so it is worth it for me!\n\n(I hope I don't get to the point where I really need the benefit of their membership, but if I do, it is a phenomenal deal!)
