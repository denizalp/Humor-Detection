I have to start this off with saying that even though I'm going to list a few complaints, I cannot give this hotel anything less than five stars. We only stayed here one night, but it was the best night we had in Vegas, hands down. I got a deal on the room so I'm not used to a hotel of this calibur.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n- Luxurious looking rooms.\n- King sized bed was beyond comfortable.\n- Completely sound proof.\n- The curtains and blinds were controlled by remote. (I'm easily amused, sorry).\n- Separate bath tub and shower. \n- Security preventing random people having access to the hotel floors.\n- Countless food\/shopping choices on-site.\n- Room service was wickedly fast\/precise.\n- Customer service at the front desk was unbelievably friendly\/helpful. They allowed us to check in early free of charge.\n- Held our luggage for free after check-out so we could ride the gondolas and walk around a bit before our next check-in.\n\nTHE BAD:\n- They didn't tell us WiFi was included in the resort fee, so that was lost potential. \n- NO complimentary beverages. Not even water. (But the selection of in-room paid drinks was amazing - also the tap water was drinkable).\n- Housekeeping woke us up at 8 am and 11 am even though we had late check out at 2 pm. That was honestly the worst thing, and it wasn't truly a big deal.\n\nI would stay here again in a heartbeat!\nIt may be overly expensive, but it was totally worth it.
