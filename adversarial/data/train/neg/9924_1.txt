This review is for their cookies. All of the food I've had here has been really good (croissants, muffins, soups, paninis, baguette sandwiches, etc.) and their coffees are pretty awesome too.  But the five stars goes solely to their cookies.  Soft on the inside, crumbly on the outside, and lots and lots of chocolate chips. When I came in today, the cookies were actually fresh from the oven... Yumm! \n\nThe only downside - a chocolate chip cookie costs over $2! If only it came with a free glass of milk...
