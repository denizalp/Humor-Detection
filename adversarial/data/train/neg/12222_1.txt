I have been living here for over 8 months.  I would say the place is nice and the office staff is amiable, however, I had something happen to me today that made me sick.  I have a car that is fully insured parked in a space that I pay for.  Someone came along last night and went car to car to ensure everyone's tags were up to date.  I am waiting to get enough money to fix the car (It runs perfectly but there is an emissions issue).  They were  kind enough to leave a sticker saying that a private company called ALL CITY TOWING would tow my car and charge me for it unless I renewed my tags.  I didn't know that private business had the right to dictate DMV policy.  When I asked I was told its in my contract.  What is in my contract?  That they send a private company to harass me so they can make a buck?  Absolute crap. My contract expires soon and I expect to catch hell for this so I will see.    This is a bunch of commie crap..
