I was here fifteen years ago and this place was amazing.  However, it's gone downhill since then.  I don't think I would go back.\n\nPositives:\nOur chef suggested things that weren't on the menu and they turned out to be very good.\nVery friendly staff, waitress service was above par.\nA decent variety of fish offered.\n\nNegatives:\nBathrooms were dirty and the entire restaurant really needs a makeover.  There is no ambiance at all.\nWe called ahead and asked how much the All You Can Eat was and were told $23.95.  When we got there it was $25.95.\nMany of the long roll selections were boring.\nI asked for oysters and was told that it wasn't on the All You Can Eat menu but I was willing to pay extra for them.  The chef was not interested in making them for me.
