I am not a vegetarian, and I have to admit, I have not really eaten at many vegetarian places.  However, I do LOVE Indian food, and this place came highly recommended by a friend.  After two trips to Woodlands, I can say that I don't miss the meat when I come here.\n\nIn true Indian restaurant fashion, the smell of the spices and curry permeated throughout the restaurant.  The inside is painted a peach-like color.  Hindu decorations and paintings adorn the walls.  However, the decor is simple.  The staff is friendly and reasonably attentive, even when the restaurant is packed.  While it's maybe not the quickest place, our food has come out hot and fresh each time.  Their prices are very reasonable, with many entrees less than $10 at dinner time.\n\nAnd now, on with the food I've had:\n\nSamosas: Crispy crust on the outside, plenty of flavorful filling on the inside.  These are not too salty, but plenty of great seasoning.  While these are not the best I've ever had, they're pretty solid.  (4\/5)\n\nGarlic naan: The naan I've always had has been soft and fluffy.  However, both times I had it here, it's thinner and a little crisp on the outside.  The garlic flavor is more subtle than at a lot of places, but still good.  I think the crisp texture holds up a little better for loading it with food, so I really like it.  (4.5\/5)\n\nChana Masala: Great spices, and I like the chickpeas. (4\/5)\n\nVegetable Jalfraeze: I absolutely loved the vegetables in this, and this sauce highly flavorful as well.  (4.5\/5)\n\nPalak Paneer:  This reminded me of saag that I used to get at an Indian place back home.  It's more of a mild dish, but the spinach and the cheese are wonderful in it. (4\/5)\n\nMalai Kofta:  This is, so far, the best thing I have eaten here.  The sauce is a little more creamy, mildly sweet.  The dumpling is AMAZING, although I only got three medium-sized ones in the dish. (5\/5)\n\nPaneer Makhani:  Again, the cheese is so delicious in this dish, but there is just never enough in it.  The tomato-based sauce was very good and decently spicy. (4\/5)\n\nMango Lassi:  I have never had one that had such a fresh, strong mango flavor to it.  Very delicious.  (5\/5)\n\nThere are still so many things I want to try here.  I have seen their Dosas, and that is next up on my list.  Their food is flavorful and spicy, but not overly hot (unless you request that, I believe).  Overall, I'd rate them a solid 4.5 out of 5.
