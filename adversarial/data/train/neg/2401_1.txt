What a great find! This place reminds me of why I love the east end. Such a cute, intimate, little cafe with a very relaxing atmosphere and great employees who seem genuinely happy to see you  and have conversation with you. Where can you get a large speciality Brew for under 2 bucks or Americano for 2.50? Um hardly anywhere. This is a gem and must be checked out on the reg.
