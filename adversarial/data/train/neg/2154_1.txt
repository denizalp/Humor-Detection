We came here before the big crowd hit the place!\nIt sure looked very popular since by the time we left it was packed. We had some appetizers like hummus, and cheese plate, followed by tofu tacos, Korean rib and scallops. They were all great! Kids really enjoyed the hummus and cheese plates. They were very friendly.
