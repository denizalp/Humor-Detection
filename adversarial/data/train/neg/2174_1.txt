I had tickets to a Pirates game and was looking for a place near PNC Park where I could get a drink and a quick meal. \n\nMost of the places in the area were super packed with no chance of me getting a seat or any service. McFaddens was an exception. They have a huge bar area and where were plenty of seats and places to stand right at the bar and order a drink and meal. \n\nApart from the convenience of being the only place close to the park where I could get service, I found the place to be just average. I had a couple of Yuengling drafts and a chicken sandwich. The beer selection is OK, but not too extensive. The chicken sandwich was also just OK. It was a buffalo chicken sandwich. I've had similar sandwiches at many places and the one here was a little smaller than most I've had. \n\nOne positive item was the service. The ladies behind the bar were really friendly and attentive.
