This place is great. Awesome drinks and a fun atmosphere. We went on a slow night, but it was still great. There were a couple of issues with the waitstaff, but nothing too bad. The bus boy cleared our table, drinks and all when he thought we were finished.  Turns out we had just both stepped away for a moment.  The server replaced the drinks and all was well.  I think they are ironing out the wrinkles, and once they do, I'll give them a 5-star review.
