I'm disappointed with my visit today. In the past, no matter what I have ordered, I have plenty of time as I receive my food rather quickly. Today, my waitress was slow and the kitchen was slow enough for a snail to pass it in a race. It took more than 30 minutes for my food to come giving no time to actually eat before my lunch break was over.\n\nI might try one more time before giving up completely. Last thing? The guy in front of me was paying and also complaining about the slow service\/food.
