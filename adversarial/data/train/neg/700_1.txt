PS702 hosted a group dinner for me for participants in a class I'm running at my company.  We used the beautiful outdoor dining as a private space, and loved playing jumbo sized Jenga and Connect4, the food was WONDERFUL!  Apps and a fixed price menu were well received by the guests - something for everyone, including our vegetarians.  But most of all, Victoria, whose name is bigger than she is, was a powerhouse as our server! She was friendly, attentive, accurate and accommodating. Great time was had by all last night!  Thank you Victoria and PS702!
