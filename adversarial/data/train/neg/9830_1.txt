Had a pretty disappointing appointment with Dr. Tamm.  I'm seeking help with chronic migraines, dramatic fatigue, and ear ringing.  He spent a couple of minutes asking for my symptoms (they're in the paperwork), and did some basic reflex tests.  \n\nHe then proceeded to tell me \"you're fine.  If it was something dangerous, you'd already know.\"  He subsequently made an odd comment about \"young fat women\" being the only group with intracranial hypertension, and proceeded to argue with my wife about why he wasn't looking into anything more complicated.  \n\nUltimately he said he'd order an MRI \"if it'll make you feel better,\" but at that point I was pretty crestfallen.  This is why I haven't sought out help for my issues - I feel like the doctor is prone to say \"well, you present well, you seem fine, no worries.\"  Which, by the way, is almost exactly what Dr. Tamm said.  \n\nI'm sure he's a fine neurologist, and maybe even a decent guy.  I may have caught him on a bad day, but it was a very disappointing and sad thing to be told by someone I've waited months to see that \"you're fine.\"  I will not be returning to this practice.
