Finally got to try this place after hearing about it and failing to go once. I went with some friends on Sunday night and left somewhat satisfied. \n\nThere seems to be no shortage to Taiwanese-themed restaurants, flooding Instagram with tons of shaved ice pictures. Cha Me. Cha seems to remain one of the more popular options. I really wanted to try some of the noodles served here, something I haven't seen at competitors, but the waitress notified us that they were no longer serving rice or noodle dishes because it was after 10PM (IT WAS 9:40PM...). Needless to say, I was a little disappointed but we decided to try the place because we were already there. \n\nThe staff seems shorthanded, so getting their attention can be difficult at times. A side note is that water will come warm and in paper cups. Some of the items we got off the menu were the chocolate cheesecake, the white peach tea, green tea shaved ice, the green tea latte, the four seasons oolong tea, the crispy chicken, chicken wings and yam fries. \n\nMost of the drinks were average to above average (the four seasons just tasted like chrysanthemum tea really) with the white peach really standing out as the favourite. It was sweet and packed a flavour punch. I would visit cha me cha just to grab this and go. \n\nThe chocolate cake was interesting but nothing memorable. The crispy chicken and fried chicken wings were well breaded and seasoned and were enjoyable, regardless of quantity. The yam fries are very very good and will go well with either salt & pepper or plum topping. \n\nAll in all, the food and drinks were very good but the wait and service really brought this 4-star to a 3-star. I will definitely be back to try those noodles and will update my review then. Hopefully this jumps up a bit!
