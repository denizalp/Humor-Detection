Dinner.  After coming here and having to wait almost an hour and a half to get in, the food was damn good.  \n\nMy buddy kept telling everyone in line and in the crowd how I was @$$ raping him because the line was super long and the food wasn't expected to be good (he's cranky when he's hungry).   But once we sat down and got our food, the constant drubbing of complaints were replaced by silence and \"mmm\" \"ooo\" \"yum\".    Hands down one of the best buffets in Vegas.
