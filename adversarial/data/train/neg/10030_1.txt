I've been to La Veranda several times since it has opened and went again last night.  It's turned into a populatar spot with the patio and much of the dining room filled with patrons for dinner and still more coming as we were leaving at 8pm!\nI can understand why it's popular, it's great Italian food at reasonable prices and the wine list is fantastically priced.\nService has always been good and my only pet peeve with the place is although order taking and food service is fast you can NEVER get their attention for the bill. Good if you want to linger, bad if you want to move on with your evening.\n\nThe dishes that are biggest success with myself and family\/friends who have gone are the two shrimp appetizers, one in a spicy oil olive great for soaking up with bread and the other is in a tomato based garlic with caper sauce. Shrimp is always cooked well and there are usually 6-7 large shrimp in dish- at $10 for the appt. Good value to me.\n\nFor mains we have always ordered veal, chicken or fish- all excellent and well cooked. Many of them come with a speciality pasta to compliment dish (ie last night I had chicken paired with linguine in a pesto cream sundried tomato sauce) Otherwise main dishes come with choice of potatoe\/veg or penne with tomato sauce.\nPortions are large (always have some to take home) and priced around $16-$20 for entree.\nAgain wines are priced well.\n\nDessert are decent, nothing to write home about. I suspect they buy them anyhow.
