I finally got around to trying the unchicken and waffles after wanting to for so long. It's pretty much all hype. The \"chicken\" and waffles were as hard as a rock, with only a tiny drizzle of maple syrup to help you get it down.  It's kinda sad to say but the sweet potato mash was the best thing on the plate.
