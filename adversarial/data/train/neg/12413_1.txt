I took classes with this company a few years ago, and because of the great experience, I chose to go back again for CPR\/AED and First Aid certification as CEUs for my massage therapy license. \nTheir classroom is perfect -- large enough, spread out so that you aren't stuck behind too many people to be able to see, a restroom readily available -- all in all, perfect. \n\nThe course content and the instructor (Mike Camden) were both excellent. He packed so much information in so quickly, yet it was all clear and understandable, with bits of humor tossed in to keep it interesting. I had recently been injured in a car accident, and the instructor modified the practice session so that I could still participate. (I couldn't get down on the floor, so he put a dummy on a table so that I could reach it and still fully participate in the practice session.) He was very friendly and easy to approach with questions. My time and money couldn't have been utilized any better. \n\nThank you, Heart Savers, for providing such an excellent service!
