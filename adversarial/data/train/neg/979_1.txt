Came for lunch and the handed us an all you can eat menu. Service was mediocre. Pretended they couldn't speak English when we asked about the regular menu so I didn't get to try half the things I saw online I wanted to try.\n\nMessed up me and my buddies order like 5 times so I didn't even get what I ordered and apparently had rolls come out after I left that they charged me for.\n\nBarely gave any ginger and wasabi. \nDid not refill drinks.\n\nWas mediocre at best but the chef looked new and wouldnt let us order off menu( only 2 other booths had customers and I've read reviews that say they do)\n\nThe squid was not even swallowable yet somehow I ordered 4 after the 1st when I have never even ordered more that 1 at any place. Not sure how, it was either cut wrong or spoiled but I had to drink half a cup of water to swallow(wasn't any wasabi left to bury in)\n\nI plan to try again and definitely has potential based off of online menu so I'll give a 4 star for now.
