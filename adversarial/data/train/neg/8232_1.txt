I decided to give Choolaah a try, as I was wanting something new and I'm not too familiar with Indian cuisine. \nUnfortunately I don't think it's for me, but I was impressed by Choolaah's atmosphere! The modern architecture is very visually appealing and the restaurant contains pieces that I've never seen before: a decorative table made out of books and a jacuzzi-like hand washing station, to be exact. \nThe ordering process appeared confusing but my cashier was very friendly and helpful! Overall, Choolaah appears to be a trendy, go-to spot for those who enjoy Indian food and I can see why.
