Love love love Poke Express! It's so good! I've never had any complaints and I go quite often. I even get other friends and family to try if they've never had poke before. They love it as well! My favorite is the spicy ahi tuna but love all their kimchee pokes too. Mussel and tako are my favorites. Fish has always been fresh!
