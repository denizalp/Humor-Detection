This company will take your money and run!  They are not honest about the installation process, the installer will probably be late, and after the installation you will leave with a list of things you need to \"fix.\"  Examples of this would be painting broken trim board, fill in grout, coordinate with a stucco repair (don't worry, you have to paint yourself), and deal with a warranty company to deal with any issues after the installation.  They will take your hard earned money and run with it; pass you along to the next person that can DEAL with you!  Save your stress and money!  Go anywhere else!
