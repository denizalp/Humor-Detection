AVOID this place, first time trying it ... to say the least SUBPAR. The cost of the food is way to much for how mediocre it is, figured be a good burger, but hell no. Customer service was bad, acted as though we were bugging them.\n\nWill NOT do this one again, dont know if I will do ANY Fatburger again. Pricing is not reasonable for what they serve.
