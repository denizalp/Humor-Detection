Ok this was my first time here. Just passing by. (Lunch) Nice sports bar if you are into that sort of thing. Ordered my hamburger more towards the well done side came the opposite.  Didn't saying thing since it would have taken to long to fix it and everyone else would have been through eating. Being right on Indian School of course it is going to be noisy. Would recommend eating inside. Also has a dog friendly patio. I own a dog but do not like eating with him.  I will eat here again but inside this time and see what happens.
