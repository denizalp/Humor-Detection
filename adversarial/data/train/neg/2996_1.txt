I ordered a chicken schwarma and the first thing I noticed was the chicken wasn't as greasy compared to the the other schwarma places it was actually quite flavorful. The hot sauce was pretty weak. I believe if they had a better hot sauce it make the schwarma taste better. But overall I thought it was a good schwarma will not hesitant to come back again. Only con was it was a bit overpriced.
