I have had good experiences at this site until today. I don't recommend scheduling online for a couple reasons. First, you have to call back and give them information on the phone because you can't enter it on the website, so what's the point. Second, there is a much higher chance of having your appointment screwed up if it starts off as an online appointment. When I called back and gave all the information I thought everything was set. When I got to the office, no appointment. Not good when you you get no food and water since midnight. My choices are to try it again or wait until something opens up, screwing up my entire schedule. I  decided to wait and write this review.
