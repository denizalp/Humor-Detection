Very cool Burger joint and I'm even sure that the nightlife is even cooler!  Looks like a place that would be rocking all night long!  \n\nDecor and music played really does add to the experience.  If you have been to Cecile and Ramone in Quebec City (like a Hard Rock restaurant) this is it's burger restaurant cousin.  I think I like LB et LB even better!\n\nFor my lunch I ordered the Classic burger with cheese with onion rings.  It came with a pate chinois (shepherds pie) soup which was a nice interesting touch! The burger arrived with a Kool-aid pickle, creamy coleslaw and a stack of onion rings.  Burger was Huuuuuuge!  I've never had a Kool-Aid pickle so this was a nice touch!  I must come here again to try other items on the menu as portions are very generous.  \n\nVibe of this place is rock n roll meets hipster cool!  Definitely a nice addition to Laval and Centrepolis!
