You would think that a hotel that caters to the business crowd would upgrade their rooms to include wireless access, but alas, that is not the case with the Sheraton.  The rooms only have cable access with wireless in the lobby (spotty at best).  Makes it very inconvenient, since I only had wireless.\n\nOther than that, it's a nice hotel.  Great location in Toronto across from City Hall and most rooms have great views of the city, whether you have  Lake views or City views.  The service is good and the rooms are clean and spacious.  The nice thing about the location of the hotel is that it is  short walk or a cab ride away from some fantastic restaurants.  You are close to the Entertainment District and the theatres on King St.  \n\nOh, one other thing, don't bother going to the \"The Bistro on Two\", their restaurant serving only breakfast and lunch.  It is outrageously priced - $7.00 for oatmeal and $5.00 for coffee!  There are many places within walking distance to grab breakfast and lunch.  It was a huge price gouge and very disappointing.  I've stayed in many hotels in some fabulous cities and I have yet to see prices so outrageous.  I expect the onsite restaurants in hotels to charge more, but this was just robbery.  And the food wasn't all that great.
