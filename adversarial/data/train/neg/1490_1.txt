Shrimp fettuccine & lasagne are incredible! Our waiter was very helpful & even told us about a Lychee drink they used to make,  and they were able to make it for us even though it was no longer on the menu! Yummm... I frequently stay at MGM signature & will definitely go back to this restaurant. No too pricey considering it's a Wokfgang Puck restaurant.
