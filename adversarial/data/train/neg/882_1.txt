I went here for the 2nd time today. I had to go to the library nearby to do some studying so I decided to give this place a shot again. I came in during lunch rush hour but thankfully I didn't get caught in a long line up. I ended up getting my order of Kafta Kabob Dinner plate with potatoes, salad, and rice. \n\nFor those of you who don't know what Kafta is, it's basically ground beef meatballs seasoned with some herbs and spices. I thought it was pleasant. Not something I would come back for though, definitely not something I would show someone around to, but maybe something I would eat if I was around in the area. I'm generally not a biased eater too, so please don't take this review as being offensive. \n\nI thought the meatballs were alright. They could've done with a little less cooking in my opinion. The potatoes were nicely seasoned, I think the potatoes were cooked in a stock that had a tomato pur√©e base, which I personally never had. The potatoes broke apart with the fork, and was really well seasoned like I said. The salad, there was definitely plenty of it. It was alright, nothing out of the ordinary. No cheese, just some vinegar-based dressing, tomatoes, and lettuce. \n\nAll in all, it was a pretty average meal. Not something I usually like to purposely plan a trip for but efini
