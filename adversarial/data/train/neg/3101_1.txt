The thing I like the most about here is how they play records throughout day. They have a wall of books and records for you to look at and which they play. There's a cozy layout w dark wooden benches and chairs. There are a couple communal tables Which creates an open and friendly vibe. The two people running the cafe the day I went were very friendly and brought me water right away after I finished my coffee. They have limited menue items for sandwiches, but the grilled sandwich I had when I went was deeeelicious! They offer a solid selection of beers, and have a variety of events at night.
