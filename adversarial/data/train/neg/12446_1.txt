I tried Pose Salon because of Jennifer S. Yelp review and loved it. I even tried the same stylist, Dennis, because of her review. \n\nMy family moved out to Phoenix from Washington DC and for the last three years I haven't found a stylist to call my own. Essentially, I've been a Bedouin of sorts, seasonally migrating from salon to salon trying different stylists. \n\nPose Salon is a full service salon in South Phoenix. They do offer day Spa treatments, nail treatments. It does not have the frills (read: \"looks\") of a high-end Salon, but the people are really nice. Kwan, the manager (or owner, not sure which) is always polite and attentive. They usually will try to fit me in -- but maybe that's because they don't have the traffic of a more popular Salon (use that to your advantage ladies!). \n\nI think the pricing was on the higher scale ($110 for a cut and all-over color) - especially for a salon in South Phoenix. But I could see why Dennis would command top dollar.  He has experience and long hair is a bit more difficult to manage - especially for coloring.  He has a 1st time customer discount too - which may have been how I got hooked on him.   For a comparison, I can't get out of the Elizabeth Arden Salon for less than $150.\n\nAt the end of the day, I trust Dennis. While he is generally quiet, serious and not much of a conversationalist, he is diligent creative and consultative. But more importantly, he listens! \n\nIf you live in South Phoenix, I encourage you to try to support your local community businesses and at least give this place a try!   \n\nPose Salon helped stop my wunderlust.  I think I've found a home for my hair.
