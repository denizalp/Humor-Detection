I like hibachi but I forgot how expensive the fancy stuff were. With that in mind and my budget, I decided to get an assortment of sushi rolls and a signature cocktail. The sushi and coconut shrimp were great, but the cocktail was just a tease. It honestly tasted like juice. Maybe the light up ice cube was placed to detract you from the lack of alcohol.
