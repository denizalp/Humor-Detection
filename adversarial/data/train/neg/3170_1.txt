The staff at Lang Van are so great, I confuse them with family sometimes.  Once, I found myself looking around for my leather jacket, and became alarmed when I realized the last time I had worn it was at Lang Van a week ago.  I entered the restaurant at 5pm before any customers showed up and the owner greeted me with a big grin, revealing she had kept my jacket under the register counter for the whole week.  The staff will fill your water glass with such frequency and alacrity you will be amazed.  Go three times, and the owner will remember you and what you eat.  Take your parents once, and she will always ask about them.  Do yourself a favor and just have her order for you!  The first thing she chose for me is still my favorite.  The food is amazing, but the staff at Lang Van are the best to their regular customers!
