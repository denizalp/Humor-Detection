Was in the area and was craving subway so I drove to the closest one to me.  Parking was quick, its in a center so there is plenty of parking.  When I walked up there was a staff cleaning the windows and I am so OCD so that makes me happy lol.  \n\nAnother staff helped me inside and I just got a meatball sub on italian herbs and cheese.  I added cheese and onions on it was really good.  I mean the staff can't really mess up your order because its right in front of you.\n\nThe place was very clean and the staff was very nice to me, as I was leaving the guy outside cleaning the windows stopped and opened the door for me!  Next time I am craving subway I will have to go to this place!
