We kind of randomly picked Tottie's last night when we were in the mood for Asian food, because it's really close to my boyfriend's house. We almost went to SumoMaya or one of the other places we knew about, but I'm so glad we picked Tottie's instead. It is so delicious, and you get a ton of food for the price. We normally eat a lot, but we still have another meal's worth of food leftover (if not more!). \n\nWe got the Vegetable Fried Rice, Sesame Chicken and Soft Shell Crab with Curry. The plate of fried rice was humongous; we'll probably be able to have leftovers of this more than once. It was very well flavored and had a ton of veggies in it. The curry was also great, and it came in a huge bowl! The crabs were cooked very well. I'm not huge on that kind of seafood, but I still enjoyed it. The Sesame Chicken was my favorite - fried and crispy, and they had a perfect amount of sauce on it. A lot of places seem to leave their chicken too saucy or too bland, so that was great. \n\nWe'll definitely be going back here again, or will probably order it in the next time we want Asian food :) I would definitely recommend this place next time you're in the mood for Asian!! \n\nI also got a really great fortune in my cookie lol ;) it was a nice ending to a good time out.
