Nice shop. One of the owners\/employees,\n(Older guy) was smoking a cigarette that smelled up the entire shop. Who wants to walk into a flower shop and it smells like cigarette smoke. Takes away from the wonderful smell of the flowers they are selling. He even spoke to a customer while still smoking. Not a good look while you are running a business. Especially when customers are present. The smell hits you as soon as you walk in. There are other flower shops that smell better than this one. I'll pass and go elsewhere next time.
