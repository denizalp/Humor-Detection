Staying here with husband and our 2 cats for our first month in Montreal. \n\nCheck in was very easy, staff were very helpful and explained all the facilities we could use.\n\nOur 1 bedroom suite is on the 13th floor with an awesome view to the south over Old Montreal. The decor is a little dated but the suite includes everything you need in an apartment. \nA full kitchen including big fridge\/freezer, dishwasher and even garbage disposal. \nThe bedroom is not huge but has a comfortable bed, blackout curtains and big flatscreen tv \nThe living room has a very comfortable sofa(bed) to laze about and watch the big flatscreen tv or work at the desk.\n\nIt also has good wifi, once a week cleaning, free washing\/drying if you provide your own detergent (otherwise $2), a meeting\/conference room and a gym.\n\nStaff are more than happy to help out with directions and reccomendations.\n\nOverall I'm really happy with our stay here!
