My first review. My husband and I never review, but felt this was worth it! We visited April 20th, wonderful evening! Wanted a place close to our vacation home, that had a patio, Mexican food, and served cocktails. My husband found this place. We were leery due to prior reviews on service. We went in, asked if we could sit on the patio, received a yes. Sat on the patio and wondered if the service slow reviews were correct. Then, we were greeted by Stephanie. What a wonderful person! She was attentive, spot on, and really fun! My husband ordered the margarita, I ordered the delicias to drink. We could have stayed having cocktails on the patio all night! A few cocktails, sun setting, beautiful weather, great chips and salsa here comes....   Dinner, I had the chicken street tacos in corn soft tortillas, oh my!!!! My husband had the steak enchiladas. So delicious!!! We felt so at home there, had such wonderful service and great food that even now we are telling everyone we know in Phoenix about this wonderful gem smack in the middle of a neighborhood you would not expect it to be! Cannot wait to go back when next we are back in the Valley!
