A-MAZ-ING!!!! If you go to Vegas and don't go to Yardbird inside of the Venetian you are doing yourself a grave disservice. Incredible service and even better food. I won't recommend what to get because everything is great. The general manager and the executive chef came to our table and took great care of us since we supported their Miami location. This will bar none be the best meal and experience of your Vegas trip
