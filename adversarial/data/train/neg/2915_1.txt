I took my car in because a brake hose was leaking brake fluid. On a wheel that NTB had replaced the pads, rotors, and calipers on several months ago. I paid a boat load of money then....they charge double what a part costs at a store. (They say they need to make a little profit.). Anyhow, a quick fix but they ordered the wrong part so I had to keep my car in there longer than expected. I go to get it, they say it's all fixed. I no sooner get on the main road and my check engine light comes on. I was so angry. I drove to the AutoZone to get it read. I swear NTB does things to your car while they are fixing other things....especially when you're a woman. There's zero honesty. I sometimes wonder how they can sleep at night. So frustrating.
