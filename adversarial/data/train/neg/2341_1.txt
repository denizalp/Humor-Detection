Walked in to get a Tint for my eye brows and a eye brow wax, and because I'm a guy I was turned away. With the rude lady stating and I \"quote\" I've never had a guy do that in a snobby sexist undertone. GENTLEMAN BEWARE! If your a guy who likes to take care of your self don't come here because you will be made to feel like your different!
