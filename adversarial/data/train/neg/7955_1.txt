So finally made it to First Charlotte location. The burgers were seasoned well and the fries were also fried perfectly and crispy. They  shake shack sauce is tasty look like thousand island dressing but doesn't taste like that at all. \nI went on a Monday and lines were that bad. The cheese for the cheese fries wasn't the greatest and clumped up kind of quickly. They have different burgers and they also offer hot dogs and chicken sandwiches. \nThe restaurant is very casual and they have a patio that is dog friendly. Their milkshakes and ice cream are also very popular items.
