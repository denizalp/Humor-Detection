Everyone should visit the pinball hall of fame. Its free and the games range from 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, and 50 cents. We play some older game with a ball and two levers, you need to get the ball in the holes in numerical order. Such a simple concept so very difficult to do. I've only made it to 4, my boyfriend made it 6. He enjoys the Police Trainer, Hours and many quarters were spent on that game. They have a little of everything.
