This place is unique and there was a line when we got there only 10-15 minutes after opening.  The indoor tables were already full, but we shared a larger table by the door.  The place is small, but nicely painted--whoever designed (& painted!) did a great job!  But the menu is the masterpiece.  There is a savory and a sweet menu.  My friend ordered from the sweet side and I ordered from the savory side.  It was really hard to choose with so many creative combinations!  I chose the Grand Prix, which is a coffee crepe, large cubes of pork belly, small cubes of pork jowl, an \"egg up\" as they call it, with some maple syrup to enhance everything.  My friend got the Cherry French Toast (not the menu name-they have a much more clever name than that).  It was large enough that she shared a quarter piece of the 1\" thick toast with me.  What we both noticed pretty quickly is that this kitchen likes to offset the sweet with a good dose of salt--think of salted caramel.  I ate all of mine but my friend couldn't finish hers.   By the end the flavors were almost a bit too much.  I would give them a second (& maybe a third) try though.
