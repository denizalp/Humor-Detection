I took cake decorating classes here. It was a lot of fun! The whole staff is friendly and fun! My mom took these classes as well, many many years ago. This place is historic! I have such fond memories as a child coming here with her. All the Sesame Street characters made out of icing behind the glass, all the awesome cake pans to look through, endless supplies for any baker!  Love this place!
