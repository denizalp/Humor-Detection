My daughter and I stopped by for a mommy and me breakfast one day during our Vegas trip. It's a small and cozy restaurant, so it gets kinda full at certain times. When we stopped by the previous day most tables were full except for a couple on the very edge outside where pedestrian traffic is non stop. I didn't want to rub elbows with passerbys while we dined so we just left and chose to check it out the next day. \nI'm very glad we did because it was a fun breakfast date with my girl. The waiters are all nice and ours was prompt with drinks and food service. I think he may have been the manager or maybe owner because he was not in a uniform and he was overly dedicated and enthusiastic during our interactions. We ordered omelets and crepes, one Nutella and banana crepe and the other ham and cheese And everything was delicious. I only tried my Nutella and banana but my daughter confirmed evth was very tasty and fresh even on her side of the table lol. The portions were kinda big for the crepes but that's perfect for the people who want to share and try a gbit of evth in a place like this. We enjoyed our breakfast and the prices are very reasonable for being in the middle of the Venetian. Less than $44 for breakfast for 2( or really 3 because we ordered 3 plates to share) plus drinks it was a wonderful deal. We will need to come back for lunch or dinner for sure. Can't wait!!
