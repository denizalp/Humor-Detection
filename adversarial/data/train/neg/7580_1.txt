Stayed here for three days over a holiday weekend.\nMy travelling buddy picked the hotel and booked two rooms for us.\n\nOverall, it was a perfectly acceptable place to stay.\n\n-- Rooms were clean and spacious. Not super updated or anything, but perfectly fine. We stayed on the 5th floor in a small 'wing' that only had 4 rooms in it and there was a couch outside our rooms.\n\n--VERY close to the Metro which is great, since it is not right downtown.\n\n-- A kosher deli, and a couple bars within walking distance if you want to start or end your night close to the hotel.\n\n--Felt very safe in the neighborhood\n\nCultural note: The neighborhood seemed primarily Hasidic Jewish. I don't mention this because I personally care one way or other, but I found it rather interesting since I don't know much about that particular culture. \n\nIf you are looking for a cost-effective place and are ok with taking the Metro downtown - recommend!
