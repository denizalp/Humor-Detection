Came to Toronto to visit and after walking in the cold and snowy day with soaked feet for a couple hours this place was the perfect stop. My friend planned to take me here because of the soups, which are amazing! the soup + wrap combo is a very filling meal, in a good way. The ingredients are very fresh and light. The feel of the restaurant is lunch room-ish, but the food is made of excellent high-class feeling recipes. The kitchen is small and open on the way to the dining area, so you see everything prepared, nothing hidden. I need to come back and try another soup + combo next time I visit t-dot.
