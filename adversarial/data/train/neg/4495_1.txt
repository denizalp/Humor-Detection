Our Old Dawgzs Veterans Group has been meeting here Tuesdays for lunch @1230 hrs last week and this week, the new owners Brian & Julie make us feel very welcome. Patty & Linda were our waitresses and everything we ate on the menu was great especially the Haddock fish dinner, fried chicken dinner & open face Turkey sandwich were repeats after each week, the homemade chicken soup was great also. Desserts are homemade and to die for. We as a group are going again next Tuesday because the prices are very reasonable and the customers seem very satisfied and are regulars to.\nGerald D Paul
