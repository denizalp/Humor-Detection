The parking lot is always empty which isn't a good sign. \nBut still wanted to give it a try. \nNo hostess. Waited a few minutes before the bartender came out to seat us. \nMy menu was dirty.\nMy silverware was dirty.\nGlasses spotty. \nCome on guys. If you're slow and still can't keep things clean.....?\nFood was ok, but definately didn't live up to the prices. I am in the business and it makes me sad when a new restaurant doesn't do well. \nThese little details could easily be fixed.
