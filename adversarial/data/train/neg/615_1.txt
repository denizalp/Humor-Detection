For the past few years when we find ourselves in need of special medications for our cats, Roadrunner Pharmacy has been our immediate go-to.  Living in Maryland, we were not familiar with them until they were suggested by our veterinarian staff, and I'm so glad they did!  \n\nThe staff at Roadrunner are always professional and personal.  That we actually receive phone calls to chat about any new Rx that is faxed in from our vet is amazing and very much appreciated.  We've never had any issues with products or delivery, and our invoices are marked \"paid\" (the only critique is the invoice doesn't reflect the charge...which I look up via our credit card and compare to what was quoted to me at the time of the phone call).\n\nSo, Roadrunner, as long as you maintain the status quo, I'll remain a happy, loyal customer.  If you want me to do dances, please have your invoice reflect the charge AND use email to send follow-up correspondence summarizing discussions and most importantly, what the charge will be.
