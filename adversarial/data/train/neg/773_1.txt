My husband and I lived here from 2009-2010 so this may be a little dated. However, I can say with confidence that during this time period,  this was a very nice apartment complex and we enjoyed living here.\n\nRent was very reasonable for such a nice area (hop, skip and a jump from Ocotillo.) Our apartment itself was lovely with upgraded appliances and a great kitchen. The two bedroom we were in was spacious, had great natural lighting and was overall very nice. I wasn't a huge fan of their parking policy. We had one covered space and the other was a first come first serve. We didn't take advantage of the amenities as often as we should have but when we did they were a reminder of the spoils of apartment living. San Palacio has a great pool with cabanas and tons of space in the immediate area. I enjoyed our time at this apartment complex and would recommend it to anyone looking for an apartment in Chandler.
