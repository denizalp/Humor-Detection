Ayeeeee us AmeriCANS are visiting from the forever lovely country of AMERICA. We were looking for a casual place to stop and get a drink when LOCAL on 8th Ave caught our eye. \"HAPPY HOUR\" and we were in. \n\nGot inside, sat down, super chill, good tunes, and overall great atmosphere. \n\nHere we is.... The cocktails are FANfuckingTASTIC- expensive, but worth it. The food? The food is pure DANK. Service? What service? Anyways if you can compromise your service for some dank drinks and food, well worth it!
