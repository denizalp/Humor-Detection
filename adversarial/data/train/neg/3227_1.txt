Super cozy wonderful neighborhood gem. Stopped in tonight to check it out. The bartender, Jennifer I think, couldn't have made you feel more welcome. Tried the happy hour chianti ($5) which was good but for $3 more the Pinot Noir was outstanding. She recommended the eggplant torte ($5 on happy hour) and the portion was generous and delicious. Definitely plan to be back!
