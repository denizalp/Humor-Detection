Glad to see this mall taking steps to update their look! Jcp has been here for years well beyond my age and still manages to keep a market for us 20 somethings! They send awesome mailers that give great discounts even on clearance items and always have good deals in general! \n\nAlso they have a new addition to the store, appliances, bedding, and bath that I would say is worth checking out!
