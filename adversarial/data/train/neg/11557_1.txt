Delicious!  Fast, inexpensive and just fantastic.  I got the soup and wrap combo:  Porcini Mushroom wild rice bisque and the roasted chicken wrap.  I had to be back at work and only had 30 minutes and didn't know what this place was like but they were literally 5 minutes to have my order ready and everything was perfect.  Had a nice sit in the back patio, enjoyed my meal and still made it to work on time.  I didn't realize how amazing this place was to Yelpers prior to coming.  I was originally looking for a pita and on the way to the Pita Pit, I saw this place.\nThe wrap was just fantastic!  The chutney inside was amazing and there was something in the mayo that was also delicious.  I feel like they could have added a bit of spice to it (the chutney was a super mild) but size was good and overall I was happy.  The soup was a tad saltier than I would have liked and just on top of the soup I could see a little bit of grease bubbles.  BUT, it was yummy none the less.  Main reason I only gave a 4\/5 was because I was hoping that with the word Soup in the places name, I expected this to be the all star of the food I bought.  The salty part of the soup for me wasn't even that big of an issue but the grease in the soup..... After I ate the soup I could rub my lips together and they would slide.  Yes, it was that greasy.  Great taste but in my opinion, they need to back off the oil a bit.\nI will still be back here but next time I want to try the Ravistew.
