Absolutely amazing service! I just moved to the Chandler area and in need of a new dentist, I'd seen the great reviews and am so happy I gave them a try! I'd hated my old dentist, and especially already being self conscious about my teeth, didn't feel like the dentist gave me the time of day. Going to Brennan Dental, absolutely everyone showed they cared and gave me all options, I will definitely go back and recommend them!
