**3.5 stars-This review is based solely on my one Summerlicious '12 visit for lunch.\n\nI decided this past summer that I would make an effort to check out some places for Summerlicious that I wouldn't normally check out or care for.  I was looking through the lunch options offered at $15 and came across Kirei.  Everyone loves sushi! I figured normally a bento box would come up to be about $10-$15 anyway, and this prix-fixe menu consisted of an app, main, and dessert!  Whatever, it gave me a chance to check out another sushi place in the downtown core.\n\nNewly opened just a few months before, I past by this resaurant many times over the Spring and Summer.  It has a very spacious bar by the front and many booth seatings, all newly renovated.  Also, there is a big patio in the front, although there aren't too many tables.  The two of us walked in and was greeted, sat, and offered the Summerlicious menu as well as the regular menu,\n\n~APPS~\n\nEbi Shiumai: (3\/5 stars)\nSix mini open-top shrimp dumplings with dipping sauce.  It was good, but nothing spectacular, but I LOVE dumplings!\n\nPork Belly: (3.5\/5 stars)\nChunks of braised pork belly sliced, served in sauce. Reminded of mom's cooking for a little while, but mama does it waaayyy better!! This was tasty nonetheless.\n\n~MAINS~\n\nBeef Terriyaki: (4\/5 stars)\ni don't usually like terriyaki dishes because i find the meat rarely cooked right, and it's just terriyaki sauce (which I'm not a crazy fan of) poured over it.  But, this was 2 thin steaks over rice.  Beautifully presented, well cooked, and quite delicious!\n\nSashimi+Sushi+maki: (4\/5 stars)\n5 pieces of assorted sashimi, 4 pieces of sushi, and 6 pieces of spicy roll. What a deal!!  I am such a sucker for beautifully plated foods because I believe we eat with all our senses.  It's also nice to know that the chefs took the extra 30 seconds to care for the aesthetics of my food.  Everything was quite standard to taste, but I only wished that the sashimi came in thicker slices.\n\n~DESSERTS~\n\nIce cream: (4\/5 stars)\nSucks they only offered ice cream.  It would've been nice if they had other things.  Oh well, great variety though.\n\nAside from out 3-course meal, we also decided to be pigs (as usual) and got 2 more apps to begin with...\n\nOyster Shot: $6.95 (3.5\/5 stars)\nI love oysters and I love shots! This is a match made in heaven!!! I know a couple other places around town serves this too, but I really wanted to have it that day.  It came in a tiniest, cutest martini glass with a tiny oyster, salmon roe, green onions, quail egg, and seasoned well.  I gulped it down like a champ and sighed a satisfying \"aahhh\"!!!  A tad pricey for what it was and portion though.\n\nShrimp and Crabmeat Stuffed Avacado: $8.95 (2.5\/5 stars)\nChopped shrimp and faux crab mixed w a salad dressing, served in a avacad half.  It was okay.  I can definitely make better, and not worth the price.\n\nService: 2.5\/5 stars\nMeh.  Friendly, but the server didn't seem too knowledgeable.  The manager\/owner came by to take our orders because our server was nowhere to be found... she seemed quite green.\n\nOverall, quite a nice place.  Sushi quality was quite decent and again, I LOVED the simple elegant plating.  Summerlicious was a great deal for quality and portion, but the regular menu seemed to be just OKAYY.
