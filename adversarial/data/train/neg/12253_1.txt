We took a trip to downtown Vegas to explore and had dinner at Grotto's.  We ordered the Bruschetta (7.99) which was grilled Tuscan bread served with marinated Roma tomatoes and the Peperoni pizza (12.99) which is imported peperoni, tomatoes and homemade mozzarella.  Both were very flavorful and yummy.  And cheap to boot considering the pricey food we'd been eating all week.
