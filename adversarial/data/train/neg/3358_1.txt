We went here today for a quick lunch before some errands. It was super busy inside, but we got our order taken pretty quickly and our food came out not too long after we ordered. Everything was delicious! We had never been here before, but I'll definitely go back. I got the grilled cheese and eggplant soup. The soup was amazing! The place is decorated so cute as well. I give 4 stars because as nice as the staff was, they only checked on us like 1 time after we got our food.
