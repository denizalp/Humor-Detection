I would never return to this restaurant after the horrible experience last night. Dined here with a group of 10. The service we experienced was absolutely appalling - our waiter was rude and made us all feel unwelcome in the restaurant, not to mention the fact that he was awful as a server (packed up our leftovers after putting dirty cutlery on top of them). I spoke to the manager after the meal to let him know about the service we had experienced and he was extremely rude and condescending and made no effort to apologize or rectify the situation. \n\nOn top of this, our food was mediocre AT BEST. We tried several of the dishes because of the large size of the party and were unimpressed by all of them. Would not recommend this place to anyone.\n\nGo to rasa down the street instead and ask for Laura - both the food and drinks are 100x better!!
