One star is actually to many. This store has decent sales however,  it's NEVER open! There are only two employees at this facility so if one of them gets sick they just throw a sign on the door saying they are closing early or going to be closed for X amount of days. I know I'm not the only one who thinks this is very unprofessional as I've talked with other people who have been waiting at the doors 20 minutes after it's supposed to be open wondering if they are going to open at all that day. If you are planning on shopping here make sure you call ahead of time to make sure you're not just going to waste your time and gas.
