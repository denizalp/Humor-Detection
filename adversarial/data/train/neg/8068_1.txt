Favorite Mexican restaurant, by far. We moved from the bay area a few years ago, and struggled to find good Mexican. We wanted a sit down restaurant, not a burrito joint. Found F&F's on Yelp, tried it, and fell absolutely in love the first time. We eat here at least twice a month, sometimes more often. We've tried many different options, but consistently go back to the chicken enchiladas and tacos. Carnitas are tender and ultra flavorful. Chips are always fresh and warm, salsa is always amazing. They have a nice selection of wines and liquors, and while they don't have any kind of specialty bartender, the drinks are always great. Nothing fancy, just reliable. We take all of our out of town guests here, and they all rave about it. They have a few delicious vegetarian options, and their breakfast is great. We even had our rehearsal dinner here before our wedding.
