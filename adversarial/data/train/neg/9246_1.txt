Small parking lot and difficult to find from the road but I really enjoyed my experience here.  If you sign up for their new rewards program, every time you visit a chilis you can have a free chips and salsa or a non alcoholic beverage. I think that's a great deal.  Of course we had the bottomless chips and salsa.  Their chips are always super salty but the salsa is delicious. Sometimes I just want to come for the chips and salsa and the chicken enchilada soup.  They have a $10 special going on right now that I also took advantage of.  It includes a choice of a non alcoholic beverage, soup or salad, and a choice of entree. (From a list of 6). I had the honey chipotle chicken crispers and it came with fries and corn on the cob. All this for $10 is a great deal. It was plenty of food and I had left overs for lunch the next day. I really like their chicken enchilada soup. I wish I could make it at home.   Customer service was great as well.  Chili's is one of my preferred chain restaurants and I will be returning to this one as long as the service stays this stellar! In case you can't see it from Tyvola Road, it's right behind the exotic car dealership and next to Costco. Happy dining!
