Just started toddler gymnastics with Chelsea. My son LOVES this class. It is so much fun for both of us. I really enjoy taking him to the tot lot prior to his class. And we live the park next door for after class. Parking is easy. The front desk staff if friendly and helpful. I look forward to taking my son here for other classes as he grows.
