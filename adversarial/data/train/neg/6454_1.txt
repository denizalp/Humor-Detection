I live pretty close to this place and have been here with my girlfriend a few times - the prices aren't bad (for lunch) but the service is ABYSMAL. Every server I have ever had here has been rude, cold, and stuck up. They often forget things you've ordered (even though its an electronic ordering system with a tracker, so you know what you have yet to receive) and if you say anything they tell you \"you got that already\". In any case, its AYCE, so maybe bring me another one? I don't like being lied to right to my face, but the food isn't terrible for the cheap lunch price, so if you just want to get full, hit it up. Otherwise, if you're looking for quality sushi with good service? Find somewhere else to go!
