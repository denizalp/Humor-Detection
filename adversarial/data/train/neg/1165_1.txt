The car we rented had a \"maintenance requred\" notice (we were picked up in this car from Enterprise so the notice must have been on at the time) which I noticed when we had driven 100 ft. Turned around, told Alex who said he checked the records, the maintenance work had been done and someone forgot to reset it when maintenance was completed. We were driving to Utah from Cave Creek so we were still nervous the whole time coming and going. On the way back, outside of Las Vegas, the tire light came on. We stopped and added air, the light came on again before reaching our hotel. We valeted the car and called Enterprise. We wanted someone to bring us a new car as it was unsafe to drive the one we had. After OVER an hour on the phone, (talking to national Enterprise only\/Roadside assistance, and unable to talk to a local person even though we had a local numbers which went only to a national line) we were told \"Las Vegas was too busy\" and we had to get to the airport ourselves to get a car (no cars available at closer locations we were told)...but we couldn't talk to the airport to see if they had a car (the size we currently had) available as we were told the \"airport staff were too busy and didn't have time to answer their phones.\" When leaving the hotel for the airport we saw the tire was almost flat. We couldn't make it to the airport...had the tire patched (which was easier than dealing with Enterprise locally or nationally), drove back to Cave Creek, AZ. To be fair, Alex (in Cave Creek) was extremely accommodating, appropriately appalled and discounted the car. However, Enterprise's response in Las Vegas was appalling. We have used Enterprise many times and were extremely disappointed in the response to an unsafe vehicle situation.
