We went here for dinner on a Monday night but early as we have kids. I was actually very surprised at how busy it was hoping this was a good sign (IT WASN'T)\nWe ordered a 2 person fajita the chicken\/steak combo. the steak was spicy as was the rice that comes with it. now I don't mind spicy but mention it somewhere on the menu or at least when we are ordering. \nOur kids had the burger from the kids menu which they had a hard time eating as it was also spicy !! from the kids menu ! go figure. \nOverall service was good and the place had a great atmosphere but the quality of the food was only so so.
