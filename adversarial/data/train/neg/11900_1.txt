We found this place on Yelp and give it a 4 1\/2. The service is wonderful, our server Omar was great. Great Marggies and on happy hour until 7pm. Roxanne had her carnitas and I had steak tapaquiena which was excellent. Homemade tortillas, 3 different salsas and a jalape√±o plate. I highly recommend this restaurant
