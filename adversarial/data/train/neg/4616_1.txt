looove it here!!!  I was truley excited to find this little gem of a dog park.  \n\nIts wonderful for dogs and humans alike.  Little benches tucked under the canopy of the forest provide a sanctuary to the heat of North Carolina as your pups run around like crazy and meet with their buddies.\n\nSwimming pools are always a source of fun as the pups splash around and have a pool party.   The other great thing about this place that I love is that you get to know the dogs and owners so you gain trust.\n\nI'm so happy I came across this place.  Please visit and enjoy the beautiful Mecklenburg Doggie Park!
