WORST service, stay away. Took my vintage Patek Phillipe here in October 2016 and just picked it up 2 weeks ago. I didn't hear a word for 6 months. I kept calling and asking for updates and was told every single time, \"we'll check and call you right back\". Never once received a call back. I began calling weekly and was told, \"next week it will be ready\". For another 8 months. Completely understandable that vintage repairs take a long time, but a truthful answer should be the bare minimum.\nWas still not keeping time after 14 months there, so took it back, only to be told for another 4 months that the watchmaker was going to look at it, \"tomorrow\". Completely unprofessional and unapologetic staff. Would sooner fly to Switzerland to buy or service my Patek then trust these people ever again.
