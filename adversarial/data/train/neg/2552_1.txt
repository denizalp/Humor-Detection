The food was great. I had an issue with my server Eddy who was too busy talking with his co-workers to bring us napkins, refills on our drinks, or the margarita I ordered 20 minutes ago. When I asked to speak to a manager Diana came over, she seemed over worked, frazzled, and looked like she hated even being at work. I explained to her how bad the service was and she proceeded to give me excuse after excuse about how busy they were. There were only about 6 small groups eating. Once again the food was great but the service was less than what I expected.
