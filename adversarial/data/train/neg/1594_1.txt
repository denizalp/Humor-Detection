We used Marshall Insulation to provide insulation and seal our ductwork and we are very pleased.  Jeff the salesman was very thorough and professional.  The crew that did the work was awesome, making sure we understood exactly what was going on, providing pictures of the attic as they did their work, and were very neat.  Although we have not had a summer pass yet, our SRP bill is already lower.  We are really glad we decide to go with Marshall and highly recommend them to anyone looking for insulation and ductwork.
