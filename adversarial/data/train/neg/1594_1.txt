Our waitress, Gina, was great. She kept refilling my water which is RARE at diners. Normally your server gives you 2 refills and then they disappear. I ordered a California Benedict. The egg should've been slightly runny (it was fully cooked). The sauce was \"ok\". The pie was great and our overall experience was great. \nThanks Village Inn. :)
