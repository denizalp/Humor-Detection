Apparently, this place is as casual as it gets at the Wynn.  Saying that, I had a good experience.  My girlfriends and I came here for dinner on a Friday, and we were seated outdoors.   The ambience was very relaxing, and we got to enjoy the beautiful decor and scenery by the pool.  The food was very fresh and flavorful, and the portion was large.  I nearly died trying to finish my linguine with clams, and I'm a buffet kind of girl.   If you're eating dinner right before going out dancing, I suggest sharing with one other person.  The only downside our dinner was our waiter - he was a cheesy comedian wanna-be that dissappeared half the night.   Overall, this place had great food at great price and great ambience.  I'd totally come back.
