I stumbled upon this little gem by happenchance when visiting Montreal 2 years ago. I proceeded to spend all afternoon here and bought over a dozen dresses and jackets. I LOVE these clothes, they're cute and are cut to fit really well, and they're inexpensive. To date, they are my best outfits, the kind I wear when I go on dates or special events. I haven't found clothes like this anywhere in San Francisco, where I live, and I would gladly visit Montreal again just to get more clothes. But it seems that the shop is closed? At least the phone number listed is disconnected. If you are the owner, will you please please please reach out to me? Your clothes have made such a difference in my life and how I feel about myself. I'd love to get more. Thank you!
