Great overall and authentic east coast Italian feel. The pizza is fire cooked and is outstanding. The yooge salads are also great and reasonable. Soda machine is state of the art and staff is helpful with building your pizza. \n\nI would highly recommend this place, especially for the cost on the strip. \n\nI'd definitely be careful of a la carte add ins with pizza--can add up.  \n\nHighly recommend.
