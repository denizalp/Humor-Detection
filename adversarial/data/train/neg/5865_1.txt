This is our new favorite place! Very Reasonably priced for the quality and quantity of food... we got a 7 piece plate, 3 piece plate (I had 5 tenders), and a side of fried pickles(huge!) for 24 dollars. The plates contained two slices of bread, half a box of homemade fries, 2 choices of dipping sauce, and the chicken tenders. Because everything is made fresh to order, we were asked to pull aside to wait for our pickles to be made. As a result of the inconvenience, They also offered us a free dry desert (desert in a jar); it contained brownie, pudding, and whipped cream.
