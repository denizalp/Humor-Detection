Very impressed with this Holiday Inn.  Beautiful lobby, courteous front desk staff, good restaurant and waitstaff, nicely appointed rooms.  Has flatscreen LCD, but like most hotels....doesn't offer HD stations.  Biggest disappointment is the Internet speed... absolutely horrendous!  Only about 0.25 Mbps download and 0.10 Mbps upload.  My 4G iPhone gets over 7.0+ Mbps download!   Unfortunately, will have to try the Hilton Garden Inn down the street next time.
