I had my front sturts replaced here over a year ago and I noticed a squeaking noise coming from what I assumed was the struts. I brought it in and they fixed it up in no time and didn't charge me anything for it. As a matter of fact, they were thankful that I grought it back in... I was impressed, I would recommend this place.
