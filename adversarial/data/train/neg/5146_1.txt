Green chile apple! Everything about this pie is perfection: the mix of sweet and savory and spicy in a heavenly crust. Everything I have had so far from Mama Toledo's is lovely and so well executed, the chocolate cream, coconut cream and the key lime.   But after having the green chile apple on a whim, no other pie ever will match up. So happy they moved to the best restaurant neighborhood in Phoenix!
