One of my go-to lunch spots. This little shop is right next to a Pilates studio and Smarty Pants consignment (good for some looking around after lunch). I love their lunch combo with 1\/2 sandwich and 1\/2 salad. My favorite is the asparagus and havarti panini, it's packed full of flavor and still fairly healthy. Some of their sandwiches can get quite heavy with lots of meat and cheese, which I'm not into but to each his own. It's also quite nice that every meal comes with an amazing cookie so it's easier to resist the dessert bar.
