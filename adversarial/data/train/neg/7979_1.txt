a guy named Tony Goeke did my tattoo and it is literally the most embarrassing tattoo on my body.. oh and its right on my shoulder blade! He seemed super confident to do a cover up\/touch up on a previous tattoo and not only does my tattoo look the exact same but only 10xshittier, it looks like my 3 year old scribbled all over me. I paid him for 2 hours, when I really barely even sat for 1.5 hour... when I showed him pictures of how awful it was he blamed it on me.. because I only \"gave him two hours to work on a flat surface\"... Totally out of his element.. if you don't want a traditional tattoo DONT COME TO TONY GOEKE! I paid 300 bucks for my tattoo to look like scribbles and for him to blame it on me!....
