Came in on a Tuesday night & was busy. We ordered to go. We were told to order to go at the bar. After placing the other, sat there for 10-12 minutes n bartender was \"busy\" I was hoping to order a drink but she was done helping me and wouldn't even come\/look my way. I didn't want to get frustrated, so just left and sat in the waiting area. I seen a bag of food come out and I was waiting for someone to call my name, instead it was placed on a table n left to sit there. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I didn't think it was mines... I go up n ask how much longer & sure enough that same bag was my food.\nI was starting to get over this place, it's decor is beautiful but workers seem awful. The whole time I was waiting, not one waiter\/waitress looked happy. Everyone looked overwhelm & upset. So I was hoping the food would make up for this.. I ordered the chicken chimichanga, and it was so bland. It wasn't even crispy and big chunks of chicken, not shredded.. There were even a few beef pieces in the chimichanga. The rice and beans were also very bland. I would of rather gone to a Filberto's than this place.
