I love this place a lot. We ordered Matcha latte and a Matcha parfait. Matcha latte tasted super rich in matcha flavor, and it wasn't overly sweetened. The parfait was consisted of matcha ice cream with cornflakes, mochi balls, red beans and matcha cake pieces. It was a nice combination. Will definitely come back when I visit Las Vegas in the future!!
