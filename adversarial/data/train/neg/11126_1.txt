Green Grotto is a very comfortable and well-decorated bubble tea place, making it a perfect spot to hangout with friends.  The drinks in my opinion are just average compared to other places, but they do have many options.  It is more on the pricier end, but I guess it makes up for the free popcorn.  Nonetheless, it is the comfortable atmosphere that keeps me coming.
