Was in a mood for cupcakes and through Yelp I received a free one with a purchase so I got a brownie and milk I ate the brownie right away very good and rich loves the chocolate on top. Than when I got home I had the cupcake it was nice and soft and good. I do wish they had more selection of cupcakes but I do love that they have all kinds of bakery goods.
