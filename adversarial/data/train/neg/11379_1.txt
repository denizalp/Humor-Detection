I bought a BMW 745Li on February 12th 2016. It is now June 16th 2016, between the time of the transaction and now in the present day my car still haven't passed smog. They had worked on his car several times. They will not help me or I think that they don't even care. I think this is the worst car dealership in Las Vegas, I would never buy another car from them again. They have no concern no compassion for their customers. All about the money!
