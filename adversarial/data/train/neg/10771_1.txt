I usually don't right reviews, in fact i don't think i ever have, however i feel i must do the public a service by reviewing this place. Me and a buddy walked in (only two people in this place) so i was excited to try it out with him. However, it took this place 35 minutes to bring us out a simple breakfast burrito. Not only this, but an employee was casually talking about not being able to pass a drug test right in front of us. I hate to be the guy to write badly about a small business, however this was absolutely a sub par dining experience.
