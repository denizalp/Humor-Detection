This is the prettiest Mexican restaurant I've seen outside of Las Vegas. So nice inside!! Huge patios and bar. Good food, ask for the roasted tomatillo salsa, they don't give it to everyone but they will send it out if you request it. My server was Mark and he was so eager to blow us away with great service, that manager seemed very busy in the restaurant but still stopped by to check on us. We came in for a late dinner but will be back for what looks like a great happy hour.
