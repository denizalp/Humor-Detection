This time around I definitely noted the variety of Hawaiian fusion foods! \n\nWe got the spicy tuna crackers for appetizer-- so good. If you've ever had those asian light airy crackers, just imagine some tuna mixed with spicy mayo on top!! Prob one of my favorites here :) \n\n808 tapas sliders- wagyu beef, shitake mushrooms, ginger wasabi mayo-- this was like your everyday sliders, nothing too crazy. We didn't get the mushrooms on them cause the bf isn't a fan. I didn't really get a strong taste of the wasabi, they were still good sliders- nonetheless. \n\nWe also tried the Kahuku shrimp: shrimp with shell on cooked and sauteed with garlic, spice, and jalapeno, this really felt like a home cooked entree. We got 3 jumbo shrimps and it was really crispy, you could eat the shell! \n\nWe also got the Kalbi ribs! These were amazing. They weren't too sweet and they brought them out piping hot. We didn't order a side of rice, but it woulda been really good if we did!\n\nReally good food, I really felt like I was getting a home cooked hearty meal!
