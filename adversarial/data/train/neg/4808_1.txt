Definitely a place for children. I went as a single adult to kill time and there really wasn't too much for me, but it's also not meant for me. There were so many interactive exhibitions, cool things for kids to do, and interesting shows. I highly recommend it. While I may not have participated in all of them, the kids seemed to have an absolute blast. There's also the option of going and seeing a 3D movie or going to the planetarium shows. I didn't have time for the planetarium, but the 3D movie on the Pacific was wonderful. Colorful, beautiful, and overall just very well done. Be sure to check movie and planetarium times before you go!
