Meh- my reaction to eating at Diego pops last night. The tacos were mediocre at best and quite frankly for the whole \"trendy street taco craze\" there are so many better places. The actual servers were very on top it, polite and speedy. The food was kind of cold and way over priced. The margarita was strong, but not worth 10$. I probably wouldn't recommend this place...
