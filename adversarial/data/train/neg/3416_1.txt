I am going to try and locate the manager and let him know that his front host\/hostess staff is horrible.  I came in and waited while 2 people stood at the cash register and neither one of them ackowledged my presence.  Then they switched places and still .....nothing....  How rude can you be?\n\nIf it wasn't for the great waitress and the food was good, I would give this location 1 star.  I go to most Dennys around the valley after hiking and they are always pleasant and friendly.
