My family and I were there for a family ceremony, spending just a few days at The Venetian, but we ate and drank so many wonderful things there we kept going back!  We had a little something of everything (breakfast, apps, dinner, dessert, and plenty of drinks) and we loved everything we had.  On top of that, the service was so incredible, especially the bartenders who were so nice when we were a little stressed about some things, and so entertaining the rest of the time.  I would recommend this place to anyone who goes there and I'm looking forward to going back again soon.  Thank you to everyone who helped us there - it was such a fantastic experience on so many levels.
