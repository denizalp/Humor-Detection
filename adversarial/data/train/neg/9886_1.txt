First visit to Lulu's 13 Pub was a good one, $5 - 22oz Margaritas and Fried Pickles were a great start.  She tried the Rachel which was over stacked with delicately smoked turkey and delicious.  I tried the Wings Special with two different sauces - both were excellent.  For desert we tried the Fried Ice Cream - yum, warm cinnamon and crusty fried shell - delicious.  Lulu's 13 is new to Madison and should be a welcome addition to the East side of town.  Stop by and enjoy, we did.
