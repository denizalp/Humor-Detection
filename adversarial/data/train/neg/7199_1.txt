I ask my husband for one of these for my birthday every year.  The cake part comes in like 8 different flavors, but good old chocolate is my favorite.  The cake is moist and flavorful and dense, but somehow doesn't seem heavy or processed.  And it's not too sweet.  How do they manage that?\n\nBut the real kicker is the cream cheese frosting.  yes, my friends, this is what it's all about.  That thick, tangy, sweet, frosting all over that yummy, moist cake.  I think I may have to pick one up on the way home.
