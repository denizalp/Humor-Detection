Oh so good! This place is just the perfect the breakfast place. Really light and tasty sandwiches, sweet drinks, and they serve a meaaaaan roti canai! I really need to come back and try their laksa because it looked super good. \n\nOn top of everything, the wait staff was just super friendly and pleasant. They constantly had a warm smile on their faces and they were eager to help. It really contributed to the happy atmosphere that just envelops the place, and I totally feel like it makes the food taste that much better.\n\nJust a side note for visitors: only debit and cash are accepted! There's a nearby CIBC if that helps.\n\nRoti Canai (5\/5) - Best I've had in Sauga\nHouse Special SW (3.75\/5)\nMalay Spice SW (4\/5)\nChinese Sausage SW (3.5\/5)
