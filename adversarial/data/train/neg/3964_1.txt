Great sports bar atmosphere, with an even better menu. The best chicken bacon avocado sandwich ever is here!  The grilled chicken alone (which is an option as a healthy entree) is marinated in a pineapple concoction, and makes it flavorful and fantastic!  The bacon is thick, Applewood smoked, and the sandwich comes with a generous portion of steak-cut, seasoned fries.  They also have a nice selection of local beers on tap - always nice to see Four Peaks' HopKnot IPA on draft!
