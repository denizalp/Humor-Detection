We are thrilled we are with our new sun screens... and the entire experience. Let's be honest... how exciting are sun screens? But we LOVE them! They look even better than we expected. Our house still has the original windows from when it was built in the 80s. We had some concerns about how the screens would work when we had to put the storm windows in, and also drilling into the metal window housing. Rick assured us they could make it work... and Shelly did. She was great... knowledgeable, professional, friendly... and fun! The whole process was quick and painless. Shelly came out and measured... on a Saturday, no less. The screens were ready before they were promised. Shelly was very careful, still had them up quickly, and showed us how to remove them and what she did to accommodate our storm windows. And... we just found out a neighbor paid considerably more from a different company. Score one for us! Rick and his team also service our garage door, so I never expected any less, but it was just such a pleasure to not to have to call to find out when the installer was coming, where the sun screens where, and all that typical BS. It's such a rarity these days to have such a seamless experience. Rick and his team always treat us right!
