Yum! Boyfriend and I decided to try this place. My sister was new to town with her 3 year old autistic child and we thought a pizza night would be fun. We were right! The staff here were amazing. My god son was all over the place and pretty loud. The staff didn't mind nor did the other restaurant guests. \n\nNow for the pizza review. We ordered the Italian Stallion and the Mediterranean. Both were delicious. They use real brick ovens to cook the pizza. We also ordered the calamari for a starter. Between the 3 adults and 1 toddler we finished everything. \n\nI was seriously impressed with this small but cozy place. I do recommend anyone to try it. \nCheers!
