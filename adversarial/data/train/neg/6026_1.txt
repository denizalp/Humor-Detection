Every time you dine here it like dining at a friends house. \nAs soon as you sit down they bring Parmesan, salami, zucchini, brushetta and two baskets of fantastic bread. \nCesar salad is made to order and it has a great dressing. \nI've had the veal Parmesan, which is a giant portion of tender veal topped with marina and cheese. It was amazing.\nAlso tasted the special, which was lobster ravioli. Which was fantastic. \nGreat service. \nA little expensive, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.
