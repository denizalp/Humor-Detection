I seriously don't know about these other reviews, but this steakhouse was awful! I've had better food at Saltgrass.  I had the filet mignon and my date had the ribeye. Both of which were not worth but 10 bucks - they had no flavor and were dry even though we had it cooked medium and medium rare. I've been to classy, expensive steak restaurants and have no problems putting down $200 for a meal if it is worth it. But this was terrible - almost ruined my night. the service was exceptional but the food was revolting. Will definitely never return and it makes me to sick to my stomach that this place got $200 from me. \n\nSTAY AWAY!
