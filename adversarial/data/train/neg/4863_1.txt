We like to explore different areas when we go to Vegas and kayaking on Lake Las Vegas fit the bill completely.  You would need a car to get here if you are staying on the Strip but the drive is easy on the Intestate 215 and you get to see a different side of Vegas.  We had wanted to do SUP but when we arrived at the location, it was a little windy and choppy so we did kayaking instead.  We are used to 12 and 15 foot kayaks and the ones they rent are much shorter versions but we each took one and were able to master the smaller kayak quite easily.  Checkin was efficient and life jackets were provided.  We were given clear directions on how fa to travel on the lake to get back in time for our hour time frame.  We were also offered an additional hour for a much cheaper price.  The lake is not very wide where we stayed and we enjoyed paddling and seeing the very expensive homes along the shore.  It is nice to see some sights in Vegas that don't include neon lights!!!  We were lucky to find a Groupon which gave us an hour each of paddling for $31 which is regularly $39 so definitely check that our if you want to save a little cash.  All in all, I would highly recommend this outing for anyone that wants a little adventure beyond the casinos.
