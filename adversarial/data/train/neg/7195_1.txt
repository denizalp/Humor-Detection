Went here for Father's Day, our son took us there and was here the previous weekend and said it was good.  Not so today...service was poor..almost one hour to get our food with the waitress only coming around once to refill coffee. The eggs were over cooked, the bacon undercooked, toast cold but the one good thing on the plate were the hash browns. The place was not even full so there was no excuse.  Not sure I will ever give this place another go round!!  One star for the hash browns.
