Tuesday used to be a great deal here at John Cutters...6$ for a burger and choice of salad or fries. The burger is really good and that was half off the regular price.\nNow, they give you half off the price, but the burger is a la carte so if you want a salad that's an extra $5.50. No real bargain at all. There's lots of $12 burgers in town at places that don't treat you like you're stupid.
