A great local healthy option!  Stopped I here with a coworker and I was impressed. They have healthy soups, salads, sandwiches, and sides. Lots of vegetarian options as well as GF. Their desert selection also looked amazing and were hard to resist. It is counter service and the lettuce type salads were pre-made but looked very fresh. Their sides and soups change and they have specials. \n\nI had a small watermelon\/kale\/quinoa salad and a large corn chowder soup. The salad was light, flavorful, and refreshing. The corn chowder was just amazingly packed full of corn and other vegetables. It was hardy and delicious. I was full but couldn't stop eating it. \n\nI also got a peanut butter bacon cookie... Yes PB & bacon... omg... So much for watching calories but it was worth it. The cookie was moist and scrumptious.  I will definitely be back!
