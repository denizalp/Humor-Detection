This place is incredible. The pho is delish! All the veggies are fresh and so yummy. On top of that, the atmosphere is nice and doesn't smell like the sea. Oh, and there is a great vermicelli dish with spring rolls that tastes like heaven in a bowl. Inexpensive and fabulous is a winning combination for a cheap foodie like me. Go there!
