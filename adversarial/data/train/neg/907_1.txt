The entrance to this place is on the totally opposite side of the parking lot which is super confusing but enter and you feel like you're in a chucky cheese minus the games! But...don't let that fool, why we're all the waitresses and hostess super friendly and nice?! Awesome, you usually don't find that kind of service at a minimum wage paying type of eatery. So fresh bread is served at the table and it is easy but don't fill up. We ordered two order of the garlic knots since they are 6 per order and we had 9 people. Tasty and huge and why does this place have the best ranch I've ever tasted?!? Omg!!! We ordered the Honolulu, the Pantheon, and the Meat Lovers (large). Seriously, the crust is not thick or thin, it's just right! The flavor of the dough was amazing! I've eaten so many pizzas in my life and this is the BEST!!! I loved the Pantheon because it had a garlic cream sauce and the thick mozzarella cheese and feta and spinach with the chicken on top literally make you just want to melt into it! I sadly could only eat one piece because it is so filling but I tasted the toppings on the other pizzas and they are huge pieces of everything. The waitress told me it's because they use all real and fresh ingredients. I'm craving this pizza again!! I know pizza is so fatty but I need it again soon!!! This is my new pizza spot. Now I hope they deliver to my house because this is my UFC and Oscar night must have! Though each large pizza is about $29 each, big and filling and the taste makes it so worth it!
