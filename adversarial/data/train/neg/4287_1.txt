I dealt with Eric in the internet sales department only through text after I submitted my online application. He refused to tell me what the application came back with and said to just come in and pick out a vehicle and verify some information. When I got there Eric handed me off to Andreas. They told me they could only get me approved for a 3rd vehicle if I traded in my SUV that is almost paid off. Excuse me?  Talk about the biggest waste of my time and a ridiculous sales tactic to try to make me buy 2 cars. I walked out and told them I was going to make sure everyone knew not to come here. Do not go to this dealership. A bunch of scammers.
