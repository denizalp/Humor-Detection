Cool place. Serving authentic French breakfast. The coffee was amazing. And the croissant sandwich is the best of its kind I've had. Yum! Plus not to forget the almond croissant that puts your brain to indulge in the subtleties of the taste. \nThe decor brought memories from Europe and the people in it are the most helpful as ever. \nDefinitely up for a treat in downtown Montreal.
