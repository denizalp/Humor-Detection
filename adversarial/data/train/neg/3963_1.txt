Bought tickets on Groupon for $22 per person that includes a free drink at the stripper bar next to the V theater. \n\nClass was about an hour long, each class has a maximum of 28 girls, and 1 instructor. Props include your own body, leopard chair, and a stripper pole. Due to the limited amounts of stripper pole, it is most likely that you'd have to share your pole (lol) with a friend. At the end of the class, you get a card where you may choose your own stripper name. Oh, don't forget to tip the instructor.\n\n*Remember this is stripper 101 and I want to emphasize 101. Don't expect to learn some crazy techniques.\n\nOverall, go in with an open mind, have some drinks and have fun with your friends! \n\nBtw, this place is in the V theater in the middle of the Miracle Mile shopping center next to\/in Planet Hollywood. Just go look at the directory in Miracle Mile.
