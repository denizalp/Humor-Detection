Decided to give 29th Street Auto a shot when I saw all the wonderful reviews. Bonus for being close to home! Andy was accommodating and was able to get me an appointment for an oil change the very same morning. I've worked with many kind, competent mechanics over the years and Andy is no exception. He clearly takes pride in his work. The oil change + tire rotation were painless and priced fairly. Andy even took the time to inspect my brakes, filters, and top off all fluids. I was so pleased with the service and overall experience that I decided to log onto Yelp to ensure that this business continues to attract well-deserved customers.
