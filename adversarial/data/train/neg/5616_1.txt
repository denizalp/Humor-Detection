I ordered 11 tacos, they only gave us 10. So they either can't count or just genuinely don't care how many tacos you get in an order. They didn't even take the time to put the lime wedge in with the tacos. The whole experience just seemed like a lack of effort to satisfy a hungry dude who just wants 11 fish tacos...
