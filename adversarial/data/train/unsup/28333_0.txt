We were looking for nice movie theater and ended up choosing this one based on 1) comfortable recliner seating and 2) free parking.  The lot behind the AMC validates for 4 free hours.  Other movie theaters were charging $9+ for parking.  The unexpected surprise was how cheap my movie ticket was , only 6.99 for an evening movie.  I was expecting at least double of that.  The seats were so comfortable, I can't imagine going to any other movie theater over this one.  \n\nThe only time I would not go here is if the movie is crowded and you are watching it alone. The seating is arranged in twos and I think it would be really awkward to be sitting that close to a stranger.  \n\nOverall highly recommend!
