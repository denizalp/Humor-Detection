Before I even start this review, I'm just gonna say I'm biased towards Stratosphere. A good biased might I add..\n\nThis has been our go-to hotel\/resort for my family and I ever since I was like....in elementary school.\n\nFrom years ago until the present time, all our stays here have been nothing but pleasant. From the parking garage to our rooms....everything was quick, easy and hassle free. \n\nGreat rates can always be found here. I mean, what more do you really need in a hotel room? You're in Vegas. I'm sure most of you are out of your rooms during the day (and even night.) As long as the room you're staying in is fully functional and clean...that should be enough. If you're a tourist that's looking for \"oh mai gawd, I want to live the luxurious lifestyle with a fancy check in area\" and blah blah blah...take your ass to the Venetian, Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, or Wynn. \n\nBut seriously...the Strat has everything you can possible need while on a Vegas vaca. You got your casino floor with endless amounts of slot machines and table games. You got your restaurants (affordable ones AND your $$$$$ ones). You got 2+ bars. A small souvneir shopping area. Sportsbook. A pretty decent pool. What more do you really need!?!
