Hakkasan - you can try to be the top dog of vegas clubs all you want but you've been slacking. \n\nThe set up just BLOWS. One main stage with everything surrounding it. unless you have the luxury of a table \/ bottle service, good luck finding a place to sit ladies! \n\nThe \"dance floor\" always gets crowded - oh and the ladies here have not been poppin either. \n\nI say stick with XS and surrender if you wanna have a great time.
