Howzit Boo? That's how i said hello to them, but they thought i was crazy. I guess they don't know their pidgeon skills. I would think working at this place they would know how to speak a bit of pidgeon. The food definitely broke da maut, but maybe because i was drunk at 4 in the morning. \n\nOrdered the Portuguese Sausage with egg over rice. Added tons of ketchup on there and had a great drunken meal! Got my Hawaiian Sun Lilikoi drink.. felt like i was at rainbow drive in all over again... NOT! hhaha far from it, but it's close enough since were about 2000 miles away! \n\nMahalo Brah! Aloha
