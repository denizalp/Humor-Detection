After riding across the Mojave desert from Porterville, CA. to Southpoint Casino, you would think the Bellman would be accomadating to Motorcycle riders. We unloaded our luggage at the parking garage in the cool shade. I asked the bellman if he could come to the parking garage, He said, No, you have to ride to the valet, to unload.  From my understanding Valet parks cars not motorcycles! I have been a Southpoint guest for many years, but after this, now I understand you get what u pay for.
