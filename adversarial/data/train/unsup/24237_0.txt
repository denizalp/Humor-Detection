Feels like a piece of Japan tucked in a discrete building off rue Rachel. The service is quick and friendly, and menu is simple: a short list of appetizers, ramen bowls (spicy or not, vege\/pork\/beef) and a list of extras you can add (seaweed, green onions, egg). Ice cream for dessert.\nThe broth was rich and flavourful, and the meat was fresh. The ramen bowl is filling and very comforting on a cold day.\nAbsolutely without reproach!
