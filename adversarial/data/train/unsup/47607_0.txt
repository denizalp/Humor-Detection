I really can't complain. We stopped in here after seeing Ka Cirque (they are right next to each other), and this was the perfect ending to our last night in Vegas. I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE. \n\nFirst of all, they are open until 6am, which was great because most of the \"classier\" places in Vegas close at 11pm. Which, really, in Las Vegas? So we were very pleased to have good food after midnight.\n\nIt's a fine dining experience with a casual spin. I saw people in jeans with their beers from outside bars, as well as suits and ties. The hostess pulled my chair out for me, and the server was spot on with timing. \n\nWe got the soup of the day \"Split Pea,\" it was yum. Also the mushroom pizza. Holy S. To die for. It had leeks, brocollini, fresh thyme and loads of salty tallegio. I tasted a hint of sweet over all the savory goodness and the server said they use a bit of honey in their dough - yep, that's it. SO GOOD. \n\nI love love love this place. And honestly, it was one of the smaller dining bills we had in Vegas and probably the best food. GO HERE.
