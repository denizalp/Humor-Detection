Based on the wings I will give it 4 stars. \nIt's always packed on Half price wing nights;Tuesdays and Thursdays.\nIt's a minimum 10 wings at 55 cents piece now (used to be 50). You can order more than 10 wings--trust me you won't need any more, the wings are big. The service is efficient and the wings are always bang on. If you like hot wings go for the Suicide.\n\nThey also have half price baby back ribs on Monday and Wednesday, I haven't had this special in a long time so I can't remember the price; the ribs are mediocre.\n\nThis is currently my favorite wing place.
