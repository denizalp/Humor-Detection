I've been referring them for years as a Real Estate agent. I've seen the service spiral downward and downward over the last 2 years to the point where I can no longer even put them on a sheet to hand out to my clients.\n\nIt is IMPOSSIBLE to reach them by phone. They also denied a claim on a home that recently closed citing...they hadn't received the check from the Title company yet. \n\nAlthough the sales rep is nice and will set up service if I contact her, I cannot as an agent intercede every time my clients cannot get through
