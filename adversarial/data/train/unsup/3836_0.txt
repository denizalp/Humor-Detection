Alright here is the skinny on this Lowes, go check out the discontinued washers, dryers, microwaves, ovens, and fridges in the back of the store. DEALS! I bought a clothes washer there for $500 smackers (reg=$1100) ok so it had a big ol' dent in it.. Who cares, it washes clothes like a champ!\nThe staff is helpful, and they aim to please.. So get in there and get your own dented deal!
