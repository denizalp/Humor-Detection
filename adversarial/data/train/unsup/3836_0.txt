Love when places offer gluten free options and this place had a plethora!   I went for the spicy chipotle chicken pizza.  It was so delicious & loaded wt chicken and habanero peppers.  The crust was flaky and perfectly cooked.  Hands down the most delish pizza I've had... I ate the whooooolllleee thang!
