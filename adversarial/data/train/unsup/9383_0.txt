It needs to be said that North Mountain Brewing has the BEST poutine in the Valley, period! \n\nThick, delicious french fries with a healthy dousing of brown gravy. Some of the most tender short rib I've ever had. \n\nAnd let's not forget those ooey, gooey cheese curds.\n\nThankfully with all of this, it wasn't overly salty.\n\nWe dropped in here for one of Dude's Brews Cruise UYEs and the crew at North Mountain was nothing short of accommodating with our group of 15. \n\nOur server Chris was on top of making beer recommendations and getting tasters for our various beer drinkers in the group. \n\nWe were pretty sure that North Mountain wouldn't be willing to make a reservation for 18 on a Friday, but Candy the manager was a sweetheart (we got to meet her!) and made it happen, no questions asked.  \n\nI'm not the Captain of these beer-swilling events and had to drive, so sadly didn't imbibe. I did get a sip of the Barrel Aged CardinAle red which tasted like a hoppier red I could tolerate. \n\nNorth Mountain Brewing is another excellent option in our growing Phoenix brewery scene - Looking forward to coming back and trying a full flight.
