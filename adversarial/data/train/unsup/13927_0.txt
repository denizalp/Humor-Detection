Fromagination is an adorable boutique type shop that's straight out of my cheesiest dreams. The selection of cheese and cheese related items here is fantasmic. So. Much. Cheese. It doesn't just stop there though, they also have a nice selection of cured meats, cheese servingware, candies, dry snacks, jams, beer... and the list goes on. The store is tiny, but there are so many unique and cool things to oggle that you don't want to miss. \n\nThat being said, it sucks that such a great, unique store lacks so much when it comes to customer service. The workers here give off a pretentious vibe and are very curt. I had a few questions and was looking for something in particular but it was impossible to get the attention of any of the staff. I guess having your back turned to the counter and unwrapping stuff is more important that focusing on customers in the store.\n\nI did end up choosing my own cheese and buying it, but the worker who rang me up wasn't very friendly and at that point I didn't feel comfortable trying to ask about anything else. Sorry for giving you my business? You'd think that a store that is so specialized with so much to offer would be more forthcoming with trying to educate customers so that they can really enjoy their products. Guess not. \n\nGood selection, but the experience is almost equivalent to going to the grocery store deli and picking out your own cheese. The customer service just doesn't exist here. Heck, the deli guy at the grocer's would probably be more friendly and I'd bet that it's probably cheaper there too.
