WOW WOW WOW! I haven't had such delicious Italian food in so long. We ordered a bosco pizza with the added charcoal crust and gnocchi verde. The pizza was comparable to Venice! Thin crust, tasty dough, flavourful toppings, this has been the closest thing to Italy I have had in years. I used to think Eataly came close but this place is definitely going onto the top of my list. Being a picky eater, my only problem was with the outside corners of the crust. It was a bit tougher than I imagined. \n\nThe Gnocchi verde was also extremely creamy and delicious. It was well balanced with pistachio bits giving it crunch along with the creamy sauce. This is a rather heavier dish, so don't let the small size discourage you. We were hungry and sharing the two dishes was more than enough. \n\nNot only is Amalfi Coast restaurant located in a very good location for parking but also priced extremely reasonably. I had a fantastic dinner here and highly recommend this place for a nice casual date!
