I went with David and Diana S to catch Fiddler on the Roof last night. I didn't expect a lot and I really don't know anything about FotR, but I found their production to be quite good. Sure, some of the singing was a little lacking. That's being way too nitpicky, though. To me, a solid lead can really set a show apart. I'm happy to report that the guy who played Tevye was outstanding--full of charisma and stage presence.\n\nI highly recommend catching one of their shows. Any show really. Worst case, you spend $15 for a ticket and get to escape the valley heat for an evening under the stars. That's worth the price of admission alone. I went simple--cheap brie and wine. Just don't forget your bottle opener.
