If you have one doughnut place to try in Vegas, try here! Trust me. The doughnut is light, fluffy and the toppings are crazy good! They only make the doughnuts in small batches so everything is fresh! Customer service is spot on and thanks to Clarence and Dominic for treating me like a whale even though Im a guppy. Only drawback is they are so far away from home. Hawaii expansion sometime soon??
