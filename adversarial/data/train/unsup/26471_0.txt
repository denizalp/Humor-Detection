Very disappointed!!  When I first spoke with Davonna I was excited and was already planning on giving her a big tip because she seemed very professional and sweet.  Unfortunately that is where the professionalism ended.  I called to advise that I may show up a couple minutes late after a hectic day and was greeted with attitude from the get go.  I was hoping for a relaxing experience and realized maybe I would just get the hour from the time I was scheduled for but was cut short of even that.  The lecture I received on etiquette also ruined any opportunity for the relaxation that is advertised in the description.  I also was not impressed with the actual massage but that may be attributed to many factors including the stress that was added when I arrived.  If you do decide to go please make sure to show up 10 minutes early if it is your first time because it will only be on the bottom of the invite you will receive and will lead to the dissertation on your lack of professionalism as a client.  As I started with, all I can say is that I am very disappointed...
