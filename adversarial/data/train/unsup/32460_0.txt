Honestly, my personal experience there was about 1.5 stars at best, but the place is clean and the rooms are spacious.  They are pet friendly, and they have a nice clean little dog area (on-leash, un-fenced), with clean up bags, and the air conditioning worked. So I'll give it 3 stars because I think there are plenty of disgusting and unsafe places to stay in Vegas, and this isn't one of those.\n\nThe staff was friendly enough, but basically useless.  It is a mini conference center and they let their convention groups completely inconvenience and annoy other guests and are extremely passive about it. They might wander over and quietly close the door to a conference room to keep the noise in, but when the group opens it again, they won't tell them not to do it, and they certainly won't tell them not to take over the entire lobby to do songs and warm up activities or quit hiding the luggage carts in their rooms.  They apologize for problems and then just stand there rather than proactively trying to come up with a solution.  They excelled at blank smiles and standing still.\n\nThe wi-fi signal was weak, totally unavailable in one of our rooms, and in the room that did get a signal, the connection was unreliable and tech support was tedious. The router needed to be rebooted multiple times during our very short stay and getting tech support to reach that realization was a painful process involving long hold times.\n\nI'd rather stay there than sleep in my car, but I definitely wouldn't be back unless I had pets with me, and I'd look at other pet friendly places first.
