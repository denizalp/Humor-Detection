I have been to many Vegas buffets over the years, and I think this is my favorite! There was a lot of variety, and almost everything I tried was yummy and good quality. I was bummed to miss the bottomless champagne option, but glasses of wine were only $5-$7, which is super cheap by Vegas standards. I wasn't expecting much as the only reason we ended up here was because we were seeing Love later that night, but I was very pleasantly surprised!
