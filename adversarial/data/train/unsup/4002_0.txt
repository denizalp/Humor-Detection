Trivia night is Thursday night.  This is truly a place for people who like to play games.\n\nThis bar doubles as a game room with old-style video game machines lining the walls. If you remember Pac-Man, you can play here for free.\n\nThey also have a large selection of board games you can play.\n\nTheir beer selection is good with revolving beers on tap. They have enough bottled beers to satisfy most people's tastes. They also serve a number of creative cocktails including some cider-based ones. \n\nThe appetizers are filling and reasonably priced but not recommended as a full meal deal.\n\nIf you come for the trivia you will be competing against some hard core geeks who know something about almost everything from pop culture to classical literature and agronomy to zoology. \n\nThe trivia master of ceremonies is able to keep the game moving, and is able to grade your answer sheets and give out prizes with humor and natural enthusiasm. \n\nGo for trivia night and have a blast.
