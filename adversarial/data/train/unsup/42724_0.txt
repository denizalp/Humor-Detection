This Denny's absolutely exceeded my expectations for service & quality! We had a pretty complicated breakfast order, but our server Ozlem was on-point so everything came out perfect. After some other questionable meals in Vegas - this was a welcomed comfort. We were pretty close to stopping back in and purchasing the coffee mug they had as a souvenir.
