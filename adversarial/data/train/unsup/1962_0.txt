*Visited here at the beginning of January 2018. \n\nI'm a sucker for chicken bowls, and this place does just that with a Hawaiian flair. Menu is simple. You can choose between grilled chicken or popcorn-style fried chicken bowls with white or brown rice, and you can add a side of steamed veggies for a dollar. They also offer wings and chicken nuggets. \n\nWhat sets this place apart from other chicken bowl places is that they offer many different sauces to complement your chicken, and the owner was generous enough to give me some samples. I really liked the ginger shoyu, mango habanero, Polynesian, and their signature Asian-Q sauce. The Asian-Q sauce was bomb asf! It tasted like a hybrid of Thousand Island and sesame. I decided to try the fried chicken bowl with Asian-Q sauce and a side of steamed veggie over brown rice, and it was delicious! The fried chicken was perfectly crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, and the sauce paired very nicely with the chicken. Portions were just right as well. \n\nI will have to come back and try their chicken with other sauces!
