BEWARE.  After getting an emission test, my vehicle barely failed, meeting two of the three criteria and needed only minor adjustments.  After spending more than $800 at Virginia Auto my car failed two more trips to the emissions testing center.  In fact, scoring substantially worse than before going to Virginia Auto and failing all three criteria.  In short, my car is worse than before I took it to Virginia Auto. The emissions testing center recommended applying for a waiver, if you spend more than $425.  I applied for a waiver and was denied because of, as told to me by the technicians, the lack of a proper diagnosis and insufficient repairs provided by Virginia Auto. I lodged a complaint with the owner and requested a refund.  He laughed and said he would only communicate in writing with me.  He has never once asked about my complaint, he has never offered a resolution, he has never attempted any level of customer service. He has never even engaged me in a substantial conversation regarding this issue, even though I am a repeat customer.  He has only sent vague and threatening emails.  And on a BIZARRE and CREEPY note the owner Matt Allen told me (in writing of course) they record their conversations with customers.  BEWARE.
