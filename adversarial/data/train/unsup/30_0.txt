We stopped by here for breakfast after dropping off my vehicle for maintenance services. Service is very friendly and welcoming. The floor manager also walked around to ask if we needed anything else. \n\nI ordered a smoke sausage with eggs and pancakes. Overall, it was delicious. Unfortunately, my friend didn't care for what he had. \n\nI'll definitely come back here again for lunch.
