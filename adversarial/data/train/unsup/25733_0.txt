Very disappointed in Walgreens, after a customer for many years I'm ending my patronage of this company.  Less than desirable experience with the pharmacy here, following the advice of Walgreens, I requested 90 perceptions took to the pharmacy,  they incorrectly filled 30 days I called when I got home discovering the error, instead of correcting the mistake or just an apology for the error, I just got oh well take care of it next month...... well my dr gave me a 90 day prescriptions and doesn't want to give another,    cholesterol and blood pressure meds I'm wondering if it was an opioid if they'd have been less helpful \nNo wonder Amazon will take this over
