FINALLY! With the closing of all the Big Fat Greek restaurants and an endless number of shopping center Greek wannabees, we have found an honest to goodness, I can't wait to go back Greek (Cyprus) place on the East side of Phoenix. Our late lunch was delicious. Everything tasted just like it is supposed to. The olives salty and tart, the fresh crumbled feta covered salad with just the right amount of dressing, I had a traditional gyro sandwich with salad  and my wife had a Shaslik lamb gyro with fries. After our local Greek restaurant in Salt Lake City closed in 2004, we have been looking for a weekly Greek lunch-dinner restaurant and at last we have found it. This is the first time since we moved here in 2011 that all of our order was actually eaten. We are really looking forward to going back. Think I will ask them if they can do Halloumi Cheese Skewers with Mushrooms and Sweet Onions. Tonight I will be call my brother in Delta, UT and tell them \"WE FOUND A GREEK RESTAURANT!\". \nGlad we moved close to Queen Creek as this is right up there with our \"BEST ITALIAN\" find in Queen Creek. The owners recently returned from Cyprus and greeted us like family and when I mentioned Halloumi Cheese, she asked how come I knew about it. Thanks PBS and your recent Cheese Lovers Special.
