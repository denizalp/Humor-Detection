Bland. I was so excited there was an LGBT club right there on the strip, and I remembered having a good time at the \"old\" Krave two and a half years ago (apparently it has changed locations since then), but what a letdown. I arrived on a Friday night, about 1:00 a.m., expecting a crowd, or expecting that the people who were there would at least be on the dance floor- wrong on both counts. There were less than 30 people dancing, and a few dozen more hanging at the bar or on the couches. I stayed for less than an hour. \n\nThe DJ was decent, playing typical house stuff, but nothing spectacular. Nothing that had me rushing to the dance floor. The decor was non-existent, and parts of the club seemed to be in disrepair, or maybe still under renovation. I bought one cocktail for $13, again, typical for that type of venue, and actually cheaper than other most bars and lounges in Vegas. They didn't charge me a cover, which was great. The security team and bartenders were pretty friendly and welcoming. The staff was honestly the best part of the experience. It's a shame that the rest of the club didn't measure up. I hear good things about Share, but honestly, it's too far away, since I usually stay at New York New York, the MGM Grand, or the Excalibur. I hope Krave gets its act together soon and does something to bring the bodies in! Oh, also a lot of straight people there, or at least male\/female couples. I don't hate on them, I love our allies and all, I was just perplexed by this, lol!
