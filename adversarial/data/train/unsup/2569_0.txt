Not much more to add. This was a very memorable meal.  Will definitely return the next time in Vegas.\n\nProtip: Do not stay up later Saturday night gambling until 7am before your meal here at 10am.  It will dramatically affect your enjoyment and performance of the meal. Make sure you get a good night sleep, have a proper reservation and come hungry.
