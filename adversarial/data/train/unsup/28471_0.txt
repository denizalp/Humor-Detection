I've been to Morcilla for brunch twice in three weeks. It's that good. The first time was with friends and two infants. They weren't exactly prepared for the infants but we figured it out. Granted one carseat was on the floor and the other on the bench. But not horrible - it isn't a kid place. The service was excellent. Zack took time to explain the menu, give advice on how\/what to order based on the party, and didn't rush us through our meal. He didn't just say \"everything on the menu is good.\"  He gave recommendations about tapas after he saw what we liked as charcuterie. I had the oxtail toast the first time and the goat cheese and caramelized onion omelet the second time. Both were amazing. Dressing on the mixed greens with the omelet was fabulous. I could drink that stuff. Definitely try the chorizo with dates and bleu cheese. The flavors are amazing together. And lastly get the French press coffee. Go for the big pot because you are going to want more.
