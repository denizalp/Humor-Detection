Really cool pizza concept. I had never been to a place that could serve quality pizza in under 10 minutes because of the temperature the pizza is cooked with, so this place was a first! \n\n800 Degrees is conveniently located on the strip, within walking distance of Aria, Bellagio, and Monte Carlo. In fact, it is directly to the left of Monte Carlo. My friends  and I chose this place because of its near proximity and we were all starving. \n\nUnlike Project Pie, you can either choose a pre-made pie OR you can create your own pie and then pay for the additional toppings and what-not. The pie is New York style, so the crust will be extremely thin - be prepared for this! If you're not into thin crust... then this place may not be for you. However, the flavors are great.
