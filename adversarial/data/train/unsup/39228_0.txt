I love the layout of this place! There's so much room to hangout, lounge around or play video games and bags. They also have a ping pong table and ski ball. The night was a bit chilly but they had the fire pit going. It was great to sit by the fire and have a couple drinks. \n\nMajority of the crowd was the younger college crowd. I'd say between about 21-30's.  Not an issue at all, everyone was busy with their friends. \n\nThe only hiccup we had was our first night grabbing a drink there we had a waitress who left without telling us. We waited and waited and wondered where she was so we could order another drink. Come to find out she had gone home and didn't close us out nor did she have another waiter take care of us. \n\nThe second time in we had a wonderful waitress! \n\nI'd definitely hang out here if I lived in Scottsdale.
