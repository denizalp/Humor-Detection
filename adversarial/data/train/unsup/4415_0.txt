This location is the worse I tried to call on my way from work so that my food is ready they are ignoring the phone.  When i got there of course I'm thinking ok so they are. It taking phone orders so they must have some hot and ready pizza.  Oh heck naw i have to wait 15 mins for a cheese pizza and I told him if they would have answered the phone 20 mins ago I would have my order.  Smh!! You get what you pay for.  I will find Dominoes
