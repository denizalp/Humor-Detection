I read the reviews on yelp and it looked like a good spot to buy a cake. I asked secifically for cheesecake, they said yes $22 for 7 inch.  I bought the strawberry-mangoe cheesecake as advertised for my mom's birthday.  However, the cake I got was NOT a cheesecake.  It was strawberry mousse on top, two layers of vanilla sponge cake and a mangoe custard in between.  I am so disappointed.  I asked specifically for cheesecake not a mousse cake. That's FALSE ADVERTISING.
