Buckle up, Mezzo Bistro.  Here it comes.  \n\nI'd give you a ZERO rating, but since that isn't possible, you'll earn a completely undeserved one star.  \n\n10\/30\/2013, about 11:30 a.m.\n\nMy wife and I go in for lunch, order a Caesar salad and two entrees.  The salad comes out, and to be honest, it's pretty good.  \n\nThen, my wife finds a PUSHPIN in her salad.  Are you f**king kidding me?  A PUSHPIN?  \n\nShe spits it out (lucky - for you - that she wasn't injured), and I call the only staff member I can find over. (A blonde woman working behind the bar.)  We show this to her, and she quickly apologizes and goes back into the kitchen.  For a while.  My wife, visibly shaken, isn't really comforted by the half-hearted apology and disappearing act.  \n\nThe woman eventually came back out and went straight behind the bar, obviously having no intention of speaking to us again.  No manager or chef came out to check on us either.  So we left.  BTW:  Y'all can keep the groupon voucher we handed her at the beginning of the meal - it's a pretty safe bet we're never eating there again.\n\nI don't know how the hell you have your kitchen and prep areas set up, but how the hell do you prep food anywhere near pushpins?  You didn't see any possibility that this could eventually cause a problem?  No?  \n\nI will say that this wasn't our first time there.  In fact, it was probably our 6th or 7th time in.  And all the other times, I left happy with my meals.  But never again.  I don't care how many good meals you serve, one \"I-could-have-been-seriously-injured-by-your-carelessness and ineptitude\" is all it takes.  \n\nI realize there's probably not much you can do to satisfy a customer that was one swallow away from spending the rest of the day in the ER because of your stupidity, but here's a tip:  DON'T RUN AWAY AND HIDE FROM THEM EITHER.  \n\nWay to run a business, guys. \n\nSo go ahead and try your luck at Mezzo Bistro, people.  It is Vegas, after all, so if you feel like gambling with your life, knock yourself out.
