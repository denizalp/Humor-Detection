Today my co-workers dragged me to another place that they claimed had \"amazing food\". I would have to disagree. \n\nI ordered the backed chicken special with collards and mac & cheese.\nBacked chicken didn't seem \"baked\". It was very fatty and the skin was chewy. I actually had to pull at it like a rubber band. Collards were good 4\/5. Mac and cheese was not good. It was cold and most of the cheese that was put into it hadn't even melted yet. \n\nMy co-workers both got the hamburger steak with 2 sides each and they said it was very good. This must be a southern thing - I never saw hamburger steak on a Menu until I moved to Charlotte. Anyways, the service was pretty good as they checked in with us often and brought us 2-3 refills.\n\nPrices were very cheap - if your looking for an inexpensive \"home cooked\" type meal.\n\nPersonally, if it's left up to me, I will probably never come here again. But you never know since my coworkers love to go to places like this for a \"plate lunch\".
