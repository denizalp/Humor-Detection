great breakfast place...period. worth the wait. had the stuffed french toast, and the bob's special. french toast was crisp and cooked perfectly, although not really stuffed, just an extra slather of raspberry jam. Bob's special was very tasty, German potato pancakes were a little under cooked but great tasting.  Service was quick and brisk, waited about 25 minutes on a Sunday morning, which was not bad but it was raining this day.
