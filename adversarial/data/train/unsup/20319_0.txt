seat:  level o, section 203, row o, seat 9-10.\nticket price:  $330.  well spent.\n\ni was visually blown away by the stage, costume, music, stunts, basically my eyes were peeled wide open the whole entire show.  visually mind blowing because there is so much going on all the time and the water elements in the show gave me a constant 'O'MFG look on my face. \n\ncirque du soleil have always had obscure abstract elements that i think is interesting in inviting the audience to interpret the show and storyline themselves.  i've never really walked out of cirque shows knowing the solid storyline, but they definitely put me, alice, in wonderland.
