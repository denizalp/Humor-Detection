We eat here quite often even though we live in Tempe. The pizza is some of the best in the Phoenix area, and the service is absolutely excellent. One of the servers recognized us from a visit months before and even remembered what we had ordered back then! We highly recommend Pizza Heaven for the great food and especially the service. The only drawback is the tiny parking lot, which is a real challenge if you drive a large vehicle like I do. Otherwise, A+++.
