So I'm here for the first time and I can say this their crust is prefabricated and when you get it before any of its toppings inhabit the pie , you can see it looks like some cheap tortilla type shell for crust.  So I proceed to order because who knows it may be the Business! Well not right.  The pizza dough lacked any pizza dough quality.  The meatballs I had were mushy and salty.  Onions, bell pepper , olives all cut in an uneven manner it looks like very little care goes into that department.  The meats look pre frozen and they taste it. The dough is disappointing and it totally refutes the purpose of getting a pizza baked from the fire.  If you are from the east or a pizza fanatic that has preferences and understands that the resistance in the dough which makes it pizza and makes it memorable than steer clear from here.  I will not be coming back especially because the concept is a rip off of Chipotles. It is totally a pizza chipotle but without the quality chipotle gives you.
