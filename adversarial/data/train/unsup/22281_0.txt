There is nothing better than taking fresh baked bread home to enjoy.  Mancini's is a Pittsburgh tradition as a bread works with their bread prominent in many restaurants and outlets.  The store in the strip is fun to visit to try bread samples and choose a loaf to take home.  I enjoy many of their bread recipes, but on a recent trip discovered their low-carb bread which is both delicious and quite healthy.  It is great toasted and freezes well.  Worth a try for the carb-conscious dieters.
