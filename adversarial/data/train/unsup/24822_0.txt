Small town with several antique stores, hiking, and some good food, all a short half-hour drive from Vegas: what's not to love? \n\nPlan a whole weekend here: spend a day hiking, get your eat and drink on at Milo's, then listen to some live music and brews at Jack's Place. Stay at a local place, and wake up or the pork chili verde at Coffee Cup, browse the antique stores, grab a Dole Whip before heading to the park to see the Big Horn Sheep, and then grab a burger at Dillinger's before you head back home!\n\nLocals are friendly, stores have diverse product you won't find elsewhere, and the food is actually pretty good- small town weekend fun, family-friendly or not. Totally up to you!
