I lived and ate in Cleveland for nearly 30 years before moving out of state. Of all the food I've eaten in CLE, Melt is the one that I miss most of all. I haven't had a Melt sandwich for over two years and decided to remedy that on our most recent visit home. Oh Melt, how I have missed you!\n\nIf you have never been here, the portions are huge! Given the large portions, my fianc√©e and I decided to split a sandwich instead of each committing to our own. I am a sucker for specials, so I convinced her to join me in splitting the General Tso's Delicious Manchu Dynasty Melt. The sandwich was comprised of Crispy Fried Chicken slathered in General Tso's Sauce, Crisp Broccoli Egg Foo Young, Rangoon Style Cream Cheese, Muenster Cheese, and a Sesame Seed Garnish. I would give this sandwich 3.5 starts. Overall, it was good, but the Egg Foo Young was bland and seemed pointless. I think it would have been better without it unless they add some more flavor to the egg. Next time, I will get my old stand-by the Big Popper. Needless to say, I have no choice but to go back to truly satiate my craving.\n\nWe finished with the Fried Twinkies. I had never had a fried Twinkie before. I must admit that, while it was good, it was not the amazing dessert I was expecting. I think I will stick with the bread pudding.\n\nMelt is such a staple in the Cleveland community that you almost need to visit when in the area, but I do miss the days where Lakewood was the only location. The more locations they build, the more it looses its identity.
