I'm obviously going to be a fan since I'm obsessed with the original location. I thought parking would be a nightmare but it was actually a breeze. Someone asked me if I was local and I said yes and they let me Park for free. I love a place that appreciates the locals. \n\nOnce inside the prices seemed a little high, but I love their BBQ and I was hungry. I ordered the brisket and he informed me that locals device 20%off. It's totally my fault for ignoring the price for sides and drinks... But $5 for cole slaw is robbery! I wasn't thrilled that my soda (including a plastic souvenir cup) was $5 either. The brisket was exactly as i remember it and I really like the BBQ sauce. I like a nice mix of the original and spicy. Perfection! \n\nThe original location is actually slightly closer to my work, and the prices are a little better (even with 20% off) so I think I'll stick to that one as my main location, but this is great for anyone interested in the pawn shop show.
