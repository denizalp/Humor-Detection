I have been here now 5 of my scheduled 7 nights and I have only great things to say about this hotel. The staff here are very pleasant, accommodating and genuine. The public areas of the hotel are clean and quiet. My room is very contemporary. The living room space is perfectly furnished with a desk, a couch with a pull out bed and a lounge chair. There is a little area for the fridge with a small sink above to prepare refreshments. What I really like about the suite is the bathroom can be accessed from the moment you walk in the door, or as an en suite from the bedroom. The last thing I will mention, although there are many more, is the bed. What else does one stay at a hotel for in the first place? There is a king size bed with memory foam and all the pillows you would need to make another mattress on the floor. The closest sensation o floating on a cloud- I think so! Roman, the suite attendant has been such a gem, as well as David down in the lobby. I understand why this hotel is categorized as a 5 star. Thanks so much and I will be back if\/when I am in Calgary again.
