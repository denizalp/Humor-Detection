I feel strange about writing a review for Taco Bell, but this location is the best of the best in fast food. The customer service is always top notch. The employees are friendly and joyful every single time. I've never had a bad experience at this location. I'm also completely in awe of their multi-tasking skills because I don't think I could do as much as they do as well as they do. Did I mention that they are happy and friendly while doing it all? This is definitely my preferred location.
