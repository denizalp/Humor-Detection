This review is strictly for the pharmacy \n\nHaving been an employee for this company and traveling from pharmacy to pharmacy to help train, clean, and assist pharmacies in CVS, this location is a good one. \n\nThey get 5stars from me not only as a previous employee of the CVS company, but more so as customer... And no, I never worked at this CVS location at all. \n\n1. Drive thru - wait time, hardly any! Speedy service, quick and friendly, and easy breezy. There's hardly ever a line of cars to wait behind and even if there is a car or two, the service is quick as the drive thru should be... You just drive thru \n\n2. Customer service - I've never had an issue with any of the techs at this location as a customer. All willing to listen and help you out and pleasant. Sara the Pharmacy Manager is an awesome and speedy pharmacist. She knows what she's doing \n\n3. They call their patients when an issue or concern arises - if a medication doesn't cover by insurance or if the co-pay is sorta high, there is no hesitation to call the patient. I've gotten calls from them before about issues and we decide together the plan of action. I never feel outta the loop with what's going on with my meds and they keep me informed \n\n4. Waiting - there hardly is none because I had an issue with a different CVS and had to bring my Rx here last minute like 30mins before closing, I dropped thru drive thru and they just said for me to wait on the side and they will wave at me when ready so I don't have to come inside since I wasn't feeling well. I waited no more than 5mins. \n\n5. No mishaps or issues - other pharmacies always something, but here it's easy breezy so thank you to Sara and the staff in the pharmacy to making picking up medication an easy experience \n\nAnd a special s\/o to Dawn the tech for getting my antibiotic ready last minute and so quickly! Way to go!!!
