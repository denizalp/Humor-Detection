Ella's Banquet Hall exceeded my expectation for my father's Surprise 60th birthday! They went over and beyond what we hoped for and delivered an impeccable service that truly made my father's birthday a special and memorable one!\n \nThe management staff were all so helpful and accommodating to every request I had made. Lisa was so patient with me as I  went back and forth to make last minute changes on contract details. She was also very prompt in answering all my questions. The guests were pleasantly impressed with the food and excellent service! The head table decoration provided by Ella created a touch of elegance to our event. There was an abundance of food, and there was a good selection of options for the buffet, especially for a group of people who has a lot of dietary restrictions\/preferences! The food was delicious, the guests were particularly raving about the roast beef! \nSpecial thanks to Natasha and her team - their service was beyond perfect! Natasha was my go to woman on the day of the event. She took care of all the minute details and ensured that our event ran seamlessly.\n \nWe highly recommend Ellas banquet hall to host your next special event! They will not disappoint and will ensure that you are well-taken care off! Thank you Ellas team for your hard work!
