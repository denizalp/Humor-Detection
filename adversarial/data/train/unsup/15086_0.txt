Undoubtedly the best and my most preferred Vig location in Phoenix. Not only is it close to Luci's Market Place (another favorite place of mine) , but it's also just up the street from my mom's place.\nIt was the Vig's one year anniversary the other night, so my friends and I decided to have dinner here. The restaurant  has a minimalist , trendy and modern atmosphere. \nWe enjoyed several half off appetizers, 2 bottles of wine, Arnold Palmer ice tea and three kinds of desserts!  (See pictures) \nWe did order a lot for three people and had plenty of left overs. \nThey were half off, so how could anyone resist? \nI was also able to pick up wifi here and that automatically gets a boost in rating from me. \nI'm definitely coming back to bring my mom for brunch next time.
