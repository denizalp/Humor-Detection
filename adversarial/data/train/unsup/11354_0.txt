Well, \nWhat can you say if a casino's \"Fine Dining\", cannot deliver better food than it's buffet. Pretty sad. Best view in Vegas , no way ! That title hands down goes to the Stratosphere. Nice view of the valley, sure. \nThe sushi was poor at best. The Kobe slider tasted like a mini burger at jack in the box . I had to saw through my rack of lamb, which had no flavor and was Tough as hell. \nI have been going to the M since it opened, and wanted to give this place time to iron out the kinks, what a disappointment. \nIf I owned the M , I would find out who runs the buffet, transfer him and a few chefs upstairs , send the cook that is there now, downstairs where he can deep fry shrimp, happily ever after.
