Was expecting better after all the hype, and DDD appearance. First of all, the ordering is a little on the complex side- but the guy running the front area was extremely helpful- offering a taste of various dishes. You basically have multiple options to order Mexican and\/or Chinese cuisine. So imagine ordering a famous Chinese dish served in a quesadilla ! \n\nThe original location on 19th is basic, basic, basic restaurant. Folding chairs and tables- run down interior, but hey you come here for the food right? Make sure to check out the \"Great Wall of Chino's\" when you enter- lots of cool accolades and the infamous DDD poster signed by Guy himself. The dishes are relatively inexpensive and portions are large. I think I paid less than $10 for a hearty meal and large soda (Pepsi products).\n\nOK - the food. I ordered the jerk chicken quesadilla  (9Q) and it was YUMMY. The tortilla was fresh, slightly crisp and just enough cheese. Definitely the highlight of my plate. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from the 9Q. I also ordered the most popular dish - Jade Red Chicken, basically a spicier sweet and sour dish. The chicken was dry, and was over-fried so the taste was just not there for me. Maybe I experienced a batch that had been cooked and sitting around for a bit? I also got the refried beans (runny & bland) and chicken fried rice. The fried rice was 'meh' - little taste and not really all that friend. I should have tried the jerk chicken fried rice- that might have been better with a flavored chicken. And then- the Snickerdoodle. I read about these cookies on Yelp and the reviews were right- man those cookies are good. Wish I could have snagged a second!\n\nI would be willing to give this place one more try- give a few other dishes a shot, see what I think. You definitely don't go here for ambience- go for the cult following. There was an eclectic lunch crowd when I went!
