Have been coming to this restaurant for years. There have been numerous occasions where this restaurant was lacking but kept trying to give it a chance but as a family we have collectively decided that we will not go there again. \n\nThere was one time where the restaurant ran out of breadsticks. We had to wait while they \"borrowed\" some from another location. We've ordered Zappa Toscana and when we told the waitress that it was lacking in the items it usually has in it, she said it was \"the bottom of the pot.\" \n\nToday, we showed up and were the only ones waiting (party of 5). We were asked if we wanted a table for 4 and a chair pulled up to the side. We declined. Then another party (7) walked in after us and were seated before us. When I asked the hostess why all she could do was look flustered and stutter. We were then seated. The breadsticks were hard and browned. When we told the waitress she told us a few reasons why it was that way. 5 minutes later we got 1 basket replaced when she initially brought out 2. The waitress forgot to bring us our Alfredo sauce boat we ordered. When we added two more Alfredo boats through their automated screen, they never came. Our daughter ordered endless soup and it was not brought out until the entrees came out. The waitress said she put it in that way so she could eat with everyone else and didn't ask us if it was OK. We had to ask for drink refills and the service was lacking. \n\nWe will no longer go to this restaurant and would not recommend it to anyone. So sad and disappointed.
