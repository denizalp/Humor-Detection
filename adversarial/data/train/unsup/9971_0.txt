I went to Hwaro for the first time today. I was excited to try the place, and wanted to compare it Gen. I enjoyed the meat, especially the spicy pineapple marinated beef steak. \n\nYet, I wish I could give them no stars. The service was horrible, the waiter literally threw our meat dishes onto the table. He avoided our table like the plague, so we had to flag him down each time we wanted more meat or side dishes. In his (small) defense the place was busy and he seemed to be the only one working; but that's poor management. \n\nI would not recommend this place based on their poor sevice. Spend your hard earned dollars on a restaurant that actually wants you there.
