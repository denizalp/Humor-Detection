This used to be a regular stop for me going clear back to when it was just a regular Costco before the one at Christown opened and this became a Business Center.  After becoming a business center it got a lot less crowded because they switched out a lot of items that were consumer oriented for those that are business oriented.  You can, and some folks do, run an entire mini mart with the items in this store.  They also have food items in huge amounts for restaurants.  Talking to the folks there, a lot of this location's business is delivered with their trucks every day.\n\nToday's trip here was prompted by a Sale price of $3 off the normal price for an 8 pack of Spam.  I also was in need of some items for the shop and home.  While there I also picked up Tahini, WD-40, orange juice, Simple Green, granola bars, Blue paper towels and toilet paper (Kirkland).  Do you have any idea how long it takes one guy and the occasional visitor to use 48 rolls of toilet paper?\n\nA couple of the reasons I put up with the crowds at a different Costco most of the time:  They will no longer sell cigarettes for personal consumption here, some of the perishables are closer to their expiration date because they don't move as fast (OK for a restaurant that is going to use it in a week , but not for somebody that may take several weeks to consume it), some of the products carried are different than a regular Costco and are not my preferred choices.\n\nHowever, if you want kitchen items this place has a whole section devoted to cookware and serving items.
