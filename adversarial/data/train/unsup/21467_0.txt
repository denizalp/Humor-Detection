I have been a fan of more than one Lazy Dog location in California. We travel with our fur baby, Brownie, and it's convenient when wanting to stop and grab a bite to eat and have that restaurant feel without having to hit up a fast food drive-thru. This location in Downtown Summerlin was nothing like any of my experiences at other LD restaurants. I came in with a group of friends and inside was pretty busy at first, but really cleared out half way through our meal. Regardless of the amount of customers inside, getting our server to acknowledge us was a major chore. We only ordered some nachos and mac and cheese, so I can't figure out what the problem was and getting drink refills wasn't easy either. \n\nMac and Cheese ($6.50) - Smoked bacon, hatch chilies, five cheeses, green onion crumble make up their take on this dish. The bacon was very fatty and not good. There was so much green onion crumble on the top, which had a super funky taste to it (one person at my table described it as mold) and it didn't complement the mac and cheese at all. When we asked our server if the mac and cheese from the kids menu was anything special so we could maybe try that also and he responded that it's basically just Kraft mac and cheese. \n\nChicken Chile Verde Nachos ($10.50) - hand-cut chips, slow-cooked tomatillo chicken, black beans, jack, cheddar, guacamole, salsa, tapatio crema, pickled jalapenos andqueso blanco. The nachos came piles high. Some of the chips were burnt. The toppings tasted decent, but there just wasn't enough of it for the amount of chips. Once we got through the top layer it was all chips after that.\n\nThe one plus about this place is that the patio is dog friendly and it's got a decent amount of tables\/seating including an area with a fire pit. There's a menu for dogs and they will bring out a water bowl. I can't say I am eager to come back however I'd be open to giving this location another try down the road.
