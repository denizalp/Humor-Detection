I must say that Meme was the best ever! I got rear ended and I was supposed to come out of pocket as the quote from the insurance company was lower due to them having Audi certified techs but that did not concern me as I knew it would be done right. My father is a body man back home so know what to look for and she treated me not like a guy who was being that guy in questioning things, but instead like a person who knows what they were talking about and when she found out I was coming out of pocket and needed more covered, she called the insurance company and got the rest covered like it should and even adjusted the rate so that I did not come out of pocket ANYTHING against the first quote. The car looks brand new from the color match to the lines matching. Thank you for being true professionals at what you do and Meme for understanding a tough situation and aiding to make it easier!!
