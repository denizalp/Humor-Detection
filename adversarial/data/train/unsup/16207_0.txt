Went to Orbis the other morning looking for a great cup of coffee. I had read one review that said they would do French press... As I walked in I admired the bakery case which was full of delicious looking treats. I asked if they could do a French roast, French press  & the millennial behind the counter said they don't really like dark roast coffee's & couldn't? When I asked what the darkest roast they had... Mention they had the same crappy blend of the week that Starbucks had Sulawasi. I think her for her time and walked out very disappointed.
