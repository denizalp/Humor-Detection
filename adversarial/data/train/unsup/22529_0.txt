I'm a west end girl living on the east side, soon to once again return to my comfort zone west of Bathurst. Anyhow, I've lived 3 blocks from this place for two years and had no idea what I was missing! \n\nThis place serves up some serious breakfasts. They're cheap and diner style, but the restaurant itself is actually really clean, warm and inviting. I had the Eggs Benny and it really hit the spot. I got a side of sausages, too, because I'm no fool. \n\nPEPPER POINTS: For their decent potato things. Hard to get good ones on the side of cheap eggs... especially in the east end. \n\nPS: Westside 'til I die: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XsP0LsAU4lg\n                                \n                                          If you followed that link, you're welcome.
