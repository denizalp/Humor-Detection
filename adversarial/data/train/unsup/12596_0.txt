Hands down the best club I've been to in Vegas. \n\nGranted, we had bottle service, and a group of 23 girls (!!! not even exaggerating. Literally 23 girls) so we bypassed the line issue that most folks deal with. I've also just come to learn that you should expect to wait for everything in Vegas. This club is pretty new, and I dig the layout. There's a hip hop room downstairs, I believe two main levels (not going to lie, I was pretty drunk so I don't remember 100%), and a nice outdoor patio at the top. There's a gigantic chandelier that does all kinds of crazy shit, and service for our table was on point. \n\nBack to the hip hop room: THANK YOU, OMNIA. I'm really not a fan of EDM and most clubs have a hip hop room that's located in the really small basement and often times does not have very good air conditioning or ventilation. The hip hop room at Omnia is pretty big, played the best music, and most importantly did not become like a sauna. \n\nIn typical vegas fashion, everything is overpriced. At one point, I was so desperate for water I decided to bite the bullet and shell out $13 for a bottle. I don't remember which bar I was at, but the bartender told me water was not available because this was a club and they had some sort of vibe to keep up, and I would have to go out to the casino floor to get some. I was like 1) WE ARE IN A DESERT that's a terrible idea 2) what why. I popped by a different bar, and the bartender gladly sold me a bottle of water for $9. Not sure what happened here but meh. All in all, had the best night at Omnia. Definitely go if you're not into the EDM scene.
