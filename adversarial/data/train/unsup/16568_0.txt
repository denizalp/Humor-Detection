If you've experienced poor customer services here, don't just write a review, call Canada Post and file a complaint. It only takes a few minutes and you might actually help to achieve something. Here's CP's toll free number: 1-866-607-6301 \n\nCanada Post licenses these post office franchisees and they could give that contract to someone who wants to operate this business instead.\n\nI did all my shipping last year from the new Canada Post office at Bloor and Ossington, which is great. It's very clean in there, the staff are of normal temperament, and the wait is never long.\n\nHere's my Bloorcourt S&P Survival Guide, should you find that dreaded Bloorcourt slip at your door. I've lifted a lot from the Soup Nazi here. \n\nWith as little motion and character expression as possible, follow these rules:\n\nStep 1 - Go when the line is shorter (3 people or less) and their fuse will be longer.\n\nStep 2 - Approach counter only after last customer has stepped out of way or departed.\n\nStep 3 - State \"picking up\" and nothing else.\n\nStep 4 - Have your ID ready in advance and present it now. Have back up ID ready. While you're at it, bring your birth certificate, deed to your house, and a credit report. You never know and you certainly don't want to have to return!\n\nStep 5 - Shut up and wait while your ID is examined, package looked up, and retrieved.\n\nStep 6 - Examine the package yourself, sign (and pay if you have to) for it.\n\nStep 7 - Step to the side. Whatever you do, don't waste their time with needless formalities and pleasantries.\n\nStep 8 - Exit promptly. Don't touch anything on your way out!\n\nIf you don't think you can follow this guide, you can call Canada Post and make a case for them to re-deliver the package to your door. This worked once for me when a friend shipped a package to my place while she was living abroad, before I planned to visit her. She didn't put c\/o on the label, so it was just her name and of course BSC refused to give to me even though it was my exact address.\n\nA couple of the positive reviewers blame the customers for the treatment they receive. Interesting that they do not deny seeing the owners behave inappropriately, but excuse that behaviour because \"they had it coming.\"
