My boyfriend and I were looking for some good authentic Mexican food and ended up here ! \n\nSo happy we did! \n\nThe menu does not have a lot of options and it's a little hard to read. Our server told us they are working on getting a new one that is easier to read. I didn't mind it. \n\nI couldn't decide between two and asked the server for a recommendation. He recommended the birria. It was delicious! It tasted like my grandma made it at her house for my little cousins birthday party! So happy. It came with tortillas, cilantro onions and cabbage.\n\nMy boyfriend had the tostadas. They are a little different because they mix their meat with potatoes so naturally he was a little skeptical. He really liked them however! \n\nPricing is good for a place that has a server. Our server was friendly and he ended up talking with us for a while. We figured it was because we were the only ones left but he definitely didn't have to since they were closed already. He didn't make us feel rushed at all. \n\nGreat food and good customer service. We will definitely be back! Thanks Victor !
