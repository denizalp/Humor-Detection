Maybe the mistake was in getting a sandwich at a place called \"Soup It Up\". I've had their soup though, and it wasn't all that better...\n\nI choose places with freshly made sandwiches because I'm a little picky about what goes on them. Today my bread was sliced with a knife that already had mustard on it. Unfortunately, mustard and I are not friends. \n\nThe guy at the register offered to ring through my sandwich while I was waiting. Nice. Except, when I turned around to give some direction as to what went on my sandwich - it was already wrapped up and in the bag, with no question as to what I might have wanted on it. Fail.\n\nThey had a basket of bananas at the register. FYI - they charge $1.14 for a banana.  I can get a rip off banana at Starbucks for $1.00, thank you very much. \n\nApart from all of this, it was probably the most offensive tuna sandwich I have ever tasted (like spit it out in a napkin bad). And I heart tuna, but I did not heart that sandwich.
