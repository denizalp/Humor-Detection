November Challenge - 14\/30\n\nAfter a strange health scare in mid-October, I found myself heading to the Mythic Caf√© on the regular, since it's connected to my family doctor's office building. \n\nMythic doesn't have many vegan or dairy-free options available, but all I ever need here is a PB&J multigrain bagel and a black coffee. Mythic does a pretty decent job with both, and with friendly service that makes you feel cozy and at ease. Even, when you've just been served up some scary ass news next door. \n\nOh, and P.S., I'm super. Thanks for asking :).
