This review is for the casino only.\n\nIt was quite amazing  coming here a year after it reopened with the new name and was gussied up from the old Bill's Gambling Hall.  The gaming area is well lighted, is very clean, and the main aisle is wide enough that you can get around the tourists who stop dead in the middle of the walkway to talk or whatever they're doing.\n\nThis is not a destination place for me.  There is no longer a self park garage.  Valet only and getting across Flamingo when I was going there turns this trip into a small nightmare.  I've been there.  No need to go back.
