God help me, I really like this pizza. They don't have any of the fancy toppings I love, and they're a chain. I mean, this place is a favorite for children, children! But I cannot help myself. I love this pizza. \n\nThe wings, on the other hand, are abysmal. There is possibly nothing grosser than wings with gelatinous skin. Fry them! No person, ever, wants to eat chicken with slimy, pale chicken skin.
