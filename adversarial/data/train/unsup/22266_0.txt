Never sign a contract with these rip off artist! They put in the fine print on the back of the 6 month or 1 year contract that the monthly facial charge will then go month to month and they keep charging your card until you write or come by and sign a form to discontinue. What a load of crap. Rachel, the manager, was of no help whatsoever.
