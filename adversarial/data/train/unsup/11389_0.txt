I had a craving for some Taiwanese food and after checking yelp Yi Mei Champion Deli came up. It's a small funky restaurant with a very confusing ordering and table service system. There is a counter with a menu board but, there is a full menu with table service. After figuring it out, we ordered the beef noodle soup, fried stinky tofu, and squid pottage. \n\nThe sticky tofu was good, nice portions and came out hot tasty.\n\nThe Squid Pottage was OK, the soup was authentic tasting but the squid was kinda weird in texture.\n\nThe beef noodle soup was not very good at all. It lacked the spicy bean paste flavor and was watery salty soy sauce based. The noodles were OK. We didn't mind it being spicy but warning to people who don't like spicy food the regular beef noodle soup is very spicy.\n\nService was good. Plenty of Parking.
