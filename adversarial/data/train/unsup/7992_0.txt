Was I not a lover of chili rellenos and coconut shrimp tacos, I'd probably never have come here. After my first visit at this location, it's doubtful I'll ever return. They were out of the chili rellenos when I went around 8 pm. Not too surprising, I guess! It's a daily special. I opted for the pork quesadilla instead, which was pretty good. I hate that they have like a 3 minute goal to get each customer through the line and out the door. I do like that I screw that goal up every time, since they usually forget something! They are visibly frustrated by this too. I asked for a side of salsa, and since that was forgotten, there goes the 3 minute goal for sure! The employees I interacted with were actually quite nice and I did get a free beverage, so points for that. I was offered the drink because they were out of the rellenos.
