[Casino review only, that's as far as I got here..]\n\nWalking into any ordinary casino:\n\nTake a lap, check the tables, check the minimums, check the happiness of the dealers, see who else is winning, check the last 10 numbers that hit in roulette, pick a table, play with caution, maybe win, maybe lose.\n\nWalking into Four Queens:\n\nThis casino looks older. These games look older. The floor looks smaller. The tables look emptier. The neon looks less LED. This table looks fun. Let's play a little.\n\nDon't let the atmosphere fool you, there is a lot of luck hidden inside this place; this was my best roulette streak to date. After several days of being up and down at various casinos on the strip (i'm only talking plus or minus $100 here, not Clark Griswold style gambling) I sat down at a $10 roulette table with $50 and walked out with almost $300 about 12 minutes later. Tipped the dealer, won a little more.  Nice guy.\n\nStrategy: pick some standard numbers and hope for the best. Always keep a chip on the last number that one, and pick a money number to double and triple up on. Mine was 17, and it hit three times. \n\nYou won't casually walk by this place headed from Caesars to Aria, but you will find some extra awesome luck hidden in the historical framework and old neon that is the Four Queens.
