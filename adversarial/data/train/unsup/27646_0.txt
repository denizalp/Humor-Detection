I was totally shocked to see that this place had popped up nearly outta no where in such a random spot but I love that its there! I hate going to the Mr Hero at Southgate, so im glad there's finally one closer! \n\nThe very small and terrible parking lot was a little unnerving as to what to expect when you got inside. Very awkward to pull in and out of that lot. Really hope they develop it more. Anyway, they kind of share a space with the business next door so I was expecting a small hallway of place like many of the other Mr Hero's. But its actually quite spacious! The further I went in the more bigger it got. (insert Doctor Who joke here). Theres a very nice seating area with flat screen tv. Seating could sit around 15 people comfortably, booths, tables and chairs, and a high bar with stools. \n\nThe service is pretty friendly although a bit on the slow side. I'm guessing its because its still a new place with a new staff so they havent completely learned the menu yet. But nonetheless the food is hot, fresh, and delicious. Definitely becoming one of my \"to go\" places.
