I had a really great experience with HomeJoy.. great value for the price. I was assigned Sienna to clean my condo. Sienna is a very nice, professional, and thorough cleaner! I highly recommend her. She was punctual, She utilized her time wisely (I bought the 2.5 hour cleaning), She's extremely polite and cordial, and she did a top notch job cleaning my condo. She even folded the Tpaper and Kleenex as would a maid in a hotel room. Cute. What more could you ask for?? Be sure to tip your cleaner too!\n\nIf I had one continuous improvement suggestion it would be for the company to re evaluate their cleaning supplies (this is not Sienna's fault). The smell is pretty bad. Left my place with a very institutionalized smell to it. I will probably have Sienna use my cleaning supplies in the future. Note to HomeJoy... provide better cleaning solvents.
