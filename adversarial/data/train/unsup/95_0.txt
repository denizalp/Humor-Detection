Besides its convenient location near ASU, this place has nothing going for it. My roommates and I would constantly be told the wrong amount of rent that was due. Even though we paid on time every month, we were constantly getting charged late fees. The appliances were terrible, the disposal in the sink never worked even after the \"maintenance\" came to fix it, which in turn caused the apartment to have a stench. The air conditioner also dripped, which was a lot of fun when they couldn't fix it.\n\nAgain, their excuse for bookkeeping is terrible. While my roommates and I have been moved out for about a month now, we are just now getting charged almost $1,000 for unspecified charges, including the aforementioned \"late charges\" that we shouldn't have been charged but were because they apparently didn't pass 4th grade math. We paid them anyway because we wanted to be done with this awful place, but they are still saying we didn't pay them. Evidently they just want to drain you of every dollar that you have because they can't keep it straight. We couldn't get out of there fast enough!!\n\nDO NOT LIVE HERE. IT WILL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO UNTIL YOU DUMP YOUR ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS INTO IT. NOT WORTH IT.
