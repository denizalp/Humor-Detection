Going back to school as a kid always meant coming to Ross Park Mall to shop for clothes. I was spoiled through childhood because I have discovered as an adult that this is probably the nicest mall in Pittsburgh, debatably tied with the Galleria in Mount Lebanon.\n\nWhile the stores have become more upscale over the years, I still come back here to shop on Black Friday. This has one of the biggest J.C. Penney's in Pittsburgh and one of the cleaner ones.  I love the addition of Nordstrom for the MAC make up counter as well. We usually make a trip to Bath and Body Works, Old Navy, and New York and Company as well. So while there are plenty of upscale stores, average people can shop here too.  The only store I don't love here is the Ann Taylor because their employees have major attitude problems. Plus I can get all my Ann Taylor at Goodwill for $4-$6 anyway. Ha.\n\nThe food court was my favorite spot as a kid, and I still run through for the free samples.  I need sustained energy for shopping, or that is what I tell myself. There are also some nicer restaurants at the mall, like Cheesecake Factory.  I think I heard that there is also a California Pizza kitchen as well, but I have never been.\n\nAll in all, this is a great mall!
