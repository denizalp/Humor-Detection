I took my car in for an interior detail and they did a horrible job,my carpet and seats are stained bad and I didnt expect much from that but alot of the vinyl was dirty and you can tell there was no effort in removing the dirt from it. I will never take my cars there again which sucks but id rather drive a little further and get a better job done
