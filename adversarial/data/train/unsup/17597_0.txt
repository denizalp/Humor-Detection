I was going to eat umiya sushi one day then I saw this little gem sitting in the corner with the open sign still on. I was wondering wow it's 2 am and that place is open too! So instead of eating umiya I walked in, and the lemme tell you the interior design is what I noticed first. It looks like they put a lot of money into just making the inside look very very nice. I mean there's tables but a wall separating each for comfort and privacy. I look at the menu and there's SUCH a variety of stuff to choose from and omg I love variety. Especially when there's kinda expensive but still good quality stuff on the menu with cheap items too so you can pick whatever you're feeling for the night. The first thing I tried here was the salmon\/avocado, I thought it was a salad at first but it's literally half an avocado with a mix of avocado chunks and salmon chunks for $10. That's a ridiculous price for such a small item BUT when I tried it, it was totally worth the $10. The service was pretty good, it wasn't slow when I was there and the server was very attentive to our needs. What I'm saying here is this place is amazing, they're trying to go for quality here so I'd definitely recommend for everyone to try this out hidden little gem next time you're up late and you want some late night yummies.
