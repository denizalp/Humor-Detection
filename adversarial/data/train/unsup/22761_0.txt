I love this airport because the minute you walk out of your plane you see the slot machines. Nothing says Vegas like some gambling at the airport.\nThis airport is pretty clean and organized I just hate that you need to take an airtrain to most gates since this is a waste of time they choose have an easier access to all gates.
