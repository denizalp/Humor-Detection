I REALLY REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS SHOW!!! \n\nI'm a big Michael Jackson fan and I was so excited to come to see this show since I couldn't go see his real concert :(((((\n\nThe reason why I gave it only 2 stars cuz the show is just not well put together. \n\nPoor connection and there are too many parts of the show that just don't have the intensity. \n\nI've been to many cirque de soleli show and this is my least favorite even compare to the cheaper ones like Mistere in Treasure island(that's actually a smaller production, smaller stage and older show but it's actually not bad at all!!!)\n\nUsually there would be clowns when they are changing stage to fill the time and still keep you focus in the show sort of so you are not bored, they don't really have that here in the traditional clown way which me personally don't really like. \n\nAnd also there are lots of \"video watching\" on the giant screen which bored me really bad and I was just thinking... why are we all sitting here watching giant screen when there suppose to be real person performing???\n\nMe being a graphic designer myself can really appreciate the graphics\/special effect they did but I don't know if it's appropriate at the life show, or maybe cuz it's going on for like about 10 minutes and not the best special graphics\/effect that you never seen before neither so I wasn't really into it.\n\nAnd there's not really any special cirque de solely crazy acrobat but the most basic stuff and lots of dancing... mostly dancing!\n\nThere are good parts of the show that's really cool though!\n\nOk Spoiler alert!!! If you haven't seen the show and wanna go see it, maybe you would not wanna read the rest of my review. \n\nThe LED light on dancers that changes color in the dark, the seeing michael dancing with the real dancers at the end was cool... well... that's about it!\n\nI don't get the guitarist showing off thing at all! I mean... there's no michael jackson with her and i do not know who she is... :S\n\nOverall, I can't complain cuz i was there for business and the company paid for this. But personally, I told my brother who's a HUGE Michacel jackson fan to not waste his money cuz althought there are good parts in the show, I know he's gonna be so disappointed at the end and the price doesn't reflect in the quality of the show(is that because they'll have to pay copy right to Michael???)\n\nThe dance was of course not bad, but i don't know if it's good enough to support the whole 90 minutes show! \n\nI say you might as well go see the MJ impersonator show!!!
