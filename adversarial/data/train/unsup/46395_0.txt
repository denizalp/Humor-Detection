Service was horrible. Took 10 mins for no one to notice us. It wasn't even during peak restaurant hours. It was around 2 so it wasn't busy and nobody shoukd be weeded ariund that time. I had to go find a server to take our order. Food has been down graded from pervious years. I used to look forward to their goat cheese appetizer. And the server was a snake when it came to pay by card. He had  bypassed the customers CHOICE to tip by $, %, or none. He had gone straight to %.\nNever again will I come to this restaurant.
