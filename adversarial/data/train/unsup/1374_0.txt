Stopped by Pizza Rock this past weekend while in Vegas. We had a larger party and the table was ready to go even before the reservation time which was great. The staff were very friendly but lacked in attentiveness which mostly just had to do with our waiter. We chose a few different pizzas and some appetizers. The truffle fries were a bit underwhelming and the amount of fries you get for $8 ish dollars was not worth it. The pizzas themselves were nothing more than average at best. My boyfriend actually compared the Detroit to little caesars deep dish in which he said little Caesar's was actually better. Bummer. I had the spaghetti and meatballs and was not impressed by the flavor of the sauce or the meatballs. The bread that it came with was tasty but I'm a carb lover so I could be biased. I'm giving this place 3 stars because of the ambiance and promptness of our party being sat. Lots of really good places to eat in Vegas but this was just not one of them for me.
