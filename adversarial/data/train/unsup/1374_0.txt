This place is great! Love the Library  Theme with the Fireplace! That fireplace is the best part of the Restaurant. The service was amazing & the waitresses are so nice and gorgeous! Drinks  were delightful! The spicy tuna was a little too salty but other then that all the finger food were delicious
