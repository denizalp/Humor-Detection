The worst customer service I've ever had. I will never buy another item in any location ever again because of the manager and her staff. I asked for a small bag and was rudely told \"you need to buy something in order for us to give you a bag.\" I guess the $1500 coat I was about to buy but threw back down wasn't enough for them.
