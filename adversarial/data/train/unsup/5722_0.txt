Responsive customer service, good pricing for technology. I dropped in at this Target to pick up a couple of wireless mice for our laptops. The store was well organized and the items I needed were easy to find. I looked for a store clerk to help me in Electronics, but they did not have anyone manning the station. \n\nI proceeded to the front cashiers. To my surprise, there were only two cashiers open. I went to the shorter line and was told that the line was closing. I joined the longer queue, 6 customers deep. \n\nI remarked to the customer in front of me. They really need to open another line. Instead of standing and complaining, I decided to give Target a chance to respond. I went back to the shorter line and asked, \"Would you please as the manager to open another line?\" \n\"No problem, \" she answered.\n\nWithin 2 minutes, 2 more lines were open, and customers moved through quickly. Kudos to Target to responding to customer needs and requests.
