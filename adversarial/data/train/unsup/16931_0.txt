Second time here. This time for brunch. Service was not as good as first time, slow. Chips came out after the food.\n  Nice outdoor patio to sit and relax on a nice day.  food is great, street tacos are delicious.  not a lot of food for the price on the lunch menu.\n\nHave not been here for dinner, only lunch.
