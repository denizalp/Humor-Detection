This is just another store at the Miracle Mile Shops that employs lazy people that aren't earning their paycheck. \n\nI stopped in on a weekday afternoon, just browsing. The same inconsiderate employee got in my way multiple times when I was trying to browse. After she moved a cart of accessories to within 2 feet of where I was standing, blocking the items I was about to look at, I decided that shopping at H&M wasn't worth the frusteration and I took my business elsewhere.
