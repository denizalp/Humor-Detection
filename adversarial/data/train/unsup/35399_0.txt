I went back. We were hoping to get their Restaurant Week menu but they only offer it at dinner. But we were all starving so we stayed and ordered. We sat at the huge shared table I mentioned in my original review that they used as a business table. The Cardinals game was about to come on and we wanted a view of the TVs that I  also mentioned in my previous review that showed a vile news program. They didn't turn the game on at the start but finished the KC\/Wash game and we missed a Cards field goal. (Bitter)\n\nThe service was GREAT today. I should have gotten our server's name, she was timely, informative and super friendly. Long blonde hair and knew triathlons. \n\nAbout the food - first negative - no kid's menu and the prices are so high. \n\nMy older boy got the chicken and waffles, this is no LoLo's but the kid really liked it. Small piece of what appeared boneless chicken, lots of waffles with BACON crumbled on top, and a big pile of scrambled eggs (totally unnecessary for the kid) $13\n\nThe younger boy couldn't find anything he wanted so we got him the BBQ sliders with the caramelized onions and aioli on the side with fries. $10 He wasn't impressed.\n\nThe husband got the short rib sandwich. Huge, spilling over with meat and caramelized onions, the bread looked rustic but soft with onion rings - he loved it. Enjoyed with Sessions lager. $11.75\n\nI got the smoked turkey, thick bacon, thick tomato slices, sprouts and pesto aioli on a croissant. Huge sandwich I could only eat half and was very full. You really can't screw up this sandwich and it wasn't a risky order - I just needed something good after a long run morning. I also got the sweet potato fries, perfect with small but visible bits of salt. Enjoyed with a hoppy beer from Boulder Brewing $10.75\n\nIt was a much better experience then the first time. They serve you a ton of food we have three boxes in our fridge right now and the prices reflect that. The total was $67 for four lunch\/breakfast meals, two sodas, three beers. Now that I typed it out, thought about the quality of food and beer, it is fine. It was a good meal except I missed the start of the game. Boo.
