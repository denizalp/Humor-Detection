3.5 to 4 stars\n\nNot bad for the price, $12.99 for lunch, seniors get 15% off.  Pay at the front before eating. \n\nThere are hot food, salads, noodle bar, dessert, fruits, fried varieties and soup.\n\nSeating in the middle section is a bit too tight, but the booths on the side look more spacious.\n\nI think the lunch noodle bar would have more variety such as different types of greens, vermicelli noodles, frozen tofu, etc.  The tomato and laksa broth were both pretty good.
