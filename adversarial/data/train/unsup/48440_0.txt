I'm a big foodie and a fan of Guy's shows. Tried the \"trash can nachos\" and the presentation was very cool. They literally have it in a can and the waiters lift the can up to dump the food out. Nachos were loaded with cheese, jalapenos, onions, beef briskets etc... also tried the pulled pork shoulder sandwich and it was.............amazing. every bite was amazing. I will definitely come back for more :)
