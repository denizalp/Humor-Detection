I ruptured my Achilles' tendon and after surgery my doctor recommended the Keith Kleven Institute for my physical therapy. The staff is GREAT! Stephanie and Jared are great. I was hesitant to go to physical therapy because of the cost. I had been doing exercises on my own, but once I started going here the difference was incredible! I feel so much better, and my swelling is almost non-existent. They are the only pt place in Nevada with a pool treadmill, which is a great way to mix up your therapy.  I started PT about 5 months post op and I wish I had started sooner. Don't let the cost scare you off. The Keith Kleven institute has me well on the way to a speedier recovery!
