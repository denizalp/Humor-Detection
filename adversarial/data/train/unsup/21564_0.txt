First of all, I do not like gelato. I've even had it straight from Italy, still wasn't a fan. But OMG, this place was YUMMMMMMMY! \n\n1. It's on a stick. Food on a stick is always better.\n2. It has toppings. Toppings I like.\n3. Chocolate and toppings designs were classy. Better to eat you with my dear.\n\nGelato is so much healthier than regular ice cream they say. Well for the first time in forever, I believe it. Now you should believe me and check this place out.
