The Aloft Hotel isn't bad. The problem with this Aloft is that it just really isn't that good either.\n\nThe issue with this hotel is how it was built. Aesthetically speaking, it is a very charming and modern looking gem out in Beachwood with easy access to the highway and local shopping and dining. The interior is well-appointed and they have a cozy little lounge\/bar area. Unfortunately for us, everyone and their Momma decided to bring their kids the days we stayed(I really like it when I can stay somewhere and there are no kids running around...). Having a child screaming while you're sitting at the bar is really no fun.\n\nThe staff were friendly and very helpful, which is always a bonus, and were very accommodating to any requests or questions. This place is also dog-friendly. We didn't bring our Puggle Riley, but liked the fact that we had that as an option if needed.\n\nOn to why I gave it three stars; this place with all of it's upside has one terrible design flaw: thin walls and floors. I mean geez-I could literally hear every single person walking down not only our hall-but the hallway and rooms above us. And don't let your neighbor above walk heavily footed-goodness gracious! It was terrible. Most of us like to rest in the evenings or early in the mornings without it sounding like Barnum and Bailey's Circus is parading down the hall or a pack of wild Elephants is walking around above you. I mean we could hear conversations like we were a part of them!\n\nHere's the deal; I'm not totally against staying at Aloft-I'm totally against paying to stay somewhere and having to hear that kind of noise.\n\nWill I stay at Aloft again? I'll probably give it another try. But here's a tip-request the top floor of the hotel away from the elevators. Maybe that'll help alleviate the feeling of being in a hotel that's still under construction or something.
