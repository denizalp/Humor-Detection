I thought this place was really good BBQ! \n\nFor $16 (tax included), I got the platter which had a slice of brisket, 2 little pieces of chicken, a generous helping of coleslaw, a bread roll, and an assortment of pickles (I also got a slice of key lime pie for $4 and a pink lemonade for $3.50).\n\nInitially, my thought was: only 1 slice of brisket? Kind of disappointing. I was wrong. That slice was: (I) delicious and (II) very filling due to its really tasty fat marbling. I loved it.\n\nThe chicken was amazing too! Very nice and pleasant smokiness.\n\nEverything else complemented the \"Q\" as well. I especially liked the assortment of pickles. In the end, I couldn't even finish the plate!\n\nThe key lime pie was wonderful but, next time, I'll pass on the pink lemonade. It tasted fine but it clearly provided me with the lowest \"utility-to-cost\" ratio on my plate. Water may work better with this meal anyway.\n\nWill definitely come back!
