One word...superficial. I wish the gay community could be more accepting. Please don't instigate a fight with one of my friends for not conforming to your version of \"gay.\" You have a great atmosphere but just need nicer bartenders. It was my friend's birthday and you kicked him out because one of your bartenders instigated a fight in the bathroom with my friend. Please be nicer, I really want to like you. Honestly I just can't understand. Will be calling management.
