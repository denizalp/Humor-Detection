I came to Toyota for my regular maintenance, and 4 hours later had one of the memorably worst customer service experiences I've ever had.\n\nI don't make a habit of posting negative reviews online, but when something is as bad as the service I received at Richmond Hill Toyota, it's important to alert people to avoid the same treatment.\n\nSo I came in for my regular maintenance. They told me it would take 2 hours. In the meantime, I was driven to the library, and was told I'd get a ride back once their maintenance is finished. \n\nSure enough, it was done after just under 2 hours, and I got a phone call saying my car is done. Before we could arrange a ride back, they had hung back. I immediately called them back, but couldn't reach anyone. I tried again after 10 minutes. Still nothing. I tried again after 30 minutes, still no answer. Once again, after an hour. Still no answer. At that point, having given up hope, I decided to walk 30 minutes from the library back to Richmond Hill Toyota (keeping in mind this was the middle of winter). \n\nOnce I got there, it was already 4 hours since I dropped off my car, and I saw all the staff, and the driver comfortably gathered around the table, relaxing and telling jokes.\n\nThat was bad enough.\n\nThen I got the bill, and found that I had been horribly overcharged. I don't remember the exact figure, but it was over $150 for a job that Active Green Ross does for $29.99.\n\nNot only that, but one of the staff even had the audacity to call me and tell me that they may call me from Toyota to ask about my customer service experience, and they were looking for a 10\/10. \n\nAgain, I don't make a habit of posting negative reviews online, especially when the service provider acknowledges their mistake, apologizes, and goes to great lengths to make up for it. They didn't do that at Richmond Hill Toyota.
