I walked in at about 3:50, was seated at a table around 4pm. I watched multiple people get taken care of, I watched multiple employees walk back and forth in front of me. After 15 minutes of waiting a man asked what I needed. I waited 20 more minutes after that and walked out. Not to mention somebody in front of me sat down and was taken care of in less than 10 minutes. And a lady in front of me had foil on her nails waiting for somebody to come back and take care of her from the time I got seated up until the time I walked out. Everybody who wanted pedis was quickly taken care of. Worst experience i've ever had.
