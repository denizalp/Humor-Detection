The Asian clown behind the counter is a condescending a-hole. The dude has a bad attitude and seems like he not only hates his job but hates life itself. Everything he says is forced. Perhaps he shouldn't take his anger issues out on paying customers. He also made it a point to give customers their orders first who clearly ordered after me. Dude mad dogging everybody just isn't good for business.
