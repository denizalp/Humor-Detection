I'm pretty disappointed to be honest. I was a regular at the old Victory Cafe for years and was cautiously excited about it's grand re-opening on Bloor. I knew it would't have the charm of a big sun-drenched patio anymore but I was still expecting something special.\n\nBasically, if you've been to the Crafty Coyote across the street, you've been to the new Victory Cafe. The owners (who also own the aforementioned Crafty Coyote) have cloned the same bar and put it right across the street. I'm not sure why they did this but I can see cannibalization being an issue with this strategy eventually.\n\nI'll give it 3 stars because it isn't the worst place to go, it's fine... it's just more of the same and that saddens me :(
