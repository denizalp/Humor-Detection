A cute little donut nook in midst of Kensington market.So this shop is tiny all donuts are placed behind the main glass wall and just next to it is a counter you literally don't go in a shop it's like a little look pick and pay place.\n\nI had not heard about this place but the line up got me interested in trying them even though I had eaten churros right before walking by Dipped.\n\nBut let me tell you I have no regrets.So this place doesn't have a huge variety of donuts but a really good selection of fancy flavored donuts.Out of the many I chose the rose water pistachio donut and boy it was da-bomb!So fresh and so flavorful.I fell in love with the rose water glaze.There isn't much pistachio flavoring only it's dusted with pistachio bits.\n\nThe donut itself was $3 even.Next time I'm definitely trying their PJ and lavender donuts.Kudos to the team for such a cute concept.\n\nThough I heard a few ppl walk by me saying we aren't trying a $3 donut.I still feel that the pricing should be between $2-$2.50 not more.
