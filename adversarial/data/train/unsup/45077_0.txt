We walked into this establishment after a fun night out on the town. We all had the huge order of fries to share between 4 people. It was more than enough. I had the Mac n cheese burger and it was delish. The meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly. It was not over or underdone. The beer selection was ok, but could use a little more variety. Our server was very personable and helpful. I would like to eventually come back and try the other burgers at this place. I would definitely come back.
