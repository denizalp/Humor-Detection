Wow what a diamond in the rough ! The wife and I were in the area and in the mood for some sushi on a Sunday (the day when a lot of good sushi joints are closed) so we did a google search found it was open and decided to give it a chance. \n\nDon't be fooled by the appearance upon walking in, it's obvious they tried to save costs in the decorations to up the quality of their food. Besides it seems to be a quaint family owned operation by people who know good sushi! Why waste money on funky lights right? \n\nLong story short, the sushi and service was outstanding and reminded us a lot of Tokyo lobby before their move across the parking lot. Small place, big satisfaction !!! Definitely worth it and we'll be back again. I'm also looking forward to experiencing their happy hour too.\n\nOh and the people next to us were in there for third day in a row.
