I have passed by this restaurant everything when I go shopping grocery at Giant Eagle. It's around 10-table restaurant, quite small for me. Their dish that was quite surprise me is Wagyu Meatloaf. Wagyu is a premium kind of beef, and I've never thought to use it for meatloaf. However, restaurant did pretty good with this dish. It's not an exact meatloaf. I considered it as a burger streak, rough grounded beef served with mashed potato and cherry tomatoes.
