Love this place for breakfast! Even though I always get the same thing (kahlua pig eggs Benedict) I've tried lots of things on their menu & everything has been fantastic! I usually order for pickup but the few times I've dined in the service was excellent and the coffee even better! Try the bananas foster pancakes - they're to die for! Also the sweet cream crepes are a personal favorite but don't forget to add bananas!!
