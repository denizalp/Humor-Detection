My co-workers order from this spot all the time. I absolutely love the mango avocado salad. You can opt. for chicken, salmon, or beef. I've had the salmon in the past, when I wasn't a healthy conscious eater and I have to say it tastes wayyy better with the mango & avocado, however, since learning just how much salmon is farmed & packed with harmful chemicals much like everything we eat, well, I'd opt without meat at the very least. I have to say that provided the cost of the combos, they sure give you more than you can handle. I like their bento box, packed with your choice of meat, rolls, fried tempura or vegetable & miso soup, well thats pretty freakin awesome. You will definitely get the most of your buck.
