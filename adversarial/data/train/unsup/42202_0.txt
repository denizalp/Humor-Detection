I am a super picky eater and this is one of best Thai places I've been.. Hidden treasure for sure! We had the Thai spare ribs, BBQ fries rice, chicken pad Thai and the volcano chicken. The combination of flavors in the food made me not want to stop eating. I didn't think anything was too salty.. Barely tasted salt. We asked for our food medium spicy and it came out just how we ordered it.. Which is always nice. This is the second time I've been here in a week and I pretty sure I'll be back soon so I can share this gem with others.\nOh and the staff is super friendly and helpful!
