No, we just stopped serving breakfast.\nThe only vegetarian lunch item is the cold veggie sandwich.\nWe're out of wheat bread.\nI *guess* we could toast the bread.\nAll delivered in a forced-friendly-but-really-irritated manner by an extremely bored woman.\nOK, at $18 for lunch for two (1 full sandwich of the day, 1\/2 veggie sandwich, two pops) I would hope that you are fully stocked, friendly, accommodating and apologetic, and don't intentionally assault my eardrums with shitty country music while I have to wait forever for very simple food. \nThe food was OK, but our conclusion was that something like Subway would have been faster, better, and less snotty at half the price.
