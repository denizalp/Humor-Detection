My roommate personally has two Evil Controllers and although I'm not a huge gamer myself, when I have played Xbox 360 with her i've definitely noticed that her controllers are a lot nicer and different than the ones my boyfriend has. She has a pretty cool one that is pink camo designed and then another one that is carbon fiber, and I really like the carbon fiber one because it's got some kind of material on it that makes it almost softer and squishier kind of which made my hands get less tired. The controller also has different sticks on it that my hands slipped off less than a regular controller, and they also have this thing called and Evil D-Pad which was four buttons instead of a regular xbox dpad. Pretty neat. My roommate plays a lot more video games than I do, but I think it's pretty cool that there's a local company doing something like this, especially since they also make controllers for people with disabilities. It's pretty much a place where you order stuff online but I know you can go into the actual office and buy controllers there too.
