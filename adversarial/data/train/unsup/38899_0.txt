Yes it's tacky. Yes it's a chain. And yes, it's standard diner food. But it works.... You cant visit Montreal without trying a Montreal bagel or french toast at an Eggspectation. Set your eggspecations accordingly, eggspect decent quality diner classics and don't be put off by the diner chain feel. And a visit during brunch hours on a weekend is best.
