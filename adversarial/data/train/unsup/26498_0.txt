Came here on Sat. for a meet and greet for UFC fighter Bryan Bam Bam Barberena. Grabbed some pizzas, a salad, and dessert.  The service was amazing. Sandy was our waitress, she greeted us with a huge smile. And was helpful in picking out a pizza for my wife. I had the bam bam special. The pizza was sooooo good. I normally don't eat the crust because most crust is either too dry or too chewy. Their crust here was perfect. We are going to be back to try some of their other flavors.
