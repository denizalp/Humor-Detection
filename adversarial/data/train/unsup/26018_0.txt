This is my new nail place!! They did such an amazing job and didn't even care how crazy my requests were, they treated my daughter and I like royalty and we will be be back!! I loved how Wendy did my nails and toes and she didn't even cut me like the other place I went to. I'm so glad that they are 10 mins from my house!! 10 STARS!!!
