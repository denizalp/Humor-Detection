Enter your credit card information..chose your wash type....enter wash.....ahh clean.\n\nThe automatic wash at this place is great and touch-less! I used to have to get out of my car and remove the antenna, so it wouldn't be sucked into those heavy foam sheets that touch car washes use. I never understood the point of those, but as a kid, was frightened by them. It was like your car was being engulfed and swallowed, I felt like Captain Ahab, in the belly of the white wale.   With this touch-less wash, no need to worry about antennas, mirrors, or anything else protruding from your car, or feeling like a character from classic literature. \n\nThe prices are meh for what you get, just spend the extra 2 $ and get the 8$ wash. It gets your car super clean, and has a full dry at the end. 6$ bucks gets you no dry, and 7$ gets you a mediocre wash, that will make you say \"did I get my car washed at all?\" With the 8$ you get this special Green Foam spray stuff, and extra rinse and polish deal. This place would be 4 stars if they wash options were better, but overall it's not a bad place to get your car clean. They have vacuums and vending machines that disperse air fresheners, towels, and small bottles of armor-all...in case you are too lazy to go to AutoZone (which I am sometimes)  \n\nMy favorite car wash moment:\n\nAn unexpecting patron approaches \"change\" machine, in his attempt to get change for his 10 dollar bill, in which he plans to purchase the aforementioned green ever-green tree air freshener. He proceeds to insert said 10 bill  into machine. Clang...Clang.... like a slot machine in Vegas the change drops from the machine, as he reaches down he realized he just bought 10$ worth of wash tokens!  DOH!!!!\n\nHe proceed to swear in Spanish..as his girlfriend laughs at him.  Little did he know that this Car Wash has it's own currency, and is a sovereign nation of the United States.....
