Since relocating to AZ, I've made it my mission to visit every cafe during the duration of my time here. I love the coffee culture here in Phoenix and The Refuge has been on my mind for a while now.\n\nI'm a huge sucker for lavender flavored things and their \"The Lavender\" caught my eye, can we say it was lav(ender) at first sight?\n\nCame in to do some studying and of course try their coffee. Got a medium, iced, Lavender which is just a latte with white chocolate Lavender simple syrup. (I know, how many times do I have to say Lavender in this review ... ) Typically priced drink and brought out to my table when it was ready. Good flavor, sweet but felt like it was lacking in the caffeine department. There's espresso in this right? Whatever, I'll take it.\n\nInteresting atmosphere to study in, definitely not for me to say the least. The environment was loud with oldies music and overpowered by the smell of fried bacon odors wafting through the cafe. Now, now, I do love me some bacon ... but to have the entire cafe smell like a kitchen flat top stove the whole time is a bit much, too much. \n\nI would say this place would be great to grab a to-go drink if you're not looking to be powered up, for a bite to eat or to just read a book. Noticed a couple people on their phones during my time here, so study session environment? Not so much. My table was also super wobbly, but I just had to McGyver some post-it notes so my drink wouldn't topple over onto my laptop ... or the floor. Wi-Fi was decently fast and there are outlets located along the wall areas. Parking lot is conveniently located right next to the cafe, so you don't have to worry about that except for the lack of shaded spots.
