Woah, sorry others had a not so great experience here. I on the other hand came in here twice while shopping in the Forum shops. Great looking shoe store with reasonable prices and a very nice selection. They had some really cute handbag's as well. \n\nMost prices are under $100 a pair, with some very nice stylish high heels for under $50, wedges, stiletto's, pumps, etc...in many colors. I did buy a few pair, actually went back the next day to get another pair that I could not get out of my head from seeing. \n\nSolid color's, bling, and more bling. Very nice casual sandals as well. \n\nService was good, they give you your space until you need them. Not pushy at all and for this I was happy. \n\nGood store and so convenient to check out especially when your feet need saving from all the walking.
