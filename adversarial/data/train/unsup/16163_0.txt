BACKGROUND\n\nI first met Dr. Church at Desert Veterinary Medical Specialist's when my kitty Rocky was diagnosed with Feline Arterial Thromboembolism (FATE) which usually has an etiology on the left side of the heart. Once Rocky was stabilized, he was sent to Dr. Church, who diagnosed Rocky with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) and promptly treated him.\n\nMost cats do not survive FATE and are usually euthanized immediately. If they do survive, the longest survival rate is 187 days, unless it's my Rocky and he's being treated by Dr. Church. Rocky survived another 3 1\/2 years, and died of aggressive osteosarcoma in his shoulder, nothing related to his heart problems.\n\nSo, when my little tea-cup chihuahua, Princess Baily, needed a cardiac assessment and treatment, I didn't hesitate to go to Dr. Church.\n\nDR. WHIT CHURCH, DVM\n\nDr. Church earned his veterinary degree from Oregon State in 2002, and moved to Arizona in 2006, after completing his residency and Masters in Science at University of Illinois.\n\nHis special areas of interest include pericardial disease, echocardiography, and interventional cardiovascular procedures.\n\nTHE STORY AND SERVICE EXPERIENCE\n\nSo, right up front, I have to divulge, I'm a SUPER difficult and demanding mommy to my pets. I got all three of my pets as rescue animals, and I'm an animal rights activist, and I probably love animals more than most people, especially my own pets. Obviously, I'm VERY protective of my animals, and seek the best for them at all times.\n\nPrincess Baily started seeing Dr. Church about a year ago, when he first diagnosed her using a 2D Echo. He was very patient and allowed me to watch and ask a bunch of questions. It was great seeing the valves and blood flow for myself. I really appreciate his time and generosity. \n\nSubsequently, Princess Baily has been back about every six months for a follow up chest x-ray, and recently twice in the last week, as she had a sudden exacerbation and was diagnosed with having congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, along with her severe degenerative valve disease and airway collapse.\n\nDr. Church ordered a CXR of Princess Baily, added some medications (furosemide, enalapril) and took a renal blood panel. I brought her back a week later for a follow up renal blood panel, and CXR, and he tweaked the medications again, and now she is getting some relief, for which I'm EXTREMELY GRATEFUL! Although there is no cure, I want to make sure my puppy is as comfortable as possible.\n\nAnd I can not say enough about the staff! ALWAYS helpful and pleasant and compassionate. They are also very fast at returning calls and refilling prescriptions, which makes my life so much easier.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAlthough Princess Baily is in her last season of life, it makes me very happy to have Dr. Church at Desert Veterinary Medical Specialists on Princess Baily's team.\n\n5\/5 RECOMMEND\n\nOF NOTE\n\n*Parking out front.\n\n*For more information: dvmspecialists.com
