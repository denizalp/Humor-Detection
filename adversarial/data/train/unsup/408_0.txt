nice ballpark. Fairly new, it replaced Jacobs Field. Sat in the upper deck and the view was not bad. We left the seats in the 5th inning and went to stand in th earea behind left field. THat was very cool area to watch a couple innings. The fans didnt seem to into the game. The park is downtown so there is lots of bars and places to eat before or after the game.
