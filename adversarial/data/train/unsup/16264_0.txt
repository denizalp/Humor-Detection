Now under new management (since sometime in February apparently).  They are using the same supplier for wings and sauces, which is the good news, but ... other things seem to be \"shrinking\".  I picked up in person last night and inquired about that.  I had ordered previously and upgraded from a large fries to a \"family sized\" fries and was a bit shocked that it wasn't any bigger than what was typically a large fries.  For $7 you would expect a pretty significant amount of fries but it was just enough for 2 people and literally the same amount that I used to get when I ordered the large size fries under the previous management (which were half the price of the family sized).  I also picked up two \"large\" salads last night, and lo-and-behold, they were also much smaller (but the same price) -- they were the size of the medium under the previous management.\n\nWhen I asked the new management about the smaller sizes they just said \"they aren't smaller!\" -- having been a very loyal customer for many years I can tell you that they most certainly are much smaller -- all of the side dishes seem to have shrunk down one full size but retained the same price.\n\nWell, at least they are still using the same chicken and sauces as before which I guess is a good thing, but all the savings that used to come with the good values on the wings go out the door with the new smaller sizes for everything.\n\nThis is NOT the same Wingery that I've been a loyal customer of for many years any longer.
