Thank you everyone for the great reviews on this lousy restaurants chain. I'm so glad I wasted my evening on this food that is still making me cringe. Catfish Delight, so chewy that I thought the skin was still on the flesh. Lard Na Noodles with super bitter broccoli. Egg rolls as small as my thumb with no flavor, and the worst Pad Thai in history. Sorry folks this place sucks.
