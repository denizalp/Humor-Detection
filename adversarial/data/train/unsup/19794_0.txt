Worst and most dishonest service department ever. I am a Ford person and very mechanically inclined, which should really validate my situation and frustration. After getting stuck in a storm and having my vehicle misfire, I took the vehicle to Camelback ford for diagnosing. The service agent first tells me my vehicle needs spark plugs, wires, and a new coil. I was quoted $372.00 for parts and labor. Then it turns out the service agents says it does not include the coil and it's another $200, making the bill close to $600 with tax. And on top of this, the agent recommended a air filter for high mileage for a whopping $626.00. Being very disappointed by the price change and since their online quote for the original $372 did include the coil, I opted to pick up my vehicle with no service. Brought it home, inspected it and it turns out that it was one lose spark plug wire cable. $50 fix.  Oh and the high mileage air filter, only $15 at my local auto part store. Truly, the most dishonest dealer that I have ever had the pleasure with. BEWARE!
