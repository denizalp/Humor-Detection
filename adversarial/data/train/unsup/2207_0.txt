Compare to places in Chicago and other states, this outdoor mall area is really nice.  Kind of reminds me of Hollywood with the fountains and huge billboards everywhere.\n\nIt's clean, a lot of security and free parking.  It's nice just to walk around and maybe grab a bite to eat at one of the many restaurants and bars in the area.
