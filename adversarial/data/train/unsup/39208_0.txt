I decided to try this place my last morning in Vegas. The location was pretty easy to find and the menu was simple to understand. The line stretching around the corner and down the hall was extreme and had me second guessing my decision. The end of the line to the counter to place my order took about ten minutes and the staff was friendly. After placing my order (2 sandwiches) it took another ten minutes to receive my order. The food was hot as everything is cooked by order and the taste was what I expected, but the portion was smaller than I thought. I left not hungry but not fully satisfied. The long line and the price I paid didn't equal to the end result in my opinion.
