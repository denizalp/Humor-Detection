My garage door was fixed without a problem, Manny came out to work on my door and was great. The only problem that existed, was calling in the issue. There was poor customer service on Lodi's end. I had called in for service, the gal over the phone was rude and unprofessional. Please train your employees to provide great customer service to your long time customer's.
