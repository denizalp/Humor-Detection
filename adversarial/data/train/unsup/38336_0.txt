Very clean nice comfy bed I had 2 queens\nI always take my own cleaning stuff cause I'm weird lol but I was amazed I even ran towel on headboard and no dust!!\nOnly bummer no microwave but there is a frig and keurig  booked thru booking.com \nFor 7 days but I needed to check out after 3 days and check back in just for 1 night they had no problem crediting my account.  Breakfast buffet was really good every thing you would want for a bfast 12.99pp.  Plenty of restaurants nearby to walk to easy access to freeway 20 min to sky harbor I will stay here again
