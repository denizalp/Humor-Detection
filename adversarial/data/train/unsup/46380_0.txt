Figured we come here for leafs games since it's named Wendel Clark's, but the experience just isn't living up to expectations.  \n\nThe bartender is nice (forget her name), and the manager is welcoming and actually chats w us.  \n\nFood is good but nothing to write home about.  \n\nThe 2nd time here our group sat at a table instead of the bar.  The waitress serving us was not personable.  I don't think any of us saw her smile.  It wasn't only our table who was frowned on either.  \n\nThe place was cold the 2nd time we visited.  They claim the heat was on the fritz.  \n\nOne guy complained his beer was warm and his pop was flat. \n\nThey don't have HD on their tv's.  \n\nHopefully the next time we end up here it's a better experience, if we end up here again...there's a pub a couple doors down..\n\nI'll give 3 stars for now as the aforementioned bartender was good (who also remembered us the 2nd time we came), and the manager was welcoming both times (who also remembered us)..
