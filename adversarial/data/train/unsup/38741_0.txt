This place is sort of hard to find, but once you do you'll be glad you found it. Its small, but its extremely nice inside with a very cosy modern feeling. We went on a friday night with no reservations and was able to get a table, but it was very busy, so i think if you were to go with more than 2 or on a special occasion I'd suggest reservations.  This place was awesome when it came to the food - you could tell everything was made from scratch and had a real authentic taste to it. But on the other hand, the service was extremely slow. I know our server was busy but i mean we were always waiting. Not that we were in a rush, but I mean menus would be nice to have (we waited about 15 mins just for a menu), and then waited to place a drink order, which took about 20 mins to get. The food took as long as a normal restaurant so that was ok, it was more the server being slow. she seemed very flustered, like she kept forgetting we were there, and when she did come talk to us it was always rushed. My boyfriend would never get the chance to order another beer before she ran off. Overall the service needed some major work, but i'd go back for the food - it makes up for the service.
