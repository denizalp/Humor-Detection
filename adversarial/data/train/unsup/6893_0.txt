Holy monkeys! I'm bananas for this place!\n\nMy fianc√© went for a couple of cones tonight. I got two scoops, one of thin mint and one of chocolate covered pretzel, in a waffle cone. He got a scoop of peanut butter pretzel and one of chocolate covered pretzel also in a waffle cone. The total was a little pricey... Until I took the first bite. \n\nThe ice cream is real. It's made on location and you can really tell the difference. It's so light and fluffy and the massive two scoop I had never gave me a stomach ache. That's never happened before!
