The staff at Cornerstone Ranch consists of undereducated, rude, obnoxious, lazy, poorly-trained, insipid jerks. They are truly last on the list for everything you could possibly want from an apartment staff. I highly recommend doing your research before you sign on with these people, as anyone who completed grade school will find their tactics juvenile, sophomoric and completely lacking in tact, courtesy and class. Absolutely 100% despise these people. Knock on any door here, ask any resident... bet you get the same response. SAVE YOUR MONEY, SAVE YOUR TIME, choose ANY one of the many complexes around this area (with better quality apartments, quite honestly). Don't read the good reviews on here that they pay their only partially-literate staff to write. Feel free to ask me any questions directly via e-mail(or heck, come by my unit here and meet them for yourself): johnnichristina@yahoo.com.
