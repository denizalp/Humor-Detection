The store is pretty big and lots of variety! I like buffalo exchange a lot! \n\nThe girl at the counter doing clothing exchanges for selling was pretty rude. I didn't do anything to her and she was acting like I was stupid because I didn't know buffalo exchange protocol for exchanging my items I wanted to sell. She was acting like I was inconvenient. Which I understand, if you're getting paid like $8 an hour you probably aren't thrilled to be at work. Although, it's Phoenix and there's lots of job opportunity. \n\nShe looked like she hated her job, I didn't quite catch her name but she had like three hoops in her nose and short brown slightly wavy hair that was to her chin. \n\nI will go to the one on Osborn, people there are way nicer.
