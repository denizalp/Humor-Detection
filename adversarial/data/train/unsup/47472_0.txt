Cute little diner spot, a little outside Pittsburgh. I enjoyed myself! Despite what appeared to be a waiting line, I got a spot at the counter right away. I had a clear view of watching the cooks flip up pancakes and scramble eggs- pretty fun. The food was good. I found out about this place from DDD. If you are in the Pittsburgh area and have time to stop, I would recommend it :) It's a little spot and has diner hours, so make sure you go when they're open. Enjoy!
