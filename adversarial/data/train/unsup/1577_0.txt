Apteka - it's vegan, but you can barely tell! \n\nThe Food\nThis is a vegan establishment, but the food is so interesting you will be satisfied. \nGet the perogies because this is Pittsburgh, and because I told you to. \nFor real, they have a regular menu and a \"late night\" menu, all of which is excellent; fresh ingredients, flavorful, and DELICIOUS. \nThe perogie hoagie is my personal favorite- literal perogies and sauce and sauerkraut ON A FREAKING HOAGIE BUN. But real talk, you have to be \"on another level\" to eat it. \nThe 4 perogies are enough to fill up anyone. They come with a mix of types of perogies with beets on the side. Fresh to DEATH. \nThe bar at this establishment is also excellent. They feature a number of drafts (rotating) from local breweries. They also have a full bar with a list of signature cocktails. \n\nThe Staff\nThe staff is super helpful and great at explaining the unique dishes. They're also great to suggest a good beer or cocktail. \nThey also work well as a team here, feel free to ask anyone for anything and they will oblige. And no one is below a 7. (I said it.)\n\nThe Ambience\nThings at Apteka are done cafe style. So, come in, order, sit at a seat of your choosing, and the staff brings your order to you. Good for small groups, because there's no worries about splitting checks- it's done UPFRONT. Larger groups can be accommodated, too, but seats together depend on the crowd that night. \nThe decor is minimal in nature- perhaps a bit too much for my tastes. The walls are cement and the ceiling is open, but I imagine a little more will come with time. \nThere are definitely hipsters left and right, I mean, look at the hood, so if you detest their type, stay away. HOWEVER, dope ppl of ALL ages come here, young to late 70s.
