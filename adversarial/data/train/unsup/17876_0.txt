They came to groom my cats . One who I have to sedate to have them touch him . They come, oh about 2 hours late  , they don't look happy because they got called in . Apparently the girl before them , the one scheduled just up and quit . I think I may know why ....\nSo they are grooming in their van that is not meeting any health code requirements I'm sure of it . But I'm desperate and I've already given my cats ACE .. So they go in . I come back out and I hear my cat being a pain the butt but I hear the girl say \"f**k this cat\" .. I was like wait what ??\nThey bring the cats in and their cuts are botched at best .. They cut my cats whiskers off on one side !!! \nThey say one of their other staff members , the one who actually cuts the cats hair .. Will be back in 4\/6 weeks and she can come fix their hair .   As if I would subject my babies to this spectacle again . \nAlso when owner was on phone , well her boyfriend I guess , who has to clear everything by her apparently , gave me a free teeth cleaning  LOL on an upset cat , you want to give me a teeth cleaning . \n\nSo $175 for 2 meth heads to cuss at my cats and jack their hair up . While the boss can't be bothered to deal with her own customer . Piss poor ! \n\nIf you luv your babies .. Go to a place that loves animals and values who they hire .
