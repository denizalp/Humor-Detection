First, the downsides, and there are not many: the crowds and the wait: no reservations, no phone-ahead seating, no No-Wait app.  Be prepared to wait for a long time on a weekend night.  I understand the wait can be two hours, a lengthy of time I would never wait for a table anywhere.  My wife and I planned an early dinner, able to be seated within ten minutes of our Friday 6:00 p. m. arrival. By the time we left at a quarter to eight, the place was mobbed despite the bitter cold weather. \n\nSome of the tables for two are very close to each other.  Hold out for a table or booth in the main room which looks out onto the street and which offers a view.\n\nThe restaurant is attractive, distinctive, and comfortable.  The seating in the main room is marvelous, nicely spaced.\n\nThe bill can escalate quickly, but if one is going to spend $100 on a grand night out, this is the place to do it. \n\nThe banquet my wife and I enjoyed included: a draft Samuel Adams seasonal brew, a glass of house wine, a large kale and quinoa salad, a delicious, good-sized appetizer consisting of zucchini fries, portobello mushrooms, and avocado, a large fish sandwich with cole slaw and onion rings, and a great burger with mushrooms, cheeses, and onions on a fresh sesame seed bun, one slice of cheesecake with strawberries, one slice of tiramisu cheesecake, and two types of bread (our favorite is the dark, seeded variety).  I know of no restaurant with as many choices of perfectly prepared foods than The Cheesecake Factory.  If you have difficulty deciding what to order, you will be confounded by page after page of the extensive menu.\n\nTeamwork service ensures that the diner is well taken care of and our primary server, Grace, was sweet, friendly, attentive, and delightful.\n\nOur trip to the restaurant was longer than a half hour and it was worth going out of the way to enjoy.  Bravo!
