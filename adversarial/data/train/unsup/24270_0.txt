Ok this store is part of a chain. A chain that has really been pushing itself hard for the last 5 years or more.  It is right by a Big Lots. \nTo me that is what I feel like I am getting when I walk in here.\nIt is all Big Lots type stuff.\nIt has a very distinct smell when you walk in. One I do not like at all.\nAll the tools are made in China and shipped here. \nSure they have lots of items but, if you are doing a constution job of working on a car,then good luck.  \nBecause, you have many tools that just break in the middle.\nWhen they first opened up I would go here with my Brother and we bought our fair share of the stuff. But, one thing after another would bread for us. So I just stopped using them.\nI came here this time with a friend who wanted to check them out.\nThey are cheap, but from now on, I do not buy anything here. It is just going to break.
