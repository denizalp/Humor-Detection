Decided to drop in for lunch here. It was 12:15pm when I arrived and the place was full. Had to wait about 8 minutes to get a table. They have a nice selection of dishes for their $8.25 lunch special, I went with the stir fry Pad Pok with chicken and a Thai Ice Tea. First they bring you a salad (lettuce) with either a peanut sauce or garlic dressing. A small bowl of soup which was delicious and sweet. The main course was really flavorful as well, with plenty of chicken mixed in with the vegetables. I enjoyed my meal very much and will come back! Service was quick and friendly.
