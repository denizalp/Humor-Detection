Went here before a concert at Gila River Arena. The decor was comfortable, welcoming and contemporary. \nWe started with deep fried meatballs which were delicious! We shared the pesto lasagna and the pollo Della casa. We were scraping the plate on the lasagna. The olives in the chicken dish were a bit strong for my taste. I would order again and omit the olives.\nI will definitely go back.
