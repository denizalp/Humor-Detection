Great selection of beers on tap, cozy ambiance, and terrific food.  I'm in!\n\nLunch on a rainy Saturday with some friends.  Ordered the burger, fish and chips, daily soup (stewed chicken), and the salad. \n\nThe food was fresh and tasty and, combined with good company, made for a nice rainy day lunch.\n\nService was friendly.  Definitely worth making this a regular spot!
