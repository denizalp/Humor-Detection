I went ahead and tried them once again. This time I ordered sweet and sour chicken with fried rice. It was really good! Not too greasy, and it was crispy. The eggs in the fried rice were actually \"tastable\" if that's a word. Lol! I'd order it again for sure. Only thing I'd change is the attitude of the delivery employees. They don't seem to happy or friendly. Kind of standoffish actually. Nonetheless, the foods pretty good and came at a good time.
