Found a 2BD\/2BA on VRBO and this place is one of the best I've stayed at in Vegas. It's just off the strip but walking distance to many of the hotels, non-casino, and well priced. The suite was huge with two queens in one room, a king in the master bedroom and a big couch to sleep two people. This full kitchen was stocked with plates, glasses, silverware, etc and great for making some meals in the suite. There was a private entrance to the master room just off the elevators. Great place for a weekend with friends!
