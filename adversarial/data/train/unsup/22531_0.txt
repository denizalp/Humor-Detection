What happened Tuesday night! They weren't even busy. The bartender (Mike) ignored our empty beer glasses twice even though we held them up to get his attention, there was no hostess to seat my husband and myself. The bus boy seated us and then no one came to our table until we had to ask a waitress where our waitress was. The special was gone so the waitress gave us a free appetizer for our long wait. The food was alright. Then waiting forever for our check we were given a check that was not ours. There was no waitress around so we left cash for the check we were given. I don't think we'll be going back.
