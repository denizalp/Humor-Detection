I'm sorry to leave this bad review. I want to say I had an enjoyable experience, but I didn't. When we arrived, the guy at the front desk was awesome. Friendly, helpful and eager to make our stay an enjoyable one. That is where the niceties stopped. Our bed sheets were covered in hair. Head hair, body hair, ball hair, you name it. \n\nI'm not confident if wasn't sasquatch himself that just slept here the night before. But even if it was, why wasn't the room cleaned before we checked in? \n\nSo my neat-freak wife (also 7 1\/2 months pregnant) flipped out. \n\nThe staff did respond quickly and change out ALL they linens under my wife's watchful eye. But... The bathroom... Urine in the toilet from the guest before... Opened, used soap bar in the shower (again imagine sasquatch scrubbed the taint with this \"luxury bar\") and yet, even more hair sprinkled around the shower and toilet area. \n\nListen, I'm not sure exactly who had this much hair on their body to leave this kind of a mess. Not sure sasquatch exists. Michael Landon (as far as i know) has been deseased for some time and so has Robin Williams. So the only visual I have is some middle aged Italian man jumping around, naked, scratching his entire body, and shedding his greasy body hair across the room. Gross. \n\nThe only reason it's not 1 star, is the gentleman up front. He was very accomadating.
