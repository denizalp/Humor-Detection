I haven't had a Brazilian in some time but in preparation for an upcoming trip where I need to don a bikini, I decided to visit Beauty Wax Room. It is conveniently located beside Jane station, although I drove on the Sunday morning and was able to find parking just off of Bloor St W. It's located downstairs beside the Coffee Time. The facilities were clean and very pleasantly decorated. Felicia was my aesthetician and she was incredibly friendly and easy to talk to (to get my mind off of what was happening). I appreciated that she reminded me to exhale with each strip pull. Felicia was very skilled and quick with the wax, I was in and out in about 15-20 mins. I also received a free upper lip was given I was a first time customer. The price is the best I have come across from a salon\/spa that specializes in body waxing (ie not a hair or nail salon that also does waxing on the side) - about $45 with tip included for a quick, quality wax in a clean and convenient facility. I'll definitely be back in the future!
