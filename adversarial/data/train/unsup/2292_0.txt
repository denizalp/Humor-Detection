Depressing! So, one day, my sister-in-law's like, \"Hey! Let's bring the kids to Bonnie Springs and check out the petting zoo!\". I figured it sounded fun. We check (what we thought was the website for pricing) and off we go. We show up & they tell us that they recently changed their prices (almost double I believe) and other websites haven't updated the prices yet. Kids 18 months and under are free & thank goodness the guy at the front let my daughter in for free since I knew she was going to hate everything about this place as soon as we arrived. \n\nSo, we go in & my son's terrified because he thinks it looks like a ghost town (exactly what it is) and is frightened it could be haunted. I pull over an employee to do a little act to reassure my son it's not haunted, give him a wink and a nudge and he tells me \"Oh, it's totally haunted\". I'm like, not for real, right *wink nudge*, \"super haunted\". I tell him for the sake of the 3 children standing next to me, it's not haunted right? \"Oh, no. Never\". Subtlety doesn't work well here. \n\nWe check out all the random buildings, and the wax museum that holds Abraham Lincoln and Bringham Young (randoms), and then make our way to the \"petting zoo\". This is the most depressing place ever. There's a goat walking around covered in wood chips with one missing horn and a missing ear. They let a pig roam free which is scary as heck since I've seen too many horror movies where they throw bodies to the pigs to be consumed. There's a bull that stands alone in a corner that has 100 flies all over its head. A lot of the animals are asleep because they hate their lives, and it smells like crap. I feel bad for these animals since they shouldn't be in Las Vegas in 120 degree weather! If you've lived in Las Vegas your whole life, are incredibly bored, and have nothing else to do, come visit Bonnie Springs. It'll kill at least 1 hour.
