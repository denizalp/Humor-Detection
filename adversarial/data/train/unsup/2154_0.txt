This place is so cute! Very rustic, the interior is dimly lit at night which makes it a great date spot I bet. It's definitely family friendly, and casual too though. Went with my sister though for a celebratory dinner. We didn't intend on ordering anything heavy nor as much as we did, but everything looked so good that we couldn't help ourselves.\n\nWe both got cocktails, which were so strong it's like the first sip slaps you silly. They have some interesting flavor profiles in their cocktails, but you definitely acquire the taste after a couple of sips. We ordered the eggplant rollatini and bruschetta (4 different kinds), she had the mini cannoli for dessert and I had the brownie a la mode (me and my chocolate). The eggplant was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The pieces of bruschetta were so big, and each one was cut into 4 pieces which takes 2-3 bites, and they are each loaded with all the goodies they promise. I think my favorite was the smoked salmon, and least favorite was the wild mushroom one, because of the goat cheese. I'm definitely not a fan of goat cheese especially when it is so strong. But my sister loved it. \n\nI was a bit disappointed with my dessert. First, they were out of vanilla ice cream and the closest thing they had to it was birthday cake flavor, so I opted to have that. It was a big piece of brownie and it was warm. Because everything else had been so good, I had high expectations for this brownie. Unfortunately it fell very short of expectation. It was VERY average. I have tasted store bought brownies that were better than this one. But otherwise, I would definitely come here again for appetizers and entrees.
