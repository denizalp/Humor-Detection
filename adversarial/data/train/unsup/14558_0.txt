Super authentic-tasting fish and chips and a meal we enjoyed thoroughly. After living in the UK for a couple of years for school, I've been picky about my fish & chips meals since moving back home to Toronto. I've found very few spots reminiscent of the meals I had there - I\"m happy to say that this is one of the few that mirrors my favourite spots in London!\n\nFIrst, the parking situation. There's limited street parking in the area. However, there is a parking lot behind King's Cafe (which is right across from Fresco's), where parking is $5.00 after 6:00 PM on weekdays (can't recall if this is the situation on weekends as well).\n\nSecond, the service. The chef and the cashier were both so sweet, going as far as asking people to move down a table to make room of us, as we were eating in. Great service, very accommodating. \n\nThird, the food and environment. Super casual, very limited seating. It's a small spot, but they deliver big on flavour. We ordered a fish and chips meal with just 1 piece of fish to try, covered generously in Miss Vickie's potato chip batter - TRY this. Imagine your favourite potato chips mashed up and covering a very delectable piece of meat, and you've got this. The chips don't overpower the fish at all and gives it pretty awesome dimension! Great fish to batter ratio, super crunchy, awesome textures, wonderfully fresh. Sure, it won't do much to decrease your waistline, but the quality of the fish is unmistakeable and coupled with delicious batter, it made for a great meal. The chips were also fine - a little too thick for my liking, but they still paired deliciously with the fish.\n\nGreat meal - definitely a must-try when you're in Kensington Market! For 1 piece of haddock, covered in Miss Vickie's batter, with chips, and coleslaw, we paid $10.12.
