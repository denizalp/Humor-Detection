Great price, Great pizza... they had to make my cheese\/pepperoni large which only took minutes! I was in the area and since we don't have one near us out at the airport I decided to take one home.  It was still hot when I got there! I did order their wings... ; ( like they say stick to what you're good at. Love their pizza.. the fellows working there were all friendly ... For $6 this is the best... the same size with less pepperoni around the airport area is much higher.. So even if you have to wait... be patient its' worth it...
