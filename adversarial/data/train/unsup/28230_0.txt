My endless soup (and salad) took 45 minutes to come to my table at lunchtime!  The waitress was unconcerned about taking care of our table of 4 and instead was more concerned with the table of 15 guys she told us about.  We had to keep asking for our food and repeating our orders!  We thought we ordered the fastest and easiest thing (salad and soup), but this was quite a disappointment.  We were celebrating our friend's birthday and our server never even suggested or offered any dessert or made her feel special in any way!  I would not go here for another birthday celebration.  I have never left such a small tip before in recent memory (10% only).  We had the money and were a mature (not elderly) group, but felt the waitress judged us as less important than the big group she was also waiting on.  Very unimpressive.
