Excellent value on the $20 winterlicious. My second time here and the server handled our large group with ease and professionalism. Didn't mind the 18% auto added for tip. \n\nThe lobster bisque was just as good as I remembered. The steak was excellent, a nice lunch size. 10 skinny beans (?) looked a little sad next to the steak, and the fries were oily... oh well. Desserts were good, nice strong coffee. Happy.
