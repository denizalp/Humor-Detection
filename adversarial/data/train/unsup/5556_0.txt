Excuse my language but this grocery store SH*TS on not just every ethnic grocery store I've ever been to in CA and NV but along with the American grocery stores! Produce, meats, cheeses, the Panader√≠a are FRESH. I was AMAZED by their selection of fresh meats, cheeses and crema! I also love their selection and taste of their fresh salsas and guacamole. It's awesome that they make fresh tortillas there too. It is clean, organized and HUGE. \n\nI freakin LOVE the quality and taste of their cocina! Anything you purchase there is just so delicious. Oh and I love their flan and I definitely want to try their other items at the Panaderia...\n\nThings that suck: it's far from where I live and parking kinda sucks! :P\n\nDefinitely a place you WON'T be disappointed in.
