Went to check in 2 people working and a line. They tried to upsale everything as usual. I was able to get a car and they said since it's my first time I was eligible for an upgrade. I got a brand new Passat . The doors opened and I was able to drive away to my destination fine. The next morning as I am trying to leave the key would not open the door . Dead battery on a brand new car with less than 500 miles on in. They called roadside assistance who opened the door for me asked me to sign and took off. Luckily the hosts of the house I'm staying in stopped by and I was able to get a jump to return this car to the dealership. So I get there and still have to wait for a car it was more than 5 minutes because I set my timer. I spoke to damn near everyone in the customer service and the hospitality here sucks. Then when i tried to get out I couldn't because I didn't have a barcode. So I had to go back to the counter another time. For all this trouble they took $50 honestly it was not even worth the trouble I went through.  They should have sent someone with a replacement car and deal with the no working car themselves. This is the first and last time I will ever use this rental company.
