New York Pizza by New Yorkers...\n\nWhat makes a great pizza? Is it the dough, water or is it that special ingredient that has been passed down generation to generation? \n\nLocated along West Lake Mead and Del Webb rd, House of Pizza will have you wanting that extra slice every time. Ordering the Works pizza to go, I was honestly a little surprised at the layout and effort that has gone into this place. It really does seem like a pizza joint staight out of a corner of the big apple.\n\nThe dough of the pizza was actually one of the best parts, the crust was soft and really had a nice flavor to it. The ingredients seem to be fresh with a decent serving. I will recommend some of the pastries they offer. I'm not sure if they are made onsite or not but the custard pastry was amazing.  \n\nA nice flat screen is on the wall that shows whatever game is on and the soda selection is quite extensive. Also I over heard the owner saying that the recipes were his grandfathers.\n\nNot a bad little find House of Pizza. Service and quality of pizza is something I look forward to eating again soon.\n\nOverall\nFood: 5-5\nService: 4-5\nDrink: 4-5\nComing back: Yes
