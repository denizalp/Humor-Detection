SO MUCH FLAVOR!!! Because they use a crap load of MSG. I was so thirsty after my meal it felt like I had a salt lick for dinner. I can't say it wasn't tasty but not worth downing a gallon of water later. \nThe portions are large, if you need a lot to get full it works. Service is lacking, I saw other tables look around for a server so they could order, it took us a while to wave down someone to ask for extra soup... which seemed to confuse the waitress so she asked our original male server to come back and confirm that we wanted extra soup... he said OK. Near the end of the meal it finally came, we thought they forgot about it and didn't feel like asking again. But load and behold when we got our bill they charged us for the extra soup, if you were going to do that you should of told us. Then we can decide if its worth the charge... and you still brought it at the very end when honestly we didn't even care for it anymore. The food was just OK, nothing great. I doubt we will be back again, there are a lot of better restaurants in the area with better service and less MSG. \n\nIf you have a party over 6 they do auto gratuity and its not marked on the receipt (esp. if you paid with a credit card) that has already been charged so careful on over tipping for soso service.
