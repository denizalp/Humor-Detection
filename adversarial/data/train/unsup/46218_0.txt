I gather this is one of the nicer Anytime Fitnesses out there. The facility is new, and definitely very nice and well taken care of. Plenty of space, and equipment\/machines. The place is kept clean, and they have little wipes all throughout for your convenience, and there's plenty of parking.\n\nThat being said, I joined when they first barely opened, and it was nice to be in a gym that wasn't overcrowded. Now that they've got more members, it gets extremely crowded around the time that I usually prefer to go. In the rare instances that my headphones run out of battery, I enjoy listening to the Zumba instructor yelling at the top of her lungs to \"STEP LEFT AND SHIMMY\".\n\nPersonally, I am used to a gym with more space and more machines. But this is certainly one of the best gyms around the Arcadia area. It's convenient and everyone is extremely friendly. They offer group classes if that's your jam, and they're opening a Protein House right next to it soon!
