I've bought a junkload of furniture at G.H. Johnson's in the past but today I tried to limit myself to only browsing, and man, it was tough. The store is a massive showroom on Dupont that's easily missable as it has no signage (each time I go at least one person getting out of their parked car asks me if I know where it is). \n\nThe showroom is loaded up with gorgeous furniture that would best be suited to a large, roomy space as most of it's pretty big. The kitchen tables are so big they can probably easily seat 12-15 people and they're very rustic looking. Tons of dark brown wood and leather-backed dining chairs. Huge dressers, ornate chaises and bedroom sets - including an ornate goldleaf canopy bed that I've been lemming for months (minus the $2200 price tag). They also have really, really nice mirrors - HUGE ones as well as smaller ones that are unique and beautifully crafted.\n\nYou can often find prices drastically reduced by up to 50%, and on this visit I noticed that they were renovating to include a second floor. As a result, all of the bedding was on sale and I must have spent 30 minutes eyeing a velvet tulip duvet cover from the Nygard collection before deciding it'd be easily findable at a better price. \n\nIt's a family business that's been around for 60 years and features products from its own designers as well as imports from the U.S., Italy, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. There is no pressure to buy and no salesperson breathing down your neck - you can easily stop in and stroll through the showroom without encountering a single employee. Take your time and sit on the sofas, beds and touch things as you please. It's great for getting home decor ideas, too!
