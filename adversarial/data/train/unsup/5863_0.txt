I have bought 3 TVs, ( all Samsung 4K smart 65, 55, 50 inch) 1 sound bar, a security home camera system and a bunch of TV accessories. Never have a problem with any of them. They also have a great staff and great return\/ exchange policies. I highly suggest you check them out before you go buy the same TV\/computer at any other store for way more then they sell them for.
