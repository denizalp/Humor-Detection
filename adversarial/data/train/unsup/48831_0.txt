It was fine but not stellar and certainly not worth the price. The steak was just okay. Longhorn's steak is much better. The truffle Mac and cheese was good but very rich. The French onion soup was great and I would get that again. The service was notable. The only time the waitress smiled was when she brought out the check. She seemed to look down her nose at us the entire time.
