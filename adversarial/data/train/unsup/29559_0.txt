In town visiting a friend.  Asked him to take me to a local place so we ended up here.  Got our beer order quick and then asked to see a menu.  A different waitress took our order of a Caesar Salad and the Steak and Ale Pie.  Eventually after 45 minutes we got our order.  My buddys Caesar Salad was a good size and he enjoyed it.  As for my order, here is the description from the menu \"A British pub classic of tender choice beef, stewed in dark beer and topped with flaky butter pastry.\"  What I got was a small cup of beef stew surrounded by fries.  No flaky butter pastry.  I would have been better off opening a can of stew and microwaving it for 60 seconds.  They also don't provide real utensils, just flimsy plastic.  It took 10 minutes to get the waitress to take our money for our food (had to pay for beer when we got it).  AND as it turns out I was only renting the food as it went through me quicker than a cheap convenience store burrito.\n\nWe were never offered the free popcorn.
