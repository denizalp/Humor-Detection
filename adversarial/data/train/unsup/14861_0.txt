EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in James, owner of Hondatronics. Just bought a used Acura, and after reading positive reviews here & other sites, decided to take my car there to see if I needed to fix\/replace anything. I had no weird noises or anything, just wanted it to get checked out for peace of mind. James checked it out for me & seemed very courteous & helpful, which along with the reviews here instantly put me at ease. He checked out the car, and said everything looked fine, except for my front & right engine mounts which were cracked\/broken. He said this was pretty common on my particular year\/model Acura, and that although no immediate danger to me, I should think about replacing them. Parts\/labor=$560 ($320\/$240).\n\nWell, I bought genuine Honda parts online for $180, and had got a quote from a GREAT SHOP in Henderson (704 W sunset) for $170 tax included to install both engine mounts. Thought I was a champ for figuring out a way to save $210!  Anyways, took it there, and 5 minutes later the mechanic came out & said \"Who told you to change these mounts?? They're both fine.\" He took me under my car to show me both mounts in question, and both looked just like the new parts albeit a little dirty. If I hadn't gone through the trouble and just blindly listened to James @ Hondatronics, I woulda gladly just paid the $560 for something I didn't even need! Sadly, he is the owner, so it's not like I got some unscrupulous worker trying to make a quick buck.  Maybe he is honest MOST of the time, but please-please-please get a 2nd opinion at the very least if he recommends anything other than an oil change. Such a frustrating experience!!!  This bothered me so much that this is my first yelp review...\n\np.s.  Come to think of it, no wonder I was told that I couldn't go and take a look at my car at Hondatronics--there were no broken\/cracked parts to show me!!  I've been taken to the work area for a visual diagnosis at Sam's Club, Midas, Jiffy Lube, and many other shops here in Vegas...
