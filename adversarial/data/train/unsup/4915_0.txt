Ignore the 3.5 stars rating, this place deserves more. \n\nHere's why I think this place got 3.5 stars. Their menu caters to too many groups of people. I would consider the atmosphere and decor to be on the higher end, but if you look at the menu, they have burgers for 12 bucks and a filet mignon steak for 30. While the the old farts around me are trying to enjoy their steak dinner and have a classy conversation, you have me, the jack a-, ordering the burger, talking about Linsanity and eating with my hands. \n\nThey made me uncomfortable and I'm sure I didn't make their dining experience any more pleasant. But you know what? J. Alexander's make tasty food. I went with the Turkey burger with all the fixin'. My classier counterpart- of-a-wife ordered the filet mignon. My turkey burger was well made; juicy and full of flavor. It was topped in fresh baby arugula, tomatoes and wrapped in a fresh baked bun. It also came with a mountain of made to order French fries. Wifey's steak was well made. Her hunk of meat was tagged on all sides with grill marks and looked very presentable. The steak was tender and well seasoned. It also came with a loaded baked potato, which went nicely with the steak. My only complaint is that the potato was twice the size of the steak. I think it should be the other way around. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this joint as a second or third date. It looks nice, good is good, and the prices aren't too steep. \n\nA little about my credentials:\nI first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I continue to enjoy & love food.
