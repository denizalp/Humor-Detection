Came here with a couple of friends and a friend told me this was a real Japanese place.\n\nIt took a little while to get seated.\n\nI noticed poutine on the menu and was shocked that a ramen restaurant would offer poutine. A friend of mine ordered it and four very small plates about 2x2 inches came for the four of us with a set of chopsticks for each of us. The poutine did not have melted cheese and didn't taste very good at all.\n\nService wasn't bad, as soon as the servers notice your drink is getting near empty they're very quick to get you another or refill your drink. (Bottomless drinks are not offered at this location)\n\nThe ramen was okay but nothing special, I ordered mine with chicken and the chicken broth. The broth tasted disgusting, similar to Karen's experience - the broth tasted watered down. Seaweed and an egg - for the side - the egg didn't look appetizing at all, I skipped eating that.\n\nThe bill wasn't rushed and overall it wasn't a great experience.\n\n2\/5 - the extra star is for the service or else it'd be a 1\/5.\n\nWould not recommend.
