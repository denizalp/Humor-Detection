When I walked into the main room and started to browse through the food, scenes of the buffet from Vegas Vacation began to flash through my mind. Remember that scene where Clark is at the buffet and there's blue chicken and yellow beef and his cousin was shoveling that nasty bread pudding into his mouth?\n\nI'm overexaggerating a little, there wasn't any blue chicken, it was green. Just kidding....but I'd rather die than come back here again.
