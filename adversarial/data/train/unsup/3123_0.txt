My initial experience with this library was poor. My family just moved here, we will only be here temporarily and we get all of our utility bills electronically - all of which posed immense barriers to getting a library card. We were, initially, turned away from getting a card and I left with a crying child. I'm checking out a book not priceless diamond jewelry! After scrounging up proof that we would not be leaving hastily in the night with a car full of library books - we obtained an elusive library card.\n\nThis library does have a nice children's section and it has several copies of popular books. The kids section also has Legos, puzzles and cool activities for the kids to play with. We have also taken advantage of the family story time on Thursdays and Ms. Ellen is a gem! Our two kiddos love attending and look forward to it each week. \n\nI cannot speak to any other aspects of the library.\n\nOverall, a nice library with good kid amenities. I'm still miffed about our initial experience but I'm a mature adult and am moving on.....sort of.
