This is my favorite library & lucky for me its about a 5 minute walk from home. \n\nI had stopped reading for a little while and then decided no more! I needed my face in a book. I stopped by this beautiful library and checked out the 'Staff Picks'. I found a great book  titled Where We Belong by Emily Giffin. I  finished the book in 2 days. \n\nOver the next 2 weeks, I had finished 6 books that Ms Giffin had wrote-- all are awesome by the way! One was \"Something Borrowed\" which actually was made into a movie & is listed as the last great book that I read on my Yelp About Me. I still have to see the movie.... which I'm sure this Carnegie Library also has. \n\nSpeaking of movies, the movie section is more than decent. I rented the Hangover II a few days before going to see the 3rd one back in May (needed a quick re-cap before the new one ) , so that says something about how recent their selection is. Not bad at all. (on that note, can I say that the 1st one was the absolute best. Although I do say 'Chow so cold' a little more often than the normal person) \n\nAnother great thing about the library is that there is room for everyone! There are multiple places to use a computer  (2 rooms upstairs, multiple computers in the hallway, the teen section, the children's section, ect-- Of course the teen and children's section are reserved for that age group)\n\nSometimes on Mondays, I'll bring my 3-year-old niece over here and we sit for story time! Afterwards, she has fun picking out books and playing kid-friendly games on the computer. \n\nThis library is truly beautiful.. and gigantic!
