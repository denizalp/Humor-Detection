Perla is awesome at what she does!  My hair is going gray & lifeless and Perla was able to give me a great cut that enhanced my features and a color that took years off my look.  I followed Perla from her previous salon at Bombshell and the experience is definately worth it.  She takes her time, does a great job and makes you feel so comfortable.  She is a sweetheart and just a really nice person.  I would recommend her for anyone looking for a great cut & color.  Thanks again Perla!
