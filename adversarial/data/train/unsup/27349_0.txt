2\/26\/2016  I picked this Mexican Restaurant by random. The place was large, clean, and the decor was nice and had a comfortable feel.  I was seated promptly and my order was taken quickly and some chips, and a medium, and hot salsa, was provided.  Some of the chips were heated while some were not.  I was not impressed with the salsa as it tasted as if it came from a can of generic salsa.  I ordered the beef burrito with rice and beans ($9.99) and a Diet Coke.  The food came out at a reasonable time and the server was friendly and attentive.  The burrito had more beans and very little meat.  I was not impressed.  The beans and rice were OK but not much flavor and could be compared to Taco Bell.  The server did ask me if everything was OK.   I was not impressed with the meal even though I nodded my head, \"Yes\".  My meal came to $11.75.  I gave a 25% tip and left.  The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and was a step up from most Mexican restaurants and to be fair, this was my only experience there and I have a feeling that other menu choices may be better and I might give them another try but what I ate during this visit was not memorable and I would be apprehensive to recommend the Beef Burrito.
