I stop by this location at least once a month for a couple bakers dozens to go boxes.. at 8:30am they typically have several boxes ready to go and if they don't they have them ready by the time you get to the register.\n\nI go for the popular flavors instead of picking my own, if you have favorites they will definitely let you pick.\n\nI choose two cream cheese tubs .. strawberry, blueberry, garlic, garden, jalape√±o, low fat and regular ..  they put knives and napkins in the box for you and you are on your way.\n\nMy office and the customers I deliver these two always enjoy them! \n\nStaff is efficient, plenty of parking and seating inside and on the patio.
