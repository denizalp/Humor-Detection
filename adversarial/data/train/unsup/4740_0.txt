I was on vacation in Vegas and called Go Gadgets. They said it would be $250 to repair my screen on my Note 5 so I took it to them. When I went to pick it up they informed me they had broken my back glass on the phone and would give me a $10 discount. Are you OUT OF YOUR MIND. I finally got them to take $40 off after much struggle. Sad thing is, I used to refer these guys to customers when I worked for T-Mobile. No thank you!!! You guys are crooks and shouldn't be repairing peoples phones if you don't know what you're doing. NEVER AGAIN!!!! Take my word and don't GO!!!!!
