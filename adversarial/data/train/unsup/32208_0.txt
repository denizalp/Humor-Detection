When we went to paint our eves we found damaged fascia and damaged decking.  TRM came out right away.  Gave a very fair quote and delivered on the repair quickly.  Gave honest opinion on the rest of the roof and gave me options.  Very fair and honest and fast.  Easy communication and came out exactly as scheduled.  Thanks TRM!
