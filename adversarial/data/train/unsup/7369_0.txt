If you're looking for authentic Korean food with crisped rice in hot pots, sizzling grills, and very attentive service (well I don't know if that's standard, just my experience), this is not the place for you, that's not what Miyagi's is offering.\n\nAfter what, a year of waiting, we stopped in on a Saturday to a fairly empty (minus the bar) space and were handed a menu that looks very similar to the one posted, but it did have some additions. We were immediately notified they were out of the Bulgogi... what?? So I ordered a ginger salad and the bibimbop (sub tofu - apparently you can sub tofu, chicken, or shrimp for the beef), my dining partner ordered the bbq salmon. \n\nGinger dressing was good, but a little on the oily side. Then, eating the (beautifully plated) bibimbop, I again became very aware that every bite was coating my mouth and lips with oil. Not the most appetizing. The tofu was tasty, as was about half the of the bowl - the kimchi seemed of the jarred variety, and honestly, I've had better. The salmon was pretty delicious, and cooked to our liking. The sticky rice was the same as the sticky rice in the bottom of my bowl, scooped on the plate from a larger vat - and the veggies with the salmon tasted alright, but were mushtastic. \n\nOur server was there as much as he could be as the only guy on the floor and tables starting to fill up. We did have to stand at the door awkwardly for a bit before we were seated, and we noticed other groups had to do the same because he either didn't see them right away or was just busy. \n\nOverall - if I want authentic Korean, I'll take myself elsewhere. But, to eat something different in NoDa I'll be back. I'd like to give their sushi a chance, and their sriracha bloody mary's. Plus, some of their appetizers sounded pretty good. I think they've changed some prices too, my bibimbop was only $10, and the salmon was $13.
