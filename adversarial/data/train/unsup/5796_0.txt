To anyone considering coming here:  make sure you read all of the 1-2 star reviews because they will give you a clear picture of what this place is like.\nAs Mark P. wrote on 08\/08\/2015:  \"Went by dash vapes to pick up some juice and a new rda. Was standing in the store for around 5-7 mins just wating for one of the employees to say something to me. They seem to be to busy with there mech mods and trying to blow clouds and vape tricks. The staff seem to be there to hang out rather then to inform people and help them find something that works for them.\"\nThis is a common theme amongst all of the 1-2 star reviews and, unfortunately, it happened to me as well.\nI work on Front Street and I thought that I could do the 10-15 minute walk and go there during my 1 hour lunch break to pick up some bottles of ejuice. (My brother actually saw an ad about Dashvapes and asked me to check it out to see what it was like.)  So, I get there and as soon as I step foot inside, the vibe I got can only be described as \"accidentally walking into someone's house where there were a bunch of people standing around in the kitchen having a conversation\". It was super awkward and I should have went with my gut, turned right around and left.  But, I thought, \"What the heck? I walked all the way over here so I might as well give it a go anyway. (And I really needed some juice.)\"  So, I sit down @ the bar and start trying some juices but it felt extremely uncomfortable -- like I was an uninvited guest @ a party drinking someone's alcohol right in front of them.  No one really acknowledged me (I think someone actually just said: \"Hey.\" and handed me a rubber drip tip, but only when I asked for one, and then went back to their conversation) and didn't offer to help me @ all.  The whole time I'm thinking:  \"Should I be here?\"\nAnyway, after about 10-15 minutes of trying some juices, I select 3 different flavours and I start looking to get any staff member's attention (2 people were hanging out with\/serving customers\/friends; and 2 people were going back and forth from the front to the back room).  Finally, I manage to flag a guy down (he was coming out of the back room and seemed regretful that he had made eye contact with me because it now meant he had to serve me) and I let him know that I wanted to buy some juice.  I tell him my 3 flavours, the nic level, and the bottle size (30ml).  He says, \"Ok, no problem. I'll go get it for you.\"  He disappears to the back room (so I think he's getting my juices), and after about 5-6 minutes steps out of the back room empty-handed, walks over to his co-worker who is by the cash and has a full-on conversation with him; and when he's finished with that conversation, he then decides to have a different conversation with his other co-worker (who is a few feet away by the juices) about some DIY kit.  I'm watching\/looking @ the guy like:  \"What's going on? Did he forget about me?\" and when he finally notices me looking @ him strangely, I think I actually saw a lightbulb go off in his head and he says to me:  \"Oh yeah, you wanted those juices, right?\"\nAt that point I said:  \"Actually, you know what? It's ok; forget about it. I'm on my lunch break right now and I have to get back to work.\"  And he says:  \"No no, I just have to go to the back room, mix them up and bring them out here. It'll take about 5 minutes.\" But @ this point, I'm thinking:  \"I have to walk back to work and this guy's idea of 5 minutes will probably be more like 15 minutes and I'll be late getting back to work.\" So I say:  \"No, it's ok. I'll come back when I have more time.\" And as I said this, he and his co-workers are looking @ me with blank, incredulous stares like:  \"What? You can't wait 5 minutes? What's your problem?\"\nI walk out of there and I think to myself:  \"Did that just happen?! No way I am going back there.\"\n\nThat is the first time I've ever gone into a retail business establishment and felt totally unwelcome and ignored. It was bizarre. When I thought about it, it was actually pretty sad.  (As a result of this experience, I actually would much rather take the streetcar to Queen & Spadina where you can find other vape shops that are much more helpful and friendlier.)\n\nI can't really end this negative review \"negatively\" so on a positive note:  if you're a masochist, you'll love it here and feel right @ home because the staff @ Dashvapes really know how to make you feel like crap.  Win-Win.\n\n** UPDATE - in response to Shai B:  Yes, that is how it happened -- he took my order, went to the backroom, stayed there for a few minutes, came back out, hung out with his two colleagues, and then remembered that he was tending to me. If your business process is \"- Customer submits their order and pays for the order with a staff member\" then he did not do that; I did not pay first. Regardless, I'm not coming back that's for sure. Bye!
