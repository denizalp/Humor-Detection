I had the C'Fleur de self and the ham and cheese crepe. I ordered milk chocolate for the hot chocolate (you have a choice of milk, 50%, or 70% chocolate). I have to say it was the best hot chocolate I have ever had.  Our waiter was attentive and very nice. My husband had the Rocky Mountain waffle and enjoyed it very much. I highly recommend this place.
