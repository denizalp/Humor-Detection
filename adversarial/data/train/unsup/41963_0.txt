Love Dr. Haralson, he gets 5 stars. Doesn't make you feel rushed so he can move on to the next patient. In fact I've seen several of the doctors here and they have all been wonderful. Really like the doctors here. \n\nThe one star is for the lack of communication with staff. Last week needed a script refilled and when I tried to pick up at pharmacy they informed me it was denied I needed an appt. Doctor Wolfson's office never called to inform me of that. So I called to schedule an appt and get another refill bc I would be out before my appt. I was told they would call it right in. Had to call them back 4 times that day and once the following day before they actually communicated to my pharmacy to fill it.\nDay of appt full reception room which is fine but I waited an hour past my appt time. This sort of delay should immediately be communicated to us patients. I can not schedule my whole day around one appt that is running behind. If you can't get a morning appt first thing wait time past your appt is almost guaranteed to be an hour. But the staff doesn't inform you of this and makes sure to collect your copay shortly into your wait so you stay. The wait is ridiculous. They need to practice better scheduling bc an hour is unacceptable.
