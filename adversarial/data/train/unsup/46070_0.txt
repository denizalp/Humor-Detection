My new favorite bike shop.  \n\nIt's the closest shop to my house, so I figured I'd stop in and have them take a look at my wife's mountain bike that had been sitting for a couple of years.  They did great work and although they could have legitimately charged us for the full tune-up (which is what I had brought it in for), they looked it over and made sure everything was working right, cleaned it up, and charged us $15.  Nice.  \n\nSo I brought in a road bike I had sitting around and needed it tuned up for a race I was planning to enter.  It needed a lot of work (tubes, tires, hoods, brakes, adjustments, cleaning, bar tape, and a bunch of other little stuff).  They had it up and running in no time and at a price I thought was completely reasonable for what I got.  \n\nSo naturally, when my wife bought a road bike and needed it assembled, we didn't think twice about where we were bringing it.  And again, they did a great job.\n\nThanks Build a Bike!  It's great knowing that we can rely on you guys to treat us right and do great work.
