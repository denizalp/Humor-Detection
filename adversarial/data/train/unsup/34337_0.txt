I went out to Lake Las Vegas with my girlfriend today and decided to go paddle boarding. We have never done it before so we were a little worried. Zoltan (the guy working there) was very helpful and nice. After signing a waiver and paying, his partner showed us all the basics of paddle boarding and gave us all the proper instructions necessary. These guys are pro at what they do. We were way more confident to go out on the beautiful lake and explore. After coming back once our hour was done he let us know the second hour was only $15 extra so we decided to stay. It was a blast. Definitely going to be coming back way more! Had a very good first experience.
