My hubs and I were at the Living Room yesterday for brunch and had the best experience out of the handful of times we've been here. \nThis was my first time here for brunch. I saw a promotion on Facebook for a buy an entree and get one free. Hannah was our server. She was fantastic! She was light hearted and attentive. During brunch Korbe Canida was performing -playing a guitar and singing. It made the ambiance and experience so delightful! \nWe had the breakfast egg sandwich and the nutella and banana crepes. Both were good!\nI look forward to coming back for brunch.\n\nThe reason I have 4 stars instead of 5- the other times I've been here the service was slow, the food was just ok and the overall experience was just eh. I know there is new management so maybe the evening vibe is better. I will have to come back and update my status. =)
