A month or so ago, Discount Tire came to my rescue. Back in August 2009 I bought 2 brand new runflats for the rear of my car back in Pennsylvania from another company. Given all the construction in Arizona, it was only a matter of time until something got in my tires. Long story short I found a nail in my barely used tires.\n\nI drove in to Discount Tire, and after a quick look at my car, they told me to wait in their waiting area. When the gentleman came back from the repair bay, I was expecting a medium sized bill to repair my tire... but he told me it would be $9 or so. I was shocked... apparently their policy is that they plug tires for free. The 9 dollar fee was for the new TPMS valve (which is advertised on the poster behind them... which he kindly pointed out during our transaction). \n\nI recommend Discount Tire, especially this location!
