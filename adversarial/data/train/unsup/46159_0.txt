Arthur Murray truly has the best most professional dance instructors.  I have been taking lessons here for five years, three of them with Andrew.  I have learned so much with Andrew and feel so much more confident in social dance, thank you!  Andrew is patient, detailed and has a great sense of humor which is good because I'm not a natural.  Thanks Arthur Murray and Andrew!
