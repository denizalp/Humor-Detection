There was all kinds of violence on this campus. Oh wait, no, that's Carnage Mellon.\n\nThe school has beautiful grounds and grand buildings, but it's far too expensive to attend. I visited (along with U Pitt) for the first time when I was looking for a Uni to attend. And many times since. Just too expensive. Like your mother. \n\nThis is a beautiful University in an absolutely beautiful city. I've been on this campus more times than I can count. I prefer the nearby U Pitt campus but this one is pretty awesome as well. Many of the people that go here (or have graduated) think they are a lot better than Pitt and perhaps in some ways they are right, but in terms of the food options on campus nothing can compare to Bigelow Boulevard next to Pitt, and the amazing India On Wheels truck. \n\nIn terms of the beauty of the campus it's more of a close call. You'll have to visit both places and decide for yourself. Much like I visited both of your sisters and am still in the process of deciding.
