I've been wanting to come to this new place for a while now since they opened, so today marks my first visit, and probably my last!\nThis place is so convenient, as it's close to my residence, but I was not that impressed at all.\nStarting with the decor and setup, the place is a bit confusing, the exterior ives me an impression of a high end sports bar, but once you go in, you wouldn't know where you at! You might be in a sports bar? A fine dining? A family restaurant?\nThen on to a confused menu without an actual category\/cuisine, a bit Italian, to sandwiches, to burgers, to fine steaks to pizzas to Indian dishes? You guys should think about it, find a certain path and stick to it.\n\nNow to the food quality, which is \"just about okay\", portions ate also okay but not too big , which is expected from a sports bar setup? Taste is very mediocre.\nAlso prices are not cheap! Our bill came up to over $50 per person! With no alcohol, which is tooo steep for a place like this.\n\nService is the worst part of the whole experience, all staff seem amateur and too young to handle this restaurant...\nThe host was professional and friendly, but the waiter was not, he was unprofessional and not friendly at all..\nHe even had to say NO to replacing french fries with onion rings on an appetizer! Then after telling him to go check he went and came back saying okay, but we'll charge you $2!! Comeon!! A brand new place, you should be building up your customer base rather than nickelling and dimeing!!\nAnother part is the girls' uniform at this place which is very inappropriate for a family dining restaurant, if that's their target crowd at least!\nUnfortunately, would not visit back!
