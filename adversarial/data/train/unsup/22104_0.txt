Walked in this evening about 6:15 excited to check it out and have a beer. What a waste of time! While it was busy, we managed to find two seats at the bar......and that is where our experience ended. I made eye contact TWICE with the bleach blonde bartender, a waitress or bartender with brown hair ...AND two male bar-backs\/bartenders(?)...and NOTHING!  The two women thought the EMPTY table behind us... and the empty glasses on the bar required more attention than the two customers at the bar that were hungry and thirsty! TEN minutes later we walked out. A word of advice lady bartenders...just because I am a female....and am not checking out your ass & chest doesn't mean I don't tip well! Your loss.....and I will be sure to tell EVERYONE I know NOT to bother visiting your place of employment!
