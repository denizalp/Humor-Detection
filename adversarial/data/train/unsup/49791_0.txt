After we finished eating, the waitress sent in the bill. I didn't check the detail, and gave her my credit card. A minute later she came back with the slip for me to sign. Everything seemed normal so far. But then friends were having a conversation at the table at the time, so I didn't sign it right away. As I took my time to take a look at the bill before I signed, the waitress immediately came and told me, \"No worries. You don't have to sign. It's been taken care of.\" as she tried to take the slip away from me. Turns out, she already faked the tip in writings on the slip, and she charged tips on my card already. I had to demand her to give me back the slip before I removed the tip completely and signed my name. I was going to tip her in the first place but this fraudulent and stealing behavior completely ruined our experience. The food is fine but I will NOT come back again for such low practice!!!
