Awesome Mac & Cheese!\n\nSITREP\n\nI have to give mad props to both my Vegas Yelp-buds Anthony and Jade since they turned me onto the GREAT CHEEESY establishment BFG Chicken Strips while I was hangin with them in Vegas for the Yelp Convention back in May 2012.\n\nTHE MAC MENU\n\nMac N' Cheese here is TRULY an ultimate \"Classic American Eats\", as a SIDE dish OR get a BUNCH like I did at just under $2 a pop, and why not? - I took them back to my hotel room at the Stratosphere one late night and make it a MAIN dish.  Mmmm, delish!\n\nSPECIAL PREPARATION!\n\nBFG Chicken Strips meets a cheesaholic's strict-standards of \"cheesification\".  They make incredible BAKED Mac N' Cheese in individual containers with a Mozzarella Crust!  (HOLY HELL.  I feel my arteries hardening with joy just thinking about this festive cheesapalooza!)\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nIf you are looking for a Mac n' Cheese fix, look no further.
