A friend who regularly visits Charcut brought me to show off the restaurant of a third place Top Chef Canada contender.\n\nI first sat at the bar and perused the drink menu - I'm aware I'm going to pay upper scale prices for upper scale food, service, and ambience, but I don't like having to pay 8$ for a bottle of 2$ beer. They do have an impressive list of bottles to choose from, including some that are harder to find IPAs.\n\nThe table and menu looked good but it didn't really matter because of our terrible, terrible server.\n\nI'll throw out some of his comments:\n\nHim: \"I see you're on your phone so you must be not very interested in what I'm saying right now\"\nUs: \"wtf?\"\n\nHim: \"I think we got off on the wrong foot\" \nUs: \"huh?\"\nHim: \"I feel like there is nothing I can do to please you\"\nUs: \"wtf?\"\n\nAnd then trying to rush us out with half a bottle of wine left: \"Should I bring out some coffees and the bill?\"\n\nHe seemed to get really offended when we made a joke about the beets that one a round on Top Chef when they came hidden under a pile of arugula - as if we had slapped his mom in the face. Super uncomfortable. \n\nIt was so weird- he was awkward and impolite to us the whole night.\nHe then told us he \"was very ancy to leave so someone else would be taking over for him\", which we were elated to hear. We told our new server about the other dude's extreme strangeness\/rudeness and he said he had an off personality and apologized. I would have liked to have seen maybe a comped dessert\/coffee\/app or really anything...because when you're looking at a 150$ bill and all you can talk about is how awful your service was for 90% of the night...it's not a great feeling.\n\nMy DC told me that had never happened to her on other visits to the restaurant, but I wouldn't recommend going back based on this experience.\n\nPS:\nThe steak and chicken were both quite good!
