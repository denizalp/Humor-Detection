My wife and I were married on December 11th and due to both being hospital employees could not get honeymoon time off together until early April.\n\nWe decided to book a 5 star Cancun vacation with Sunwing because they were one of few companies offering 5 night vacations out of Toronto for a good price.\n\nWe ended up selecting Sens Del Mar as our hotel because they advertised a special honeymooner package procured simply by presenting a wedding certificate dated within the last six months at check in.\n\nThis package included VIP check in with cocktail, free upgrade to best room available, fruit plate and bottle of sparkling wine in room, romantic dinner for two with bottle of wine, and something else that is slipping my mind.\n\nDespite simply saying to present certificate at check in, we still emailed ahead for the honeymoon package and did not receive any response.\n\nUpon arriving 3 hours early to check in for our flight, we requested the favour of exit row seating due to me being 6'9\" and us being on our honeymoon. We were informed that we could have the upgrade, for $40 a piece just like everyone else.\n\n\nAfter boarding the flight and me having to hang my legs in the aisle, we were told by the flight attendant that we had to move to the exit row because they couldn't get the drink cart down the aisle.\n\nThe bad news? There were not two seats together. I did not get to sit with my wife on the plane on our honeymoon, which was our first vacation and flight together.\n\nUpon arriving to check in, we were ignored for over ten minutes while the staff chatted behind the desk. We were eventually helped, and the hotel claimed no prior knowledge of our honeymoon.\n\nIt is convenient how they on the booking site have no way to inform them, and they also ignore your emails, but you are somehow supposed to let them know.\n\nAfter photocopying our marriage license, we were upgraded. We weren't upgraded to the best room, but simply from street view to ocean view.\n\nThe next morning we met with a Sunwing rep and informed her that we had not received anything promised in our booking. We hadn't even received the bottle of tequila everyone gets from Sunwing at this point.\n\nShe feigned shock and looked into it for us. She came back to let us know that this was all news to the hotel, and they needed a copy of our marriage license, which they had already copied 12 hours previous.\n\nThe sunwing rep promised to get back to us with the rest of our package. We eventually got a tequila bottle from her in the room the next day, but otherwise never saw or heard from her again.\n\nOn the trip home, we spent 90 min in the airport waiting to check in. When we finally checked in, we found out the flight was delayed another 90 minutes for unspecified reasons.\n\nOnce we finally got boarded, I found out to my delight that the Sunwing agent had assigned me a middle seat at 6'9 265 and my wife a window seat for a 3.5 hour full flight. A 5'0 french speaking lady was given the aisle and refused to trade because her friend was sitting across the aisle.\n\nWe then sat for 2 hours on a full plane while waiting for a repairman to take his time showing up to repair a chair that would not stay upright so that we could leave. During this time, a flight attendant remarked as to how uncomfortable I looked but no assistance was given whatsoever to remedy my visible discomfort.\n\nAfter being wedged in that chair for 5.5 hours, we finally got home with my entire body in pain. I have a picture of myself jammed into the middle seat for reference. I emailed sunwing to complain about how poorly we were treated on our honeymoon and was returned an auto response letting me know that my email would be addressed in 4-6 weeks.\n\n\nNever again, Sunwing. Their employees had their hands out for tips the entire trip but did absolutely nothing to ensure their clients had the experience they were even promised, let alone even think of trying to go above and beyond to make a monumental trip memorable.
