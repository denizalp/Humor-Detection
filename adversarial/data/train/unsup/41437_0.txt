I debated against whether to give this place a rating of 3 or 4, but 3 seems a little unfair given that food delivered, and the only thing that bugged me was the fact that I couldn't drink\/enjoy my spicy ramen soup. I think I'll go for level 1 next time. \n\nService was great despite being on a Friday dinner rush evening; the lady tending to us was patient and friendly, polite, and all smiles. She made sure to check up on us from time to time for tea refills and there was no need to flag her down for service whenever we needed something. \n\nI'd definitely come back, it's a nice little ramen shop, small space-wise, but good food. Definitely warrants a second visit.
