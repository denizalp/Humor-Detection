I am renting a apartment right now from premier Property Management and I have to say that I've never felt more safe with it just be me and my daughter. I am just going through a divorce so this is mine and my daughter's first home together we are starting over from scratch everyone has been so helpful the area is amazing when I moved in it was a couple problems with the apartment and I notified premier Property Management and they fixed it right away. The staff has bent over backwards to make this experience be as rewarding as possible and I would tell many of my friends and family to go through them. They are five stars in my book.
