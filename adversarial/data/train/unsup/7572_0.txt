Due to the lack of lighting at this apartment complex, please make sure you get ADT, security bars and an AK47 upon moving in if you don't want your place broken into multiple times. In spite of complaints, the owner is too cheap to put in decent lighting or hire security to patrol the property. Cheapskate owner doesn't have a problem raising the rent and then charging for renter's Ins, water, sewer & trash. Ignore my check-in, hit the wrong button. Don't check-in !
