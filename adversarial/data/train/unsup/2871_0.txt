I travel to Toronto for business quite a bit--Fresh is my first food stop every time. I've made a ritual of getting carry out there and I have not been disappointed yet. Their miso gravy is out-of-this-world good as is the \"Ninja Bowl.\"\n\nI want to try other things on the menu, but I'm stuck on my faves. The only downside is the wait--I never seem to account for how long it takes them to get my order ready.
