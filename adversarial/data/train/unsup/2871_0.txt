Not cool security at entrance were the biggest dicks ever and trying to skim money off guests under the table.  Refused to let us in without paying under the table cash,  we were guests at hotel which means you get in for free.  \n\nMen in club were beyond aggressive.  I was grabbed by the neck and throat on 2 separate occasion by men of 2 different groups when walking away and saying I wasn't interested in talking more or getting a drink.\n\nIf you go here bring a strong group of friends and stick with them as a female.\n\nI had only 1 drink because I felt super uncomfortable and borderline unsafe.\n\nAlways watch your drink being made had several offers to have a hand mixed drink that I couldn't see made at VIP tables.\n\nThere were several groups of guys onto seriously sketchy scene and propositions.\n\nDon't recommend this club.
