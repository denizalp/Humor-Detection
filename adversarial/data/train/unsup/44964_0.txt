If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.  My wife and I had the three course meal during restaurant week.  Every course was amazing.  Starters burrata y procuitto and the Dolce salad,  mains parpadelli bolognese and the gnocchi in tomato cream and for dessert the marscapone cheese cake and lemoncello cake.  From start to finish the meal and service was outstanding.  The owner is really hands on making sure everything is spot on.  Will definitely be back to try the expanded menu they offer not during restaurant week.
