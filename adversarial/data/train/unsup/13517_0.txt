2.5 STARS would have been a perfect rating.\n\nFOOD: As far as I'm concerned, the best thing available at Cafe Roma are the calzones. The cazlones' cheese, sauce, and bread are all pretty good. They are huge and decently priced. One calzone could feed two non-starving people. I usually have to struggle to finish one. Other dishes are decent, but nothing to come back for. \n\nPRICE: A calzone and a drink cost about $9-10. \n\nATMOSPHERE: It's a typical low-cost Italian restaurant. TV's in the corners, music playing in the background, a couple decorations on the walls. Good place for lunch or modest dinner. \n\nSERVICE: Nice people, but they can be almost too helpful at times. Sometimes they come by the table four times during the meal to ask if everything is alright. Sometimes I want to shout, \"Yes! Everything is wonderful, now leave us alone!\" They know I get the calzone every time I go there, it's a cool feeling to have that regular status.\n\nSKINNY: Try the calzone, I think its pretty good. If it's not good, then I'm sorry I wasted all this time writing this review only to lead you astray.
