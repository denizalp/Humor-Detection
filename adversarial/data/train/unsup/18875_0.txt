This place was clean, cute, and filled with pastries. My main complaint is that it's titled a coffee shop, but it really lacks in a selection of coffee. All the beverages are from a fountain including iced tea. The coffee selection was decaf or caffenated. Yeah, it might sound picky, but I truly expected a variety based off the name. \n\nPrices are similar to Dennys. I spent 12 dollars for an eggs Benedict and a fountain tea. The food was pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the ham used, but it was good enough. The cook did a good job constructing a beautiful plate. My waiter was honest when answering my questions. He told me that the title coffee shop means 24 hour breakfast, which is new to me. \n\nOverall, I'll come back if I am in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place. You can play keno and eat, which is the main distinguishing feature from Dennys lol.
