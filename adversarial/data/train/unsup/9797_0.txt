I guess having lunch here was a fitting way to end my latest Vegas get away: fitting because even this place has a bar.\nDoes every eatery in Vegas serve alcohol?\nBut no big complaints.\n\nOut of all the menu items, I settled on a simply cheeseburger and fries.\nWith all the buffets and Asian eats, I've forgotten how good a burger could taste: seasoned ground beef cooked to perfection with a thick slab of cheddar on a toasted ciabatta bread.\nGood stuff.\n\nThere were a couple other things that did surprise me:\n1) the service was attentive without hovering.  For some reason, I assumed lunch was going to be uncomfortable.  I was pleasantly mistaken.\nand\n2) they serve a popover at the start of the meal and was accompanied with a small plate of strawberry jam and cream cheese.  It was warm and tasty but I wished it was given at the end of the meal because it felt more like a dessert item than starter.\n\nOverall, I liked the NM Cafe.  I don't know if I'll return since my loyalties lie more with my trusty Nordies Cafe.
