What can I say about this place that hasn't been said already? It's VERY hot food. They do have options that aren't as hot, but they don't sound as good. I have finally found a dish that I can eat which is the bean burro. That might sound funny but it's perfectly seasoned whole beans (just like my Suegra used to make).  The tortilla is soft, fresh, warm. It is a perfect specimen of a bean burro. \n\nI might mention, I'm happy I found something I can eat there, because I do love their Coronarita to drink. It really should be called \"the tranquilizer\".
