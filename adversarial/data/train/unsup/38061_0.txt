Went in for an alighnment, Im a disabled veteran .  He says oh its only this much and no problem.  Then half hour later, you need brakes, rotors. Okay, then he does that and say well you should get this this and this.  Paid 485.00.  the very next day the brakes he did LOCKED up and almost Caught on fire.  So I have a tow truck drag it back to Mikes place.  He said oh, not my fault.  So i paid for a caliper and a new brake line.  another 285.00.  Now the thing is grinding so bad im scared to drive it.  Looking into legal action.  Thanks for the SUper car care mike and thanks for Your Promise to me  (LIED).  Forgot to mention the tow was 126.00 and he didn't even blink at that.
