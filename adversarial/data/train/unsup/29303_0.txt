Little cafe on the east side of cave creek north of the 101 freeway.  We live nearby & enjoy the homey atmosphere with decent fresh food.\n\nLast time I got the egg white bagel sandwich  ($7.99) on an everything bagel and a cup of fruit ($1.99).  I really enjoyed the avocado, egg white, ham and melted cheese.\n\nMy hunny got the green chili burger which he ordered medium but it was well done- of course.  He enjoyed the bread.\n\nMinus 1 point for tchotchke hair ties and homemade baby clothes being displayed at hostess area.  This is not a boutique and I suggest you elevate your dining experience by ditching the dust collectors.
