I came to the Boulder City Municipal Airport for a Grand Canyon sightseeing trip with Papillon.  This was the first time I was here and I was impressed.  Greeted at the door, I was then shown to a place to check in for my flight.\n\nI then waited in a comfortable chair with a wonderful view out the windows to the tarmac.  It was wonderful watching the helicopters taking off and landing as well as the prop planes going to the Grand Canyon Airport.\n\nThe facility is modern and clean.  The bathroom was also clean and everything appeared to be rather new.  The only thing was the sound.  When names were called, it was difficult to understand the names being called.\n\nAt my appointed time, I got near the gate and I heard the pilot call my name without the microphone.  I was soon on the tarmac looking back.  Impressive airport and terminal.
