Lew, Lew, Lew! My review for you is long overdue! \n\nMade the trek down I-77 to meet my friends for an all out, no hold barred feast!!\n\nThe hospitality here is awesome - they want you to be happy, eat great food and make you feel loved on!\n\nWe tried just about everything on the menu: Spring Rolls, Fresh Rolls, Tom Ka, Tom Yum, Papaya Salad (super spicy fire alert) and these amazing stuffed chicken wings - holy wow, they were like chicken lollipops!! How did he debone those wings so neatly??!\n\nThe next round came main courses: Green Curry Chicken, Pad Prig with this incredibly flavorful BBQ pork and a very well executed Pad Thai. Really good stuff all around!\n\nNow for the big secret - Lew used to work for Mrs. Smith's (you know, the pie\/dessert company) - he was a baker for years and can taste something and deconstruct and remake it. So when you go to eat here, don't be surprised if the dessert menu has like 12 freshly made baked goods. He knows his stuff. The chocolate Mousse cake is great, but that warm spiced streusel topped homemade pound cake is \"hold the phone you just won a free vacation\" good!
