The best part about Planet Hollywood is the location. Its right in the middle of some of the best hotels and shopping. The casino is pretty basic, they have a restaurant, several bars and tons of machines. Their little gift shop is a great place to stock up on snacks and trinkets. The pool has a huge cement area for laying out in the middle of an adult pool and a family pool. This is a nice budget place to stay at if you are looking to save your dollars but you won't get anything overly impressive.
