Nothing Special\n\nCulvers is an decent place to grab a good lunch or dinner.  However, I didnt find anything special or spectacular.\n\nCulvers offers some different items from the ordinary burger shops.  Today, I had a grilled chicken sandwich and french fries and cost about $8. I guess Culver's has better fast food  than most other fast food restaurants but nothing I would go out of the way for. \n\nAll in all I guess it's a nice change of pace from the typical,  Wendy's or McDonald's.  Maybe, next time I will spluge and try one of the Ice cream treats look very good.
