Worst Good Earth ever!! Anywhere!\nI ordered a latte and got a crappy cup of coffee with no where near enough milk. I tried to bring it up with the older, very miserable 'barista' but he persisted to argue with me that he knew more than I did. Apparently I should have ordered a cappuccino instead of a latte! Ha! I suppose I know nothing about a proper latte...\nI asked why it was so different to all the other Good Earths I have been to. Just silly, angry responses and that it was me- not him. \nHe just does not get it. Next two customers were told how 'he had to charge full price' for a latte that has a tiny shot of skim milk. Don't waste your time here. I am disappointed as I just moved into the area but I won't go back to the Richmond location. I feel sorry for the owners, especially if it is him as he has no clue.
