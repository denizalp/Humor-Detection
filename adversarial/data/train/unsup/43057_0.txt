Given that this is in the heart of the entertainment district, people come here before and after shows in the area. We had reservations for earlier in the evening, and the place was completely empty so we had our pick of the entire place. I don't recommend this place for those dressed casually as the place definitely projects class.\n\nI'm afraid I can't say as much for the food on the other hand. Nothing really stands out here, everything is safe Italian \"inspired\" cuisine that's mildly seasoned, lacking the soul of traditional Italian. They try really hard to impress, and I give them an A for effort  but the food falls flat here. \n\nRecommendations\n\n- Browse the exceptional wine list\n- Tiramisu
