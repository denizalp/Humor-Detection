I am not sure I understand what the hype is all about. I had a pulled chicken platter with baked beans and vinegar slaw and everything was mediocre at best. The pulled chicken was greasy and bland, and was covered in a tasteless sauce (Why even bother putting BBQ sauce on the table?). The slaw had no flavor, and the beans were adequate, but a bit mushy. I have had good bbq all over the country, but this makes Tony Roma's or Dickies look excellent in comparison.
