a bachelorette party visit to scarpetta was by happenchance.  ok, i was wearing sky high heels and since there is no golf cart service to shuffle the ladies around...i canceled the she\/morton rezzies for new ones at scarpetta which the group agreed to after checking out all the lovely shoes at the cosmopolitan!  \n\nplus who doesn't want to dine in style with housemade pasta?\n\ni think the folks here were trained at the school of Le Bernadin since they were on pointe with service.  you aren't supposed to notice how many interactions you actually have but they scored big.  i notice but i'm a foodie fanatic.\n\nLOVED that they gave white napkins for white dresses and black napkins for dark dresses.  the ladies can attest to the lint nightmare.  \n\nboo!: ask for a view! i failed to so we didn't have the bellagio view. (for next time).\n\nbread:\ninsert triple toe curl for the bread selection and i'm not a gluten freak.  i would make out with the pastry chef just for the bread alone.\n\nappetizers and entrees:\n- the bride to be was in bliss with her veal duo.\n- i loved my foie gras pasta - it was not salty like other yelpers have mentioned. and i'm sodium sensitive.\n- every gal pretty much loved their dish from short rib to lobster pasta.\n- the only mini ding was that the calamari was way too spicy for my liking.\n\nwine list is lovely and affordable for vegas.  \n\nwe would have stayed longer for more foodie adventures but our  group had more stops to make that night.  scarpetta is a solid date night spot or whenever you want to be pampered.\n\ntip: the lighting is kind on the eyes.  no botox required.
