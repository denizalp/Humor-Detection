When I'm at the Westside Market you will find me standing in line for one of Frank's Bratwurst. I like to keep it simple so I can enjoy the flavors of the bratwurst. You definitely want to enjoy this on the fresh hard roll it is the only way to go, don't worry about it being too hard or tough it's always fresh, tender with just enough chew to the roll add a little mustard and walk way so you won't be tempted to order another. Ordered plain its $3.50 you'd be hard pressed to find a better one at any price.
