My new FAV place!  Most of you would know this restaurant perhaps by Gordon Ramsey's aired episode on Kitchen Nightmares - but NO nightmare here!  Amy's food is AMAZING!  The absolute BEST hummus I have ever eaten!  Everything we ordered was amazing all the way through the desserts!  Everything was so great we bought her cook book!  Besides the great food, Samy and Amy were extremely kind and went out of their way to make it a great experience!  Ladies and gentlemen this is why we don't believe everything we watch on TV!  If you pass by here you need to stop because it is an amazing place!  Thanks Amy and Samy for a great experience!  You definitely have an art and talent!
