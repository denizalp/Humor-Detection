happy dogs are here \nhot dog extravaganza \ntater tot tail wag. \n\n\nCool,cool,cool. Lot's of beer, live music, a Friday Polka Happy Hour! Young and hip crowd, Dogs with 50 hot dog toppings. FIFTY! ...but no char-dogs... boo hoo... \nActually, the hot dogs are good. Kinda big, so you can't eat two and really get into the garnishes. The meat itself has that nitrate filled goodness that only mechanically separated meat products can provide. A bit salty, I'd give 'em a solid \"7\", but if they were charred, a \"9\" would be within reach. And yes. There are tater tots deep fried to a golden, amber like crust.  Crunchy on the outside, for excellent ketchup retention.\n\nCarry on.
