As many of you know, I've fallen hard for the Coconut- almond French toast served at both locations.  (The original is at Gainey Ranch, on Scottsdale Rd, just south of Doubletree Ranch Rd.)  I usually order two or more entrees (perhaps an app and an entree,  or an app and two or more entrees if Mom's [1] with me) just so that I can try something new, while not feeling like I missed out on my favorite.\n\nToday, I came in six minutes before the kitchen was about to close- I work late shifts, so I usually don't get out of bed till around 1 pm!- so around 2:54 pm, almost starving, as I'd just finished cardio and strength-training before freshening up and taking the lovely walk up to THK.  Everyone greeted me a warm welcome, and Fallon, who I usually find working the bar, took my order of a cappuccino, which she made herself, and told me in passing that the kitchen was closing in five minutes, so be sure to put in my order very soon.  I contemplated on ordering the Savory Breakfast Tart along with my French toast fave, but didn't want to overburden the kitchen as it already was almost-closing time.  Same instructions as always, \"extra bananas and no powdered sugar, please!,\" I said to another staff member, who placed the order on the bar's computer.\n\nFallon soon brought out a darling cappuccino, and the texture and flavor (no sweetener) were delightful! https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale-2?select=r5hZnwMSPJeZX4qdU3hf4g  It blended perfectly with the French toast when it finally made its way to the counter.  It took awhile, arriving around 3:13 pm, with powdered sugar [2] sprinkled from one end to the other.  I spoke up, because my corn allergy,  like 99% of my food allergies, is very cumbersome.  The runner took it back to the kitchen for a remake, and I spoke to Fallon, who was still doing closing chores behind the bar, and the managers on duty- Ivo and Adrian- and told them I had to send the toast back and asked if I should just go home, since I don't want to delay the kitchen staff from doing their duties back there and was told by Fallon and Adrian that it wouldn't be a problem and that another one should be out soon.\n\nAdrian brought out a new order for me, with extra bananas, just as I requested.  I enjoyed half of the entree- three toast triangles- immensely and boxed up the other half to take home.  As I mentioned in my check-in note, the management and staff know how to treat their customers well, and as I was exiting The Hash Kitchen accompanied by Adrian, who shook hands with me goodbye while apologizing again for the mishap, I told him that I enjoyed my breakfast and the mishap won't keep me from coming back!  :)\n\nThank you, Hash Kitchen.  See you again very soon!\n\n[1] Mom loves the different eggs Benedict selections here, but she thinks the menu prices are over-priced.  It can be overwhelming, and that is why I try not to order too much, or visit too often.\n\n[2] Traditional powdered sugar contains cornstarch.
