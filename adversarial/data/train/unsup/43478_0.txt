I've only been here twice but I love the pancakes (tried plain and blueberry). my dad has the egg breakfast with peameal and love everything on his plate. The coffee is what you'd expect from a diner, not great but good enough. The service is good as well, everyone is kind and are prompt and always around for coffee refills.
