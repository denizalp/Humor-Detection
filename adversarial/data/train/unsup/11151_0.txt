This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Took 5 minutes to be acknowledged. Even then, the owner just yelled through the takeout window that we could seat ourselves. Waited another 10 minutes while the waitresses and other staff completely ignored us. It was another 5 minutes before we got menus, another 10 before the waitress took our order. My boyfriend sent his flat Pepsi back twice. He finally asked for water but the waitress went on to serve a bottle of wine to another table and never brought the water.  We had to ask the owner for it, as he stopped at the next table to chat with his friends, who by the way, arrived 20 minutes after us and got their food before us. The salad was some lettuce, a grape tomato, two thin cucumber slices and a pile of thinly shaved carrots. And they forgot to add the cheese we requested.  The spaghetti was bland. The meat in the sauce tasted like cardboard. Furthest thing from authentic I've ever had. Finally, the waitress offered us free dessert because of the poor service. We got the chocolate cake and cheesecake to go. (We had already spent almost 2 hours there.) So glad we didn't pay for the dessert. They were both bitter and the taste was inconsistent throughout. By the way,  $8 for a slice of cake? It wasn't worth a dollar.  We'll never return.
