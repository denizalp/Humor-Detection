We have been regulars at this place and we used to love it. But today, it has nothing been but the worst service we have had in all of dining out. So bad that I had to review as soon as I got out. Our waitress didn't greet us properly, did not ask if we needed any drinks, and didn't clear our plates. The host did that all. Despite the horrible service from her, I still proceeded to give her a tip as she stood with the machine. She didn't say thank you, and was so rude. There was another table next to us and she said thank you and have a great day to the other table- NOT US. She left without a word and grabbed the cash tip we gave her as if she was ungrateful that we were there. Whoever that server is today- we did not get her name, I hope she realizes how horrible she was today, and the fact that we are Asians and the people next to us were Canadians and got the service everyone deserved just shows how this can be a little if not wholly racist. I am so appalled by this service. I can't believe it.
