I brought my dog here for the first time for a self wash and overall it was an awesome experience and I will for sure be back. They have everything there, shampoo, conditioner, brushes, dryers, spray, etc. my only concern was how high the tubs were, my dog is 85 pounds and a big guy to lift. Luckily, the staff helped me get him in there. They offered a hot oil treatment for $5 extra and it was worth it as my dogs skin was getting dry with the weather change. When it came time to get him out of the tub, it was so easy. The drying station can move right up to the tub area and my dog jumped from one to the other. He was so soft and smells so good now! I also stopped in the bakery to get cupcakes for him and my 2 other dogs, reasonably priced treats. The staff also gave him some treats after his bath and he loved that of course!
