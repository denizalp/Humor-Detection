I liked the grilled peach salad, especially since I added the salmon fillet, and my wife's street tacos were very tasty.\n\nHowever, their $2 margaritas were pretty strong (IMHO), but their draft bud lights were pretty expensive at $4.50 a pop.\n\nIf you come with a large group, you will be charged a 20% gratuity, so DON'T tip (unless you really really liked your server.), because it will already be included in your tab.
