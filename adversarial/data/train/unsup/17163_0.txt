I hate to write a review for a place I did not actually eat or drink at, but the lack of eating\/drinking was not my choice, hence the 1 star review. Three friends and I attempted to grab drinks and appetizers last weekend before heading over to an event at Consol and when we walked in, the place was busy, but there were several open bar tables in the seat yourself area. After about 15 minutes of attempting to get the attention of a server, bartender, hostess...heck, ANY employee, and failing, we decided to get up. Some people at the table next to us said \"that's why the women before you left; they never got served.\" While the employees were busy ignoring us, they were standing around texting and being generally inconsiderate. At one point, we tried to wave down a bartender and he looked right at us and walked away.
