The good is decent here and the service is good (for how busy they always are). But I came in here for one main reason. I've been to the place about 4 different times. Every single time I've been there they have the air conditioning in FULL BLAST! You will notice as soon as you step in the front door that it is cold. Twice I have been seated at tables where the cold air is blowing directly on our table. I hear other customers also making comments about how cold it is. Warning: Don't come in here without your winter jacket. As they don't seem to care if their customers are comfortable or not. I will think twice about coming in next time if I have nothing to warm myself up with. I would have given this place 4 stars otherwise.
