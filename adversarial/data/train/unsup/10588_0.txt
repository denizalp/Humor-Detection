Such a swanky place! (And I love swanky places)\n\nService: Services was just alright here. There were long wait times after being seated. We went during lunch time, so it wasn't too busy at the restaurant. However, once the server came around it got a bit better. She was personable, and she knew the menu well!\n\nFood: I had the fish and chips! I was wanting something greasy, but delicious. The fish was a nice honking size. Tasty too!\n\nDrinks: They had a nice cocktail list. Had all the classics, but they had good variations as well! \n\nAtmosphere: They have a pretty cool atmosphere. Industrial, but has great windows to people watch.\n\nOverall, I'd probably come back if friends asked me to come out there. However, wouldn't go out of my way to say hello!
