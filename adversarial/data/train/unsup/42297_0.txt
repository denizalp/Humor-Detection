I've been a member at Generate for several years and have been very happy. I'd been trying out various gyms and was never completely happy. I don't like the typical gym scene - often full of testosterone, loud music, a level of intimidation and too many screens. Generate is a completely different experience. It's a calm environment with great energy. No screens. Good tunes. Bright natural light. Reclaimed wood floors. Lovely organic towels. And best of all it is very clean and the equipment and mats are well maintained. Staff and members obviously take pride in keeping our gym welcoming. Great range of classes and some fantastic instructors. (Shout out to Magz and Georgina!)  Portia is always looking for ways to improve the member experience with special events, workshops and offerings (farm fresh eggs anyone?) I'd  like it if the Pilates reformer was not an upcharge but there are no other hidden costs to membership. People of all fitness levels are encouraged and there is no sense that you don't fit in if you aren't a hard body :)  I highly recommend Generate.
