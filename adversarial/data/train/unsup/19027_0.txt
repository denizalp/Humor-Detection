I was lured in with high promises and set up for great expectations. These guys are clueless! They have no idea what to do and how to do. They're work is so substandard - they don't even proofread it to catch easy misspellings! But they will glad take your money and waive some obscure clause in your face about it. My suggestion - don't walk - RUN!!\n\nSo here's how this story continues... A couple of days after I post this review, I (finally!!) get a call from these guys offering to give me a full refund on what they had charged me. The want to part ways in peace, they say. So all I have to do is sign a document saying that I won't publicize my story. Well, as hard as it was, I had to reject their offer. And to be clear, we're talking about $1,500 that they owe me which now they admit that they owe me. But the only way I'm getting it is by keeping my mouth shut. So I ask you - if this was a legitimate company, with a legitimate service, would they have to blackmail me like this? Wouldn't they have contacted me months ago to offer this refund, which they agree I'm owed? Shame on them!
