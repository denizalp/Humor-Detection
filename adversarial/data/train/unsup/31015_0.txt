Suuuuper expensive! A plate of mediocre nachos and some store-bought (really sour) guacamole was $20 - and that was the day the nachos were supposedly on special. The food was bad but the service was ok. The one really good thing I have to say about Brewsters is their Bellini was delicious! Not worth another trip though... We won't be back.
