Ok so we were at Dino's bar and were a bit hungry deciding what we were going to do to fill our tummy's as we had not had dinner. We were drinking and needed something on our stomach as to prevent the psycho drunk after effect as well.\n\nAlbo's pizza is located behind Dino's bar and has a nice indoor seating option if you choose to dine in.\n\nWe opted to place an order for take out in which they actually walked it over and delivered to us at Dino's so we did not have to wait :) Yay!\n\nWe ordered a large Albo Special:\npepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, onions, mushrooms, black olives, green peppers \n\nPizza was good, and plenty cheesy which is a bonus as they are a pizza shop that does not skimp on the cheese! That is something that drives me nuts when you have to add cheese as an extra topping just to get a decent amount, not here!\n\nPizza is good and the friendly personal service is even better :)\n\nMy next trip to Dino's we may just have to order another pizza from Albo's :)\n\nThey also had several pasta dishes that looked yummy as well! They have a wide and varied menu to choose from and not limited to pizza.
