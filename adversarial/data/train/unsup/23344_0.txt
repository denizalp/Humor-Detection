OK, for a bowl of veggie rice, an order of chilled noodles,(1) taco, and an order of stuffed dumplings,a non refillable can of diet coke and , small cup of cantaloupe juice .I paid a whopping 91.50. The portions sizes were very upsetting,(infact I cried a little before leaving) the dumplings tasted similar to play-doh (don't judge me) play-doh being the Victor in the taste comparison. The taco was the size of a Japanese hornet small when compared to an average tacos. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.I will never be returning.maybe just to yell through the window \"you suck!\"I would rather eat Vegas desert  dirt.
