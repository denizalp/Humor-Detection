I would describe this place as modern Indian dining. The presentation of dishes like the homemade paneer cheese tikka appetizer (stuffed with apricots and raisins, marinated in coriander and basil glazed in Tandoor, pickled red cabbage) looked like something I would get at a French restaurant.  This place isn't the norm and it was just what we were looking for this evening.  \n\nHaving a $25 restaurant.com coupon in hand didn't hurt either.  AND we got a free appetizer just by checking in on Yelp! WEEEEEEEE!!!\n\nWhat an excellent selection of vegetarian dishes!  My wife gets saag paneer at Indian joints like she gets filet mignon at steakhouses like she gets green curry at Thai restaurants.  EVERYTIME.  \n\nI got the Khadi Paneer (House-made Indian cheese and mixed bell pepper cooked in tomato sauce) which was delicious however we were already at maximum paneer overload after the appetizer.  This was out fault for not thinking this through.  It certainly made for a great lunch the next day though!!\n\nThe service was very attentive and filled up our water glasses promptly.  I'll be back!
