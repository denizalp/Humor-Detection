Hey - I just tried SRP for the first time - which you know is scary if you haven't been to a new stylist. \n\nI really, really like my hair! Better than where I got it cut before. I had Megan and she did a great job! Especially because I had red hair and wanted to make sure it didn't come out burgundy. Megan and Jen consulted me prior to mixing up the color - and I appreciate that they took the time to find out what look I was going for. \n\nI will defiantly go back to Megan. I brought a picture in of what I was wanting - and although my hair is too short at the moment, she cut my hair so that I can eventually achieve that look. \n\nAnywho - was pleased when I walked out of there and I still am. \n\nThe ONLY negative I can find was with the receptionist, who did not acknowledge me in any way; she just told me what I owed and not once looked up from the computer.  Guess she was having a bad day.
