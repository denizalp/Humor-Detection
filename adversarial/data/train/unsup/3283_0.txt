I was excited to try Pho here since they opened after hearing about it and passing by after it opened, the Yelp reviews were promising as well! I went with fellow Yelper Heather S. as we were in the mood for hot soup on that cold night! \n\nThe decor is nice, bright and clean and I like the open view kitchen so that you can see the cooks moving about while making every ones food. \n\nI was in the mood for something with shrimp in it and for Pho there were only two options for seafood. They had the seafood Pho which had, shrimp, scallops and imitation crab or Tom Pho which is what I ordered that only had shrimp.\n\nThe Pho noodles and the broth were good however my little shrimps had been cooked to death, overcooked then filled in a bowl with boiling hot water just killed it as those shrimps never had a chance to be good. That is a pet peeve of mine, over cooked seafood is a deal breaker and will ruin a meal as shrimp should not be hard as a rock and chewy. I do not suggest ordering the Tom Pho.\n\nI did like the fresh spring rolls with the peanut dipping sauce and my lychee flavored iced tea was a winner.\n\nIf you do not see a combination that is listed you do have the option to create your own up to three meats.\n\nThere is no ATM in this restaurant, they refer you across the street of crazy busy spring mountain to a Wells Fargo bank ATM. I have no idea why previous reviews state there is an ATM located inside of the restaurant when there is not. \n\nAlso no credit card transactions are accepted for less than 20.00 so it made it sort of complicated for us going dutch.
