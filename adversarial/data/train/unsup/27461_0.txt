I really wanted to be blown away by Beef 'N Bottle. I grew up in Charlotte and have heard about it my entire life. I finally went with my boyfriend for his birthday and we didn't leave as happy as I expected. I knew what to expect-- a run down old school building that serves crackers and a scoop of cheese as soon as you sit down. I can appreciate that. It was fun knowing that the food and experience has stayed the same since the restaurant has been in business. We were sat right away and greeted within a moment or so. We ordered the Cajun Crab Dip and received a thoughtful explanation of how each steak is made. Once we ordered the crab dip, our server did not return to our table for a LONG time. In fact... the table beside us ordered, ate, and received their bill before we placed our order. My boyfriend had to get up and ask another server for help. I understand that it was a busy night and our original server seemed to have another large table, but waiting nearly 25 minutes to order is ridiculous! She was very apologetic and made it up to us with a free dessert (which we were too full to eat by the end of our meal.) For 2 steaks and an app, our bill was $100 which was to be expected. The steaks were great, no complaints there, but they justtttt weren't amazing. I've had better at other restaurants. The mashed potatoes were very thin and almost...shiny? It was weird. The saut√©ed mushrooms were whole mini mushrooms that seemed to be poured out of a can into a bowl of salted butter. They tasted good, but kind of grossed me out. After we finished, we sat for a while and waited for our server to return. The tables around us cleared and another server cleaned and flipped them all before our server came back to take our plates. It wasn't a bad or good experience. I'm not sure that we will be back for a while.
