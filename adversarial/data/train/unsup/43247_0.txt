This is a fantastic store! I'm on my feet all day and travelling a lot for work so a friend of mine in Montreal reccomended I try Mephisto's. I bought their version of the boat shoe and I wear it to death! It's amazing for travel and the leather molded to my foot so it's a perfect fit.\n\nThe customer service is also really good in this store. They know exactly what they are talking about and they even told me how to wear the shoe in. It also came with a warantee which I haven't had to use yet but its good to know that its available!
