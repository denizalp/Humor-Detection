Freestone Park is a must-visit if you live in or near, or are visiting Gilbert. The 100-acre grounds are beautiful, featuring a man-made lake and waterfall. An 1880's replica miniature railroad takes a quarter-mile loop around the lake, affording a views of ducks and geese. Bring some bread if you dare (the ducks can be quite aggressive!).\n\nThere are numerous picnic armadas, several separate playground areas -- so if one play area is being dominated by a snot-nosed bully, you can always move to a safer one. \n\nThere are also basketball courts, sand volleyball pits, batting cages and a driving range, and a 22,000 square feet skate park.\n\nBut wait! That's not all! There's also an antique carousel, mini-ferris wheel, and a tot-sized \"wave runner.\" Although there is a fee for the train, batting cages, golf & the rides, it is on par or below what other equivalent amusements usually cost. \n\nFinally Freestone Park is an excellent place to slide down grassy hills on an ice block. Of course, that activity isn't officially sanctioned, so try-at-your-own risk :)
