Best dim sum in richmond hill. More expensive than golden court, premier ballroom (diu yu toi) and emperor but the quality is there. \n\nBEWARE though. Without a reservation don't even bother cuz even if u have one you'll still have to wait a good period of time. The wait time is a nightmare because the restaurant is sooo packed. In fact, they hired their own parking instruction guys to direct traffic lol. The parking lot is also a nightmare because its a one way parking lot and a ton of drivers dont obey the one way signs. Thankfully it's connected to an adjacent lot that has much more parking. \n\nThe pork in the siu mai is ground by hand in the kitchen as opposed to being ground by machine (tastes much more tender and fresh). I thought the har gao (shrimp dumpling) couldve had a thinner rice crepe; the shrimp was really good. They offer oxtail as an item which is rare (only other place I rmbr having it was Gold Mark in markham). The bbq pork bun with pineapple topping is a MUST TRY (for all you ppl foreign to dim sum). Also the bbq pork with rice (the bbq pork at this place is amazing, trust). The curry octopus was mediocre. I've had much better. It tasted like the octopus was drenched in watered down sriracha. Try the honey glazed beef spare ribs. Those are bomb as well. \n\nYea so check this place out. It's slightly more expensive than any other place in richmond hill but the quality is there. And REMEMBER TO MAKE YOUR RESERVATION otherwise \"i told you so\".
