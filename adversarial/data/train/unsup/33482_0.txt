This is my first burrito from this chain restaurant and it was so good!! The plc was clean and spacious (don't let the exteriors fool u).\n\nI got the ground beef burrito (size small) and it was so filling and delicious. It was around $9. They let you pick the toppings (free guac oh yeah) and the person who took my order was pretty friendly and was able to answer my questions. Not a lot of people were there when I went, but I'd say it's because of the area not because it's bad (a lot of work offices, so burritos and mex food probably wouldn't be the first thing office people would think of at lunch). the stuff tasted fresh. \n\nI asked for hot sauce on the side and they forgot to give it to me :( and the burrito wasn't hot enough even when I only had about 2 min of travel time in between, so I had to microwave it.  \n\nBut overall I'd deffff come back !!
