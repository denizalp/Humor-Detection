I was impressed with my first Aloft experience this past week. I knew this was W's crack at competing with Courtyard and Hampton Inn, but wasn't really expecting it to completely blow away the cheaper Marriott and Hilton brands.\n\nIt did - the lobby, the rooms and the fitness area (which rivaled what I've seen at the average Marriott) were exceptional when compared to the competitive set. The bed however was about on par with the Courtyard\/Hampton Inn set. The internet speed was ridiculous: 7.82 Mb\/s down http:\/\/www.speedtest.net\/result\/878972301.png. \n\nHighly recommended.
