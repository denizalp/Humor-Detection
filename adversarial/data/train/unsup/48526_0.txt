Falcon funeral home is where we choose to have my father's funeral. Christian Timothy, funeral director was kind, compassionate, and went far and beyond for my family. I have no complaints about this company. Everything that went into my father's tribute was amazing, and beautiful. I would highly recommend this locally owned and family operated business.
