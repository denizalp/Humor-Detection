If I compare t what I grew up with in Santa Barbara it is a 2 but would not be in any way fair.  I got there over an hour before they opened so I had time to go for breakfast and walk around Old Town.  Got there right at 8 and the first stop was McClenden farms where I got zucchini and yellow crookneck that had been picked when they were supposed to and tomatoes and green onions.  I later saw some really nice bennings green tint at another booth but already had enough squash.  I got a couple jars of preserves at Terra Verde.  Terra Verde will be there only sporadically for the rest of the season.  A loaf of sourdough from Arizona Bread company.  And of course Sweet Republic.  I knew this is the time of year for Peach ice cream but in case I did not make it over for some reason I did not call ahead of time to make sure that was one of the flavors loaded on the truck.  As Helen started down the list I stopped her at peach.  :-)  I am planning on making the trek across the valley once more before the end of the season.  This coming Saturday is planned to be the first underground.
