Avoid this location at all costs.  The room is filled with at least 50 people already waiting and more coming in. They are only processing about 1 person every 30 minutes.  Someone at ADOT needs to audit this location.  I will also be taking this up at the next RNC meeting to see what needs to be done politically.
