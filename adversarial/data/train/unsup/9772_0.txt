Best greasy spoon you can ever find in Montreal. I went to a CEGEP nearby for two years and been to the place at least 5 times a month. Their hot-dogs, hamburgers, glass bottle Coca-Cola and vintage decor can pull you back to the memories of the 30's. Their poutine is by far the best I've had in the whole Montreal, and they've been on the Gazette more than once for their hot-dogs and poutine.\n\nIt is a small Italian family owned business, so the cooks are very friendly and outgoing, however the place may have a slight sanitary problem. Well, it's a greasy spoon, waddaya expect?
