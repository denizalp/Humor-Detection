Stopped in to cool off on our way back to DTPHX via light rail from Tempe Town Lake. Saw they had summer shandy on tap, that was enough for me to pull up a seat. The bar looks good, and it probably gets quite busy on the weekends during the college season. $8.25 for a 25oz Shandy, not bad, but could get that at BWW for about $4-6.\n\nOrdered a few tacos, shredded chicken and the steak with corn tortillas. Got smashed potatoes and rice for sides, and I'd recommend it. The tacos are a decent size. The avocado cream was good, maybe I'd like to see real sliced avocado but still good. It was a little slow in the bar but it was also 3:30p on a Saturday in July.\n\nIf I'm back in the area sometime I'd consider stopping in.
