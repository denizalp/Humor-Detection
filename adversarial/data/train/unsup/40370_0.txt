Super pleased with my experience at Lotus Nails. I very occasionally decide to get my nails done but decided to get them done based on the great reviews I saw about this place, and the beautiful nail art! I was able to easily schedule an appointment for my friend and I. \n\nWhen we got there, the two ladies who were there provided exceptional service and were super friendly. I definitely recommend this if you want a treat yourself day!
