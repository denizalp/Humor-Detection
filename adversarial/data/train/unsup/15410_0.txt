I've been here for brunch a few times and the food has always been wonderful.  My only real complaint is the layout in the front room, but it's not fun to have people sticking their asses on your head while you try to eat a delicious plate of chicken and waffles.  The restaurant gets SO busy, and there is no clear host station, so people just sort of mill about, and the chairs are just low enough to put your head at ass level.  If they can re-work the space, this would be a four star review.  The food is unique, fresh and delicious and the atmosphere is informal, with excellent service.
