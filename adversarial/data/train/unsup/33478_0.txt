I'm new to Phoenix so I've been trying to find a good nail place. I went last week and had a lovely pedicure. Great massage and friendly service as soon as I walked through the door. Today, I walked in to see about 4 customers working with someone and 5 nail techs standing and sitting around. I signed up on the sheet, sat for 5 mins waiting to be acknowledged. I then made eye contact and spoke to multiple people but nobody brought me back. I stood up after another 5 minutes and asked if anyone was going to help me. One male, spoke to another male (in their foreign tongue) and he seemed annoyed that he had to put down his iPad to help me. My manicure was painfully long. Throughout my entire manicure he didn't speak at all, didn't offer water, didn't put any lotion or massage at all. The only other acknowledgement I got was when he said sorry while LITERALLY making me bleed. I have 4 open sores on my hands because \"the file was new and sharp\" ...what? I've never had a manicure take almost 2 hours or be SO PAINFUL. I go up to pay and he wants to charge me $41. Their menu says $35 for gel full powder set. He says I'm wrong - and then goes and gets the other male who originally told him to help me. He points to the SNS menu - which I didn't get. Then said well it's $15 extra for gel but it says it nowhere on the menu. I advised him that he made me bleed multiple times and he didn't care- still charged me $41. This place is sketchy about pricing and has RUDE nail techs. Don't waste your time or money. I'm home and finding many nail bubbles and glue is peeling off my fingers. What a waste of money on such a horrible job done!
