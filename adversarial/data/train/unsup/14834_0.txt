Saku has been on my bookmarked list for quite some time now. And finally my friends and I were able to go try it out today. We made a reservation just in case Saku would be busy, but surprisingly it wasn't packed when we got there. \n\nWe had a little trouble deciding on what to order, but based on yelp reviews :p we ended up ordering lion King, ocean, volcano, energy and the chef selection A. I know...that's quite a lot for four people but we were starving! Three of us also ordered drinks, I had the momo - I don't remember what was in it but it was too sweet for me. My friend had the Tokyo Rose and the other got the sparkling jelly sake - recommend! \n\nOur rolls and sushi came within a reasonable amount of time. And everything was SO delicious! We were not disappointed at all! And our server was so nice, she had no problems splitting the bills. I'd definitely come back, it's a great place for dinner and date nights ;)! Don't forget to check in for 10% off a roll.
