Walk in and I LOVE the way this place looks!  Holes still in the wall from a knife fight (only don't bring a knife to a knife fight when the other person has a Pick Ax) in a club or concert hall, long before Liz had her stand here, covered only in black paint.  Please NEVER take these \"scars of History away!  Long Hallways (Entrance and to the restrooms) Great looking Bar and Dinning Room...This place is Coooool!\n\nDrunken Short Ribs on a Bavarian (better be if it's a pretzel) Pretzel Buns for tiny sliders.  The taste was Fantastic!   Mayo Warning! ! !  I HATE MAYO! (at the time of this writing the menu contains NO Mayo warning)!  I'll be glad to delete this part of the review if someone can prove the restaurant added it to the list of what comes on the sandwiches (I gave my idea to my server and I'm not making a statement here accept to inform those who despise it more than I.  It was my only recommend change for the Restaurant)!  These sliders even had heaps  of Mayonnaise on them and I was still Totally impressed with the taste (I hardly ever send anything back, nor make many complaints anywhere and did not today even though they quickly offered to remake my order).  \n\nThe flavor of the Onion Ring Batter (it was cooked when I tasted it, so batter may not be the right terminology) was very good.  The only reason it does not make my Onion Ring list is because it is not one of my favorites, though still one of the better batters in Charlotte and cooked just right!\n\nDrunken Short Ribs 5 yelp stars\n\nPretzel Bun 5 yelp stars\n\nOnion Rings 3.75 yelp stars\n\nHouse made Garlic Mayo (I can not rate it since I prefer none).  I bet if you like Mayo You'll really like this one!\n\nHow about Dessert:  How about MINT Ice!  That looked like a question the Mint Ice is Fantastic though I think it was meant to be the garnish on this Flourless Chocolate cake!  The Shaved Mint Ice gets 5 yelp stars for flavor, 5 yelp stars for texture (bigger than snow and twice as Romantic, smaller than Hail and ten times softer).  I almost fell in love!  The Flourless Chocolate Cake gets a 2.75 star rating!\n\nThe Service gets an EASY five yelp stars and I'm one who invites the minimum amount of service as long as EVERYTHING is PERFECT!  Today I met four of the servers and all four were friendly!\n\nSecond meal:  March 7th 2012 Chad style UPDATE : : Service still great!  Storefront Signs are in place and looking great!  The place looks FANTASTIC! The food is ahhh, uh, ok here goes:\n\nEggplant Stack 3.9 yelp stars\n\nDrunken Short Rib 3.85 yelp stars\n\nWaffles: Fantastic 5 yelp stars\n\nFried Chicken 3.75 stars\n\nFries: Better than many, though will not make my \"Lonely Fry\" List 3.25 stars!
