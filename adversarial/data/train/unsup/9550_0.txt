This is the kind of salon that attracts cheap dads, little kids, and old ladies. For some reason, it also attracted me. From the outside, En Vogue looks a bit weird. It's at Dufferin Mall. It's kind of ugly. There's a messy handwritten note advertising hairstylists. However, it's much nicer than it looks beyond the front desk. I was able to walk in and out in less than 15 minutes, no wait, no appointment, on a Saturday,\n\nThe spa part is in the back of the salon, enclosed in glass doors. I met with Irina - who was so nice and so great. She also specializes in organic facials by the way. She made sure to ask me exactly what I want, advise me on the best shape for my face, follow up with tweezers, and make sure everything looked perfect before I left. She even played that lovely peaceful music. I definitely recommend her!
