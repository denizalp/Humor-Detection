I have been driving by this place for months thinking \"I really should stop one of these days\".  So tonight, thanks to Nicole W's foursquare check in, I got inspired.  \n\nThe pizzas are huuuuuuuuge!  If you check on foursquare you get free garlic knots :)  The pizza was the perfect combination of chewy and crunchy.  Definitely going back to try some traditional Italian dishes.
