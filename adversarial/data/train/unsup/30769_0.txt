Heard a lot about this place so we HAD to try it out last weekend. The lounge is SUPER KICK ass.. A MUST go to. The Grill is pretty cool to see.. however the food is just A-OK. More of a lunch meal. I HIGHLY recommend hitting the lounge late night after dinner for drinks\/apps. The lounge is dark, good music, lots of TV's, sexy u shape couch's with plants\/flowers separating the section all around you, a water feature with a fire pit in the middle. Pretty cool must see lounge.
