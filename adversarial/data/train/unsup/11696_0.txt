BEWARE!!!! \nSo ever since my husband and I went to this place we've been watching our account with them double charging us. Well this morning it was processed. So I called the nail salon and had to deal with no one who knew how to help me with their mistake. The lady said \"yeah we over charged like all our clients\". Not a good feeling at all and not a way to get customers to return. So after dealing with the the receptionist and the \"owner\" she said she'd have her other receptionist call me back. Well 4 hours later no one called so I called and got the receptionist and she it took 15 mins but supposedly she returned it and would be sending me the receipt. Oh mind you she told me it's gonna take a week till my money is fully refunded. Oh yay!! So not only was my husband and my services awful and overly expensive with a coupon but they double charged us. Oh yeah and we never were given a call to say I'm sorry your service was awful. After I called a week ago to tell them how shitty our service was. Gave my info so the owner could call me back but never got a call. So needless to say we will never return. Thanks for the shitty service and the headache with over charging our account. I'd rather paint my own nails.
