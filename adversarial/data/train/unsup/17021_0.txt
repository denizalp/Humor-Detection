I found 'The Brow Studio' using Yelp and am I ever glad I did.  \nVisited the studio this past week for my first appointment. Noelle was my consultant and she is an absolutely delightful professional - what a lovely gal.  I am new to Calgary and Noelle was so sweet and helpful through our conversation as we chatted.  \n\nShe is incredibly thorough in her work and explained the whole process to me in a way that I have never heard before. I have an entirely new outlook on eyebrows! I am excited to go back over the next few months and see what improvements we can make to my brows. Thank you Noelle.\n\nThe studio is quiet and relaxing and the follow up call was so appreciated - who does that!?  Yup - Noelle - you rock sista!\nI will definitely be back and also reccomend this place to anyone wanting to improve your brows and your over-all look, they really do frame your beauty :-)
