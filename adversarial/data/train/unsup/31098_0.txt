I almost didn't go here because of the reviews but man am I glad I did!  The Albino stout was nothing I had ever had before. I love a good stout\/porter and this one was awesome!  It went down a little too easy!  I also ordered the Patatas Bravas and bacon wrapped dates. The dates were okay, I didn't love the schmear but I also ate all of them. The Patatas bravos were DELICIOUS!!  \nI sat at the bar since I was in town for work. Staff was very friendly and had great recommendations   I really enjoyed my visit and I'll be back again!
