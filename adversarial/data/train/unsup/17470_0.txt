I want to build the Roman baths in my house!!!!!!!!!!!!  OMG, IT WAS SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!\n\nWe girls arrived at Qua around 3 pm to visit the facilities (I needed a nice soak.)  We were then ushered into the spa area and were given a tour and our locker info.  \n\nThe first thing I did was jump in the shower to rinse off and ran to the Roman Baths!!  It was absolutely relaxing!!  \n\nWe first went into the main bath, which had a warm temperature to soak for a while.  The reason why I want this in my house is that I love the waterfall effect from the tub!!  We then went over to the hot tub..  MY FAVE!!!  I was probably in there for a good half hour with the waterfall splashing my shoulders.  We then took naps on the heated stone lounge chairs in this steamy room (perfect for your skin!!)  I loved the sound from the overhead shower that helped lull me to sleep.  We felt so pampered just being there.\n\nThen we showered and got ready in the self salon area.  It was furnished with dryers, combs, curling irons, razors, cotton balls, straight irons, everything you'd expect from a high end spa.  \n\nWe then went into the lounge area to relax.  I got some pineapple juice and pretzels to snack on.  It was great!  They offer tea, coffee, juices, fresh fruits and prezels.\n\nI can't wait to go back, but need to finish my tour of Vegas Spas ;)  Definitely recommended!!
