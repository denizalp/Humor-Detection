I went to this restaurant on Saturday night with three friends. I think it may have been their first day (or one of their first days) serving a full dinner menu, so perhaps things will get better. I certainly hope so, as I love Cuban food and this is the first Cuban restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh, as I only moved here a few months ago.\n\nMy friends and I had a empanada platter appetizer for $6. Based on the amount of food you get, $6 is a great deal. If you want to eat four small calzones as a meal, then this could easily be a meal for one person. We all liked the empanadas, so we were hopeful about the quality of the entrees.\n\nHowever, I found the entrees to be quite lackluster. I ordered the lechon platter ($11), which is a dish of pulled pork. It was rather plain tasting, and came with a side dish of white rice and black beans. The beans were ok, but the rice was rather crunchy and didn't have the same very light taste of garlic and oil that I'm used to at Cuban restaurants.\n\nAnother friend's fricase de pollo was so-so, with a side of plantains that were quite starchy and flavorless--not like the lightly sweet plantains I've had at Latin restaurants in other cities.\n\nAll in all, I felt that this restaurant did not live up to the standards of other Cuban restaurants I've been to in other American cities.
