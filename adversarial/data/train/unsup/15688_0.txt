Let's face it.  There aren't too many GOOOOOOD pizza joints on the Strip.  But then there are slice houses that really get the job done by being open super late at night like Secret Pizza at Cosmopolitan, Pizzeria Da Enzo at The Venetian, and Le Pizza at Paris LV.  Pin Up Pizza at Planet Hollywood fits perfectly into that category.\n\nUnfortunately their late night slice selection is very limited compared to what they have during the daytime.  When I got there for a at around midnight, I went with their All-Meat slice, and one Cheese slice.\n\nYeah, there's no denying it.  These slices are huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge!!\n http:\/\/bit.ly\/1v6XLrC\n\nThey're around $5-7 a slice, but the enormous size of these slices definitely justify the price and they're pretty good.  Very similar to Secret Pizza's slices in quality.  If you want a whole pie, there's unfortunately no discount.  You just take the price of the pizza slice and multiply it by ten.  So we're basically talking $70 pies!  It's worth it though if you have a big group to feed.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty solid pizza spot on the Strip with enormous slices that are good enough to satisfy your hunger for lunch, dinner, or a late night snack.
