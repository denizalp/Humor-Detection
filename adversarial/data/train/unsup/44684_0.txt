I decided to celebrate my son's bday on a Friday evening, so I go to topgolf that day at noon to get information about the wait time, whats the best thing to do and so forth.  So they suggest for me to call before I take my party to topgolf to have a better idea of the wait time.  I call around 6pm and I was told that there was no wait time and that if I get there now, I will be given a booth up on the 3rd level (which I had asked about earlier in the day).  So my party and I get there at 7pm (which I understand that we were going to have a wait because it was an hour later).. once we get there they inform us that it will be an 1 hr to 1 1\/2 hr wait time.  So we decided to go eat dinner somewhere close by.  We get back to topgolf around 8pm, we check in and they tell us it will be a 30-45 min wait time.  We said okay we'll hang out upstairs 3rd floor where the DJ area is at.  ONce we got up there, we notice a couple of booths opened and notice a family was escorted to a booth.  We ask them how long their wait was and they said 10 MINUTES!!!!.  however they said because they have a premium\/platinum membership, which we understand that they pay $$$$$ for that.  So we said okay, whatever.  My husband goes downstairs to check on our wait time and they said that there are 10 guest in front of us so it will be another HOUR or so.  It was already 9:30pm.  We didn't get a booth until almost 10:30pm and the only reason was because my husband went almost 4 times to guest services and told them, to be honest with him and tell him if we are going to get seated or we just leave.  They give you the runaround about the wait time!!! I had to wait almost 3 HOURS on Friday evening.  I felt that we were given the worst booth because of our complaint.  WE were put on the booth next to wall!!
