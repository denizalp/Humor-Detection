Truly the best in the valley.  I am a medical professional (NP) and am very aware of what to look for in choosing a health care practitioner.  The office is extremely clean and you see the staff keeping it so.  The entire staff is professional and very interested in getting you better.  Not only is the chiropractic treatment top-notch and effective, but the massage therapist and NP (trigger point injections) are fabulous.  My condition has improved significantly and only because Valley Pain and Wellness has given me individualized care and a personalized home treatment plan so that I can maintain the benefits of the office treatments.
