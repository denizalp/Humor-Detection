This place has thus far been a hit and miss for me.  It is however still better than the Pho place in Stouffville though.  The first time, I ordered a grilled pork bun and it was quite good despite the insane amount of bean sprouts they had.  The next time I went, I had ordered a shredded pork bun and it was very flavourless.  I had also asked specifically to NOT have any bean sprouts and they still put it in, which really ruined it.  I ordered a soy milk as well under the assumption they make it in house - and they gave me a Yeo's can of soy milk - definitely not worth the $3 I paid for it.  Overall, I'd say that while this place isn't inedible, I wouldn't go here deliberately.  I still like Pho Metro way more!
