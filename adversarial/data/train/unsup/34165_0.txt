I just love this pub. It's such a perfect little bar for the Roncy strip. Small enough to feel cozy but big enough to fit a decent number of people. It's always been pretty full any time we've ever been. \n\nA few of the reasons I love this spot: \nThe atmosphere is great (friendly, buzzing, dim lighting...all the things you want a pub to be).\nThe staff are really friendly and helpful. \nThey carry a great selection of beer (including one called \"The Local\"). \nThe food is good (we've been here for dinner a few times). \nThe have regular live music with some pretty impressive musicians. \nTheir walls are decorated with an eclectic mix of everything.\nThey have board games you can play if you are in the mood.\n\nIf you live in the area, you probably already know about this little gem, if you don't, you should come and check it out. It's one of the better pubs in this city.
