World class burgers here, made to order!  Nothing too fancy--just very nicely constructed one-third pound burgers prepared to order, and delicious specialty sandwiches to boot.  My medium-rare Roxy's Grand Chuck Burger arrived just as ordered, with lettuce, tomato, and pickle planks supplemented by requested bacon, mushrooms, sauteed onions, a slice of Swiss Cheese, and fresh avocado on a soft bun.  Heinz ketchup and Heinz mild mustard applied by me finished the job.  Once done, I could barely get my mouth around my hamburger, but when I did it packed a delightful multi-ingredient punch.  House Fries in a small paper bag, and thick golden battered O'rings dipped in BBQ sauce and Ranch Dressing,rounded out a fine filling meal.\n\nSinging waitstaff added an authentic touch of rock 'n roll to this venerable diner located on the main floor of the Stratosphere, and service was again very good.
