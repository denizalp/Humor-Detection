When's the last time you took a late night Denny's trip sober? Never?! I'm not surprised. Nobody does that; nobody except this guy! Why on earth would I succumb to this? Well for starters, if you're looking for a spot to hang out in the area after 2am, this is it. Secondly, with Denny's at 2am you get both dinner AND a show! A very colourful, very very drunk show as put on by the other patrons. If you're in need of either of these 2 things, you fine. If not, you'll probably have better luck going anywhere else.\n\n We were straight up with out server that we were here to watch the drunk people; he showed us to our booth and said \"I think you will enjoy your view from here and as you can see this booth comes equipped with a safety glass railing to keep you at a close distance while still keeping you safe. Now, if you look to your left that's the table you want to keep you eye on. Please remember to keep your hands inside the booth at all times and to not feed the animals. Leave that to us - we're trained professionals.\" He was so attentive and so funny the whole night I can honestly overlook how terrible my stomach felt the next morning for attempting to eat Denny's food without any alcohol in my system to soak it up. What was I thinking?\n\nAlso, the Mozza sticks give me an immediate nostalgia flashback to when Denny's was my high school hang out. \n\n2-stars for food and 4-stars for semi-disgruntled yet hilarious Denny's servers. Can't wait to come back another night after several rounds of tequila and get emotional over the crane game.
