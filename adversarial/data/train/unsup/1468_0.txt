I got surprised with lunch from my boo at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill when I was just here for my birthday.  The service was phenomenal.  We ate at the bar and had such a lovely time chatting with the bartender.  She was great with my man's allergy concerns and was very honest about helping us pick the best things to eat.\n\nI had the lobster mac n cheese and split pea soup.  SOOOOO Good.\n\nWe got surprised with the spotted dick --insert juvenile joke here-- for dessert.  The warm bread pudding with ice cream was to die for.  Honestly, who needed lunch food.  Just get this!  \n\nIt is pricey.  But honestly, EVERYTHING nice in Vegas is pricey now.  Not to mention, food like this is starting to look cheap in comparison to the price of 2 drinks at a club.  $40-$60 for 2 drinks?! Seriously people!?!?! WTF!  --endrantonsoaringvegasdrinkprices--
