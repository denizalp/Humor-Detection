I could not remember if I had ever visited a Popeye's before in the past.  If I had it must have been a forgettable experience and could have saved me approximately $8 today.  I was out and about running errands and realized I had not eaten yet.  I was on my way home and thought I would check out this location, because I had never has Popeye's....or so I thought.\n\nI cruised into the drive-thru and was met with a voice on the other end of the squawk box purely going though the motions.  I ordered a #7.  This consists of three fingers, a side (I chose fries), and a drink.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised when I pulled up to the window, I thought the lad did his best.  He was polite and courteous when he told me they did not take American Express (all about the points), I gave him cash instead.  Another lad asked me if I would like some dipping sauce with my meal.  He was also polite and handed me my dipping sauce.\n\nOff I went....When I arrived at my domicile, and opened the box, I discovered where chicken fingers and fries went to die.  Every bite was cold and tasted of a chicken finger and fry graveyard.  I felt soulless and empty as I ate my soulless and empty meal.  I even mixed up my own version of a garlic and ranch sauce trying to play Dr. Frankenstein while attempting to resurrect my meal.  Alas, nothing could save it.\n\nPrior to writing this, I conducted a search of my previous reviews and discovered I had indeed eaten at another Popeye's location.  I did not like it.  I do not like this location either.  Based on two reviews of the franchise, I am sure I will never dine at another.  With other chicken finger locations in the valley....that are good and some great, NO MORE POPEYE'S.
