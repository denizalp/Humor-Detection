I looked on their official website and it stated they were open Sundays. (They're really not.) Called the number and explained to them that my laptop is running reallllyyyyyyy slooooowwwww and I might have a couple viruses on there. Basically it needs a good clean up. The owner, Lem, was such a sweetheart. He personally drove to the shop so he can meet me up. On his day off. What great customer service!!! He felt bad since his website wasn't updated. NOTE: they're still closed Sundays. Remember that.\n\nI was able to get my laptop back next day (Monday) by the end of business day. He charged $90 to clean up any viruses, adware, cookies + data....and all these other I.T. tech terminologies. He added two virus protection softwares to my laptop too. Now I gotta make sure I run it on a consistent base.\n\nThanks Lem for such great customer service! =)
