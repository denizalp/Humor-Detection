41-story condo on the corner of sahara & las vegas.  one distinct feature is the dish on the top.  so i've lived here for 2 months thus far and i love it!  the units are beautifully designed - if you're considering on living here, make sure to look at the 1+den layout.  it's about 1,100 sq ft with floor to ceiling windows and a deck with high ceilings.  there's a large pool and jacuzzi facing north, surrounded by cabanas and lounge chairs.  there's also a full gym and a media center plus an entertainment room.  the neighborhood isn't great but you never feel threatened in and around the building.  definitely a+ experience.  oh, last but not the least, there's coffee and pastry every morning in the lobby.  :)
