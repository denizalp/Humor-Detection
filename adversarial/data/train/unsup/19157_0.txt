The sushi was damn sexy.  But it was kinda like going out with a gorgeous girl, who's a bit of a princess and didn't have much to say.\n\nOrdered the Omakase and it was the first time ever having pressed. It was quite tasty, but the hand roll was tough.  Had to eventually try and swallow the whole thing in one bite.\n\nThe servers were all very nice, but it was quite slow.  Luckily we weren't in much of a hurry, but the pace could pick up just a tad.\n\nIt's a nice little spot, and I'll probably be back to giver another shot and hopefully can give a better update.
