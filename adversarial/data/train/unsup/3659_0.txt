A thrift store doesn't matter if I give it a million stars or one star, it's always changing! But today I dropped by, there was some good stuff, I was in a time crunch so I couldn't even go through it all. But what I did see, great jewelry selection, all the folks working were pleasant and it was super busy. I want to return first thing in the morning or the last hour my next visit and not on a Friday! Live and learn. There's bound to be something for you.
