BEST WONTONS EVER. Hands down. Large, plump, juicy, flavorful shrimp exploding from each one. Don't bother with any other noodle toppings--a mistake we made in attempt to diversify our food selection. Just straight up wonton noodles all the way for everyone. You'll thank me later. Very reasonably priced too!
