HORRIBLE! STAY AWAY!! If you are a tourist, GET OUT! They will charge you $50 a person to get in if you take your own transportation. They literally hand you a piece of paper with your form of transportation checked off and ask you to hand it to the cashier. Unbelievable! Also, if you enjoy Coca Cola with a \"splash\" of rum for an unbelievable bargain of $19 before tip, then this place is for YOU! Don't waste your time, the dancers aren't even anything to look at. I would much rather spend my time in Vegas watching paint dry. Sad!
