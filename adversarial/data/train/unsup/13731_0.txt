CRABFEST SCORE!!! Went in tonight with my hubby for my birthday dinner. Our server was a sweet young blonde lady. I wish I remembered her name because she was amazing! (I'm so horrible with names..grrrr)\n\nStarted with a peach tea! So refreshing and tasty. Of course we got those amazing cheddar biscuits. Light crisp on the outside and steamy soft goodness in the center. Those biscuits will beat any diet will power, I don't care who you are! \n\nWe both got the ultimate feast with a lobster tail, king crab legs, shrimp scampi, and sub the breaded shrimp for coconut shrimp. Everything was cooked to perfection and HUGE portions. I'm at the point now where I hate myself for eating so much but in the moment... it just felt so right! \n\nIt was my birthday so they brought out a scoop of ice cream that said happy birthday which was tasty. Perfect to share since we were both so full already. \n\nOverall everything was great from the food to the service. Not one thing I would of changed. I feel like the prices are very fair medium range for a huge crab\/lobster dish. Any other place would of been outrageous for the amount of food we got. Looking forward to coming back!
