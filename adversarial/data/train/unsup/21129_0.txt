Bouchon Bakery is a classic tourist trap in the Venetian on the Vegas Strip. I came to Bouchon Bakery one other time a year or two ago and the experience was so forgettable that I don't remember what I ordered or ate. \n\nThis time, they won't be so lucky.\n\nI ordered a ham and cheese croissant ($6.94) and requested it warm. Their version of \"warming up\" a croissant sandwich is apparently putting it in the microwave without actually turning the microwave on. Whatever treatment they gave it resulted in a \"smooshy\" and sad-looking croissant, but one with a decidedly cold filling. The ham was of the normal sliced deli variety. Despite being billed as containing dijon mustard, I couldn't taste any mustard. My eagerly-anticipated croissant ended up being nothing more than an unfortunate waste of emmenthaler cheese, and a waste of $7. I would have had a more satisfying croissant sandwich at Dunkin' Donuts.\n\nI also ordered the kouign amann ($4.16), which was not as bad, but also no better than the kouign amanns I get at bakery-chain Paris Baguette in San Diego for half the price. Rather than being rich and buttery, with a cake-like consistency, Bouchon's kouign amann simply tastes and feels like a large croissant with a caramelized top (or bottom, depending on how you plate your kouign amanns).\n\nMy pastries were accompanied by an iced latte ($5.32) that was poorly conceived and negligently put together, with my syrup of choice fully sinking to the bottom of the cup before I could even take my first sip. Middling chains from Starbuck's to Panera Bread to Coffee Bean have solved for this by using thinner, more soluble syrups, why can't Bouchon Bakery?\n\nAnyway.\n\nShame on you, Chef Keller. Understand that when you put your name on an establishment that serves food, your customers reasonably expect that establishment to represent your culinary ideals and perspective, regardless of whether or not you're directly overseeing the operation or engineering the menu. Your name has value, and people are willing to pay extra for that given your well-earned reputation. I have to believe that if one of your pastry chefs ever tried to serve anything of the quality I've had at Bouchon Bakery to your customers at French Laundry or Per Se, you'd fire him or her immediately for gross incompetence. Do the right thing and put this abomination of a bakery out of its misery -- your reputation is at stake.\n\nFood\/DÃ©cor\/Service: 1.2\/3.3\/NA
