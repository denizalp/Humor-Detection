Came in here on a Friday morning with an old friend, got seated promptly - wow did this place fill up fast. Got the corned beef hash and some orange juice - everything turned out great. Even though the restaurant was almost at capacity, the food still came out promptly.\n\nIf I had to pick one disappointing thing about my visit, it would have been that my friend's coffee got refilled 4 times while we were there without him asking whereas I was never offered a refill or even a glass of water after I finished my shot glass sized orange juice.\n\nAlso - I wish they would handle your bill at your table, but I guess they'd rather us just bring it up. I thought this was a little annoying. A good experience nonetheless. I'll get a coffee next time.
