Rare do we get authentic Vietnamese cuisine in the east end of Montreal.\n\nThis is the go to place when we want to eat some Vietnamese food so my mother doesn't have to cook for the whole family.\n\nI did hesitate between giving a 4 or 5 but I did recommend this restaurant to my Caucasian friends and they absolutely loved it and I think it deserves its 5\/5.\n\nA background of vietnamese music will play while you eat. You'll probably also get to see vietnamese customers order different items than what you have ordered! You can ask for extra piment on the side, and it's spicy as wished. My favourite is their canh chua aka aigre-douce soup!\n\nSo far this is the best vietnamese restaurant in east end of montreal !!
