Crispy Town is located inside Seafood city market on Maryland of Las Vegas. I have anticipated for grill city to open up recently. Crispy Town opened right at the same time as grill city located right next to each other inside Seafood city market. \n\nIt is set up as a food court, fast food ready to serve. Ordered their half calamari, lumpia and veggie lumpia. Everything was delicious. However almost everything is deep fried here except they do have entrees like pancit and meat choices. \n\nFriendly service.
