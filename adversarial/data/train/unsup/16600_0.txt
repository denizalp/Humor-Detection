I love the part where Yelp is like \"you've checked in here six times! what keeps you coming back?\"\n\nUh. \n\nAnyway. I do think that Global Entry these days have made this process much, much less painful than it used to be. However, It is still painful when you travel with family or friends who do not have global entry. You will wait in long lines, get repeatedly sent back for small mistakes on your form because the forms are confusing or you have a stray pen mark somewhere, and you will end up waiting forever regardless. \n\nEven when I did use global entry, at most other airports in the US upon entry, I don't go see a person just give my print out to the agent. However, here ... you still have to go line up to see someone. I don't understand the point of global entry if you still have to see someone. Meh.
