This may be the smallest of the Harrah's properties buffets, esp if you purchase one of those 24 hr buffet passes.\n\n It's pretty sad, because you'd think that Caesar's Palace should have a grand buffet, but it doesn't. I think this used to be a full-service restaurant that they turned into a buffet.\n\nThe selection at dinner was pretty slim...long line to get in (unless you have a Platinum, Diamond, or 7 Seas Rewards Card, then you wait in the \"special\" shorter line).\n\nBreakfast selection was pretty decent. How much variety can a place really offer for breakfast anyways? They had a carving station with ham, canadian bacon, and sausage, but the Carving Chef disappeared and was no where to be found.\n\nThe service was slow at dinner and breakfast. You wait a while for the Server to bring your beverage, I think we were done by the time they finally brought it.
