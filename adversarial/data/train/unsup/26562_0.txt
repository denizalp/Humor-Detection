Everyone seems to love Melt. Because my office in Independence overlooks the restaurant I have seen people come by the busloads, Pose and  take selfie's in front of the restaurant, and fight to the death to park in front of it. There is not much to say that hasn't already been said, it's a fun place with good food. Probably not a place where you want to eat every day but more of a destination restaurant. So the next time you come up to see the Indians in the World Series or to celebrate the Cavs winning another world championship, make a stop at Melt to finish off the day and you won't be sorry. And my hunch is that you probably will sleep very soundly that night.
