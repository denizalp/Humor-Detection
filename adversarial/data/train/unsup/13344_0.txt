When Globe Bistro first opened, I really tried to force my self to dislike it as Globe usurped what was once my beloved Cafe Brussels, home of a myriad of mollusk delights. \n\n Well I've had the pleasure of visiting Globe several times from its dawning and have ALWAYS been well impressed by its exemplary service, elegant relaxed surroundings and incredible food. \n\nMy first visit was casual as hubby & me were seated upfront close to the bar.  I ordered the Globe hamburger (mmm with smokey ketchup) and was feeling festive so I decided to order a Proseco too...mid way through my meal I had a fruit fly in my Proseco and I swear the bartender had x-ray vision 'cos as soon as he saw me inspecting my glass, dude like nearly jumped the bar to come ask if  there's a bug in it and if I wanted my Proseco replaced, which he did and then did not charge me for it which I thought was pretty awesome on their part.\n\nSecond visit was to eat on the roof-top patio and had a magnificently yummy cobb salad, very impressed with the slick patio set-up, arguably one of the best in the city.\n\nThird visit was for Winterlicious diner 2010. This time hubby and myself dined intimately on  the top floor overllooking patrons and murals of nude silhouttes while basking in the deliciousness of the Cornmeal Crusted Lake Huron Whitefish with prawn \"gumbo\" sauce , plus Cauliflower Moussaka  with Ontario buffalo mozzarella and to finish a Walnut Butter Tart Vanilla Chantilly, Muskoka cranberry preserve. All this amazing-ness for $35! Holy Hannah!!\n\n  I love and also appreciate that Globe's menu incorporates local and seasonal items so it is everchanging and supporting the local economy.\n\nWell Globe  I tried to dislike you but... you're good enough, you're smart  enough and gosh darnitt, I just like you!
