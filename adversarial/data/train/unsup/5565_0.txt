Is a place so mundane as a hotdog stand worthy of four reviews?  Well, hell yes!  It seems that yesterday I got a craving for some fine encased meats again.  Combine my love of such with my love of dining al fresco and good ol' Susan sauntered up to the convenient sidewalk take out window for a fine luncheon experience at the nearby square.  \n\nThe hot sausage specialty sure sounded tempting.  But I'm a chick who likes the basics.  So I got me a pure beef dog, small fries, and diet pop.  I learned the hard way when I was in Chicago to NEVER ever put ketchup on a hotdog.  With that lesson in mind, I smeared the red stuff over my fries.  Deelishus!
