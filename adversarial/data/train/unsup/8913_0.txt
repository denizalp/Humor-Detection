Yelp removed the photo of the illegal contract they tried to have me sign under duress, but here is a link to it For reference:\n\nhttp:\/\/angelaira1.blogspot.com\/2015\/10\/a-brothers-moving-contract.html?m=1\n\nIf you hire this company, here are your legal rights:\nThey cannot charge you more than their quoted price and hold your property on their truck until you pay the extra amount.\nGet the quote in writing, and print a copy in case you need to involve the police. \nBoth Art and Mitch will lie to you. Do not trust a single word they say. \nWhatever they quote means nothing and is a complete and total fabrication. \nThey insure for .60 cents per pound. They will tell you they will cover those Waterford crystal goblets at full replacement, but will not. \nThey will charge by the hour, and by the box. They will not bring enough boxes so the movers take longer waiting for those boxes they need. \nThey will not mention the supply charges in their quote. \n\nI could write a long, long, long explanation of exactly how bad this experience was. I figure just letting you know your legal rights so you know what to do if you hired these guys is probably warning enough. Don't be afraid to involve the police, and don't sign a non-disclosure. After they completely messed up every single aspect of my move, they graciously offered 50% off the supplies they left completely out of their original quote if I would agree to sign a non-disclosure (non-disparangement according to them, please see photo). I told them where they could shove it. They eventually agreed to honor their quote after 8 hours of very intense and stressful back and forth in the middle of an already stressful move. But only after they realized I knew my legal rights and planned to have my rights enforced.\nThe original quote was $1250 including everything with proper insurance, 4 movers, 8 hours. When they arrived an hour late the paperwork said $139 an hour plus supplies with no indication of supply costs. I ended up paying $1459 plus $70 for pizza for their movers, $15 for bottled water for their movers (the movers were nice and I felt bad for what their management was doing to them), and $200 cash tip to two movers who felt bad about all of it and stayed until 4 am to help me at least get my bed in place and get the big pieces out of my apartment. I finished the job in my car the next day, and paid an extra day on my apartment because of all of this.
