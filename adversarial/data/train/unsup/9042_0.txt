This is a really cute new restaurant that opened! I'm pretty bummed that I can't drink at the moment because all of their drinks look so amazing! I did order like a pina colada mock-tail and the bartender did a really good job on it. \n\nWe ordered their street corn and also shared the grilled hanger steak. The corn didn't have enough cheese and mayonnaise, so I almost always have to order extra everywhere I go. The steak was really good and extremely tender. My husband really enjoyed it as well. \n\nThey also have a really cute patio and customer service was absolutely great. I believe they also have a happy hour too so we'll definitely be back!
