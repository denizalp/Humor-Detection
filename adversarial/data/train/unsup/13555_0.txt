What a fun place off the strip.  I actually prefer this place over most places on the strip. The service is great, the drinks are delicious and the decor is fun and hip. \n\nWe initially came here on a Wednesday night and it was jam packed inside and out. Little did we know that on our girl's night out we stumbled in at the right time to enjoy Ladies Night. Call it dumb luck. The drinks were delicious and at half price even more delicious. Love how they bring your drink in a cocktail shaker that give you at least two fill in your martini glass. Oh and then there's Industry night on Mondays. Definitely a smaller scene than Wednesday but made for a great outdoor patio party. The dj was on point. \n\nI have loved every cocktail that I've tried here. My favorites by far are the Chyna Doll and the Summer Fling. Both are sweet, though not too sweet, and flavorful. I've tried my friends cocktails and seriously have yet to try one that I haven't liked.  \n\nSimply love this place. It's away from the whole casino\/strip scene which I appreciate and then to consistently have good service, great music and yummy drinks, how is one to stay away?
