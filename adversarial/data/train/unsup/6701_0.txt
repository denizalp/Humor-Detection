Here's the deal. I'm no club guy. I'm an old guy. This place was my first and last venture into a nightclub in the 21st century. Drug here by a childhood friend for a part of his little brothers bachelor party was just not something I envisioned. Was it fun? Fuck if I know. I was to busy looking at all the ass and trying not to feel like some kind of pervert. I wasn't trying to stare but holy cheee-rist times have changed. What they show you on TV and in the movies doesn't do this kind of scene justice. Are drinks expensive? Hell if I know.... I wandered around for 20 minutes just to find the pisser, finding an actual bar terrified me at that point. Drunk in this place would not be a happy thing if you were looking for someone. I have to go with 3 stars based upon it not really being my thing but for the most part young drunk people dancing and smiling don't rate 1 star.
