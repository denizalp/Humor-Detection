This place is trying way too hard to be cool; I wish they'd focus more on making great food. I asked the cashier what cut of meat they used in their burgers, and she said \"Angus\". Well, that's not a cut. So she asked her manager, who also replied \"Angus\". Wrong again. I expect an upscale, artisanal burger shop to know this kind of information. The fries and burgers were only average. I liked that their soda fountain dispenses real sugar Jones products. If you're looking for a great burger, I'd recommend SmashBurger then The Habit, in that order.
