Disappointing.  I love supporting local business, so when I veered into the neighborhood street to enjoy some local goodness, I was hoping for something as unique as the neighborhood that homes it.  The place was a quaint little shop, with a whole lot of sandwich selections, and the staff is friendly and welcoming.  I stood for a moment to peruse the selection and finally settled on an avocado BLT on seven grain to-go (I can't remember the clever name).  I also ordered a reasonably priced 32oz of freshly brewed tea (which was perfectly tasty).  The sandwich, drink and 'complementary' mini bag of chips came out to almost $10- a little pricey for what I got.  I eagerly opened up my sandwich to find a pretty small square of doughy bread laying over a meager melange of shredded iceberg, avocado, bacon bits and maybe tomato.  It was kinda gooey and I could hardly taste the yumminess I've come to expect with even the most modest BLT.  ...But nothing, it was so... bland!  For $10, I expected better quality ingredients.  If I go back, it'll be for the iced tea on the patio.  Sorry Ladybug.
