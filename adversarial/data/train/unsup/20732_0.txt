Damned that bad, no good, shady SOB lover of mine!  Not only do I go to strip clubs, but now I smoke tobacco.  Being bad has never felt so good.  LMAO!\n\nWe were able to walk in with no cover\/line.  It might've been because we were there in the wee hours of the night aka 10 p.m.  We became acquainted with Mister at the Hookah station and smoked Lemon tobacco all night.  Apparently, you need to cough up some $ to smoke, but my poor little lungs survived countless rounds of free hoooookahhh.\n\nDon't get me started on the view!  I swore up and down that I could fly when I leaned over the railing.  Luckily, we were able to sweet talk our way into a private VIP booth outside.  When it comes to the view, Voodoo definitely gives Moon a run for its money.  However, Moon provides the upscale environment.  It's sooo gorgeous that I recommend you at LEAST give this place a visit.  I wouldn't suggest partying all night here, since there are many other awesome clubs to visit in Vegas.
