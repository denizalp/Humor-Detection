We always had a problem finding breakfast when we lived here. That was before google though. This time google results on Nov system brought up this place. Hidden away in an industrial park beside the 401 just off Kipling.\n\nVery much a 1950s Diner complete with counter and chrome stools. The window ledge gad zero dust. And the ceramic pots and figurines sitting in the ledge also had zero dust.\n\n3 eggs ham toast and home fries was less that 6 bucks. The eggs are cookedmore or less the way you want them. Served by a friendly and efficient wait staff. Would definitely come back.
