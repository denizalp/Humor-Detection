Do you remember the Simpson's Halloween episode where a 50 foot tall Big\nBoy-esque statue with equally big donut is destroying Springfield a la Godzilla?\n\nI'm not saying that would ever happen but . . .\n\nwith DNA splicing and nano technology advancing at the rate it's going, it could\nbe possible to have a hoard of spidermen and women,\nand monsters from the movie Pacific Rim (does anyone else think that title sounds dirty?) walking around Toronto one day.\n\nSo when that day does come . . .\n\nand one of these giant Big Boys are searching The City for a ginormous donut,\nhe would simply stop by Krispy Kreme and pick up one there.\n\nKrispy Kreme donut is no joke!\nAnd in my younger daysin UAE, i have eaten dozens of them! I am not a dessert person but give me a donut and my sweet tooth comes alive.\n\nSo I opt for a regular sized chocolate glazed or caramel kreme crunch or cinnamon apple filled or powdered strawberry filled or chocolate ice kreme filled, and they were all so good\nthat now I'm thinking maybe I might have to have one of those  donuts after all.
