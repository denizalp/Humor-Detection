Unfortunately this place still does not quality for a decent review as the food is just mediocre, bland, and service is horrible.  You know you have a real issue when ribs are hard to get off the bone and don't taste good with rich flavoring.\n\nOur steak was cooked well done but tasted like rubber and the lobster tail was decent, but not the savory taste it should have been.\n\nTwenty minute wait for unworthy food is unacceptable in any manner and doesn't deserve a return visit.  What was I thinking?!
