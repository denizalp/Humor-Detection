I got ice cream here on a trip to Pittsburgh and LOVED this place. You are immediately greeted and the staff is so friendly, they talk to you a little bit about the menu and specials. The ice cream is delicious and looks amazing! They mix up the add in foods and cream right in front of you and let it freeze then roll it up. I got the s'mores and they offered to toast another s'more on top which I got :) It was so yummy, creamy, but toppings were still crunchy, everything was a perfect blend. If I lived here I would be here all the time!
