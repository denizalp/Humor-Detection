The patio is nice.  The food and drinks are awful.  The skinny margarita was sweeter than any house margarita I've had.   The waitress asked us if we wanted chips and salsa.  Sure....the salsa tastes like a can of tomatoes.  I asked for different salsa.  Sure....we got charged $5.  The food was terrible.  The chicken was inedible and they claim it's award winning.  It was the worst meal I've had in years.
