I must say that I ate the absolute best turkey burger ever here. Usually turkey burgers can be kinda dry.  The turkey burger here was moist, even succulent and beyond flavorful. It's huge so I shared it with s friend.  The assortment of different types of fries were quite tasty.  We sat at the bar so we wouldn't have to wait for a table.  The bartenders were wonderful especially a pretty blonde who gave us free shots bc my bf is a cop. Will definitely visit again.
