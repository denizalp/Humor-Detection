First of all, this will be the last year anyone will have a chance to play golf on the Las Vegas Strip. There are rumors the course will be replaced by either a large lake, another hotel, a playground (wtf?), or (hopefully) a football stadium for the Raiders.\n\nIt's expensive, but worth playing, especially in the hotter months like July (for the $). Just do an early tee time and you'll be done within 3 hours or less! This course plays pretty fast, and offers a well designed course by the talented Tom Fazio.\n\nThe course is beautiful and immaculate--easy to find your ball, especially since you get a caddy, which some were on the pro tour for years. They give you something like 8 water bottles and 8 Gatorades in the ice chests. You don't feel like you're in the middle of the Strip, it's so lush and green. Only indications are the tall hotels popping up here and there.\n\nThere's no beverage cart though. The driving range has a net, since space is of utmost value in these parts. I'd also expect a GPS tracker on the cart for the price you pay (but I guess that's the whole point of a caddy). However, given the price and exclusivity, we didn't feel rushed, were treated very nicely, and really felt like the only ones there!
