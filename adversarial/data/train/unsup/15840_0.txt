See this is what happens when I enter a dessert place: ....O_O. Oh, it was excellent. Cold & creamy, delicious, and unique! They have a variety of unique flavors in the back and they change it each day and add more to keep things interesting! Wow, we got to try a lot of gelato and it was all delicious! My favorite flavors had to be the Fat Elvis and the Coffee, which tastes EXACTLY like a coffee bean. With the larger sizes, you can even mix flavors! Also, they even serve other menu items other than gelato! Absolutely amazing. \n\nI just love this place so much. If it weren't so hard to park at, I would definitely go more often haha! The inside is small and intimate like a cafe, and just the perfect place to sit and enjoy!\n\nI'm OBSESSED! And now that I have liked their Facebook page (lol) I will definitely be stopping by more often! Art of Flavors is a dessert-lover's dream that every person should try at least once! So stop by and savor the flavor!!!
