The Bellagio Buffet gets 5 stars because this is truely \"as good as it gets\" in terms of buffets in Las Vegas.  If you have never been to this buffet you must go.  The selection of food is always fresh and high quality.  \n\nLike all the other reviews say the wait here can be very long.  I went and waited 40 minutes but it is incredibly worth it.\n\nThe service is pretty attentive and they will get you any drinks you want.  During brunch they usually offer $5 all you can drink Mimosas which is the perfect way to start the day in Las Vegas.  My drinks never ran low and there was no problem ordering coffee, orange juice, grapefruit juice, water, and of course the Mimosa all at once (it is a drink buffet too!).\n\nThe service at the buffet itself is great as well.  The omlette and waffle lines move fast and if you need something that you don't see you can ask any of the staff and they will get it for you.  (I couldn't find the yogurt at any of the bars so I asked a staff member and they brought it to my table for me.)\n\nI never felt rushed to leave even after my 4th and 5th plate.  I found that to be a very unique quality at restaurants in Las Vegas especially buffets.\n\nOne complaint would be that it can get loud in here when large groups come in but it is better than the sounds of slot machines.
