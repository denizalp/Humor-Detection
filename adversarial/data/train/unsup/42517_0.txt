I moved back to Vegas from California after living there for 5 years. While I was living there I became pregnant with my 4th son and went to 4 different OB\/GYNs never finding one I like. We decided to move back to Vegas and I'm so glad I did, Dr. Scarff being one of the reasons. I was already 5 months along when I started seeing him. Having experience (as this is my 4th child) I knew the routine but every pregnancy is different so I still had concerns and questions. Dr. Scarff always answered all of my questions quickly and thoroughly. When it came time to deliver (on Halloween!) Dr. Scarff was already at the hospital and came to check on me as soon as I was admitted.  From what the nurses told me he had already delivered three babies and had been at the hospital for hours - I couldn't tell, he came in smiling per his usual self. It was a quick delivery once my water was popped and he made everything look so easy!  \n\nA huge quality that Dr. Scarff has is his capability of making you feel comfortable. And on top of that my husband felt comfortable and really liked him as well. He is laid back and down to earth, making a stressful time (because it's not easy creating a life) easier and more relaxing.
