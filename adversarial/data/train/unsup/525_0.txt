Suite 701 has a trendy lounge vibe in upscale looking building. It's for a young and swanky crowd, for sure. I came here for dinner after the girlfriend suggested we dine here for Happening Gourmand.\n\nThe good aspects are the Beautiful decor, fantastic location by Place D'Armes metro, and really good ambiance. We had really good service from the get go. Firstly, the entree was delicious: goat cheese, spinach and roasted red peppers and garlic confit. Nice presentation (as expected from restaurants like this) and even better taste. 10 on 10 would order that again. The dessert was probably top 3 brownies I've ever had. Moist, rich and not too sweet, it was definitely another winner.\n\nI wouldn't say the main plate was bad, but it was definitely underwhelming. We have the smoked pan-seared king fish with quinoa and salsa. While at a glance it looks nicely plated, the taste is not noteworthy. It resembled a high end version of a typical meal prep. The fish was a bit dry, the skin was over salted, it just did nothing for me. The quinoa was a bit soggy and really didn't fit the the luxe vibe of everything on the menu.\n\nI was impressed with 2\/3 items on the menu, so I would come back again. The girlfriend speaks highly of the food here, so maybe I just had really high expectations.
