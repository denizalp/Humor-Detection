Over priced and under delicious.  Went on a Saturday afternoon, and the cupcakes tasted a little stale by the time I ate them 20 mins later!  They didn't really seem of \"cupcake shop\" quality, more just box mix with buttercream frosting on top.\n\nGood creativity with flavors, I'll give them that!
