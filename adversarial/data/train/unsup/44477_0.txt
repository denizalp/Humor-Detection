The guys that make you encounter upon ordering and get your food from are always cool. So are the cashiers. \nMy usual choices of food include the lengua tacos, but lately I've been hitting up their area for their carne asada fries. LOL. They fry those potatoes fresh, and they never come up greasy! Yum! Plus their toppings (ex. guacamole) is as fresh as can be. \nNice bar with a variety to impress at a taco joint, and I always hear the bartenders talking it up with patrons in their area. Overall, nice space to eat at or get your food to go.
