Would recommend this place. Food was good, especially for gluten free lol. Here on a Friday evening and there was one other table on the restaurant (likely due to the weather). Cute small place with a diner feel. We shared the empanadas (we chose beef, chicken and fish) and those were the best part of the meal. They came with two delicious sauces for dipping. Yuca poutine was not bad, could have used something else in it to pump up the flavour... maybe some meat haha! The owner recommended the beef arepa (pabellon) and it had solid flavour, came with fried plantains, avocados, beans, and cheese and small side of coleslaw. Red sangria special was pretty good to top it up. Service was a bit awkward with a new waitress in training but I will ignore that in this rating... Would try again and maybe have the tacos next time! Don't need to be gluten free to enjoy the food here :)
