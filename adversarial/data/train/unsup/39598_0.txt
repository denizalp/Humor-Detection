The venue is very nice. But they are unprofessional!. The \"event planner\"  for the venue Andrea that was supposed to be ordering my chair covers and chair sashes informed me a week before my shower that they have not been ordered. We picked out colors and how I wanted the sashes tied. She claim that there was a separate agreement and payment  for the sashes and chair covers but never informed me of that or never sent me the agreement for the chair covers or sashes. I also asked her if there would be draping on the stage she said that she would include it and days before my shower she said it was not included. I even have facebook messages proving what we discussed and agreed upon!!! My shower is this Sunday and im hoping everything turns out right! this whole experience with them has be stressful!!! She doesn't answer her phone and her mailbox is full so you cant even leave a message. Getting in touch with her is nearly impossible. i would never support this business or recommend them again!
