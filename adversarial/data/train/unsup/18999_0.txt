No words...well, almost no words can describe this place.\n\nI was doing my husband - a native Phoenician - a favor one evening and picked up dinner for him at Pete's Fish & Chips. He explained to me how everyone knows that it's just fish bricks, etc, but that the red sauce is on point and well, you have to be born and raised in Phoenix to \"get it.\" \n\nI'm going to assume that he's correct because, well, I watched them put a frozen brick of um, let's say packed fish, into a big vat of grease and then pull it out and stick it into a brown paper bag. The grease leaked through the bag and stunk up my car for a day or two. \n\nHonestly, I'm giving them 2 stars because of their length of time in Phoenix and being able to convince Phoenicians that what they're serving is fish and two because the drive-thru service guy was really nice.
