One star is for great service...but\n\nThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.\n\nThe definition of dining insanity is going to the same restaurant after you swore you would never go there again and expecting the food to be good!\n\nOn TV I saw... \"Fried Lobster Bites\" which are two things I love: lobster and a light crispy breading (or so the picture on the TV represented them as \"lightly coated nuggets of wonder\").   Shame on me... what I got were overcooked erasers with a breading that was so thick it could have doubled as arctic parkas for tiny Eskimos.  The sauce had broken down, the corn on the cobb was dry, and gritts like paste. \n\nI will now stop the insanity.
