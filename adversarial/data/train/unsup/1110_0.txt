Ode to Trader Joe's,\nI've loved to visit your shop,\nto give my pantry and cooking a pop!\nSome basics you've had for years,\nAnd now you even have wine and good beers.\nBlack Olive tapenade and Flax Seed Chips are my faves,\nPick up my top ten, I can throw a party and still save.\nKeep up the good work, hawaiian shirts and local foods,\nAnd you'll stay in my heart, wallet and never be boo'ed.\nLove,\nMe, \nLoyal customer for over 15 years.
