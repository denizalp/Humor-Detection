This place does an awesome job of processing film.  I have tried other places to develop 35mm rolls of film (such as Rtiz Camera), but they don't compare to the type of quality that you will get from Photo Shack.  \n\nThe only thing is that this place is a bit pricey, but it makes up for it from the quality and service.\n\nThe owners of this place are really friendly and nice people.  Also, this place is in a great location for college students, since it is right across from UNLV.
