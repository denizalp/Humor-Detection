I really love pizza and I consider myself a pizza connoisseur. There are many ways to make a pizza, however, only a few way to make one right! All the ingredients work together but only when they are in the correct ratio, too much of one or too little of another throws this delicate balance out of sync and ruins what otherwise would be a perfect pie. God knows how many times I have come to a pizza joint and they don't get this basic principle. \n\nL'Amore really puts their name to the test, making good pizza is a love and art form. I know what you may be thinking \"it's just pizza!\" But no my friends it's really not. Pizza is a simple but beautiful food, only if done right though. These guys make their pizza in all the right rations, with fresh ingredients, good service, great deals, and lots of love! I have tried one of all their signature pizzas and they are all good, you cannot go wrong with any of them! Bruschetta Bacon and gourmet are my top picks Mediterranean and Deluxe come a close second. I should also mention that they have a nice soda selection like pineapple and grape, which are not always offered in most places especially the pineapple (my personal favorite). \n\nI highly recommend this place the service is great but the pizzas are better.
