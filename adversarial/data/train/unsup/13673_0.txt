If you want a full set, please book 2 weeks in advance.  It's \"slammin\" as one of the managers confided.  Nice!  I imagine their reputation precedes them.\n\nSORRY, this is another review that got \"lost\" except for this little bit.  Seems Yelp doesn't back up their websites, so they can't restore all my \"lost\" reviews.
