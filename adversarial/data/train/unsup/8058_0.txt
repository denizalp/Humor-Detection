I love the strip district. I love walking, looking, smelling. It is everything and has everything Pittsburgh. There is plenty of parking (if you are willing to walk a few blocks) and there is so much to see. All of the street vendors and all the little mom and pop places that have been here for ages make an awesome feast for your senses. There are always lots of people (good for people watchers) and lots to taste. The flowers being sold are beautiful and the view of downtown (or as we say it dahntahn) is just extraordinary. If you are looking for something to do on a Saturday morning, come here. Always a fun time!
