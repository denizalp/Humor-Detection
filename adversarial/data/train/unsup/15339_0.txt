Chin's Pagoda is a Lake County landmark which makes this review difficult to write. I have been going to Chin's for over 30 years!! I have fond memories of sitting at the lounge waiting for our food while my Mom had a cocktail or 4 while my brother and I had our Shirley Temples. I digress. Let's get to the point. Chin's Pagoda is dirty. It is not clean at all. I actually tried to have a heart to heart with the owner and explain that he should clean the place up but he only became defensive. No cleaning measures were taken. The floor is dirty, the restrooms are dirty, the booths and menus are dirty and the front counter is stacked with old papers, and whatever else he can cram up there. It's a darn shame because Chin's deserves better. I really hope he cleans it up but until then, I will not be going back.
