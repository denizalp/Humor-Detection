I wish I had Alexander's experience.  Every time I come in, there's 50 people on the floor asking if I need help every 15 seconds.  Unfortunately, none of those 50 people know how to operate a register, and you'll wait in a line with 10 people and one cashier.  And let's face it, they are not the \"best buy.\"\n\nWell, we had a new beautiful console delivered yesterday, but no television yet.  I wanted to order from Amazon, but the Mr. had to have it \"today.\"  The problem is he was on call, which meant we couldn't be driving all over town.  Our closest Walmart is in the process of becoming a Super Walmart and had no Sonys or Samsungs.  Our second stop was Best Buy.  Of course, the one we chose was not in stock.  But here's where the 3-stars comes in.  The guy who helped us called all the other stores, without us asking, and when he struck out, offered to take $150 off the display model.  Since this model had been on clearance (although the price was no better than you would pay anywhere else), we declined and purchased an in-stock item.  He offered, but did not push, a warranty and was pleasant to deal with.\n\nWe did pay about $100 more than the Amazon price, plus the tax, but had the convenience of getting it immediately and comparing picture quality of several different models at once.
