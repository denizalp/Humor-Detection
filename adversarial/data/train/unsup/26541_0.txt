My friend had been talking about how great this restaurant was until I finally tried it. I ordered a chicken burrito and I was disappointed. The burrito was so small and the chicken was tough and burnt. I had a hard time eating it, but I made up my mind that I wasnt going to waste it because it was so expensive. If the chicken wasnt burnt and so tough it would of been a great burrito.
