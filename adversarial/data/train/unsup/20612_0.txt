Sandwiches here are great, the service is horrible. The owner apparently works the counter and treats people like crap.  I got the New Orleans burger, delicious. When I asked the owner for napkins ( you will need many) he said \" they are right behind you, did you want me to get them for you\"  as if I were lazy or stupid, I just didn't see them.  Advise to the owner, don't treat customers like your the soup nazi, there are sandwich shops all over town.
