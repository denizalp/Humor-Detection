Out of all the restaurants in the Wynn this is hands down my favorite restaurant. It is casual and all the dishes are superb. As a starter I love their hot and sour soup like no other! And as the entree I can order the spicy soft shell crab all day.  There is no going wrong with this restaurant. Wish I was in Vegas now this is definitely where I would be for lunch even for dinner!  Sometimes the wait can be annoying especially when you are hungry but its worth the wait in my opinion.
