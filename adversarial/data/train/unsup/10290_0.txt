As a self-proclaimed beef connoisseur, I'm always in search of that amazing steak that will just blow your mind.  Indeed, I browse the beef section at every market just to check the quality and marbling of their steaks.\n\nIn my mind, the \"perfect\" steak has always come down to a 28-35 day, dry-aged, USDA Prime Ribeye, cooked Rare to Medium Rare with a dash of sea-salt and fresh ground black pepper (What can I say, I'm a purist).\n\nTODAY, I say with good authority... that the perfect steak... is whatever they're serving over there at CUT.\n\nWell lets get some context - we started off the evening getting a couple of cocktails at the bar while watching USC football dominate Ohio.  I look to my left and who should be standing next to me?  WOLFGANG MOTHER-EFFEN PUCK!!!  Yes, Wolfgang Puck hangs out at his own restaurant and apparently was routing for USC - Go figure.\n\nAmbiance of the restaurant is great.  Suitable contemporary decor for a more modern steakhouse.  Lets get down to the food:\n\nTHE BAD:\nThe side dishes are horrible.  \nHerb Fries... absolutely nothing special.  \nCheese Polenta... quite disgusting.  \nCream of Spinach... not much better than what you can get in the Frozen food section.  \nFingerling Potatoes... are actually quite decent.\n\n\nTHE GOOD:\nThey have an amazing mult-course assortment of bread starting with breadsticks, baked cheeseballs, onion bread, and my personal favorite, the Pretzels.\n\nTHE AMAZING:\nIf you're not planning on having a steak, don't come here.  In fact, I'll take it one step further and say IF YOU'RE NOT PLANNING ON HAVING KOBE BEEF... DON'T COME HERE.  The regular USDA Prime steaks are great, but you'll find steaks of similar caliber elsewhere.  The two people who vouched for mere USDA Prime Ribeyes were torn with regret by not spending the extra $25 for the \"Kobe Beef\" upgrade.\n\nPersonally, I can only speak for the medium grade Kobe (American-Raised Wagyu cattle).   Unbelievable flavorful and tender  They say Kobe beef melts in your mouth, and honestly, it really does.  I tried a bite of my friends USDA Prime Rib Eye, and I SWEAR... after having a bite of Wagyu Beef, dry-aged USDA prime meat taste like Sizzler.  $85 for an ala carte 10 oz Rib Eye American Wakyu Steak may seem steep, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.\n\nMost people got the Taste of New York sampler which included 2 oz of Authentic Japanese Kobe Beef, 4 oz of American Wagyu, and 4 Oz of USDA Prime.  Of course, the purpose is show Americans how deprived we are by having mere \"steak,\" while our Japanese Friends have \"STEAK!\"  The taste of this Culinary sampler - $140 for 10 oz of meat.  Yep, $14 an oz.  \n\nBut according to all those who ordered the sampler, the difference between Japanese Kobe and American Kobe... is even bigger and more noticeable than the difference between American Kobe and USDA Prime.  In other words, I have still yet to taste the best of the best.\n\noh Wolfgang Puck, why must you torment me so with your ridiculously expensive, but oh so delicious cuts of Kobe Beef?\n\nThe total cost for 11 of us... almost $2,000.
