Cupcakes... they seem to be a craze that is not going out of style anytime soon... and I know that everyone and their mother couldn't wait for Sprinkles to open here in AZ!  \n\nI have yet to visit the shop, but I did get to sample the banana cupcake since I was part of the group that celebrated Halley's birthday.  It was good.  Great?  No.  Good.  $3.25 per cupcake good?  Personally, I don't think so.  But, it was good... and I think that part of the craze is that the cupcakes look fantastic... so cute and colorful, and they come in a variety of fun flavors (http:\/\/www.sprinklescupcakes.com\/flavors.html).\n\nFor a special occasion, I would get Sprinkles again, and I will go visit the store for sure, but am I blown away by Sprinkles?  Not so much!
