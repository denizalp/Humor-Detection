There were times during my experiences on Fremont street where I had to ask myself, \"Is this real life?\"\n\nIf you make the trip here at night get ready, because if you're not on drugs you might feel like you are. The sidewalk is littered with shady characters, not to mention of copious amounts of nude street buskers. The homeless denizens here are extremely aggressive, and I had all manner of profanity and slurs thrown at me. Luckily I was not too shocked, but was a bit surprised by how intense it got. The tourists are similarly ill behaved.\n\nMost of the casinos on Fremont are middling. I'd suggest Golden Nugget, the D and Fremont. They were the nicest ones I found. Definitely stay away from Binions, which reeks of a horrifying odor I will never forget as long as I live. Speaking of odors, the Fremont Experience has tons of horrible ones! You can't walk a few feet without a new bed smell hitting you.\n\nI've painted a terrible picture haven't I? It's not all terrible. There's definitely more character here than on the strip. The crowd leans towards young and hip, and you feel like you're in an actual city as opposed to a giant tourist trap. My biggest advice is know your limits before you come here. It's definitely not the sanitized strip. This is the real Sin City, and it isn't usually pretty.
