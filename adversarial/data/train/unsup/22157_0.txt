BLD, I'm doing this for your own good. My husband and I are huge fans of Cork, so when we heard you were opening a new spot and that we are located in-between the two, we were super excited. Unfortunately, we have been really let down. \n\nThe first two times I visited I figured they were just still working things out, so was trying not to be too hard on them. But, the sandwich I ordered was pretty greasy and the second time we visited the waiter apparently had nothing else to do, and checked on us an annoying amount of times. They seem to have way too many staff there, most who seem to be very inexperienced and nervous, which makes for an uncomfortable experience. \n\nYesterdays experience was unacceptable. We were sat at lunch, and then sat and sat some more. I kept trying to get the attention of anyone of the 5 servers who were working in our section, nobody even looked at us. Finally we had to leave because nobody came to our table after 15 minutes and hubby only has an hour for lunch. \n\nTwo stars because I have hope, we are going to let them work out the kinks and try again in a few months.
