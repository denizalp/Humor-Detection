I found Jewelry Judge on Yelp and was  extremely satisfied with the service I received from Joel. He gave me a little history on my earrings and I appreciated how knowledgable and seasoned he was with diamonds. I was done in about 30 minutes with the appraisal in hand. Many appraisers in Las Vegas have you come back in 24 hours or longer to pick up your appraisal. Joel was efficient and very pleasant to interact with. I will recommend him and be back when I need another appraisal.
