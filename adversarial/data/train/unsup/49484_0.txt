Eat here.  My wife and I came here for breakfast.  I ordered the crisp berry french toast and she ordered the corned beef hash benedict.  The food has a special combo that cannot be matched in Los Angeles.   Portions were excellent and not small at all.  If you live in the area, go there. It's amazing.
