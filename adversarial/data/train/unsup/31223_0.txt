Troy came to our house to install a ceiling fan.   I emailed him on his website and he emailed me back pretty quick to schedule an appointment.\n\nHe came right on time which is very important to me.  He was very friendly and helped us with another small project before he left without charging me too much extra.\n\nHe also was very honest with his opinions about other things we wanted done with the house.  With his advice we probably saved a few thousand dollars!\n\nI am going to be using his services for other projects around the house.\n\nHighly recommend Troy!
