The second night of our stay at this hotel our hotel room was COMPLETELY ROBBED OF EVERYTHING.  Suitcases, laptops, and toiletries everything we brought for a week's vacation.  My SUV was also stolen from the property parking lot the same evening with more luggage in it that we had not even had a chance to unpack yet because we just had gotten there.  This place is beyond unsafe!!  The hotel took ZERO responsibility, the staff was unprofessional and unsympathetic.  Security was pathetic and the front desk manager simply said, \"I am sorry.\" WE LOST EVERYTHING AT THIS PLACE.  I have extensively travelled all over and NEVER had a more horrific experience at a hotel.  NEVER EVER CONSIDER STAYING AT THIS PLACE! You will regret it for the rest of your entire life.
