I came here with a group of friends from Mississauga just to see how different this place can be from all the other lounges out there.\n\nService: Only one server was running the floor which was causing long delays in our food order. However, the server was very nice to everyone in our group. \nIt seemed like the other kitchen staff were just hanging out at the lounge after they delivered the shishas till the next order came through rather than assisting the server on the floor.\n\nFood: This came to me as a big surprise for a place that would be hosting a Yelp! event soon. The food was very bland and lacked flavour.\nThe fries seemed soggy and were drenched in salt.\nThe rest of the food which took 45 minutes to come through for 4 people was unimpressive. You could taste\/feel the frozen not fresh vibe.\n\nShisha: I always order one flavour and it was a hit!\nThey have a few selections and everyone seemed to like it in our group.\n\nPrices are average and be sure to check out the Yelp! offer after checking in. There are places out there that do not compromise on food quality and unfortunately today we were left dissatisfied with the quality here.
