I've never been wow'd by pizza but we were at the Palazzo and we wanted to try Grimaldi's.  Grimaldi's has a reputation of being great pizza and located in the mecca of thin crust pizza. Grimaldi's serves coal fire brick oven pizza and known for freshness including handmade mozzarella. \nLocated at the northern portion of the Palazzo, the restaurant was a bit dead with very few customers in the late afternoon. There was only two of us so I ordered a 16\" pizza. Pizza comes in 3 sizes and comes with red, white, or pesto sauce. For toppings, we decided to have pepperoni, meatballs, Italian sausage, and bacon. \nThe pizza came out piping hot. Overall, the pizza was good but not great by any means. You can definately taste the freshness of the mozarella, the good flavor of the sauce, and the quality of the meats were very good. \nFor two, we ate about 3\/4 the pizza. Just the right serving which would be better for 3 since we overate some slices. Overall, service was just okay. Pizza was good but by no means wow'd me.
