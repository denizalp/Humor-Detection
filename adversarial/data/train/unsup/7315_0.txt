I made a wrong turn to avoid an accident scene on Baseline Road...GOOD THING! I found Panchos!  This place is super cheap and super delicious!  I usually order the El Crudo burrito ($6.45 only!) and I love the Mole sauce!  The burrito is stuffed with Machacha beef and comes with rice and some lettuce...the sauce is the best Mole sauce I have ever had.  \n\nI have never had to wait for my food. Although the parking lot can get packed. This place is amazing. if I'm ever in phoenix again on business I'm going here!  \n\nLove it. \n\nbtw, I was on  mission to find some bomb ass Mexican food and was somewhat disappointed. People kept referring me to Filbertos.  WTF Go to PANCHOS!
