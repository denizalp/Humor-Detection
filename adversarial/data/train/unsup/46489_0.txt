Jus food this place and I'm in love! That laksa soup! I can't seem to find it any where eles! There is only one place I know that makes it better and it's in mtl called satay brothers!\nThe amount of option you get! From topping to noodle to soup to drink.... \nMust try and for 10$ u will be stuffed!!! \nDecor is nice, only thing is they try ad group every one together even if there is room in the restaurant, also they don't care if u eating they will clean and mop right around you! Not so classy
