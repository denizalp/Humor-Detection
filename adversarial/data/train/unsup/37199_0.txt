I want to start off by saying this happened four years ago so I am not sure if they have changed since then. I went in to get my car checked out because it wasn't starting and I had no idea why. The mechanic called me with a quote for $850 and said that the distributor needed to be rebuilt along with warranties and fees etc... The sad thing is if I had had enough money to fix it then I probably would of paid it. I didn't have the money so I told them that I would come back to get the car. I went back with AAA and they towed the car back to my house. I went and looked under the hood and to my surprise my car was torn apart. They had not put anything back together that they took apart when diagnosing it. I had no idea what fell out and what stayed on the ride home because some pieces were just loose laying in different spots in my engine compartment. Well I ended up having to go back down there and talk to a manager who told me they would put it back together for me(I was a bit reluctant at this point to trust these guys with my car but I didn't have much of a choice). They put it back together and had my car towed back home. I ended up researching the problem on auto MD and it said that it was the distributor cap and rotor that needed replaced($20 as opposed to $850). The problem was the screws that were holding them together before were gone because my car wasnt put back together. I ended up having to send away for the screws from toyota. I put the cap and rotor back on and VOILA IT WORKED! There was nothing wrong with my distributor and I was so happy to have saved myself from getting completely screwed by these guys. By the way, They still charged me for the Mis-Diagnostic. Please don't go here it will cause you a lot of unneeded stress in your life. There are way more honest mechanics out there.
