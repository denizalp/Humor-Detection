Everything with Wedgewood was AMAZING!  Our first meeting was with Megan.  She was very thorough and really nice.  We let her know we were still looking at venue which she respected.  She followed up with us a week later (which no other venues did) and we booked immediately.  They gave me a great binder with all kinds of useful information as well.  Every time I had a question, they responded within 24 hours, usually within the day.  Desiree joined their team and was just as helpful.  They were totally alright with me adding and deleting different options every time.\n\nFor the rehearsal, they were amazing once again. They were open to our ideas and great with our large group.  \n\nOn our wedding day, everything when perfectly.  Everything was set up and ready by the time I arrived (2 hours prior to ceremony).  Both Megan and Desiree kept checking on everyone to make sure we had everything and were once again, amazing!  When I went down to start our first look photos, Alexis made sure I had whatever I needed (wine and water!).  The ceremony went perfectly and everyone loved the food and open bar for the cocktail hour.  CJ and Mark did an awesome job keeping everyone happy!  Alexis, Brian and Makayla made sure out entire bridal party (including parents) always had food and drinks and anything else we may have needed all through the night.  We also thought we would have to take down all the decor that we had provided but they took everything down and had it ready for us in the morning which was such a relief.  \n\nI am so impressed.  I highly recommend booking with Wedgewood, they are awesome!
