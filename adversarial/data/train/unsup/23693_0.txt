Don't see this show....it is SO boring. I literally was dozing throughout the entire show. We got our tickets from a ridiculous time share presentation (were promised Ka and got bated and switched to this POS), so at least we didn't pay for it, but this show was just boring, had no discernable plot (maybe an angry fetus? not sure), had no impressive acrobatics...just don't waste your time and money.
