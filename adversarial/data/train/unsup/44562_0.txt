SLOWEST DRIVE THRU EVER!!! Waited 20 minutes in the drive through for a damn burger after I was blocked in... It was like 7:30 and it wasn't like this place was popping off, there was NO ONE inside. What happened to FAST food. This isn't the only place where service is lacking, but another to add to the list.
