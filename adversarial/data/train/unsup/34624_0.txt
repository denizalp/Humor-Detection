This is an average salon with a language barrier. I came in for a polish change and they walked me over to the pedicure seats. I told the lady that I'm only getting my finger nails polished and she says \"okay\" and to stay seated at the pedicure chair. Hmmmm.... okay. Maybe you know something that I don't know. Eventually, she figured it out and I was seated in a regular chair. I chose two colors. One they had, one they didn't have. However, I wasn't informed that one of the colors wasn't available until she finished the base and I asked her about the sparkle overlay I asked for, only for her to then tell me the that they didn't have it. Sigh....  I had to have about 4\/5 coats of the nude color that I wanted, but had to continue to ask for another coat when her eyes are as good as mine and she can see that I can still see my actual nail so another coat will be necessary. That being said, there was no attitude given and she was find with the extra coats. Another patron ruined the mood by loudly talking on her phone THE ENTIRE time that she was getting her nails done. Completely annoying, but that's out of the business's control. The music here is relaxing. Pop songs on flute.
