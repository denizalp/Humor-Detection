Was craving a soda pop & popcorn for a movie night, so we decided to go to Pop Drinks. The place was really quiet, but the employees were nice and welcoming. We ordered a 32 oz of Sprite with the flavors of mango & orange. It's pretty delicious! The best part was while you're checking in with the Yelp app, you can get a free large popcorn! This completed our movie night. Great drink and buttery popcorn!
