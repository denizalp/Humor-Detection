I went in today and the service was really good. I'm glad they've made improvements.\n\nI've said before, I really want to love this place. The ambiance is just great. The coffee is REALLY GOOD. The food is good. The outdoor patio is AMAZING. You dont feel like your sitting in a parking lot. But every time I'd come in, the service was either extremely ride or just shitty. But I tried it again and I'm glad I did. There was a staff of 3 working and they were all great. Fast friendly and personable
