I was very disappointed in ATL Wings. I am a native Alabamian and the food here was not up to snuff. The waitress seemed to be upset with me as if I had slept with her boyfriend or husband. There was a young man there who was going to provide me with a ranch and she said, \"No, that is going to cost 75 cents.He shrugged his shoulders sorry. I paid the 75 cents. But that was the LAST amount of any money ATL will EVA get from me... and the food was not that good. Blah!
