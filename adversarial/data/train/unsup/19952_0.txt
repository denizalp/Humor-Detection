Three floors of shoppes. THREE FLOORS of them. That is what this place is. If you like shopping at major retailers, this is one place to do it. The indoor mall is usually filled to the brim with people. To my recollection I can't think of one particularly great store that stood out for me. They have the usual, like Foot Locker, Forever 21, H&M, Sears, etc. At the time I was just enthralled at the prospect of having 3 floors of shoppes to stroll through. Now, looking back at it, most of those shoppes are ones I can drive to closer to home than making a trip cross-country for.  If you are in Toronto, you should visit this place, just to say you were there. If you are thinking of going to Toronto, this place should NOT tip the scales for a reason to go there. \n\nOh, and FYI- I'm going to be SUPER nice and tell you that Yonge is pronounced Young. Americans look silly as hell when they say- \"yawn-g?\".
