I can't believe I ate the whole thing.\n\nThe great thing about eating BBQ in places in the South such as Memphis & Nashville is that I now know what good BBQ is. The bad thing is trying to find good BBQ in the Desert. Luckily a couple years back I was introduced to Lucille's  BBQ. Their food portions are great from your meal to your dinner salad or sweet tea you're gonna be set. Though not usually a Sweet Tea fan I always start things off here with one because they really have the mix just right and it adds to the whole BBQ experience ; )  They always hook you up with complimentary biscuits & butter which are very addicting if you're hungry and not paying attention. My Girlfriend ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer which is apparently a big favorite here and definitely worth a try. Then without warning a giant slab stockpiled with food is dropped off in front of you as you're informed that's your meal. I ordered one of many different BBQ combinations they offer and my plate had a Spicy Hot Link which is a personal favorite of mine at Lucille's, in fact I'll usually order it on the side if it's not included with my meal so needless I strongly back this item if you don't mind a little spice. Pulled Pork which was very moist & tasty, and BBQ Chicken which this time was pretty dry when usually it's excellent. The kid in me always has to get a side of Mac & Cheese and I went bananas when I found out they had sweet potato fries. The fact that the fries were amazing confirmed I was not dreaming. If you live in Vegas it seems that not enough places have\/have good sweet potato fries so bonus points for Lucille's! but it's been 5 hours since my dinner and I still can't believe I ate the whole thing.
