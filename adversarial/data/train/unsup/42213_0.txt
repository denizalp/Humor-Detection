We just took a family weekend trip to PHX and my husband and I wanted some adult time but were very nervous about leaving our toddler with someone new. We were given Jenny's name at Caring Nannies from a trusted friend so we contacted her and she put our minds at ease that our daughter would be in excellent hands, while we got out for the night. The nanny Jenny sent for us, showed up with a huge bouncy ball and bag of other fun toys and books and our daughter's eyes lit up and she walked right up to the nanny without hesitation. She warmed right up to her and we felt great about leaving her. The first night went so well that we asked for the nanny to return an additional night before we left town. It was an excellent experience and we are grateful to have been able to get out twice with friends while our daughter was having fun and being entertained with a professional nanny. Jenny was prompt in responding to our needs and we will be using Caring Nannies again for our next visit!
