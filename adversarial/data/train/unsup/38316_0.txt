I went here twice in three days.  That's normal, right?\n\nOn a Saturday, I went in for a little snack to go.  I wanted to check out their Siu Mai (pork dumplings and shrimp) and their potstickers.  Both were amazing.  My wife and kids and I gobbled it up.  The Siu Mai had a balanced seafood and pork flavor.  The potstickers (pork and vegetable) were a perfect crispy texture but not dripping with oil and incredibly tasty.\n\nSo, on Monday, we ventured back but went for a sit down meal.  Here's what we ended up with:\nPork Soup Dumplings ($9)\nPork and Vegetable Potstickers ($8)\nVegetable Dumplings ($9)\nShrimp, Pork and Vegetable Wontons - Szechuan Style ($6)\nTaiwanese Style Sesame Cold Noodles - ($6)\nSide of steamed rice - ($2)\n\nI thought the veggie dumplings were just meh.  But everything else was just perfect.  Be sure to try the pork soup dumplings and their potstickers!  A real surprise was the Taiwanese sesame cold noodles.  I liked the peanut and vinegar balance.  It's not for everyone but I really enjoyed it.\n\nWe finished up at $52 with drinks, tax and tip.\n\nService was friendly and attentive.  We were seated in a long bench facing where the dumplings were being made.  Talk about dinner and a show!  This was a ton of fun for the kids and our whole family ate well.  Can't wait to be back again!\n\nThe only knock about this place - it's too small!  There are only about 36 or so seats in this place and if you don't get there early, you will be waiting for a while.  We got in right as lunch was picking up and no wait for a table.  Others coming in after us were not as lucky - so be aware.
