This was my second visit to Scottsdale and the first restaurant on our trip to dine at. My first thought very cool, hip, trendy, and poppy with the music. I hear Mastro's is supposedly up there with Morton's, Myron's, and Ruth Chris. Nope... it is not. Sadly, dinner was so disappointing my other half didn't want to deal with management and the poor service that was provided to us.\n \nThey originally put us in the back corner near the kitchen and the busy walkway from the kitchen to dinning area. What moron put's customers there? Why? Would you sit there? I mean I would put people who did not make RSVP there, yeah sure. So, we told them to find us better seats away from heavy traffic. Great they were able too. \n\nService started off strong, but then just fell flat before the main course. Bread crumbs on the table and nothing was cleared. We ordered a bottler of wine, soup and salad, ate it, and was still sitting in front of our faces until the steak came to the table, and they just moved it to the side. Oh so you just leave the empty salad plate and half eaten soup bowl there? Do you want me to take it back? They plopped the porter house steak in front along with the sides and walked away. Hmmm...I know others places cut the steak for you, and ask what cut do you want and even serving you the sides. But what do I know maybe this is a DIY wanna be bougie steakhouse? \n\nI've had way better and excellent service at Gordon Ramsay's in Vegas, service all around from each staff member was exceptional. But Mastro's? What happened? I guess Shaima H. is right maybe they are discriminating... other than the steak was not good, and very chewy. We had a hard time deciding about tipping and all. It was the worst steakhouse experience ever. I mean I know for a fact I can get better service and steak at Outback.
