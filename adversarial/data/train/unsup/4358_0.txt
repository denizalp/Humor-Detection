Personally I don't know what everyone is talking about.\n\nI usually go on the 18+ nights (Thursday is 18+) (I'm not into cougars; I'm 21) \n\nand as far as 18+ clubs go in the Scottsdale, Myst is the best.  and I could sum it up for one reason it is this.\n\nif you are 18 and want to go to a club, go to Myst.  The water is FREE.  if you go to Afterlife (which is in the same area) they will charge you $3 for a glass of water.  WTF.
