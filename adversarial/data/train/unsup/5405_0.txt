AMBIANCE:\nCame in here and was greeted by everyone who worked there. And the old lady who I think was the owner smiled and showed our group of nine to our table. It felt like a family friendly kind of place because most of the people were there were families! It wasn't as loud as I expected to be, it was actually pretty quiet. Which earns them a star!\n\nFOOD CHOICES:\nThe selection of meat was a lot, but not so much on the other already cooked dishes. I really like their fried rice and they had some huge ass dumpling like thing that I really liked. When I ate the calbi ribs, it had a lot of flavor also the chicken was still tender and juicy after being cooked really well. The only thing that irked me was that the food selection didn't have names of the dishes displayed, which kept me guessing half the time as to what the dishes were.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe waitress was attentive and friendly. She even helped cut the calbi ribs for our group. She also made sure that our glasses were always full and always asked if we needed anything.\n\nOverall I had a good time here, I ate until I felt my stomach was gonna explode lol. Definitely give this place a try.
