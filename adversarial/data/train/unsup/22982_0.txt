Went shopping at Trader Joe's to get a few items to make some dinner.\n\nThe store was well stocked and they had a very large wine selection. They also had lots of fresh produce and other grocery items. The aisles were a little on the narrow side so there wasn't much room and we had to keep stopping and letting people through etc.. \n\nThe staff were helpful and check out was quick and easy.
