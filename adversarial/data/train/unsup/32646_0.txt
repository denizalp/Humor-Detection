Despite the customer service issue reported by a previous Yelp member, I decided to give NPS a shot based on the more positive recent reviews...big mistake.  The employee I dealt with became rude and condescending the minute I couldn't tell him the exact gallon capacity of my pool.  It got worse from there, and when it became apparent that I wasn't a pool maintenance technical expert, the holier-than-thou attitude got turned up to 11.  At no point during my interaction with this particular employee was he polite, personable, professional, or, heaven forbid, helpful. When it became obvious that my experience at NPS was going to continue to be eye gougingly painful, I told said employee I wasn't interested in further dealings with him and left.  All I can say is, wow! I've never experienced such poor customer service anywhere in Vegas...so, unless you're craving attitude from a strip mall clerk with a massive Napoleon complex, I highly recommend looking elsewhere for your pool supplies.
