\"Wahoo. The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter, and then there'd be this one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook perfect, just perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was *it*. And *that's* what Dad had us looking for, man.\"\n- Mike\n\"The wahoo moment?\"\n- Kyle \n\nMy Personal Vegas Ratings (2 Options):\n5-Star or 1-Star \n\nI think I had a Wahoo moment at Cleopatra's Barge...  That could have something to do with the 3 days and 40 NCAA Bball games of Drunk'n Parlay Enduced Emotions we went through prior to putting on our Suits (or our friends Dapper-wear) and hitting up Cleo's Barge... No cover, No line, but packed dance floor... anyways:\n\nIt's Vegas... if you are not having a 5-star time with your friends and\/or loved ones... you just are not doing Vegas right...\n\nYou win all your bets... ahh Vegas\nYou lose all your bets... ahh Vegas\nYou pay $10 for a bud light... ahh Vegas\nYour $10 bud lights gets knocked out of your hand... ahh Vegas\n\nIt is all part of the experience... had a good time: 5-Stars
