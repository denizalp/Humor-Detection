This will be one of my favorite timeshares. We don't own here, just traded in and it was our first stay. Members of our party have stayed here before and recommended it as one of the better timeshares and I agree.\n\nThe units are big and clean and very comfortable. The mattress on our bed was just right. The kitchens are nicely equipped. The staff is friendly and helpful. They do try to get you to view a presentation but just say no and they let up and don't bother you.\n\nThe workout facilities have a weight-training area (all machines, sadly there are no free weights) and a cardio area (treadmills and elipticals). You can walk right next door to the South Point to see a movie or visit a restaurant, although I didn't like anything at the South Point as much as I loved the food at the restaurant across the street (the Boulevard Bar and Grill).\n\nI would definitely come back to stay here. In fact, I would've given this place 5 stars, but they nickel and dime you for wifi, which to me is just ridiculous. Come on!  Hotels and timeshares need to realize that fast, free internet access should be just as freely available as cable TV. \n\nSo if you do want internet, you can pay daily at $10\/day, or get a discounted rate for 3, 5 or 7 days. I can't remember what it cost for all the plans, but the 3 day rate was $25.
