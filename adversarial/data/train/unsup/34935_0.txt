Tough to review because I loved it so much under its prior owner. The food is different but still good (not as good, but with more options).  The new owners are kind and generous, but a number of things are a bit awkwardly done.  Cappuccino was not nearly as good - not sure why, but it wasn't. Cinnamon roll wasn't even close, but it was nearly the best in town before.  Service was very friendly.   4 stars is probably being too kind, but I think the bar might have been set artificially high by how well the prior owner prepared the food, etc. Nevertheless, that's my review.
