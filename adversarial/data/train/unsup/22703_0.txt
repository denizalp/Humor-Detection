Looking for a pre theater dinner, Thai sounded good and we decided to give Basil Thai a shot.\n\nThe dining room is upscale and has a nice warm feel to it. I really liked the marble tabletops and fell in love with the water glasses - I know - weird. The corner location is kind of fun for people watching as well.\n\nI am a big fan of Chicken Larb - and theirs was really good - just the way I like it with lots of cilantro, lemon and just the right amount of fish sauce. We were able to substitute lettuce for cabbage with no problem.\n\nProbably the best thing we had was the Tom Kha Gai soup - served in a hot pot with a sterno flame for a truly snazzy presentation. I'm used to Tom Kha broth having quite a bit of chicken broth in it with a little coconut milk - this was mostly (if not all coconut milk) and was delicious. The portion was large enough to where we each had three small bowls of it.\n\nDeciding between Green and Red, the Green was recommended. The flavors were great. I do agree with others comments that the curry portions are a bit on the small side but between splitting the three dishes between us, we were stuffed.\n\nThe Jasmine tea was awesome - I think I drank 3 or 4 pots of it. I was so jazzed (no pun intended) I could done 100 or so jumping jacks.\n\nLaura - take a bow and thanks for taking great care of us!! Fresh plates, silverware, ice water and tea water - she was on top of things and we wanted for nothing. Her timing of ordering and bringing out dishes was excellent - we felt relaxed and everything was served hot and fresh. And it's okay that you don't know who Janeane Garofolo is - I just have to remember I'm getting old. LOL!
