Defalcos is more of a small Italian store than a restaurant, but it is definitely an awesome place to get authentic Italian food.  I tried the Half portion meat lasagna which comes with a side of garlic bread. If you order the full plate, it comes w a salad. But the half portion is enough to feed any appetite.\n\nThe sauce was amazing and the Lasagna had tons of cheese with homemade sausage which literally made me tear as i was eating this meal. Will return many times as i have found a hidden gem.\n\nPlace was also clean. Not a big dining area, thats the only negative. They would be wise to expand this place as the food is amazing. 5 stars easily!!
