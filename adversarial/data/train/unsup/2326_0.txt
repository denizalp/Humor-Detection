Easily the best pizza slice at 3am on The Strip!  \n\nIf you can find it in drunken stupor by yourself, get two slices. You can't be that lucky twice, so get it now. \n\nGMonkey do:\n\nWHITE- cheeses and garlics!  It'll actually make you smell better. Delicious, to be exact. \n\nThe sausage look good. Meaty. All pizzas offered here are of thin variety, but good size, with enough crust to easily handle without cheese sliding off and you staring at floor. \n\nDefinitely recommend getting whole pie for the four of you. Can wrestle for extra slices on carpeted area. Just move furniture. Plenty of space for vloggers to record action. Just don't do inside pizza joint. We all need access to pizza.
