This place is awesome, the best sandwiches there are in the Valley!  If you don't try it, you are missing out on something great!  I promise you, you will love the food, the people and the place!\n\nI never know which sandwich to pick that is the hardest part!  I have tried almost everyone of them and the food is the best around!  Mark my words, you will be happy you went there!\n\nTell Jodi and Dave Jill \"aka the bratt\" sent you!  :)
