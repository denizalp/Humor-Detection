I think they are putting out some creative, tasty dogs, but I never want to live in a world where a regular-sized hot dog costs $4-6. Somebody make it stop. Even the lunch special of 2 dogs + soda for $10 makes me cringe.\n\nThe San Francisco BLT dog was surprising and we really enjoyed that the best (sounds weird, but go for it). The madison shop dog is good, but all you really taste is the beer cheese. TBH, I'd skip the KC ruben dog.
