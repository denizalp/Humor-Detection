The show was entertaining, but reallyyy confusing :( I seriously had no idea what was going on... lots of WTF moments.  The music was great, of course, but the storyline was so hard to follow!  If you are a Beatles lover, this is a must-see of course, but if not, I think this is a Cirque show that you can miss.
