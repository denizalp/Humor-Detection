I don't think I've given a 5 star review in a mighty long time but my goodness I LOVE this place!! I've been twice. It was love at first bite but I didn't want to be deceived so I decided to give it another try before writing my 5 star review. \n\nThe first time I dined here I had the Quad City Melt and the soup of the moment. Delicious! The Quad City Melt was soooooo good. I stopped in today for lunch and ordered the Fall Leaves salad with red onions and dried cranberries. Holy crap!! Try it!! \n\nHappy hour is served daily from 11am - 6pm. Do not skip the red sangrias and the peach Margaritas, by far some of the best. $6.50 a pop, regularly priced at 7.50 and 8.50.\n\nThey feature a lunch combo (1\/2 salad and 1\/2 pasta, 1\/2 salad and soup but you can't order a half sandwich and half salad). That's the only bummer for me, besides that. It's by far one of my favorite spots for lunch!! Oh ... if you want to add chicken to your salad know that it's baked, no or grilled. I'm not big on meat in my salad but if I do I prefer it's grilled
