This place used to be good, but recently I have noticed the quality in the sushi has gone down, in addition to the wait staff.  \n\nThe sushi chef is not trained well on the specialty rolls and has to check the menu or ask the waitress for the ingredients.  I had ordered a fried roll, from which a shrimp tail was rolled into the middle of the roll. This is pure lack of skill on sushi making.  In addition to lack of training, the time to make a roll when there were a total of 2 tables in the restaurant was about an hour.  The wait staff is also pushy and slow.  Overall, not a good experience.
