I love my new floors. I had Epic porcelain tile installed on my main floor. The team worked very hard from 8:30 am to 7pm, installed about 860 sq feet of tile & completed the job in 3 days as promised. I am very satisfied & happy with the quality of the product & the installation. I shopped around 6 places & the others were way over priced. Some had the same porcelain tile but charged about $15.99 per sq feet for the product & installation. Affordable flooring met my expectations with the products they offer & quality of work. Travis the owner was very friendly & personable. Highly recommended you use them!!!
