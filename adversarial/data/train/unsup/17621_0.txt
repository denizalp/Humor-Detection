For those who don't already know, I have been on a hunt for the best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. While I still have a few more places to visit before my quest can officially become complete, I can say that this is by far the best AYCE sushi house I have gone to-date. \n\nTelling from my experience as well as what other reviewers say, this place is always crowded with people. We sat in a small table in the center of the restaurant and we could definitely feel how busy all the waiters were getting orders around in a full house. Although there were so many customers, my date and I got out orders at a quick pace. \n\nThe waiters and waitresses were also the most welcoming and personal out of every restaurant I've encountered so far. When a dish was served, they would always wait to see my approval before going back into the question. Someone was always there whenever I had questions to ask, and they always constantly asked me if I ever needed anything or if the food was good. \n\nYes, the food was actually very good. As you may have already read, the fish to rice ratio was superb. The fish itself just screamed out FRESH, at least compared to other AYCE sushi joints. I was pleasantly surprised that they did half orders too. Not all sushi houses do that. \n\nOne thing that I thought was very unique and cool was the fact that they put lemon on top of the salmon nigiri as garnish. It gave the salmon so much more flavor, and a bit more of a zing to it. If I ever have a salmon craving, I'll probably go here to satisfy it. \n\nI also liked that they had a wider array of flavored mochi ice cream. I always look for my favorite flavor, chocolate, but most places never seem to serve it either.\n\nPS: They serve Tamago without the sticky rice! Pleasant surprise!
