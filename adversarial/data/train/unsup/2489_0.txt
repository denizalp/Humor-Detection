I came here yesterday in a group of 5 after I heard that Markaz closed down.\n\nWe parked around the corner on the street and walked by here.\n\nI almost went into sneaky dee's instead because I'm almost an alcoholic, but I made it there anyways (sober)\n\nWe walked in, and it was alot bigger than I expected. The decor was really nice.\n\nThere was no one working near the door though, so kinda wandered aimlessly into the back, and around the bar area...and finally a server seated us.\n\nThe seating was awesome. HUGE TABLE. Sexy booth loungish-ness. \n\nWe looked throught the menu, and didn't want to eat anything really. (I WAS DYING FOR A SHAWARMA AND I HOPED THEY HAD FOOD. But they didn't really have anything..substantial to eat on the menu. I guess that's not what they're there for)\n\nMy friends and I ending up getting\n\n1. The Faloodeh Shirazi - Persian Faloodeh (vermicelli) frozen with rose syrup and lemon. Nice, but lacking a certain umph that you get from the authentic stuff. But its the first time I've seen it in Canada, so double thumbs up!\n\n2. The Faloodeh Anari - The same as abouve, except with dark pomegranate syrup. See above for review as well.\n\n3. The Nutty Bear - My friend ordered this, and it was ...interesting. I didn't actually try it though, but it was like a nutella and raspberry sandwich. \n\n4. The Latte - Standard, nothing special.\n\n5. The Chai Naneh - a little more mint leaves in this would've been nice, but it was still pretty good. :)\n\n6. Shisha - Double Appz and Mint - Okay, first thing I have to say...no tobacco shisha is pointless. Anyways, for pointless Shisha, it was still pretty good. I had to work my shisha adjustment magic, but it last pretty long. We there for about 2 hours.\n\n\n\nAnother great point - They have playing cards! We spent the whole time playing crazy 8 countdown, and no one made it past 6 before we realized how long we were playing for..\n\n\n\nAtwash (persian for Fire) was great. I can definitely see this becoming a hangout spot for us :)
