This place is a bunch of bull shit. Some of the nurses there should be fired. They don't care about people lives. I had caught one of the nurse stealing Morphine. My husband was in the hospital due to neck injury. The doctor order morphine for his neck. They the young nurse came in the room with the medicine. I had ask her what was that, she going to give my husband. I'm a nurse to I didn't tell them that. But anyway  I'm looking right at her while she putting the morphine into the iv. I had ask her why are you saving the morphine in the syringe. She didn't have an answer. I ask my husband to you feel a hot feeling going through your body. he say no. I don't feel anything. And that when the nurse ran out of the room. Well I follow her she ran in the bathroom. I had saw the doctor in the hallway. I was telling him what happened. He seems shock. I told the doctor if you not going to help my husband we can go somewhere else. He says we going to help let me get to the bottom of it. We where waiting for hours and hours. No doctor or No nurse. I went into the hallway Nobody to be find. My husband in pain!  I took out the iv and left. Shame on you John C Lincoln hospital. U need to fired the whole Staff was there Monday 15, 2018 at 10pm-3:35am and u need to drug test them so call nurses every 30 days. I will never go to that hospital again  I wish I can give them No Star!
