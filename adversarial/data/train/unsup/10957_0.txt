First of all this is not your typical Fili B's!  It is like the Cadillac of late night fast food restaurants!  It has a sit down restaurant, a full laminated menu, a full bar, BIG screen TVs and wait staff!!  Wow!  Now I know this is not 5 star dining, but in the realm of late night\/fast food this is a whole other level of greatness which is why I had to give five stars.  \n\nThe owner happened to be our server and he was extremely friendly and excited about his restaurant and rightfully so!  All the screens had soccer on while I was there, which in my opinion added to the 'ambiance'.  The bar and restaurant were hopping with excited soccer fans!  \n\nWe ordered the half-order of loaded nachos as an appetizer.  I had the ceviche tostada and carne asada taco for dinner.  My friend had an amazing burrito!  See all the pictures; it all looked and tasted delicious.  The nachos weren't that exciting, but aside from that everything else was done very well and came out fast!  The ceviche came with a huge portions of fish and cabbage and tasted great, which I never in my wildest dreams would have envisioned at a Fili B's!   I had a frozen margarita that they made in house, blended just for me...no margarita machine here.  So yes there was plenty of tequila.  Thank goodness for my good DD friend Nydi!  \n\nI don't think I can ever go to a normal Filiberto's again!  Well, ask me at 2am and I may change my tone Hahhah!
