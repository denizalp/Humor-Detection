This place stays very busy. I've been there twice now and it was slammed both times. They also have lots of good sized TV's everywhere to make for a great sports bar. There was also a band playing that night and they were very good. It made for a good entertaining experience. The atmosphere and layout of this place is very nice but the food and service was a little lacking. \n\nWe had a large group for my buddy's birthday celebration. I thought the servers were very friendly and polite but I found myself having to track them down to order a drink a few times. \n\nI ordered the \"Firecracker\" Hooley Hunks (Their version of boneless wings). This flavor was supposed to be the hottest on the menu. Either somebody brought the wrong wings or these are the weakest hot wings I've ever had. Please don't label things as hot if they're not. It drives spicy food enthusiasts like myself completely bonkers! These weren't even as spicy as mild wings at BW3. \n\nFor my meal I ordered the Chipotle chicken wrap with a house salad. The wrap was a little bland and starving for flavors. The house salad was very good and fresh with crispy greens. \n\nI will go back to give them another chance since I remember my first visit being more enjoyable and I do love the atmosphere and entertainment. The food was a lot better the first time around as well but I don't remember what I ordered. I shall give it another go and see if the third time is a charm.
