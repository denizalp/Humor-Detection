\"I am really happy right now,\"  I said aloud to Kat F as we ate Bus Terminal food this morning.  When I was in high school, a bus terminal lunch was whatever you could get from the vending machines at the bus terminal in St. Catharines (usually cookies or chips and a pop.  Sometimes Andrew and I would get cookies and chips and split).\n\nThis diner is top notch.  Nestled between a bank and a parking lot at Danforth and Coxwell, I felt happy here this morning eating greasy breakfast, and said so. \n\nThe good:\n- HASHBROWNS!!!  These were GOOD hashbrowns, and if you have perused my breakfast list, you will know that I'm a harsh judge when it comes to morning potatoes.\n- My medium soft poached eggs were perfectly done.\n- There is a parking lot right next door!  A Toronto first for a breakfast joint.\n- Cheap - it was $17 for two breakfasts\n- Good enough coffee that comes free with your breakfast\n- They have takeout!  \n\nThe bad:\n- my crispy bacon was flimsy and fatty and next time I would order a different meat\n- It's probably rammed on the weekend.  It's pretty empty at 1000 on a Tuesday though.\n\nThe weird-and-awesome:\nLisa.  Our waitress Lisa is fantastic.  She wears sunglasses inside and laughed at the menu misspellings as much as we did.  She was entertainment to the max.\n\nWould I go back here again?\nI might go back tomorrow.
