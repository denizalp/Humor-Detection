Recently moved up to north Charlotte from Elizabethe, so my wife and I are trying to familiarize ourselves with the local breweries and D9 was a great place to start. We went on a Tuesday for yoga ($10 which includes a beer) and had a great time. \n\nThe class was held in a smaller back room and there were about 15-20 people in attendance. Afterward everyone hung around for a beverage. D9 has TVs with their beer menu since they always have new offerings. The bar is a centrally located island, so plenty of space to belly up and order. They also have a great patio area with picnic tables, umbrellas, adirondack chairs, and a fire pit.\n\nGreat atmosphere and looking forward to going back.
