This place is awesome. I went in there last Sunday with a screw in my rear tire. They took the tire off patched it and the guy comes into the store and says you're good to go. So I stand in the line to pay and the guy at the register says your good to go I said I haven't paid yet he says that is a service we offer there is no charge. And they won't take tips Thanks Again BIG O
