Very excellent experience. I was not too happy after selling off perfectly good furniture when we were leaving Montana and then to get involved in buying more of the same in South Carolina.  I am told that it is a nesting thing and that it would be best for our marriage to shut up.\n\nI did.\n\nBassett sent two decorators to make an in-house visit.  They spent time taking photos and talking with my resident interior decorating expert and said that they would be in touch.\n\nThey did and we made the trek to their very extensive showroom.  Entering, for me, was like being thrown into a pit of boredom where I was totally helpless to do much but tag along.\n\nWe were escorted into a special room and the show began.  The decorators talked about what we had and what we might want and then pointed out furniture and accessories that was their plan for our home.  I was impressed, truly.  They had done their homework and had chosen some nice stuff for us.\n\nI was sold, so just, as my advisers had advised, took out my credit card and waited for the tariff as to what this wonderful decorating would cost us.  I simply handed them the card and said nothing but a smile.  I told my wife, wisely, that I thought that this would work well for us.\n\nGee...\n\nDelivery took place within a week as the decorators arrived with the delivery crew to put the stuff in-place.  Rugs went down, furniture was placed and a couple of wall pieces were strategically placed for hanging.  I admit that it did look good.\n\nThe decorators and my wife were delighted and got into heavy bonding while I started to think about how to pay for all of this.\n\nNet is that Bassett did an excellent job in meeting our needs.  Very professional and easy to work with.
