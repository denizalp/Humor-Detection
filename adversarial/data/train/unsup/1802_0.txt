The food is always fantastic (well - skip the biscuit that comes with the fish fry, it's dry and cold). And you the beer selection is definitely top notch. The only issue I have with Gray's is the noise level and the weird seating arrangements. The space is just not used efficiently and feels awkward. There's plenty of room to wait if needed, but actual seating is odd. It's a nice place to grab a bite with friends.
