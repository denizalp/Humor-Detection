Food is average,  the beer selection is pretty good.But when service is poor,  all good things about a place are secondary. I've been here 3 times and each visit was during the week, and each visit the service Staff failed. They had zero personality and little hospitality. My waitress seemed overwhelmed being that she had no help covering the tables.\nThe hostess acted like she couldn't wait to get off her shift. Granted, this was almost a year ago now. But that's why I don't go back ...poor service.Will I give it another try?...sure.
