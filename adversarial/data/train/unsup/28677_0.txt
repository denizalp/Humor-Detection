First let me say that the customer service is fantastic.  The restaurant is beautiful and very clean.  It's all down hill from there.  Canes sets the bar for me and this doesn't even come close.  The fingers are plump and juicy, better than Canes.  They have absolutely no flavor though. Zero. None.  They could have been so much more if they had some flavor.  Canes have great flavor and the sauce is a compliment to that flavor.  Here you have to drown your tenders in sauce to give them any flavor.  The fries were mediocre.  They weren't even that hot when we got them.  At Canes everything is too hot to touch when it gets to your table.  You know it's fresh.  Here I'm pretty sure my fries were not fresh.  Also got the apples with toffee dip.  It was good but nothing that special.  I'll stick to Canes.
