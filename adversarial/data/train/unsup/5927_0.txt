So I came here today with my family, as the hostess tried to sit us, a BIG ASS RAT comes out from underneath the table, huge! I froze! All I could say was let's go let's go. It was so big & slow I could've taken a picture of it, but I was so disgusted. One of the waiters joked that it was the restaurants mascot, either way I don't want it, needles to say we will never go back.
