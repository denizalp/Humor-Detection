I have been a member for about 3yrs, was out of Cleveland for a year, came back, but just decided not to renew my membership. The space is cramped, old, drab. The membership fee is outrageously expensive, almost twice the cost of most other gyms. The only redeeming quality about this gym is the convenient location on Case Western's campus. It's a shame Case itself doesn't build a decent gym to put this p.o.s One-to-One out of business.
