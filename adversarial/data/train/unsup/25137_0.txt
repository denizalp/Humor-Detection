I've dined here three times. The first two times were great and so was tonight's. There are a few things that makes a dinner an enjoyable experience. The atmosphere, the food, the service, the price and location. My wife and I love this place for all those reasons. \n\nThe atmosphere at The Combine Eatery is exceptional. The restaurant has low lighting in the evening giving the feeling of comfort, has great sunshine in the morning for brunch and appropriate slats for shade on the back patio if you use the patio. The restaurant is well decorated and quite clean and appropriate for different moods.\n\nThe food is awesome. No matter what I have ordered I've never been disappointed. Everything they serve is quite delicious.\n\nThe service is always great too. Nice people, friendly, real, personable. \n\nOverall this place is great. It's all mine so don't go here k? Go somewhere else
