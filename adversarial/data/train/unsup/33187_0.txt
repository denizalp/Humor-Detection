Ordered 2 appetizers - the nachos with guac and spring rolls. Also ordered 2 entr√©es, a chicken and guac sandwich and a steak. \nWaiter was very friendly but seemed pretty stretched out due to the hectic atmosphere. \nGot drinks promptly.\nHowever we waited 40-45 minutes for our food. We decided to check in with our waiter, said that the steak wasn't well done yet and that he wanted to make sure the food came out altogether. \nJust wanted some food out at that point and told the waiter to bring out the other three dishes. The nachos and guac were great; best thing eaten at the meal. The spring rolls were dried out. The club sandwich bread was burnt. \nWe understood that the waiter wanted to be nice and make sure everything came out at the same time but the quality of the other food was bad due to that. Also understood that the place seemed to be understaffed during holiday season but this particular meal wasn't able to be fully enjoyed. \n\nSuggestions to future patrons:\nAsk the waiter or waitress how long the food should take\nSpecify if you would like the food to come out ASAP or altogether\nAsk if substitutions or removals are acceptable for your food before you have your heart set on it\nBring a charged electronic device or engaging conversation\nExpect a wait and a jostling\/busy atmosphere
