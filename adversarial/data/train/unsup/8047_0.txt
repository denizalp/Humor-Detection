I spent the majority of my day here. My flight was delayed a total of 7 hours, and I was stuck in the C gates, so this was pretty much it. Joey the bartender and I became airport buddies, and he was kind enough to grab OJ from the place next door so I could make a mimosa. I needed some food halfway thru my stay, I didn't have too high of expectations for this place, I went with nachos and added chicken. When it arrived in front of me, I wasn't sure what it was, were those tofu cubes? What the heck is that? Oh is that supposed to be chicken? Wowsa. I decided to eat around the mysterious cubes. \n\nI spent an obscene amount of money at the crap hole. I wish there were better options, but hey, gotta make the best of it.
