I'm shocked to read all the bad reviews of this place...  I've been here twice and have received excellent service both times.  The folks working when I shopped here (twice) left you alone when you wanted to be left alone (to browse) and yet were available to answer questions.  I was thrilled with the service I received, the quality of cigar I purchased, etc...\n\nI will be returning.  Often.
