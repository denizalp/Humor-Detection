We are giving this review 5 stars because we had an awesome experience with a sales associate named Johnny from this store.  After originally having 2 bad experiences on 2 different occasions, we still returned to purchase a dining table that we really loved.  When we arrived to pick up the table, it was out of stock.  Johnny went out of his way and got in contact with managers to get us the table.  Within two days, we were surprised to get a call that our table had arrived.  He offered to ship it to our home and it will be arriving soon.  Johnny offered us the best customer service we have ever experienced.  We will definitely return to purchase more furnite for our home.
