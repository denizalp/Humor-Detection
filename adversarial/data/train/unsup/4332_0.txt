We stopped in here after dinner at Hexx - I'm not sure how anyone could pass up the intoxicating aroma of chocolate directing you inside!  It's a cute chocolatier shop, with lots of funky, quirky gifts for sale in addition to chocolate, candy and ice cream.  One thing I noticed right away was that many of the saleswomen's lips were very noticable.  After staring for a while (it was hard to look away) I noticed they had on some lip product sold in the store, basically a preprinted pattern or color that you apply to the lips.  One was white and made her look kind of odd, it was somewhat distracting!\n\nAnyway, an employee offered an older couple a chocolate tasting.  I thought that sounded good, so I wandered over in that direction.  After looking at everything possible nearby and being ignored the entire time, I asked if I could have a chocolate tasting as well.  She acknowledged that I could and after asking if I wanted to try milk or dark chocolate, set a sampling of 5 or 6 tiny dark chocolates in front of me.  Then watched me as I ate them.  It was awkward and I felt as though she had a bit of an attitude as well.  I did not think the chocolate was that good, honestly.  It was fine, but nothing I would want to try again.  One interesting thing was they had a real pod open on the counter so you could see where cacao beans come from.  I thanked her for the samples and we continued to look through the store, but left without buying anything.
