This restaurant has been our family go to forever. It started with my 8th grade graduation back in 2000. We came for every high school and college graduation, then started coming for birthdays. We came to celebrate our engagement and our 1 year anniversary. The ambiance is for special occasions. I would say the food is actually 4 out of 5 stars - I am just being honest the food is not the ultimate draw to the restaurant.
