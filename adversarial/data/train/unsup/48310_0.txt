Wow.. Found this little gem by chance driving by New Years Day after 5-hours driving back from Laguna.. If you are like the mom-n-pop places opposed to chains.. This staid charmer will keep you a loyal customer. I had salad w the guacamole starter which BTW comes w crispy cheesey garlicy flatbread pizza.. I honestly can't remember Italian food tasting so darn good!! Place is packed & they offer curbside delivery.. Just because they love their customers & want them to be happy..How cool is that??;-)) Jack and Shirley still own this gem and they even gave me a free cookie.for giving them a try.. Did I mention this huge warm-out-ya-the-oven cookie come sealed in its own little tin.. with Ice-cream!!! Who knew??
