It's OK, but a lot of places do \"OK\" steak these days.  Even Bob Evans has gotten into the game with a $9.99 steak topped with shrooms and cheese that isn't ALL THAT BAD.\n\nSo besides a decent steak, what do I expect of a place called Texas Roadhouse?  \n\nWell, I expect sides cooked Texas style - lots of flavorings: cinnamon butter for the potatoes, black peppered corn, ham in the green beans.\nWhere did they misfire on the food?  NaCl.  Say it with me: salty salt salt saltiness.  My wife's burger was pucker-up salty.  The green beans were warm wet salt sticks.  I drank two tall glasses of water just to prevent my brain from shriveling like a salted slug.\n\nWhat else do I expect?  A lively fun atmosphere.  Our waitress was awesome (thanks Shannon!).  But oh the mid-meal pain we endured with the super lame line dancing bit.  The girls doing the line dance didn't want to be, which means it was a total fail.\n\nLet me paint the picture: The loud music comes on blaring, so all conversation at your table is forced to stop.  Because it's so loud, you can't simply ignore the line dance coming up and carry on as you were.  \"If I was here on a fun date, this could work\" you say to yourself as you watch your kids cover their ears and close their eyes.  But what happens next?  All the female employees under 25 or so line up and: A. look confused, B. look embarassed, C. show no coordination.  Torture for them and torture for the patrons.\n\nThe cherry on top of this hilarious sideshow: they are all wearing t-shirts that loudly proclaim \"I LOVE MY JOB\"!!!  LOL  Yea you do, and it REALLY shows!\n\nTo be fair to those girls, it doesn't look like management spent any time training them.  Either let them do a fun routine they enjoy and give them some paid time (on the clock) to practice, or scrap the whole thing.  Please.\n\nOh, and somebody hide the salt shaker from the cooks.
