Beautiful place for a wedding.  This old theater is rejuvenated to its former glory plus some sparkle and embellishments.  Be prepared for a grand night of dancing and celebrating the bride and groom in style! \n\nWe attended a wedding in January 2015 at the eglinton grand.  They had two ceremonies, one was traditional indian and the other canadian themed. The old theater is gorgeous and full of ambiance. I love how they have the wedding couples name listed on the exterior building theater sign which was previously used to list movies when the facility was as a traditional theater. \n\nComplaint #1: The ladies bathroom was freezing cold.  I noticed this same cold potty problem when I attended a chinese wedding in 2010 at the eglinton\n\nComplaint#2: Lack of seating on upper level where coffee break and cocktail hour were hosted\n\nHere is a break down of the food which was all arranged by the eglinton grand.\n\nCoffee Break: Between the ceremonies there was a coffee and cake break. I was lucky enough to try all 4 cakes and 2 pastries. Each cake was declious and I would order them again. The pastries on the other hand were bland and not my favourite - definitely not a repeat.  \n\nCocktail hour:  The house white wine and signature drink were excellent! To compliment the drinks, they had pulled pork sliders which were topped with a chucky coleslaw (yummy), chicken tandoori skewers (which were full of flavour but too spicy for my liking) and  my favourite was the beef wellington bites with a gravy sauce.\n\nDinner: Started with a yummy salad and pasta was fantastic. I asked for more pasta, however my request was completely ignored!!!  The chicken and steak, the carnivore special plate was ok. I wasn't too impressed with the meat plate
