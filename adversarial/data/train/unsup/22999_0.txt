The dude working there i think his name was sean, very friendly, good kid. we actually swapped numbers hes gonna help me find a car from his friends at roy foss. Anyways we dined in and enjoyed the cool space. Will definately be back!!! and sean if you read this you better not forget to call for the car!!! ha ha  just kidding brother. GREAT PIZZA!!!
