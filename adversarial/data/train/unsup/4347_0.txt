Stinky Tofu....The whole event just smell like Stinky Tofu...I can smell it even at the underground parking lot!! That's just insane!\n\nRichmond Hill Summer Carnival is like a night market with food vendors plus on stage competition and performers. A lot smaller scale than the other Night Market but the good thing about this is there are tons of parkings and no lines for anything.\n\nSimilar food vendors as other events selling BBQ skewers, Pineapple drinks, Bubble Tea, Stinky Tofu and Takoyaki.\n\nGood to pop by if you have the cravings for the tofu..but if you are not into that, stay away... STAY FAR AWAY!!
