Surprise, surprise....it only had one star when I looked it up today. If only I had read these reviews before I hired these bone-heads. \n\nHonestly, this company's practices are criminal, shady, duplicitous...I could go on and on.\nThey have the worst customer service I have ever witnessed. The bottom line is there are many great transportation companies in Las Vegas. Avoid this one at all costs and you will save yourself a lot of trouble (dealing with rude representatives, cancelations of your charter the day of the event, etc.) They should be shut down immediately by the Better Business Bureau. \n\nIf you are reading this V Transportation : SUCK IT!
