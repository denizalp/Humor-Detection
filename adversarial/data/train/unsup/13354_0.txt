The $1.25 breakfast seemed appealing to my husband and he wanted to try it. I saw these cute looking Swedish desserts made with marzipan so I was curious about them so I picked one up. It is a cafeteria and you go threw a line just like you did at school. I didn't try any of the breakfast plate but to my eye the eggs seemed to have been cooked in a large batch in a steamer. The turkey sausage and potatoes didn't appear to be a fresh kind and had that certain frozen look to them like what you can find in your grocers freezer. You can see in my photo they look very processed.\n\nI go to try the little cake and have a taste of the frosting. Wow! it was terribly sweet and have a texture that was like liquid rubber with an awful after taste. So I peal some off and go for the inside. The cake tasted like something processed and a chemical fake raspberry taste was above it. I fear it had it had castoreum in it. If you don't know what castoreum is you possibly don't want to know what it is but you HAVE eaten some if you ever ate a Cadbury Cream Egg.\n\nA few things did look better than the breakfast like the tomato and cheese salad and the gravlax plates. \n\nIf you are a fan of the meatballs you can buy them in the store in the frozen section.\n\nI think most people have had food outside the box and have had better.\n\n1.5 Stars
