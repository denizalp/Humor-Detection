Come on yelpers, stop rating down a place just because it is a chain. The dishes were delicious, salsas were particularly good. And you get 3 different complimentary salsas, compared to a regular of one. The enchiladas were also excellent.\n\nAmbiance is gorgeous, classic mexican decor and a beautiful building. To top it off, prices are extremely competitive. You can get a very filling lunch for under $10.
