i'm from New Jersey and this is my favorite spot in town for the style of pie i grew up with. saw other people say they were heartbroken when Mamma Mia's closed and i can 100% understand- i was too. thankfully when it re-opened with this name everything was just as good and the lunch special is basically the best deal in town for east coast pizza
