A pretty average place, we were seated quickly and staff was friendly. We sat outside and the patio was very comfortable. On the beer list it says \"ask about our current craft beer selection\" and when my dad asked our waiter he apologetically told us he didn't know, and ran inside to find out. We started with the calamari and the spinach and artichoke dip. The dip was fantastic! Our entrees were pretty mediocre though, my sister had the spicy scallop marinera and it was too spicy for her to really taste what she was even eating and my Pasta Bravo was kind of bland. Not the worst, but certainly not the best. waiter was kind enough to comp my sister's overly spiced pasta, I thought that was nice of him as we only mentioned that it was too hot in passing.  Our server was nice but not very attentive, we only had our waters refilled once.
