Our experience was so bad that we are suing the Flamingo in small claims to get our money back!\n\nOnce we arrived, we were delighted to wait 30 minutes in line just to check in. Then, during the 2 mile trek from the desk to the elevator, we were hit-on by an employee trying to sell us a time share! But that was nothing compared to what would come.\n\nUpon entering the room, we quickly realized that the heater would not work. Then, we realized there was no hot water. So we decided to call the desk for help...but the phone didn't work either! After many tries on our cell, we finally got thru and an engineer came out. He fixed the heater, but not the hot water.\n\nWe are patient people, so we we tried again the next day. Again, an engineer came out. He informed us that the hot water in this floor never works. After much wasted time and effort, we got a NEW ROOM. What could go wrong now?\n\nWell, the new room's toilet didn't like to flush. At all. So we called, once again, for help. The engineer fixed it. But of course, it broke again the next day. That's a lot of unflushed human waste, my friend.\n\nDO NOT STAY HERE. Its an overpriced, dilapidated, embarrassment to Las Vegas.
