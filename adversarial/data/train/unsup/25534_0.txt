I've been going to Lynette every month for years. I find her very knowledgeable about skin care, lasers, products and procedures (even the ones she does not perform). I have tried other day spas for IPL and they were very expensive per treatment. Yes, she doesn't have a huge and luxurious location, but with her prices and attentiveness, I can deal with it. Yes, she tries to sell you on products, but she takes no for an answer and the products that I have purchased from her have been the best quality. My skin looks great and I trust her with it. The IPL has decreased my dark pigmentation and tightened my skin to lessen the fine lines. I have never had any down time or felt that I needed to hide after a treatment (which I have had with other IPL treatments at other day Spas). I recommend her to anyone that asks me what I do to have my skin look so good. Go through her directly and not Groupon (which is how I found her initially).
