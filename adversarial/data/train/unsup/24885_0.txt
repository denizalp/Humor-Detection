I got free tix from work and it's better than before.  The latest version is about 50% new from the previous Venetian show.  I am not going to get into the details of each part because that would ruin it but the ending was a lot more fun in this one.\n\nThere's no point in getting poncho seats because nothing will be spilled on you.  You may get hit by a jello mold but that's about it.  So lame and tame.\n\nNot exactly a first tier show and there will be (are) plenty of people who just don't get it.  But if you dig percussion and\/or just smoked a fatty, this show just might work out for you.  $125 is still too steep for BMG.  I would rate this as a $50 show.
