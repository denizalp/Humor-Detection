VERDICT:\n\nThe crunchy wrap on the outside traps in all the juices for a hands clean and juicy experience, also adds in nice texture that is pleasing to the senses. The chicken is juicy and very tender and seasoned quite well. They gave out baklava for free which was a huge bonus. The sauce is decent, it is simply present, it adds to the flavours but does NOT make you want to cry, although it invokes a couple tear drops. It is smaller in portion size which may be more sensible but less of an experience. I cannot speak for the beef, however. Additionally, they include red pickled thing inside which I am indifferent to. There is less material inside but it is definitely a symphony -- Beethovens ninth donair perhaps -- in the mouth. The service is very fast and very kind, they know you by name and are very personable. \n\nAll in all, I would rate this place a 4.8 falafels out of 5.
