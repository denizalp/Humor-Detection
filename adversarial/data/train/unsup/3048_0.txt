I love going to this store, it smells very fresh and natural! Dirty is my favorite perfume their and the bath bombs are great! Some smell better than others imo, I like the avobomb and Sakura the most. \n\nAs for the masks- they really do work! I've tried cosmetic warrior, rosey cheeks and catastrophe; none of them have been a let down. Plus rosey smells like roses and the catastrophe smells great with the chamomile blueberry.
