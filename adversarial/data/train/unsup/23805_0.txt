I've had two visits to the beautifully decorated Dorsey.  The first was in January shortly after they opened and literally 6 months later. It goes a little something like this...hit it!\n\nService: 2\/5  Both visits were around 6 PMish on a Friday.  Unfortunately the service was lacking, we'd have to wave down our server to get a drink. I assumed during my first visit, it was opening issues but having the same service 6 months later was surprising. It took about 15-18 minutes to find her and another 15 minutes to get the drink after the order.  When the server appeared, they were very friendly and pleasant. It appears that they are severely understaffed in servicing their floor and there was no sense of urgency.  Each visit was about 1 1\/2 hours and I was only able to get 3 drinks.  Both times I was with a friend whose company was paying and I left there surprisingly sober.  Management can do better here, I'm rooting for them.\n\nDrinks: 4\/5 my current favorite Dorsey Cocktail is:\nHarajuku: Japanese Whiskey + Byrrh + Gran Classico + Chocolate bitters = best 'mixologist' cocktail of 2017 currently.  Lots of stuff going on in here, and it worked magnificently.  The other drinks I've tried off their menu (Caballo Blanco, Remember the Alimony, Banana Hammock) were tasty but the Harajuku is my current champ.\n\nValue: 3\/5 Cocktails were $18 a drink and $12 for their shorty drinks.  You're paying for a high end mixology experience in a very swanky lounge on the strip.  This is the typical night club cocktail pricing but at least here you get try a trendy unique in house cocktail.\n\nAmbiance: 5\/5 This is what saves the Dorsey.  This might be the most beautiful cocktail lounge on the strip.  When you enter, there's the \"Bird Cage\" which grabs your attention immediately.  \nThe long bar area is well stocked with premium booze with sharply dressed bartenders.  The open floor lounge area has expensive couches and tables with big classy ash trays for the cigar smokers.  Everyone working there is attractive and the music isn't too loud.\n\nIf you want to nurse an $18 drink every 30 minutes as you get your game on with your date, sit on the couches or the library area.  You won't have to worry about getting disturbed.  If you're trying to get your expensive drink night on, sit at the bar.  Those are the cards you're dealt at this beautiful lounge known as the Dorsey, play them as you see fit.  Game on..!
