Looking at some of these other reviews, I just don't get it.  I've used Suburban Express multiple times and found it to be a convenient, affordable, and easy way to get back and forth to U of I.\n\nBuying a ticket couldn't be any easier.  The website is very straightforward, it walks you step by step through the selection process and gives you the chance before you pay to review what you've chosen.  So when people say they accidentally purchased the wrong date,  I say maybe try buying your ticket when you're sober.\n\nWould I like it if the tickets were refundable or at least exchangeable,  if I change my mind?  Sure, that would be nice, but they do tell you a bunch of times that they're not, so I can live with that.  It's not like I'm investing in a $400 airline ticket, it's a $28 bus ticket.  \n\nThe times I have used it, the bus or van always left on time (I prefer the bus trips, sometimes the vans can feel a little cramped if full), and more than once I got to Oakbrook earlier than the arrival time on my ticket.  The drivers seem polite and I've always felt safe. \n\nI actually don't have to take a bus very often- my Dad likes to drive and always wants to come down and pick me up.  But I point out to him that it's more economical to take the bus and better for the environment for him to not waste all that gas.  On the bus I can tune into my iPod and relax, or get some studying done.  When Dad drives,  my entertainment is hearing about every frame he bowled with his bowling team that week.  \n\nThanks, Suburban Express!
