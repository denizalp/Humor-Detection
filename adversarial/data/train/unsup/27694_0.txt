There's nothing nice about these \"upgraded\" apartments. Brush strokes are evident in the paint, the bathroom vanity has multiple screw holes from the toilet paper holder, there are urine stains on the bedroom carpet. Insulation between apartments and even the outside is hard to come by. I have to listen to people's music in their cars as they drive by at all hours of the day and night. Most residents have absolutely no pride in the community or their surroundings. There's trash everywhere, dog waste everywhere, kids run everywhere with no supervision. In the summer the pool is slam packed with people, most of whom don't even live there. The layout of the apartments aren't bad, just know that there is hardly any storage, especially if you like to cook and have a lot of cooking tools and gadgets. The leasing staff struggle with their jobs. I told them weeks in advance I would be arriving at 9AM from New Jersey to pick up the keys. I was then told the day before, via e-mail, it would have to be pushed back till 2 or 3 so they could clean the carpets. Major inconvenience as I was already driving through Greensboro, and could saved the money I spent on a hotel, and just drove down the following day. In addition, I can't tell you how many times I've received letters in my door saying they've received notification from my renters insurance company that my policy has been cancelled. However, when I call State Farm, they know nothing of a cancellation. Spend the couple extra dollars a month and stay at a nicer, newer complex right around the corner.
