I have been dying to try this place because I am a big fan of the burger. I will keep this review very simple for you. Three words\n\nOversalted\n\nOverpriced\n\nOverrated\n\nCheeseburger, fries and drink at Smashburger= $10\nCheeseburger, fries and drink at In n Out= $ 6.59\n\nHow's that for simple?
