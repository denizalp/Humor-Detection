What a great find! My husband and I wanted to find a place close to home for some breakfast. When we walked in my eyes were immediately drawn to all the Bay Area team memorabilia's ( I'm a huge fan, if you can't tell).  The place is small and quaint. The staff immediately welcomes you and offers you table. Very friendly staff.  I decided on the Lumber Jack, two sausage patties with two eggs (any way you want it) with two biscuits on top smothered with country gravy.... which is homemade by the way! With a side of hash browns or country potatoes.. I settled for the hash browns. My husband had the super combo breakfast... a stack of pancakes (which were perfect, not too fluffy or too thin), eggs, sausage, bacon and ham. Obviously I had to eat off his plate too... it's just what I do, lol. I have to say the food was delicious. So if you're looking for good food, good service, then this is spot for you. Needless to say we will be coming back again!
