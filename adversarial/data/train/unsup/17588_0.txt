This stands as my top 3 when it comes to Shanghainese food....the food quality has pretty much stayed the same for many years which I hafta give them credit for...\n\nLove the steam dim sum...ALL OF IT! the best thing is that when it comes to the dumplings, there are more veggies inside than pork...which is a huge plus because the other places there is so much pork, makes me feel like i'm eating fat...every single piece...the wrappings are thin and light compared to other places which don't care about it..\n\nI love the veggie wonton in soup, its around $5.99 and there are quite a few pieces in there....fills me up! =)\n\nAs to the cooked side, not my fav. I think they do awesome in dim sum as thats what most people go for...\n\nGo in for the dim sum and you won't regret any of it!\n\nHave to agree with Jennifer K. that it is the top 3 Shanghai restaurants in the area!
