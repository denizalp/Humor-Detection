During my recent travels to Vegas I decided to treat my self to a little luxury.  I arrived around 1 AM, there was only one check in agent and a long line of hotel guests waiting to check in.  After 30 minute wait time I finally got to talk to the check in agent.  Of course the long wait was not due to incompetence of the check in agent but because every guest was asked to join the trump card program which delayed the check in process.  \n\nThe room looked a little run down, the TV built into the bathroom mirror was a nice touch (not that I was going to use it).  Since I had an early start i needed to get my shirt pressed (they didn't offer that service).  There was no iron or ironing board in the room.  After 20 minutes I got my iron and it took them another 20 minutes to bring an ironing board.  After everything was done, I went to bed around 3:30 am. I didn't get any rest  because I had to be up at 6am. \n\nSome towels were dirty, there was no soap in the bathroom and the sink was clogged.  It looks like no one had dusted the room in some time.  Please don't get me wrong, the hotel served its purpose, but I would have been as happy in the near by motel.  I also asked for late check out and put not disturb sign, of course the housekeeping had to ring the bell and knock on my door at 8:45 am.  \n\nBased on my experience the Trump name is just full hot air as the men him self.  Complete overpriced fraud!
