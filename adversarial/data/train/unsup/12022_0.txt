I've never met a salty carb I didn't like. I'm especially fond of delicious everything bagels covered in all of the seeds, salt, garlic and onion. Nu Bugel does everything bagels beautifully, wood-fired and dense like Montreal goodness. One dozen for $10, or one for $3.50 toasted with schmear are delicious deals they offer on the regular.\n\nI had my first bagel here in, and paired it with a soup. The soup was just meh, but damn they do their bagels well, and I will be back for a dozen very soon.
