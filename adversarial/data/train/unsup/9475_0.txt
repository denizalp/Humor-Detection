Was here for breakfast and they didn't disappoint. I had the \"Big Omelette\" and boy, it's big . The taters are thinly cut and fried, they are delicious. The omelette is stuffed with cheese, onions and Italian sausage. The taste is fantastic. And you better be hungry to eat the whole thing. Service is very friendly. We will be trying the hot table soon, can only recommend this place. On top of that the prices are reasonable.
