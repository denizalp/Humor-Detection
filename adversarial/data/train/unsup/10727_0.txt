Take a walk with me. Close your eyes. Picture a cinnamon roll. Replace the dough with pizza dough. Now, replace the cinnamon with cheese and any topping you can imagine. Finally, instead of dipping this in frosting, taste the home made ranch and marinara sauce. That, my Yelpers, is a Pizza Muffin. \n\nBesides the Pizza Muffins, their Italian food is quite authentic. I have had a little of everything, and I have yet to find something I don't like.\n\nThe staff is great. It reminds me of a Chicago bar where everyone knows your name, except they really don't know your name. They are extremely friendly and always willing to give you suggestions.\n\nFor dessert, the pizza cookie is a must, and after all of that, you can walk instead of roll out of the door, I will applaud you.
