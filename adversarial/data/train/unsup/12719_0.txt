Upon our arrival to Las Vegas, we were hungry and in the mood for some Mexican food.  I heard Hussong's had vegan options so we headed there.  The restaurant is located in the Mandalay Bay Shoppes.\n\nI was happy to be seated right away and even happier that they had a separate vegan menu.  I scanned the vegan menu and noticed they use Gardein Chick'n and Daiya cheese. I'll have mock meat occasionally but not too often so I opted for the Baja style veggie tacos - double stacked corn tortillas, served with guacamole, breaded zucchini, tomatillo-avocado salsa, and cabbage mix. My boyfriend ordered the Chick'n burrito which had Gardein Chick'n strips, Pico de Gallo, Daiya shreds, vegan sour cream, rice, and pinto beans served on a mix of lettuce and tomatillo-avocado sauce.  We thought the food was ok and was pricey for Americanized Mexican food.  But I get it that it's a tourist spot so a lot of the food is overpriced. I give it 3 stars for food, but since the service was great and they have a separate vegan menu I'm giving them another star.  Our waiter brought our food out quickly and always made sure we had everything we needed.  \n\nIf I'm ever near Mandalay Bay, I'm glad I can come here for vegan options or I may try their sister restaurant next door Slice of Vegas which also has a vegan menu. Being vegan in Vegas seems pretty easy.
