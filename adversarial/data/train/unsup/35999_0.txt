This is one of my favorite jamba juices to go to. I used to always go to the superstition location, but when I was in Mesa I visited this location, and now I always come back. The smoothies are amazing, and the staff is always extremely helpful. I showed up before closing and asked for a carrot juice, and in the past, employees would have an attitude, because they cleaned it, but dharma was extremely helpful and in a great mood she didn't seem to mind at all. The staff at this location never seize to amazing me. Highly recommend this location!
