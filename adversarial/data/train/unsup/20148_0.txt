We rented a Dodge Viper for five hours for a total cost of approximately $240.  To pay this amount you either have to be a total car buff (my hubby) or a show off (not my hubby).\n\nOne minor annoyance was that the Viper was yellow (hello 90s!) and two big annoyances were that the business is located in a somewhat sketchy area (but still on The Strip) and our car smelled like barf.  \n\nAll in all, the ride to the Hoover Dam was fun, the car is a ferocious beast and we looked pretty freaking awesome (okay, so I'm a show off).
