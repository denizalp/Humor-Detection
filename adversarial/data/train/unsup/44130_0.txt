I have been here multiple times as a patient. Just recently I had an upper respiratory infection and was severely dehydrated. Dr. Kalra was my physician and gave me the best care I could ask for. Allison A. the medical assistant took me back right away and was so kind to me the whole even though I was an emotion train wreck. There was no nurse on duty so Stacy Shelton the nurse practitioner started my IV fluids. TALK ABOUT GREAT PATIENT CARE. They truly worked as a team to provide top notch care. It's comforting to live in a pretty new state and still have somewhere you feel comfortable getting medical care.\nAll of the employees here are great.\nYes, it gets busy sometimes but it is an urgent care. You get taken back as soon as you possibly can, given great care, and given the proper treatment. \nA BIG THANK YOU to everyone at Wynn Urgent care who truly cares about their patients and puts patients first 24\/7!
