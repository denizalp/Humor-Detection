I'm gonna be honest with you: I've never given a flying fuck about scones, and when this strictly-scones-only bakery opened in my neighbourhood I was puzzled as to why anyone would focus on such a bland niche but my world turned upside down when I tried one of their smoked salmon lemon ricotta scone sandwiches and immediately stopped thinking of scones as piles of chalky flour you just choke down because that's all they have to eat at the tea party at your Nanny's retirement home and I was suddenly overcome with the desire to stand on a corner and spread the gospel about this magical land where scones are buttery and flaky with just the right amount of saltiness that makes them taste so good you're tempted to adopt a strictly-gluten diet and smuggle them into Starbucks (sorry, asiago pretzel), and at around $3.00+ per scone some people think they're a little on the expensive side but I think that's a tiny price to pay to have your mind literally blown by a geriatric baked good.
