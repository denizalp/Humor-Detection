Yuck  where do I begin, worst experience EVER!!! Ordered the oysters those were delicious however the seared scallops were terrible I had to spit the 1 bite I took in the napkin and wasn't brought a replacement so I took it off the next table, the lobster that came with the \"surf n turf\" was also completely in edible and the steak was undercooked. It took an HOUR just to bring our soup that looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp the whole time, they never brought our salads. The Mgr came to our table trying to apologize saying he would \"see what he could do\" and when the bill came we were charged for the wine which actually was delicious by the way the oysters and the soup totaling over $50!!! Way to \"see what you can do\"!! After all that and they still charged us I will NEVER eat here again and if you do, I HIGHLY recommend NOT to eat ANY seafood!!!
