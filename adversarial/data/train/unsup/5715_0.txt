You can read about the furniture, food and design in other reviews.  I won't bore you with that.  What I am here to tell you about is how much fun you can have if you go here early (or late on a weeknight) when it is not busy and take a camera.\n\nMy family (alright mostly my kids & I) get a kick out of hiding price tags in the demo areas and snapping lots of pictures as if it was our house.\n\nI uploaded a few.
