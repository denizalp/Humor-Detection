Thank You Amy D. \n\nIf it were not for her, i would not have brought in the new year the best way i now know how to... \n\nby doing YOGA! :) \n\nthe lady at the front desk was amazing ... she was very calm and welcoming... that made me feel more comfortable since i don't ever go anywhere alone... and i had never done yoga ever in my life... two new things in one night... I'm on a roll :) \n\ni met Amy D.... she is so nice and welcoming too :) it made things way easier... \n\nthe instructor was a very nice gentleman... tall with a little ponytail... and an adorable little white chihuahua that stays up at the front of the studio in his kennel during the session.. :) i thought it was cute lol \n\nthe instructor had such a calming voice and was very easy to follow... \n\nmeditation is NOT my forte... even though it was relaxing and interesting... i guess i need more practice since half the time i had my eyes open (yes, i had my eyes open during meditation... i know now ... that's a no-no) and was watching everyone else to see what i was doing wrong.. why i couldn't just relax and think about nothing... hmm.. yes definitely need more practice... \n\nthe bathrooms were very spacious and clean... and i loved the little cubby holes for your shoes and things :) \n\nthe studio was very calming and clean... and clean makes me calm... lots of space.. and the dimming light action seriously helped in the mood setting... \n\nthis has been one of the best \"new\" experiences Ive had yet this year... and i cannot wait for more... \n\nThanks Again Amy...
