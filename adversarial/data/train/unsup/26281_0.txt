Nice little donut shop.  Not a fancy or new-looking joint, but it was clean.  The donuts are well-priced, fresh, and there was a great selection available when I was there around 5pm on a Wednesday.  The guy behind the counter was friendly.  I ordered a half dozen donuts, some donut holes, and a thai tea with boba.  Everything was good.  I'm not usually in this part of the Valley but would return if passing through.
