#155\n\nMy first trip was a recommendation by Al C. since on 14 March, all pizzas were $3.14 for Pi day (NERD!).\n\nI figured what the hell, it's a cheap meal.\n\nI got there around 7pm or so; I waited literally for an hour from the tree outside to the counter to actually order pizza.\n\nPreface:\n\nI HATE THIN CRUST PIZZA!\n\nOf course, when I get there, I find out that's all they have. So, it's not looking pretty but damn, the pizza sure does smell good.\n\nWhile waiting in line, several of the employees were explaining about their app which you can order on, then pick up as well as how the line works and such. They even offered water if you were thirsty.\n\nApparently, as I found out on my 2nd trip, many of them got training in the LA office since the company requires 3-5 members have that \"special training\". The owner of Five Guys Canada owns the rights to Blaze in Canada (both are US based chains of high quality).\n\nNow, I'm used to being told that you only get two toppings and any more is extra.\n\nNo, No, No, No, that's not how they dough it here! They told me, it's unlimited toppings at no extra charge!! That's worth the drive alone as most places charge $2 to $3 for each extra topping so my pizza would be $12 to $18 more if they did that here (that makes up for the drive though a new location is opening in April at 2020 4th St SW down the street from my house... DOUGH! Sweet DOUGH!).\n\nSo, with this knowledge of how it doughs for the toppings, I proceeded to build my own (think Subway but higher quality fixin's and for pizza and now you get how it doughs).\n\nI got a double helping of the spicy red sauce (and people, it AIN'T white people spicy; this spice kicks it like it's hawt), green and red peppers, red onions, tomatoes, spinach leaves, mozzarella, pepperoni, and chicken (all these veggies are known to be very liver friendly so if you have liver disease or liver problems, load up on these; also spices are good for your liver like cinnamon and tomato based spices).\n\nAs was on the first trip, the service was just awesome. Fast, friendly, and with a smile (and it wasn't as busy as Pi day; how they kept such a good attitude with that kind of line is beyond me but the customers I saw that day were pretty awesome)!\n\nBy the way, I hope they get some sugar based sodas soon because the glucose-fructose Coca-Cola and other just ruin it but they have two flavours of lemonade (sugar based), regular and blood orange! Jolly bloody good, mates!\n\nOh, and the crust, pure DIVINITY.. perfectly toasted and light but supports the weight of 8 toppings (verified!).\n\nOh yeah, it's like 3 minutes for your damn pizza, can you beat that?\n\nSo, I waited until my second trip on Saturday, 20 March to see the regular price of $10.45 + shipping\/handling (tax) to write my review. I wanted to see if the first time was a fluke; you never know with these \"fast food\" chains how it doughs the 2nd time around.\n\nSummary: unlimited toppings, set price, three minutes, get pizza, get happy, get home
