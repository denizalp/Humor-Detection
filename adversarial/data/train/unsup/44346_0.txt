I have been going to the Peppermill forever and throughout the years it has remained one of those Very-Vegas places to eat. Though the times and the menu have changed a bit over the years, the atmosphere of the place has remained pretty much the same. \n\nThe menu changing is actually a good thing. The portion of the food have diminished somewhat, which makes their meals much more manageable. They used to be so large that you were almost forced to eat too much. Now, they are just about right.\n\nThe place can get crowded at times and depending on who is taking care of you, the service can be touch and go. But, this restaurant remains a must go to on the Vegas strip. It is like stepping back by a decade or two.
