Went here for the first time today - not impressed at all.  Without knowing really what to order, I ordered the frybread and red chile.  What I got was the greasiest piece of stuff I've ever tried to eat with some red gravy looking stuff on it.  Hardly any meat at all in that gravy.  If I ever do go back, I'll definitely try something else.
