House of hair is amazing...and I attribute that to my stylist Cyndy! I have been going to her for 15 years and every time she amazes me! I have never gone to another stylist since I met her! She's professional, fun to sit with and you can trust her judgement completely! Thank you Cyndy for the amazing experience and hair every time!
