Went there today at lunch with Mrs.  Had heard good things about their breakfasts but it was too late for that.  \nMs. had mushroom soup and a sandwich..turkey and brie with cranberries.\nI had mushroom soup and ham and gruyere cheese.\nBoth sandwhiches were served hot.  Wife declared the soup wonderful.  I thought it was a bit thin.   It was good though, and had a bit of pepper in it but not overly so.  This is because of the Cajun roots that the French Groc. has.\nTheir cold case had several tempting items in it.\nMs. wants to go back but I'm thinking I want to give it another try before putting it on my permanent \"go to\" list.\nPrice for two sandwhiches and two cups of soup was $19.00
