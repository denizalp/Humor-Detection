I came here on a Sunday night with a friend, and the weather was very nice (60 degrees in Jan, can't complain!), so we sat on their patio. \n\nThe patio gets five stars for sure: with the beautiful fireplace, I would definitely take my girlfriend here for a date. \n\nI ordered the chicken skewers plate that comes with a Greek salad and pita for my entree. The food was not bad, but honestly nothing too special. The server was nice though. \n\nAll in all, the next nice day Charlotte sees, I will be back for the patio.
