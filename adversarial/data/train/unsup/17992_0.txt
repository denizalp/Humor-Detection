Came here early for breakfast at 3 am. This is my 500 review. I came here hungry. \n\nAs we got in line to be seated, the place was packed with the young crowd at 3 am. We got seated right away at a booth that was clean. Good thing the waitress gave us a clean booth. \n\nThey have grave yard specials. Hubby orders us two steak and egg breakfasts which comes with steak, eggs, hash browns and choice of toast. I got my steak medium well, eggs over easy with wheat toast. That special costs $4.95. That is the cheapest steak and egg breakfast you can find in Vegas. It is inside South Point hotel which is off the 15 freeway. \n\nSteak and eggs were delicious. Hash browns were cooked perfect. Steak was tender, and eggs and wheat toast were good. Our waters were refilled immediately as they were half empty. The waiters kept checking up on us. I like the great customer service here. You don't need a club card, but must be over 21 to get the grave yard specials. Good deal! Plenty of tables here, so the lines go quickly. I definitely would come back here for breakfast. If you are in Vegas, check this place out.
