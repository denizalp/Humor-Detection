Located on the corner of Decatur and Cactus, it's super far from my house (30 miles!), but I'd definitely make the trek here! \n\nThey offer beverages such as coffee (keurig), champagne, and water with lemons and cucumbers.\n\nBiggest plus is that EVERYONE speaks english so well.\n\nPrices are $30 for a pedicure (40 minutes), $15 for a manicure (20ish minutes), or $40 for BOTH. Unless you're getting a deluxe pedicure, then it's $60 for that. Well worth it if you have crocodile feet like my dad's. Super reasonable! \n\nPROTIP: They do a rewards program here. You open up an account (free) and they keep track of your visits. You rack up point per dollar. Every $300 spent in services, you get $10 off your next service or you can save it. Double points if you use cash! So if you're to frequent this place, you may as well do it! \n\nI came here for a mini-express facial ($35) and a manicure ($15). They have a bunch of other facials here too, the rest ranging from $55-$70ish. (bacials, specialized facials for mature, oily, sensitive, acne\/problem skin)\n\nThe spa room was relaxing, clean, and very inviting. The person pampering me, Linh, conversed with me in vietnamese but didn't talk my ear off. Very pleasant. \n\nThe facial included a steamer that gently blew warm air onto my face. I laid down on a clean bed with fresh sheets and a fresh long terry cloth towel on it. Major points for a towel sterilizer they have here. The products are Dr. Jeff I believe. Very high-quality products. She gently, yet firmly massaged the cleanser onto me first and wiped it off. Then she used a scrub on me and massaged all around my face (doesn't include neck). After applying the mask, letting it sit, and then wiping it off, my face felt smooth and radiant as a baby's bottom. Includes moisturizer. \n\nIt took around 30 minutes. Complete heaven. I felt very relaxed. Nice to see a spa room that isn't nasty, unsafe, or unsanitary.\n\nMy manicure was a simple pink polish. My manicurist was sweet. Very quick, only took 15 minutes including hand massage and picking out which lotion to use.\n\nI took a star off for the receptionist. The receptionist was chewing junk food and talking to customers. Didn't offer a drink until the manager\/nail technician\/her mom (I overheard in vietnamese) told her to ask us for something to drink. Also, pointing at me and referring to me as \"that one thing\" in vietnamese is incredibly rude, but I digress.\n\nAlthough it's largely inexperience and the fact she's young, it's something to consider in the customer service business. This might explain the double-charges on other reviewers' accounts considering the fact that she's overwhelmed by customers and the POS system.\n\nOther than that, this place was wonderful. Ambiance, service, and cleanliness is superb. I only wish it wasn't 30 miles from my house... I would definitely come here again!
