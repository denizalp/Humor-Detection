Beautiful facility. Bike shop is awesome. \n\nThe customer service desk is horrible. I've been there numerous times and spoke with a number of different individuals and the result has always been the same... Rude, short and a little bit insulting. \n\nHope this improves because public transit is an important part of any metropolitan area.
