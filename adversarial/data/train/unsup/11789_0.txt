So we went again, it was worst that the first time.\n\nSince they don't use trays they dropped my husbands breakfast on the floor. Another employee (not our server) walked up and asked my husband if he got a bite of it! WT...? (As if he took a bite and threw it on the floor or something?!?!?!) My husband said No and the employee said \"That's f**ked up, dude\" and walked off. I am not a prude but I do believe in professional language is a workplace. \n\nSo two employees come to clean up the mess, One has dirty dishes in his hand. I saw it coming. I was hoping he wouldn't. But he did! He put his dirty dishes on my table next to my plate of food! Gross! \n\nVegas has plenty of restaurants! Its service that makes it great or not! This place is a No Go for me!
