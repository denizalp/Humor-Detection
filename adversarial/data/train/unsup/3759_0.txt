I'm a female who walked in this store.  Not a \"hello\", not a \"welcome to my shop.\" NOTHING!!!!  I walked over and sat down.  My S\/O was nice enough to drop me off since there was no close parking spots and went to park.\n\nWhen \"HE\" walked in, he got a nice welcome. He was called \"Sir.\"  Personally, at that point, I would have walked out and went elsewhere simply because a business should be respectful to everyone who walks thru the door.  Hence the 4 Stars vs 5 right off the bat.\n\nAs I was watching them cut hair, they were very slow and thorough.  This is definitely a man's world.  I like how they use shaving cream and a straight razor vs. an electric razor to clean up the neck.  The hot towels, I bet felt awesome. A little neck massage.  $16 for a haircut seems a little pricey until one sees the extra detail they take in doing such a nice job.  Will go again.
