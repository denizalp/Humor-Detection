I absolutely love this place! Hiroba is a cheap option for high quality sushi. The restaurant is spacious and clean and the waiters and chefs are absolutely the friendliest. \n\nIf you're in the mood for sushi, but not quiet in the appetite for All You Can Eat, then this is the place to go. Their nirigi is only $2.99 for two pieces and their rolls are mostly under $10. Their best deals for lunch and dinner are their specials combinations. You can get a few nirigi pieces and a cali or tuna roll for around $15 or for the same piece get a whole bento box. These specials come with salad and miso soup too! This restaurant is my go to place for sushi. It's cheap, it gets me full, and the quality of the food is great!
