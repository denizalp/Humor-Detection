Probably the tastiest vegan food in Pittsburgh. Pierogi were the obvious highlight, the smoked potato and parsnip being especially noteworthy. We also got a giant salad full of herbs and baby kale with tasty homemade bread on the side. The food is seasoned so well you do not miss the butter! \n\nOnly drawback was the difficulty in reading the menu, which is posted pretty close to the door. A few paper copies to pick and read while you wait in line to order would be helpful.
