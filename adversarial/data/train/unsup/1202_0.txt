Stumbled upon this place accidentally, and left a happier satisfied person. \n\nThe staff is extremely cordial, they seem joyous to bring their culture to this tiny gem of a restaurant and were willing to alter their dishes a bit based on dietary restrictions. There are over a million cutesy decor accents to look at, I loved the photographs. I almost wanted to take the tuxedo pig and the flamingo statue with me. \n\nWe ordered the spicy Mexican omelette (I am already day dreaming about this), the Portuguese breakfast (could keep eating this all day everyday) and the Vegan Burrito. \nWe all absolutely loved this place the very instant we entered. It felt like we had transported to a South American diner with all its ethnicity. \n\nBrownie points to this place for being pet friendly. Did I mention they have the cutest puppy 'coffee machine guardian'? \n\nI highly recommend this place to everyone and would go again for the omelette soon.
