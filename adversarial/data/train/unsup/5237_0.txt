This hotel  is clean but that's all I can say.  So disappointed I was quoted the wrong price for my stay and also they charged the wrong amount on my card I was told I would see the instant credit on my credit card for the confusion that never happened the person at the front desk who checked me and was extremely rude and during my stay I have received a bug bite on my chest and my husband received a bug bite on his arm This concerns me deeply I I'm very disappoint I will be contacting the manager because right now I'm still in the hotel and I want this to be rectified. On the upside TAO beach was amazing
