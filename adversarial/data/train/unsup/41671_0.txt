I grew up in Hunan,  the food taste just like what I had at home. If you want the most authentic,spicy, Hunan style food, this is place. If you have never been to China or Hunan, then don't bother to waste your time here, they won't have what you looking for. They usually have a lot bones in the meat, waitress there normally do not speak much English( they won't be waitress otherwise!) The waiting time was not too bad, you know compare to Cheese cake factory, also good Chinese food probably takes much time to prepare!!
