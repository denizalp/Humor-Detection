Delicious! My family is from Guadalajara and I can tell you that the tortas ahogadas here are super good and very authentic. The sauce is mild perfection and the birote (bread) is flown in right from Guadalajara so of course it's the best. The meat is delicious too. 2 for 1 tortas on Wednesdays and fresh handmade tortillas on Saturday and Sunday. Great service from nice employees. I can't wait to go back.
