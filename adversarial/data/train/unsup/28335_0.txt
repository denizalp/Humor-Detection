I've gone to many different salons to get my hair cut. Each one says how bad the one before them did. Dianna is the ONLY one who has actually fixed what anyone else has done. I will only let her touch my hair from now on because everyone else has proved their lack of skill in the hair industry. I highly recommend for people to go to her. She's super sweet and I know I can trust her opinions. Best stylist :)
