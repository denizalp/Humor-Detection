Vinny's just keeps getting better. On my first visit I was pleased, but thought that the cheese pizza I had wasn't quite as light or crisp as I liked.  But every te I've gone back it's gotten better.  Tonight I had a pepperoni pizza that had a perfectly thin, crisp and chewy crust. \n\n@Nanette the variety on the\nmenu is what I'd expect from Phila. area pizza joints. I've also tried the Chicken Parm sandwich, which was OK mainly because the rolls.  If they'd import some good Amaroso rolls like Fat Sandwich does it would be perfect.
