Attorney Wolfe had great energy when I met him and they were able to assist me in making payments towards the services I was looking for. I did have a situation the did not allow me to me continue and I called them to explain my situation and they were understanding and offered to refund me. They sent me my refund however there were a few fees that needed to be retained and the consultation remained free. I appreciate that they worked with me and I feel the fees they kept were reasonable from the process. I will be returning to them once things get settled.
