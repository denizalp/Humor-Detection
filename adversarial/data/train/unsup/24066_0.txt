after finally having my try at burger priest, disappointment and relief. Disappointment because it wasn't as great as people made it out to be, and relief because you have to endure a lot just to get a burger here, and now I know there is absolutely no reason to. \n\nIts not easy to get a parking spot around the area, the line to order is long and slow, and waiting for your food to come out takes even longer. I realize that the staff aren't slow but there are just too many questions while ordering especially if the person is unfamiliar with the menu. Everything has to be some sort of code that only the regulars know. The place gets packed and tight, fast. I did come prepared so I ordered quick with not a lot of chit chat, but still, it's too much labor for a friggin burger.\n\nI got the priest with the chilli cheese fries. As to how an unseasoned, soggy burger gets so much high reviews really baffles me. It wasnt bad, but it wasnt great that's for sure. Definitely not the best burger in Toronto and for it to be voted one of the best food in Toronto is really really sad and makes me wonder what the hell kind of demographic did zagat get their input from? Whoever they are should really diversify their dining options.\n\nNot to say that it's wasn't a good meal. There were some interesting components to the sandwich but overall just an OK burger.
