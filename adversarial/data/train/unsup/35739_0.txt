We were in town Thanksgiving (2010) weekend for a quick little visit. We decided to come to Casey's for lunch and a couple drinks - boy am I glad we did!  I ended up getting the \"Du Marche\" and a few Rickard's Whites. The \"Du Marche\" sandwich was AWESOME - definitely something I have not had around here (turkey, panko covered cheese, granny smith apples); and the Rickard's white was basically a Belgian white beer - very good! Being a visitor, I'm always on the lookout for new beer and beer glasses. I asked the waitress, who was a very pleasant girl, if I could buy the Rickard's glass. She asked her manager, who said he would get me a price. When we were ready to leave, he said due to the holidays I could have the glass. All in all, Casey's is a very classy place - another good place to watch a game as they have tons of TVs.
