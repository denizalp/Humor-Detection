This location needs help already!! Very new, but very bad.\nFirst, the location is awkward. It's in the middle of a tiny strip mall, which doesn't make sense. You'd think a drive thru would be on a end. Then it has an awkward two-lane split but no place to merge. You just have to wait or cut in line. \nThey had the typical long wait due to heavy volume. NBD but at other locations they send out a Bro to take orders as soon as cars start to stack. I was in line (a car was backing out of one of the faux order lanes) a good 10 minutes without moving before they sent out a bro. Then, he didn't let me pay, he only took my drink order. So I had to wait still to pay. \nThen, after I made to the window and paid, I still waited a solid 5 minutes for them to make my drink. \nAnd it was the worst version of my regular drink I've ever had. Watery, lacking any flavor at all. Wth. Not worth the $5 plus $2 tip I left before tasting my drink. \nNot cool, Bros.
