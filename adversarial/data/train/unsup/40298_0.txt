This is an awesome salon and photography studio!! If you're looking for an AMAZING bayalage, Mandi knows her shit! I do not get my hair done often so that it stays healthy, let me tell you, she slays with her technique. You're treated so well at this place, they offer welcome cocktails and keep them coming! The decor in the salon is so unique and the photography studio has natural lighting galooooore, so I'm sure it would be wonderful for a photoshoot. \nI went right into my appointment, I had my hair colored and styled and my husband had his styled and cut. We had a cocktail & Mandi got us in and out . \nIf you want to have a fun photoshoot or get your hair done the way you want it to look and cheers to your fabulous self after, get your ass in a chair at Bazaar!\nXo
