I went there for the first time with family and friends to celebrate my birthday. The meal began by my mom making a simple request for lemon in her water and she was denied. They don't have lemons. That is fine but the response came with attitude. When I went to order, I wanted to select a first course but was limited because I am pregnant. I am not at all a picky eater but I am following the basic no raw meats or no uncooked eggs that all doctors suggest. The one salad on the menu was with a dressing that contained raw eggs. I asked if I could have the other dressing listed on the menu with a seafood salad. The waitress informed me there were no substitutes. I explained I was pregnant and could not consume raw eggs. So no salad for me! The other choices for a first course contained raw beef and seafood that can also not be consumed during pregnancy. We did not fuss or ask for anything other then a dressing substitute and lemon for the water. The kitchen design is open and it was evident that we were being discussed throughout the meal. It was a terrible birthday dinner and big disappoint. The food was good but I would never go back after being treated so terribly. Poor service is one thing but this was beyond. The food was pricey for what it was and the wine was improperly stored and served too warm.
