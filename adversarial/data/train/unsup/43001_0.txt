If you're looking for a \"treat yo self\" treat, Roselle is the place to go! They have a wide variety of pastries and baked goods. I got the black sesame eclair. Every bite was a surprise. You can taste the black sesame cremeux with a crunch of the hazelnut. Sandwiched with two crunchy black sesame shell. It's a plus that their treats are all sooooo instagrammable! :)
