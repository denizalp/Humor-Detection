You can't buy happiness, but you can buy pizza! \n\nI stopped in for a much needed pizza break with a few other pizza loving companions. It took a very long time to get seated because the hostess was no where to be found - not the greatest first impression. The interior itself was beautifully decorated. The darker lighting gives the restaurant a more intimate feel. \n\nOur waitress came very swiftly to take our orders. Our table split the Proper House Chips which came with a french dip. I definitely recommend it for a quick snack before your meal! I had the half Proper House Salad for my starter which was great but so puny! I'm not sure a couple pieces of lettuce is worth $6. For the main course, I kept it traditional with a Margherita pizza. It was very appetizing but surely not the best pizza I've had. It was fairly average, but if I'm paying $15 for a personal pizza, I expect something special. Anyone who knows me knows that I absolutely need ranch with my pizza, and Proper didn't have ranch! None?! How is that possible?? \n\nThe meal was fine, but for the prices, I would say skip this place and grab 5 pizzas at Pizza Hut for the same quality. Sorry, Proper, I'll get my pizza cravings satisfied elsewhere.
