I love this store. As a teacher, it has any and all kinds of fun items for parties, decorating, games, prizes, gifts, etc. Luckily this store is near where I work so I ventured there to buy some gifts for my class as the end of the year approaches. This store is HUGE! I like that is it divided up by themes such as special occasions and holidays. There is anything and everything you can think of for making any occasion more enjoyable. Balloons, streamers, cards, candy, games, toys, wrapping paper, cups, plates, napkins, pi√±atas. Bring your patience because this store can turn any well behaved child into a wild child like the one who was there today. He kept yelling in excitement as he walked down each isle and to his amazement, saw more things that he wanted to put into his mother's basket.
