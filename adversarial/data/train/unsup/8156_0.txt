I've been in a thrifting mood lately and of course couldn't pass up this location.  It's not really bigger than other locations, but it's definitely a place to come and look around to see what is there.  They seem to pack as much stuff in here as humanly possible.\n\nI was on a mission to find an awful picture with a pretty good frame in order to do a project I have on my mind.  So I had stopped at several other local thrift shops and had no luck.  I should note here that I had no luck at this location as well.  But I didn't walk out of here empty handed.  \n\nI ended up purchasing a pretty awesome drop leaf table.  Fits perfectly in my apartment.  The staff here are super polite, they even helped me out to my car after my purchase.\n\nOf course like any other thrift store, steer clear on senior citizen day.  No one wants an old lady beat down.
