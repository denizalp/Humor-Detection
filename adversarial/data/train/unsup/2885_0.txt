The worse Pho place I've been to yet. The atmosphere is very unwelcoming. The service is awful. I can't stress how awful the service was. They are not that nice and very impatient. From the time I was asked what I want to order I wasn't approached until I finished eating. \nThey give the soda in cans... which personally I can't stand. \n\nAnd the Pho wasn't good. There wasn't much broth or beef. The flavor wasn't great and the noodles were soggy.\n\nHonestly.... go anywhere else.
