Ok, so a little awkward on this review as one half of robeecats has actually been on a date with someone else at this restaurant.  However, we will look past that in the interest of journalistic integrity.\n\nOn our lovely date we started the night off with a modified caprese salad with olives and onions in addition to the usual ingredients.  \n\nEntrees consisted of the \"castro burger\" (with fried egg on top of course) and \"fettuccine a la carbonara\".  The burger was actually ground pork with gruyere cheese, pancetta, fried pickles, and some sort of spicy jalapeno based mustard.  We found this very original, very good, and so big you will need an extra jaw to take a full bite.  The fettuccine could have used some more pancetta for flavor but the presentation with the egg was nice.\n\nOn this particular night we dined on the small outside patio consisting of 4 tables.  The view was not great (just cars on Central Ave cruising by) but the patio area was secluded and pleasant.  For a Sunday night there was no wait and the service was good.  The location is a little hard to find but once you do, parking is on-site.\n\nAs for the all important booze, selection was good but not extensive.  We had a bottle of red wine on special...a spanish grenache that was recommended by our server and was very good.\n\nOverall we liked it a lot and would give it 4 lulu's out of 5.
