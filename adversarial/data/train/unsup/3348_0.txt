First off,  I like this little, cozy, very comfortable hotel.  The rooms and amenities are great.  This was my first time here, but I've  always had good experiences with  Embassy Suite hotels and thus expected the same.\n\nI just needed to rant a bit about the guy working the front desk. Upon arrival he did a minimal greeting with no eye contact while I handed him my credit card and ID.  The person next to me was being told by another worker that they couldn't find their reservation.  I looked at my guy, who was typing away in the computer, and kinda humorously whispered asking if my reservations were in the system.  He totally ignored me.  I thought, ok whatever, not a personality kind of guy.  (note that I'm giving him NO attitude whatsoever) Then he just slaps down the room keys and says. \"Ok, you're done.\"  Never making eye contact.   I had to ask where the elevators were...He just pointed and said, \"there and there.\"   I gave him the benefit of the doubt and figured that he may have had a rough day.\nThen I came back down later for the free cocktail hour.  I walked past the front desk to ask where the bar was.  I see him and figured I'd give him another shot.   So I go up to him and asked in my most pleasant tone ever, \"sir, excuse me, where are they having the cocktail hour?\"  He blurts out this loud, \"WHAT??\"  which actually startled me.   I repeat my question, and he just points across the way whilst looking down and says, \"down there.\"\nWhat......the.....heck?  Maybe I look like the guy that ran over his puppy or something...I dunno.\n\nMind you, everything else about this place is fine.  The one star is just an attention grabber to rant about this front desk worker that I really feel should not be there (can you say \"understatement?\").\n\nThere are those moments in life when you just wish you were the undercover boss, and this was definitely one of those moments.
