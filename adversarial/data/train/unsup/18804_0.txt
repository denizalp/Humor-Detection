Oh yeah, one of my favorite spots in Vegas.  Last visit a large group of us got 2 cabanas side by side on the left side of the pool area.  This gave us plenty of space to ourselves when it got crowded.  If you're planning to do some serious partying, then I suggest you get a cabana at the pool or a table\/booth in the club, it's worth every penny.  A few pics of the cabana when we arrived:\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/marquee-nightclub-and-dayclub-las-vegas?select=wKgLxE9Xb0sw278ESVEXIQ#wKgLxE9Xb0sw278ESVEXIQ\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/marquee-nightclub-and-dayclub-las-vegas?select=SAwNvzYuXhyOk5M1FkToEA#SAwNvzYuXhyOk5M1FkToEA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/marquee-nightclub-and-dayclub-las-vegas?select=zAh8t6bsDY7A16S4qn85-g#zAh8t6bsDY7A16S4qn85-g\n\nWe arrived early and got in before it got crazy busy.  Throughout the night, we went through several bottles of Goose.  We left around 2 am and the party was still going strong....ahhh, I miss living in Vegas!\n\nTotal damage: $3,000 ea for the Cabanas (inc 1 bottle ea), 6 more bottles @ $500 ea + Tip.....I think we spent $11,000 total.  Not bad for an epic night out.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
