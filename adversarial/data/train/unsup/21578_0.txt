I hate the dentist -- I am not alone in saying this. It's usually a lot like taking in your car... You aren't sure if they are telling you the truth or trying to rip you off, but you just agree to it because you're so afraid of it getting worse or not working. This is not the case here. The staff is friendly, the dentist is great and personable, and they do great work. They aren't always that timely with getting you in or getting back to you about scheduling the next step, but everything else makes up for it. Best dentist I have been to (and I have been to tons!! I am a dentists dream!)
