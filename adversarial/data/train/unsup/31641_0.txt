I have to give 2.5 because of the service. Food came out quick and server was nice and fast. If it wasn't the service, I will only give 2. \n\nThere was nothing special about this place. Maybe they are really good at steak but their other dishes were good but not good enough for what you are paying ... it felt like it was higher class of pickle barrel with a good food.. \n\nThere are plenty of other good places around the neighborhood. Won't go back if I have a choice.
