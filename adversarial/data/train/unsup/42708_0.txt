The Dor-Stop had perfectly fine diner food, but definitely not a frontrunner for breakfast food or diner food in the Pittsburgh area.\n\nThe diner was packed on a Saturday morning and we had about a 15 minute wait. The staff was great at expediting the process of greeting customers when they came in and getting them on the waitlist\/calling names. The dining area is definitely cramped, but tables\/booths were very clean.\n\nOur table ordered cinnamon rolls, the jumbot eggs (basically a hash), eggs, bacon, sausage, and several different kinds of pancakes. None of the pancakes were great--they have a very dry and tough exterior and a soft center. The dryness\/toughness of the cooked exterior, however, basically demands that you drown them in pancake syrup, but they're already pretty sweet to start with, so it just gets gross. The child at our table did not eat more than two forkfuls of the chocolate-chip pancakes.  The fruit-filled pancakes (apple and banana) had great flavor, but again, they pancake itself just wasn't good. The hash was very dry and didn't have much flavor, in spite of advertising itself as having both hot sausage and jalapenos. Eggs, bacon, and sausage were fine, but definitely nothing special.\n\nThe cinnamon roll was delicious--soft and tender even at the edges, gooey, and with strong cinnamon flavor.\n\nThe coffee was absolutely terrible, which, well, I mean. We're ok with that. Diner coffee is diner coffee. Always disappointed to see the little individual containers of half-and-half, though.\n\nOur server was nice and efficient, but definitely not attentive (offered our only water refill while delivering the check for example). The place was very crowded, so she was definitely busy. \n\nIt was fun to visit a new breakfast place and check this one off of our list, but we won't be back.
