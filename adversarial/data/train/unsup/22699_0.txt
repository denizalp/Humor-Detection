Maybe I visited on the opposite version of an 'off' day because, unlike the majority of other Yelpers, I enjoyed my food here.\n\nI appreciate the simplicity. Typically burritos are stuffed with excessive ingredients that I don't even want. Rice, beans, cheese, sour cream...no thanks. At Get Some Burrito, I didn't have to tell them to hold any of these copious toppings because the burrito came just as I wanted it. Simply stuffed with salsa\/pico, guacamole, and your choice of meat. Perfection in a tortilla shell. \n\nFor the price, my tummy was satisfied with the taste and the portion. This is certainly no classy burrito joint (if there is such a thing), but I could see coming here late night or when I'm on State and hungry for some quick, Chipotle-like food minus the long lines.
