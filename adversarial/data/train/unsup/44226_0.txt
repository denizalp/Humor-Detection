I am so glad I read the reviews here and ordered the Escargot.  In short, it was stunning.  The Escargot not only tasted great out of the dish, but by using the warm French Bread served with dinner dipped in the sauce nothing was sent back to the kitchen.  \n\nIt was Thanksgiving weekend and things were pretty slow around Montelago which is not a bad thing if you want a private dinner. I would ask to sit under the lit tree at the entrance, it was a perfect way for me and my Wife to spend the night at dinner.  \n\nThanks and we cannot wait to be back!
