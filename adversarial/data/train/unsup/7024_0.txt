Another Yelp breakfast search success! Bagel Man whips up one delicious breakfast sandwich that hollers New York authenticity. The eggs, meat, and cheese bust out from the fresh and spongy bagels. There's a reason they're called Bagel Man and not Bagel Boy - this is a grown up establishment.\n\nI came through on a Saturday morning. Craving eggs and coffee, I had searched Yelp while driving through the area. The outstanding reviews convinced me so I pulled on over. The restaurant can be a little cramped with the counter taking up most of the space. My eyes darted around the large menu behind it, covered in tasty bagel options. They've got quite the spread, and I don't mean what goes on your bagel! The smear options go for days. \n\nI ordered the scrambled eggs with sausage and cheese on a wheat bagel. It came out wrapped up in foil to go. The bagels are soo good. They consistency isn't bready, it's more pliable and buttery. The trick is in the boiling and baking. Very scientific. \n\nThe store is a little warm, but the real heat is coming from their kitchen. Check out this gem of a bagel shop off the I-10\/Elliot.
