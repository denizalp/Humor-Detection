This place was a pleasant surprise! We went with our two children for the mini golf, and it was a great indoor 18 course. It was kind of small, but it didn't matter because each hole was so creative! They have one where you shoot your ball out of a gun (in a contained netting) and one that sucks the ball up into a tube and through a pipe-maze. Kind of hard to explain, but it was fun to see each hole and what it had to offer. Its also in a dark atmosphere with black lights, so that was really fun.  Our kids are pretty young and we weren't sure they would like it, but it was perfect for them! Its a clean business and the teenagers that worked there were very polite. My husband and I both agreed it would be a cute place for a birthday party too!
