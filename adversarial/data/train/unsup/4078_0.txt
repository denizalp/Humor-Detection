I've missed multiple visits for very Vegas like reasons for Gordon Ramsay BurGR.  I finally made it here and was very pleased.  One note is to either go early or have someone wait in line for you at peak times because that line can go Disneyland long. \n\nWe both had the Gordon Ramsay Burger and it was delicious.  Paired with fries and you're a happy camper.  I got a shake too, which kinda put my meal over the top.  I highly recommend BurGR for a relatively inexpensive Vegas meal.
