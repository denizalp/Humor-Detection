New to Vegas and in search of a new salon to go to for my nail fix. Searched yelp and found this spot. Coming from a place where I became super close friends with my girl in Kansas City to Luxy I have to say that I will definitely be returning. \n\nThe staff were all super nice and spoke to us like we've been coming there for a long time. My fianc√© is just getting Ito the regular mani pedi routine and we brought along his daughter for her first. All left satisfied. \n\nI really don't have anything negative to say about the shop. It appeared they had just received some packages so there were boxes in the front of the place but it didn't change my opinion enough to affect the rating. \n\nThanks again!! We will be back!
