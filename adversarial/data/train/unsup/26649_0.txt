I like this oyster bar but wish it had oyster stew.  Prices are ok for high quality of food and good service.  Nice lunch specials.  Crab salad is gr8 and love the clams and linguini.  Gumbo and jumbalaya look good but too busy for me.. Good bar selection and spacious seating.  Oyster bar option available.
