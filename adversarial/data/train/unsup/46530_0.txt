I want to report a story. \n\nTrigger warning: Audism\n\nI went to Dunkin Donut using the drive thru to order my food and drink before going to work in the morning. When I pulled up to the window, I gave the lady my list of what I wanted to order. The lady told me to pull over and she will bring me my items. I did as she requested me to. When she came up to me, she gave me my items and a note. I was appalled with her note: \"Next time, it will be easier on everyone if you just come in and order your food.\" I told her that was not very appropriate because that is taking away my accessibility. She just walked away. I was upset, but I had to leave to work. Few days later, I went there again using the drive thru. I saw the same woman and did what I usually do: give the list of my order. She rolled her eyes at me. I said that was very rude of you to do that. She told me to park my car, she will bring me the food. I decided to park and go inside the building. I wanted to explain to her why I felt so discriminated with her previous message. She said\" I am not breaking any laws here, just be considerate of others. I read her message and shook my head. She grabbed the note out of my hand and crumbled it and threw it in the trash inside the worker area. The other workers and customers just STOOD there.. DOING NOTHING. I was shocked.. I kept asking someone to serve me my food and to give me her name. Someone finally came forward and gave me her name. That lady, VERONICA, picked up the paper in the trash and put it in her pocket. No one told her to do the right thing. I was furious and hurt concurrently. I want to report her, but I have no evidence, except for the workers there and perhaps a hidden camera. I have reported to the Dunkin Donuts, but I feel that is not enough.
