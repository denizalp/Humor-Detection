OH MY PIZZA. Let me start by saying I could pretty much eat pizza at Vero and only Vero for the rest of my life and be happy (okay that's a bit of an exaggeration). Every pizza I've ever eaten here has been fantastic, my favorites being the margarita, the salumi, and the capua. On my most recent visit I noticed they had updated the menu and added a few new pies, which all sounded great. We started with the parma board, which is a board of Parmesan cheese, prosciutto, local honey and fresh bread. OMG so delicious. We scarfed that sucker down. Then we split the salsiccia (italian sausage, roasted peppers, candy onions, gar\nlic, ricotta, caciocavallo) and the margherita (tomato, mozzarella, basil) pizzas. Both were exceptional, as usual.  You really can't go wrong with any of the pizzas here. Be mindful, these are more personal sized pizzas. I would recommend one per person, because you can always take leftovers home. And save room for dessert, they have an awesome gelato selection.
