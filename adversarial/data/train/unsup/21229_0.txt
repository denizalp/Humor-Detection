Home, sweet, home. If you want to deck out your home, make a stop here. You will be dazzled by all the pretty, shiny, chrome-y things. If I won the lottery, I would build a home from the ground up with Ferguson's help. \n\nIt's not everyday that I need to buy faucets. Who knew they could be $555\/each?! Wowzers. They also have tricky toilets that hang from the wall, thus reducing space for those tight bathrooms. Didn't check the price on that one, but I'm sure it's somewhere along the lines of an arm, maybe a leg. \n\nThey have everything you need to make your house a cozy and ritzy home. Walking around I was mesmerized by all the various fixtures and endless home possibilities. If you are remodeling or building, then schedule a time to meet with one of their designers about a week or two before you need anything and they'll help you select items. \n\nGreat design place, but like any savvy shopper, I'm going to have to decide where I want to invest and save. However, I'm sure I'll be back for a few major fixture needs...who am I kidding, 1 major fixture...until I win the Mega-Millions.
