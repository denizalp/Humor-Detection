3.5 stars\n\nafter reading all the glowing reviews and receiving 2 michelin stars, i was expecting to be absolutely blown away...the service was excellent and the decor was stunning...but the food was somewhat disapppointing.  not to say that it wasn't good, but just not 2 star michelin good...so, i guess l'atelier will continue to be my favorite restaurant in las vegas...for now\n\ni do have to say that  the basket of mini madeleines we were served at the end of the meal were...D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S...sorry nancy silverton...your's can't even compare...i dare say that it was even worthy of eliciting a proustian effect...that = pretty damn good...unworthy of mentioning were the thoughtful but kind of gross package of house-made lemon macarons i was given as a gift...why is it so hard to get decent macarons??  nik, the next time you're in paris, can you express me some decent macarons pleeeeeease??\n\nonto the food:\n\namuse bouche:  wagyu tartare, lobster tempura, fried risotto ball, parsnip and apple soup with fennel powder, cracker with white cheddar cheese filling \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=k4VtDJG1EzXU-hyaxcMUIw\n\ntuna carpaccio topped with fresh huckleberries and crème fraîche\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=4-Cnoh2kHKJa858uZ3-vaQ\n\nprawn carpaccio with celery leaves\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=FAP0U-04RiPGwJEWhZ3scw\n\n\nlobster, leek risotto topped with small japanese crab\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=0-eMPu7nswUjI0ScXgQE-w\n\nsquid ink pasta, butter poached lobster, baby brussel sprouts topped with uni\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=_7W3u8KRIqgI_PZJB7wYcA\n\nfoie gras with mustard greens and sliced turnips\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=sJKFiZYMvXjDInrCtmpzTA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=nSVBWD8n18myV7ZMjXq2Dw\n\nparmesan crusted dover sole, wild mushrooms, baby savoy cabbage with cabbage foam\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=-X58EmKyMLH1_0KL1d0tqg\n\nherb crusted rack of lamb and loin of lamb\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=HjwbQeiideLkVzayNTuaBw\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=3DxW0BVzASqUZM7C7w9AYg\n\nparnsip custard with crispy marrow, arugula salad with shaved parmesan, and sliced kobe\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=vSjdzQfd2Rs9lzIms5zooA\n\nintermezzo:  panna cotta with tropical fruit\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=qOSA6BVq49j3Ti9qELjEUQ\n\nintermezzo: coconut tapioca with tropical fruit and pineapple chip\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=HJtGrbH1RWdzyTmqHlg4kg\n\nmascarpone \"cannoli\" with expresso ice cream\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=2VRskLlwBE5isiak2MO1zg\n\nbanana beignet, peanut butter ice cream and dark chocolate brownies\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=TxqarNCtCUx20wnEx8xAtw\n\npetit fours\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=P20G7FOlqP-Ies5kVltI3Q\n\nfresh madeleines\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lQ9VmIWvM6v-rONPkYX8aQ?select=7L6JkBabc3hFoKljPVHG-Q
