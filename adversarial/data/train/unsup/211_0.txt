After eating at Hopper Hut, I now daydream about eating Sri Lankan food. \n\nI just love Hopper Hut!\n\nLampries! I love the Lampries! Not only that it is sizable, cheap can feed 4 of me, the spices in there are so complex... with all those different spicies in it and serving steaming hot.. oh what a treat! Even I am not into Mutton (I don't eat lamb, goat!!)  but the Mutton Lampries is A+ OK for me!\n\nAll the items are delicious. And it is a good restaurant for sharing with your friends or fellow yelpers\n\nThe owner of the restaurant that served us are really nice and friendly and with a nice smile!\n\nI definitely will be back! LAMPRIES!!
