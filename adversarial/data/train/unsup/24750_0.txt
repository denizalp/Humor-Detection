Came here the other night to get my Thai tea boba fix. I have been to their Happy Valley location and was excited to see this place opening by ASU. There can never be too many boba shops; in fact, there needs to be more up north in Scottsdale and North Phoenix. \n\nI ordered my standard drink and waited at the seating area. There were a few people ahead of me so it took some time for my drink to come out. It was a fairly busy time with more folks coming in after me. I enjoyed my drink as always and was pleased to see they have a variety of drinks, toppings, snow and even food. Seems like they are in a prime location and will do well. Kudos!
