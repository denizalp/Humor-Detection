Not happy with last experience. The food as always been pretty good. But $15+ for a steak sandwich meal is a bit steep. The soda machine was out of 50% of the drinks so I waited for 10 minutes for that. The phone was constantly ringing with no one answering and some beeping or notification sound was going off behind register and it was annoying. WTF. My sandwich seemed a little skimpy this time as well.  Anyway, not worth the $15 for a lunch. And just to clarify I did not vote for min wage increase. So don't blame me. There are better options for 9-12$
