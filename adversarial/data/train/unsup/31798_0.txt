With hands on the wheel and eyes on the road, it's amazing what you don't see!  Such is Tott's which I've passed hundreds of times not knowing it was there.\n\nTott's is  a very good neighborhood spot - not necessarily a Chinese food destination.  On the other hand, the menu doesn't stop there also offering: Curry, Thai, and Japanese.\n\nClean?  Extremely!  Best yet you can see your food prepared!\nFresh food?  Yes, definitely!\nFriendly?  Very!  The owner himself takes your order and says \"thank you!\"\nGood prices?  Yep.  $7 to $10 buys dinner.\nPortions?  Dinner tonight, lunch tomorrow.\nSeating?  Maybe, maybe not.  It's small restaurant and they do a very good business.  A few outside tables though.\nService?  Very fast!  Take out took less than 10 minutes.\nFood?  Good!  Yet I always kick myself at home with menu in hand wishing I had ordered something else...\n.......Guess I'll have to go back!
