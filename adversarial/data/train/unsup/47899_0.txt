I give this place two thumbs up. I have to say it is the best Chinese \/ Vietnamese restaurant. Pho is fresh and quickly prepared the best fried flounder with sauce I had second to none. Staff are very professional and the restaurant ambiance cannot be more relaxed and family oriented. I was starting doubt the quality of Chinese restaurants here in Las Vegas until we came here to have late dinner. I highly recommend the place for anyone looking for plenty of menu selections or a relaxed and appropriate dine-in for family.
