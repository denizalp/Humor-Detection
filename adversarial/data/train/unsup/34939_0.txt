Homey ambience, authentic comfort food.\n\nI had the pork bone soup, as usual. And Simon had seafood pancake, as usual.\n\nEverything was flavourful and well seasoned. There was parilla powder in the soup, and the pancake (deep fried which was a little odd) had lots of green onions :) \n\nWater is self serve on the side, parking can be a little tight, but don't let the details deter you, the food is worth it :)
