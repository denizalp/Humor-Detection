I needed a new dermatologist.  After reading several reviews, I found one about Dr. Jeffries, although now I cannot see it even in the not recommended.  I had a spot in my arm that was making me nervous, so I made an appointment with Dr. Jeffries.  The process as the other reviewer said was pretty easy, the only thing you have to be aware is that Dr. Jeffries works in the North Scottsdale office only on Wednesdays.  I had waited so long to check this spot, I could wait a couple more weeks.  After checking the website, I realized my husband had been to this practice about 9 years ago, it was much smaller then.  I went in and filled my paperwork, I was called in on time and the doctor was really nice.  She did a full check up of my skin spots.  The good news, its nothing I'm just getting old, so spots come with the territory.  She told me they could remove them, since it is considered cosmetic, it is out of pocket.  I made an appointment to take them out, since I sometimes scratch them and make them bleed.  Getting old is not fun!
