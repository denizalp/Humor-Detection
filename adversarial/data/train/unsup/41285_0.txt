I guess the Vegas club circuit is just not my scene, because I thought this was a waste of money. One advertised selling point is you don't wait in line. That was untrue because there were 90 people on our tour, and it takes a long time to get that many people into a club.\n\n Another advertised selling point was free drinks on the bus. First, we were only on the bus twice, and for a total of about 10 minutes each time. Second, the drinks were disgusting. Clearly bottom-shelf liquor. Also, they didn't provide water on the bus.\n\nThey also advertise no cover charges. That part is true, but the so-called VIP treatment stops there. We were even kicked out of our seats in the first place, Gold Lounge, because it became bottle service only at 10:00 pm.\n\nYou will get a text a few hours beforehand saying, among other things, no flat shoes for women. Ignore that. Or at least check the dress codes of the clubs on the itinerary. Lots of girls were wearing flats, and some wore sandals. I also saw guys in nice jeans and sneakers. You will be on your feet for 5 hours and do a lot of walking, so be comfortable, while still looking nice. \n\nThis tour is a good way to see several Vegas clubs, but other than that, I don't recommend it.
