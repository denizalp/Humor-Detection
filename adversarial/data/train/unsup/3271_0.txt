I have no right to complain, I saw all the bad reviews and still went. I was desperate it it's right next door to work. \n\nLiterally 45 seconds to do my brows! Wax only no clean up, pluck, arch, scissor cut. Basically what I could do at home.\n\nThen they run my car and ask out loud do I want to leave a tip, I tip off what I get, normally it's 5-6 dollars this deserves 1. I said I'll write it on there. She says no how much.... In front of the whole store. A tip should be no ones business besides the one receiving it. I said a dollar. And all I hear is sighs lol step it up people\n\nI'll never come back
