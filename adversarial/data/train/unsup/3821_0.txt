Dude! DUDE!\n\nI have been loyal to this car wash for some odd reason. I guess it was just the first place that I went when I moved out here, so I kept going back. Well, let me just say that after yesterday I am DONE!\n\nMy boyfriend and I both took our cars to be washed since they were a filthy mess. I got there first (boyfriend had to get gas) and I pulled up to the guy at the front. He asks me if I want their expensive ass carwash, and I politely respond I just want the normal vacuum and wash deal. He goes on to point out that I have \"water spots\" on the dirt in my car and that they wont come clean with the normal wash. Sooo what you're trying to tell me is that you wont wash my car? I almost left, and I would have if my boyfriend wasn't behind me.\n\nRang the bf and told him \"the guy in the front is a hard ass, so make sure you tell him you only want the wash\" (my boyfriend backs down in situations like this). So he gets there and says 'wash and vacuum'. The guy tries to hard sell him as well and even goes \"oh so your cheap. the economy must have been really rough on you\". DUDE! Serious?\n\nYea. They washed my car (half ass like always) and I'm so done.
