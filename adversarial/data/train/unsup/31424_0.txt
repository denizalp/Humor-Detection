My regular nail tech at my regular place wasn't available, and I made the mistake of trusting someone else there. Worst experience, and really shitty pedi on top of it. I left there without getting my nails done, and after checking with my trusty Yelpers, I decided to come here. \n\nWow! Upon hearing what happened and how I wound up coming to their salon, everyone really went out of their way to make me feel welcome and taken care of.\n\nMiss (Ms.?) Swan was a love, and she made sure I was hooked up with the right tech who did my tips, and then another tech, who did my gel and design...just to help out.  That sort of attitude and ethic is rarely seen, but I certainly noticed and appreciated it here . There was a receptionist who kept checking to see if they or I needed anything as well. Again, good form! The salon is also very clean and serene, no obnoxious music blaring which was very welcomed. The only changes I'd like to see as a client are some comfortable chairs, and perhaps some decorative art to warm up the room a bit. \n\nI'm still not exactly sure how I came to spend over three hours there (probably my OCD to blame, lol), but it really was a pleasure getting to know these ladies and have quality work done as well. I came in mad as a hornet, but left being very pleased. Thank you all very much. Both myself and my sense of humor will most certainly be back LOL. :-)
