One of the best parts of Kennywood! Whether you eat the fries plain or you smother them in that amazing cheesy bacony goodness, you just can't go wrong. Can't leave visit Kennywood and not visit Potato Patch! Also heard they added poutine and burgers last year, I will definitely need to check those out!
