My typical cheap Chinese place is no more and when I remembered I had this flier on my fridge today and was in dire need of some comfort couch food, I reached out to them for help.\n\nThey did not disappoint. The take out menu they have is so simple and well organized it's unbelievable. I was told it would be 35 minutes which is reasonable. Imagine my excitement when they arrived in 18!! On top of that my food was very well packaged and organized. \n\nThe garlic chicken isn't as spicy as I was hoping for but was still good and a perfect portion. The wonton soup was delicious too and more than I could eat. The steamed pork dumpling appetizer which is usually fool proof was just okay.\n\nWe'll see how many \"after affects\" I have. The big down side I saw so far as the $12 min order. I had to order 3 items for my lowly self and only finished one.\n\nOh yeah, and this is my 100th review yay :)
