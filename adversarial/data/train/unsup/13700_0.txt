There is a growing trend amongst hipster eateries that believes that the spicier that the food is, the better that it tastes.  SoSoBa, subscribes to this philosophy, big time.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that any restaurant that has to overpower the taste of their food by making it so spicy, is hiding poor cooking or ingredients so that you won't notice. Hereto, SoSoBa is guilty. \n\nSpice should be used to ENHANCE the flavor of delicious food, not overpower it.\n\n\nTheir menu fails to indicate levels of spiciness or even mention that the item you are ordering may be spicy.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer (pork wings). The meat was tender and delicious and served on a bed of crispy noodles with a sauce and some sort of fine red thread-like substance. The sauce was mildly spicy and complimented the dish, however, it looked like someone spilled the jar of chili powder onto the crispy noodles.  The taste was overpowering and left your lips stinging from the heat.\n\nThe waitstaff seemed indifferent to complaint of over spiced appetizer and tried to explain it away instead of apologizing.\n\nThe menu had a poor variety of of main dishes and a repetitive use of pork belly throughout the entire menu. This is a clear indication that the chef is either  uncreative or is unable to work outside their comfort zone.\n\nTheir kitchen was EXTREMELY unprepared, they RAN OUT of a MAIN INGREDIENT (Udon Noodle) early on a Saturday evening. For a restaurant that claims to specialize in noodles, this is a faux pas.  The kitchen also took far too long to prepare our meals. This is either an indication of a poorly run kitchen, or I suspect an indication that this restaurant is trying to upsell their clients more drinks...a dubious practice. \n\nEven though I expressed concern to the waitstaff about not wanting my meal to be too spicy and despite my earlier complaint about the overspiciness of our appetizer, I was delivered a bowl of food that was also high in the heat index. \n\nThis solidified my opinion that either the chef prefers to serve food the way they want to cook it or that the waitstaff was incompetent.\n\nThe final kicker that proves that this restaurant does not have your best interest at heart was the gratuity ledger on the bill that gave you 3 suggested tips:\n\n18% = $9.36\n20% = $10.40\n84.20% = $43.78\n\nReally...84.20%?\n\nEither this is meant to be a joke, or more likely they hope that you are too drunk from all those extra drinks you bought waiting for thier unprepared, over spiced, and uncreative, food to arrive to notice the amount. \n\nOverall a complete failure, would not recommend.
