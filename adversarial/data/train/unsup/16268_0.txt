I was in the area and decided too give Jersey Mikes's a try even know there where a few bad reviews.\nI ordered a regular size #13 original italian with mustard.\nThe hero was good not the best that I have had but ok.\nThe service was fast and friendly and the place was clean.\nI would probably go back and try another style sandwich.\nI thought the pricing was a bit high compared too a Subway.
