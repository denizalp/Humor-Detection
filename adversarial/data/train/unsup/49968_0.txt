BEST MEAL IN PHOENIX AREA-\nOkay, background to qualify me to say this- I was raised in a family with a parent who is a Food & Beverage Director at very prestigious hotels all over the World. I grew up on 5 star restaurant food and basically lived in hotels. I moved out to the Phoenix area about ten years ago and eat out all the time. I have had meals for two that have cost $300 that didn't taste as life changing as the food at the Centurion.\nA work friend has been bragging about this place for years now and for years I thought he was just exaggerating. Nope- wow- our taste buds were dancing with joy!\nSo this place has a pretty good beverage selection ;-) and the food they serve are Tapas (small plates). I believe there may be certain dishes you can order in an entree size but you'd have to check with them.\nOur group sampled a few rounds of different beverages. They are very knowledgeable about their beer and wine choices and will even offer small tastes to pair with your tapas. Their menu is completely seasonal as they use fresh ingredients. We sat in the room with the kitchen, which is extremely small and you would never in a million years expect the quality and flavor in the dishes to come out of that kitchen. \nWe ordered many items between two couples, here is what my Husband and I ordered: \n-Risotto of the Day (Pumpkin with a light cheese) x2- and then again at the end of the meal- my husband wanted more too, it was so amazing. Light and creamy and topped off with some very lightly sea salted pieces of delicate pumpkin. Wowza- incredible!\n-Papas Bravas - \"Potatoes Pan Fried in A Spicy Pimento Sauce, Finished w\/ Chive and Garlic Cr√®me Fraiche\". Most delicious and flavorful potato dish I have ever tasted. It was impressive that the outside had this nice crispiness to it but the inside was so fluffy.\n-Chef Eric's Bolognese - \"Over House-made Fettuccini\" - Super flavorful and delicious! \n-Stuffed Mushrooms - \"Stuffed with Pesto Risotto and Wrapped in Prosciutto w\/ Aged Cheddar Tarragon Sauce\" - OMG- Wow, flavor explosion. Cannot stress enough how delicious these are and you will love them regardless of if you like mushrooms. \n-Baked Brie - \"Brie and Raspberry Preserves Baked Fresh to Order -  Inside of Puff Pastry\" - Just melts in your mouth- yummy yummy!\n-Pancetta Wrapped Gnocchi - \"With an Aged Cheddar Sauce & Harissa Toast Points\" - Okay, I honestly loved every single item we ordered, but I imagine these flavors in my dreams. This is probably the MOST DELICIOUS thing I have EVER eaten in my life. Wowza- no joke, get here, order this, make your food dreams come true!\n\nWe also had two desserts- one light and fluffy like a giant macaroon and the other was their famous chocolate siracha cake. Both delicious! \n\nSeriously cannot wait to go here again and take everyone I know there for a piece of heaven. :-)
