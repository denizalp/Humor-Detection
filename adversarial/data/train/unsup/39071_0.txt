This place is really small, but if I go to Korea Town, I won't ever miss my chance to come on in and grab a delicious flavoured scoop. The Earl Grey\/ London Fog is , as always, my favourite, but surprisingly, I really really can't get the coffee\/ espresso flavoured ice cream out of my mind! The initial taste was bitter, just like you'd expect from a cup of black coffee. Then there's the most amazing sweet, rich, coffee after taste which is absolutely delicious!! I don't know if they did that on purpose, or if it was a happy coincidence, but its superb and I hope they don't discontinue that flavour.. everrr. hahaa \n\ngive this place a try if you're in the neighborhood! the staff are really nice and they let you taste test the flavours before you decide which is the one you'd like to order.
