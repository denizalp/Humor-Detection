I originally booked my birthday dinner at the St. Clair location but when I found out that they were opening a location just down the street from where I live I was super happy so I decided to give it a try. Based on the reviews from the other locations, the service was very much consistent over at Yonge St. I knew it would be a hit or miss since they just opened up a week ago but I must say that I was thorougly impressed with the whole experience from beginning to end. The manager opened up the 2nd floor early to accomdate my large group just so that we have a bigger and more private space. The manager from the Yonge St. and St. Clair location even came by to greet me and make sure that I had everything I needed. Our server Lindsay did an awesome job taking care of my party and also confirming our orders to make sure everything was correct.  She was friendly and very attentive. They accidently gave us an extra order of poutine but the manager decided to gave it to us for free instead of taking it back. Overall, the food was pretty decent. I tried the Banana Coconut Crusted Chicken, Lemon Dill Salmon and the Korean Beef Tacos, all of which were tasty. What I also really liked is that all the menu items are $20 or less so it's perfect for a casual night out. I definitely want to come back to try out other food items and check out the beautiful patio.
