I searched on Yelp for nail salons in Vegas and found this one with high ratings and good reviews.  I've been to several salons in the area--they were satisfactory.  Diamond Nails offers a variety of pedicure treatments.  Sure, it might cost you more than the average salon around the corner from home, but \"you get what you pay for\".  To me, it was worth it.  Figured I would play it safe and make an appointment on a Saturday afternoon, and sure enough it was packed when I arrived.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  The wait time was less than 5 minutes even after arriving a half-hour early.\n\nFirst visit, I chose the \"Hot Stone\" treatment.  You are offered a bottle of drinking water to hydrate just before they work on you.  Next thing I noticed, for each customer, they used sterilized tools enclosed in a sealed package.  Kory, a male pedicurist, took his time during preparation and was friendly enough to have a conversation with during the treatment.  Some pedicurist can't wait to work on your feet (you're lucky if you even get a leg massage), then to not say one word but, ready to collect.\n\nThe entire experience was relaxing, soothing, and satisfying.  I think Kory does a wonderful job as a pedicurist, and alongside him, Stacey and James too, both of whom have treated two close customers I know with satisfying results.  When Kory was through, he told me to sit back and relax while my toes were drying.  He was in no rush to have me pay for the services--only when I was ready to get up and go.\n\nI'm definitely returning to Diamond Nails (hopefully, soon!) and try their next level of spa pedicure treatment!  Happy Feet!!
