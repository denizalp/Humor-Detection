A large number of options.  As I am gluten intolerant,  I asked the hostess as she was seating us for gluten free options.  She called the chef who was kind enough to give me a tour of the entire buffet.  The food was reasonably tasty and the salads were fresh.   The staff however seemed a bit too involved among themselves.  The dessert selection was extensive for the gluten tolerant but only two for those of us who can't consume gluten
