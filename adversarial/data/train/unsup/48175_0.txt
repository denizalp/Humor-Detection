They do NOT do silk wraps, although they told me they did when I called for an appointment. They do the thicker (uglier) linen wraps. They do not use powder to strengthen the wrap. And no, the girl can't do an extension with the wrap for a broken nail. (I have had all these things done elsewhere for the last 15 years.) The last straw was when she wouldn't allow me to use the nail polish dryer I prefer. I asked her about customer service, and she replied, \"Every salon is different.\" So take my advice, and go to a *different* salon where customer service is a priority -- AND they tell the truth about their services.
