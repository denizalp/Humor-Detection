My history with vets is admittedly limited; long perhaps but not vast. When I married 1972, a poodle\/sheepdog mix came with the package. Our first trip to the vet was a clinic nearest our house, owned and operated by John Wallace, DVM, fresh out of Iowa. We discovered we were also neighbors and our friendship has lasted to this day. \n\nThis is the kind of vet Dr. Wallace is: On Christmas morning our dog had a severe episode. I called the doctor and asked what to do. His answer? \"Meet me in 20 minutes at the clinic.\"\n\nMind you, this was Christmas morning!!!\n\nWhen we decided to rescue a Ragdoll cat we considered a few vet clinics. Instead we decided to give Boca Park Animal Hospital a try, as it is located literally walking distance from my house. We've now been there often enough that I'm comfortable doing the following evaluation.\n\nFront desk: Knowledgeable, efficient and concerned. Always with a smile and willing to offer comfort. Grade: A\n\nTechs and Nurses: Gentle, caring, compassionate: All we've worked with seem happy to be in the veterinary profession. Grade: A.\n\nVets: We've only had our Callie seen by Drs. Anderson and Wagner but like their last name initials, they are compassionate from A-W (and XYZ). Dr. Anderson is clearly an A rated doctor based on the limited time we saw and spoke to her. Dr. Wagner is the vet with whom we had the most interaction and based on her caring, going the extra mile, compassion, and training in three of the best schools in the country, I must rate her as A+, or a reincarnation of Dr. Wallace. Her devotion to the profession and concern for the well-being of our Calie is beyond the pale. BCAH is fortunate to have such a vet on staff and we are fortunate to have discovered her. But Calie is the most fortunate as she gets the optimal care.\n\nAndrew R. Nixon, Ed.D.
