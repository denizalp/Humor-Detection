Nice place for a rock bar.  The neighborhood is reasonably decent, there's a lot of parking around on the street (huge church in the next block that's obviously not in session during the shows).  The back patio is pretty sweet to hang out with a beer in the nice weather.  Show space is sizable.  Bathroom, or at least the women's bathroom, could be improved but it works for what you need a bathroom for.  There's also a bar next door that keeps the block pretty busy in the evenings and reduces that \"walking down the deserted street to your car at 2 am\" vibe.  I'm happy to see places like this operating on the West Side, thus reducing the need to drive to Coventry, University Circle area, or other easterly places.
