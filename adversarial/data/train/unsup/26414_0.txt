I don't really like to give reviews unless it was due. It wasn't about the restaurant but the service. I felt it was necessary to highlight the great service by Donte at the front bar. The guy was on his game and handled things I've seen a whole crew couldn't do. The guy was on , serving customers, dishing out plates, cleaning areas, greeting people, and not skipping on doing a great job on the drinks. Props to the person that hired him and a major kudos to Donte!
