Being that this is a \"European\" themed hotel, it is nice but not as impressive as the other European themed hotels on the strip (like Bellagio, Venetian, Caesars). However, the price we paid was great (as we got a Groupon deal) and it is in a good part of the strip. Also parking was easy (short walking distance from the structure to the lobby!), they give a coupon for 2 free drinks, and self checkout was great!\n\nThe rooms are pretty standard; its clean, some items show wear and tear... one thing I didn't like was the thin walls... you could easily hear guests in the next room. Luckily we weren't in the room most of the time, we were just there to sleep after partying!\n\nOverall, an OK place. The highlights for me were the parking and the self checkout :) I would come here again if the price was right. Thanks!
