The only reason I'm writing this review is because of the bag check. I walked into the store, made it about halfway through the store before a cashier was yelling for my attention. I turn around and she shouts that she needs to check my bag. The bag in question is probably 12\"x12\" and doesn't fit anything wider than an iPad before it starts to visibly bulge out. I hand her my bag and receive a ticket. As soon as I turn around I see women shopping with purses bigger than mine that could have easily fit whatever they were trying to stop me from stealing. I don't want to say it was racially motivated, but two black men walking into a store and they're the only ones who have to check in a bag? I wonder if she knew that statistics show that middle aged white women (who carried their purses freely) are more likely the shoplift. Even more baffling is the fact thought of my stealing a $2.99 shirt stuffed in my LV bag. \n\nThankfully the manager was in reach and She promptly helped us. She retrieved the bag and apologized. She explained to the employee that backpacks were the only bags that needed to be checked in and the employee says \"Well I didn't know. No one tells me anything.\" My bag was the only bag on the counter while numerous purses and diaper bags roamed the store. \n\nNeedless to say several employees overheard the situation and assisted us in finding the manager. They expressed to us that she was wrong and not to argue with her., probably saving us from a more chaotic interaction. \n\nIn the end I didn't find anything I was interested in and left. The store was neat and had plenty of employees tending to it. Will I be back? I doubt it.
