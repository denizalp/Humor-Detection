Customer service is incredibly unacceptable. Unsure of how they have customers.\n\n- The hostess was unfriendly, rude and unprofessional\n- Food did not come out until an hour later and we had to follow up many times on the wait time - we have a feeling she told the kitchen staff\/manager to do this as she yelled at us for sitting at the wrong table\n- The manager, Tommy, ignored us when we tried to flag him down to talk to him about the issue \n- When the issue was brought to the manager's attention, he yelled\/argued back with us\n\nThere are so many dim sum places around Markham, do not come to this one - just read the other one star reviews.
