So this greasy spoon is as ghetto as they come. They got a market and a grill manned by this guy who looks like Snoop Dogg - What's funny is....its a lil intimidating for white people when they walk in. But hey everyone's friendly. They have video poker machines that are still coin in and coin out. But Hamburger Hut(or we call it Hamburger Slut) holds a delicious treasure of hamburger surprise. Ever watch Grease 2 and Michelle Pfeiffer is at the diner getting a burger and putting lots of ketchup on it? Or Pulp Fiction. Where they house the Big Kahuna burger? Well these movies make me crave burgers. This burger grilled over an open flame....FANF*CKINGTASTIC.....yes It's not Burger Bar at Mandalay or Kilroy's - This is just all man meat grilled juicy like a house burger without the onions or bell peppers sticking out of it. Snoop knows how to grill a burger. The chicken fingers....sure they're packaged - but it's good fast food they usually hook you up big. Fried chicken's not bad also. I haven't found anything I really didn't like at this place. Sure it's not Mc Donald's(I just threw up in my mouth) but it definitely is an experience if I use the FANF*CKINGTASTIC word....\nSo Location - 1 star...but it gives it character. Experience and Taste...4 stars.
