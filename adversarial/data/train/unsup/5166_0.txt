Janine is right - there aren't many choices here for the captive audience. Once you're through security and US clearance, the Burger Bar seemed the best for a hot meal. It's standard Burger King with a focus on burgers. Whoppers of all shapes and styles from the regular Whopper to the Bourbon Whopper and even the Angry Whopper (I'm guessing the security folks eat a lot of these last ones).\n\nSoda fountain with Coke products is completely refillable, which might be good if you are a big Coke drinker and you have a long layover.\n\nGood seating with some view of the ramp area. Service was speedy.
