We recently got our PADI certification here and our instructor Allan was by far one of the greatest teachers we've had for anything. Not only was he super personable, but you could tell he really cared about your well-being a safety. He went above and beyond to ensure that we had a great time, and even provided Hot Coco to keep us warm in the 52 degree lake temperatures. Highly recommend him and the shop!
