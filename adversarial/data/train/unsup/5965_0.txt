You gotta stop at Fat Tuesdays when you're in Vegas. Delicious slushies in tropical flavors. I have tried the peach Bellini and mango flavors so far. Yummy! Pay the extra money to get a reusable cup. You can pick the size. You can then get cheaper refills later. I would pay the extra buck to get another shot added, as the slushies aren't strong.
