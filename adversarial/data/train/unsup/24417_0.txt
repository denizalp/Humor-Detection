So this guy Frank is apparently a sauce specialist and I'm not even going to try to pronounce the French word for it because last time I did that I said the French word for sausage and was ridiculed, but anyway the food here is incredible and incredibly expensive but it's worth it, especially the seafood medley entr√©e I had, which was a little lineup of bits of various rich fishes and seafoods each with their own little amazing sauce, and it was all worth the money and waiting over half an hour for my friends to arrive while the hostess not-so-silently judged the foundation of our friendship.
