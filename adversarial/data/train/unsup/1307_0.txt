oh schnaP!\nI came out of this restaurant beating on my bf and asking him why restaurants like this don't exist in SF.  With the number of Japanese Americans in the bay area, WHY CANT THERE BE A DECENT IZAKAYA?!?  WHY!\n\nIchiza, please come to the bay.  I'll come every weekend I promise.\n\nAnyway.  With the help of you yelpers, I made up my mind to come to Ichiza the day we arrived in Vegas because  knew this place was open til 3.  We lugged our luggage in like true tourists and just started ordering off the wall and getting a bottle of Sapporo.  We had all sorts of things that night but the uni in ponzu sauce was TO DIE for.  It was the best thing ever i wanted to order like 10 of them.  Each little dish is meant for you to drink some beer with and savor and sample.  I'd love to come with a BUNCH of people and just order all types of food.  We also tried their spicy kara-age (good), miso cod (good), fried oysters (really good) and I wanted to try a lot of other stuff too but we were full. The noodle dishes here looked amazing and their little donburis looked good too.\n\nIt's comfort food and places like this that make me miss my mom's cooking and Tokyo. DAMMIT.\n\nPrices were reasonable, service was good, atmosphere ROCKED.  It's a lil out there if youre staying near the strip.  Best meal I've had in a while.
