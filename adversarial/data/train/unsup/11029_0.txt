I wasn't sure what the hyped about this place beside it being new and popular in New York and other countries.  However, my overall dining experience here was alright, nothing too spectacular.  \n\nWe decided to dine here while in Vegas and saw this place had 4 stars rating from yelp; let's try it out shall we?  Well I wish I could give this restaurant a 4 stars too, but I thought what we had went through from service to food, and the overall were all just average.   \n\nWe dined here on a Saturday evening.  We didn't have any reservation that day and luckily after 10-15min of wait time, we were seated at the bar \/ open kitchen dining area.  \n\nLOCATION - located at the Cosmopolitan Hotel on the 2nd floor, next to Milk Bar.\n\nHOURS from their Main website\nLunch:        11:00am - 2:30pm\nAfternoon    2:30pm - 5:00pm\nDinner:         5:00pm - 11:00pm \nLate Night   11:00pm -2:00am\n\n\nSERVICE - Our server that night was a guy\/ bartender guy (forgot his name, Caucasian\/semi Hispanic lookin with stylish hair cut).  \n---Not sure if he was too busy making drinks and forgot about the \"customers\" in front of him, but he didn't seem to care much about us throughout the whole dining experience.  \n--- He got our orders out and basically just left us there doing our own thing.  \n---He didn't even check up on how was our food or if we had wanted any desserts? \n----It's not like we had sat 5-10 feet away from him then I can assume that he must be super busy, but we were right in front of him eye to eye.   \n\n\nENTREES AND FEEDBACKS: \n\n**SPICY CUCUMBERS** $7 -chunky cucumber, togarashi (Japanese chili powder), toasted almonds, scallions.  There was this green sauce, but wasn't sure what it was.  This dish was ok; at some point some of the cucumber had a hint of bitterness in them which I assumed it was from the cucumber skin.  \n\n**PORK BELLY BUN** $7 (1 Order) - 1 thick pork belly, hoisin sauce, scallions, and sliced cucumbers.    I would recommend you try this dish.  The thick pork belly was very tender; eat this with their \"Ssam\" sauce (similar to Korean gochujang- that red chili paste you see in a lot of Korean dishes.)  \n\n**CHICKEN KARAAGE** $7 (1 order) - spicy mayo sauce, pickled red onions, shredded iceberg lettuce.  When I hear \"Chicken Karaage,\" I picture this as a crunchy fried chicken.  However, our chicken didn't come out crispy or crunchy but more of a soggy seared chicken on a bun.  \n\n**PORK RAMEN** $18 - Yes, ramen can cost this much people, which is a bit pricy to my opinion.  This ramen included: 1 thick pork belly piece, shredded pork belly shoulder, 1 poached egg, seaweed, fish cake sliced, bean sprouts, and green onions.   \n- The ramen was ok, but it was so SALTY.   Everything else in the ramen was good if only the chefs cut down on the salt here.\n-  OR at least please have a taste test of the broth before serving it out to your customers.  \n\n\nOVERALL - I think Momofuku was alright.  Would I come back?  Maybe, I would come back for the pork belly bun only, but not much of the other dishes.   It was nice to sit at the open kitchen where you get to have a full view of all dishes being made in front of you, but then again the great service wasn't quite there.  I was glad to try this popular restaurant out and you should try it out once and see for yourself too.
