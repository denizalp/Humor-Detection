I went to Dr. Harmych to have a cosmetic procedure which involved primarily the removal of a mole on my cheek. He also removed various skin tags from my chin\/neck\/under arm area. I was anxious and nervous about pain and potential scarring but felt the mole affected my self-confidence so I thought I would at least look into the procedure. I have seen other doctors but after a consultation just never followed through because I didn't feel comfortable. Dr.Harmych and his staff put me at ease and I can honestly say the entire process of consultation, procedure, and recovery were so easy, painfree, and absolutely worth every penny. I only wish I had found them sooner. It has been 2 months and I feel so much more confident and beautiful. There is no scar, the skin is healing beautifully, and you can't even tell the mole (about the size of a pencil eraser) was ever there. I would recommend Dr. Harmych to my closest friends and family and anyone looking for a professional and personable experience. Dr. Harmych is the best!
