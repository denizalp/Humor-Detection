My g\/f and I come here about once a month and we are never disappointed.  The food is excellent.  I usually get the sukiyaki and she gets the shabu shabu.  If you get the sukiyaki, I have some recommendations.  First, order the raw egg with the meal.  Crack the egg into the small bowl they give you with the egg, then beat to mix the egg yoke and white together.  When you pull a piece of cooked food out of the hot pot, dip it in the egg then eat.  When I dip a piece of the cooked meat in the egg, then put it in my mouth, it melts...  So good and there's nothing else like it.  I would also recommend that you order a side of mushrooms and udon noodles to add to your hot pot.  \n\nCheck the web site for specials.
