Do you have Reservations? Are you kidding? In a half filled restaurant with no one sitting at the bar!\nThis was like an episode of Bar Rescue... How are you possibly remaining viable?  If this were in the \"Theater District\" maybe I could have understood. But 7:30 in Bloomfield....Are you kidding !!!   \n\nAnyway, five minutes later we're sitting at the The Church Brew Works, a great brew house with baby-back ribs, Chicken Jambalaya, and Shrimp and grits on the menu.  \n\nI'm working off my rejection with a great beer great meal and 'I have \"no reservations\"  in recommending the Church Brew House, right down the block on Liberty Ave.  \n\nI should have reviewed the negative reviews for Sugar and whatever before trying it, but I'm happy and filling sufficiently happy now.  \n\nDon't waste you time.
