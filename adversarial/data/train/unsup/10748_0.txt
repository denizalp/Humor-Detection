I wish I could tell you about my experience here, but I didn't have one.\n\nWhile waiting for a table, I grabbed a drink from the bar.  Unfortunately, this process was cumbersome - at best - since half the yuppies in Uptown were using the bar \/ stools \/ floor as space to lay their jackets \/ bags \/ laptops as they stand in crowds around the now-obsolete bar seating.\n\nOnce seated, I became a ghost.  Like a wind-swept trinket buried in the desert sands, the longer I waited, the more forgotten my existence.  \n\nI attribute this to a complete lack of professionalism on behalf of the server(s) who made little effort to actually work and maximum effort to socialise with friends at the bar.  Secondary to this is a hostess who, against all odds, exerted inhuman levels of apathy in rectifying this issue as it unfolded before her very eyes.\n\nTotal garbage, -10 out of 10, more like \"Shitzgerald's\".
