EPIC VALET went above and beyond with their customer service. I left my keys with them overnight and when I realized I couldn't get my keys till 11:00 am at Scottsdale Fashion Square mall I was devastated. It was Father's Day and I was taking my father out to breakfast at 10:00. I called Epic Valet and they went out of their way to bring me my keys early in the am and delivered them directly to me. I was in SHOCK they did such a kind gesture. I was absolutely amazed with their service. Thank you Quest Wolfe and Conner !!!!!
