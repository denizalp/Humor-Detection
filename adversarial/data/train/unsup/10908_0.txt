3.5\n\nDesi Burrito is my go-to spot when I'm craving Indian and in the UNLV area. Here's the lowdown ~\n\n\nTHE GOOD:\n+ delicious Indian food conveniently wrapped in a burrito\n+ filling portions\n+ awesome vegan and vegetarian options (such as the Paneer Chili burrito and masala French fries)\n\nTHE MEH:\n~ prices ($10 for a combo)\n~ fresher than fast food, but also longer wait time\n~ no indoor reception \/ AC\n~ awkwardly waiting at the walk up menu not knowing if anyone's there\n\nTHE BAD:\n- sometimes the rice is crunchy towards the end of the day\n\n\nOverall, recommend if you're in the area and looking for a filling lunch (and if your stomach can handle spicy food). Also recommend calling in for pick up and using the drive thru to avoid the long wait times.
