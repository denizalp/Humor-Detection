Very happy with my trip to Eureka, drove all the way down from mountains edge to try it out and it was well worth the expedition. \n\nGot there in time for happy hour (awesome little bites for cheap!) so we threw down a couple drinks and some Brussels sprouts. The Brussels had a lemon kinda zest to them as opposed to the obvious idea of drenching it in balsamic so kudos for goin outside the box. I went out on a limb and tried the stone double IPA as well as a different DIPA that I can't remember, both incredulous. Let my hair down real hard. Btw these drafts, as well as the bottled beers and whiskeys rotate so you can always find a fresh lineup?? That's awesome. \n\nThe entrees didn't stand a chance. Me and Mika both had burgers that were perfectly portioned. Personally, I like to be able to breathe and move after my meal so the portions were perfect. Especially with an appetizer. Bison burger w\/ a BACON jalape√±o JAM.. WAT. Fresno FIG burger w\/ a FIG MARMALADE and SPICY PORTER MUSTARD THESE ARE MY FAVORITE WORDS. I even threw a tomato dill soup on the side cause I'm bouji. Will return for the kimchi burger and the buco riblets! \n\nBig shout out to Lauren (I'm almost certain that's her name.. the body builder from Washington) for taking solid, personable care of us and the friendly host. Made it a lil vacation for my one day off. \n\n~My only suggestion\/improvement is to make sure the silverware is polished a little better but otherwise massively impressed!
