Had this buffet for dinner about 3 weeks ago. It was spectacular. I have never seen so much food in my life. And just about everything I added to my plate was good. I think we paid around 30.00 per person and I thought it was worth every penny. Get there early, though (we arrived at 6pm and there was no line; 90 minutes later, it was unbelievable!!) Make sure to try a little of everything. Otherwise you'll feel deprived. Enjoy!
