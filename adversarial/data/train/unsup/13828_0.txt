I called to see if they could work on my bridesmaid dress that was ordered by another bridesmaid in a size smaller... Just my luck.  The guy answered the phone without saying the name of the business. When I asked if this was pro tailors he sounded irritated. I told him my dress situation and he just huffed loudly and said \"bring it in. I must see it.\"\n\nUsually, no problem I would bring my dress in. But this guy sounds rude and unprofessional- making a loud huffing noise on the phone is not okay when a potential customer calls.  I don't need a red carpet pulled out for alterations but I would appreciate some respect and professionalism as a potential customer.
