I'm really surprised there isn't more reviews for this place.  I guess everyone's too busy working out and getting GAINZ!\n\nI've never been to another gym and truthfully it will be hard for me to ever work out somewhere else if I had to.  My friend Tyler finally talked me into breaking away from home routines and park workouts and to start really putting on some mass.  I'm glad I went cause the next day I signed up and now 3-4 months later here I am leaving a review and in arguably the best shape of my life!  24\/7 has a very community feel.  Once you know one person and two and three eventually you start to know a lot of people and to most non gym going people's criticisms of gyms, these are actually cool people!  Everyone respects everyone and even helps them out with a spot or some knowledge about working out and that's just one of the perks in your $29 a month membership.  \n\nIf you have kids they have a daycare and if being tan is your thing they even have that, all included.  They also have an extensive cardio\/biking\/elliptical\/steps area and a room for aerobics and group work outs.  They offer personal training and a few other extras that might cost a hair more, but very worth it.  I've watched people transform in this place before my very eyes, including myself! \n\nAnother plus is this place is clean.  It's well kept but not overly perfect, giving it that charm that makes you wanna come back.  The staff is friendly and helpful as well.\n\nDon't wait till the New Year to join, start now and be ready to show it off in the New Year!\n\nThere's no tomorrow, only today.
