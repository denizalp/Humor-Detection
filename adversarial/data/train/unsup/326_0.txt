The staff at this site has been performing maintenance and\/or repairs on my vehicles for over 5 years. I have had nothing but positive experiences with the work they have done as well as the customer service I have been given, both in person, as well as over the phone when making appointments. I truly appreciate your efficiency and thoroughness. I highly recommend this Brakes Plus for your various automotive needs.
