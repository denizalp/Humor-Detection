Searching for a hotel in Montréal was difficult for me. From most of what I saw, they all looked interesting, but was unsure if I wanted to stay in the back roads or Montréal's metropolis. I analyzed every image, to satisfy my picky ways and Le St Martin, came on the very top for me in terms of their noticeably classy style and reviews. Additionally, their non-typical look, also, sold me. In essence, Le St. Martin has all the elements of a boutique hotel: (at least for me it did) upscale design with a nice contemporary vibe! \n\nIt starts with Le St Martin's high-rise exterior, which is no comparison to the upscale appearance once I went inside. Right off the bat, lobby alone, spoke volumes: it's modest but so plush. My room? Even more so. Not a hair out of place and bathroom was pristine! Le St. Martin offers free wi-fi- only for the first day, Valet service is always up and ready, (if you're going to use your car, call and allow Valet 10-15 minutes prior, leaving to your destination) and gym is opened, around the clock. The combination of pleasant staff on hand with smiles and great hotel stay, made my mini vacation feel luxurious. To add, service was extremely personal and attentive.\n\nI'm extremely delighted with my choice here, as I didn't want to stay in a traditional, branded hotel and Le St Martin went above and beyond, to fit the bill.
