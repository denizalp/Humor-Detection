This Frys and their customer service are a joke. I spent $1000 in parts to find that my motherboard was dead on arrival. When I went to exchange it they refused to do so even though I purchased a warranty claiming that it must have been faulty installation. I was told that they would rather me return the other $800 worth of equipment than exchange the motherboard. Avoid this store. You can get the same items for cheaper on amazon.com
