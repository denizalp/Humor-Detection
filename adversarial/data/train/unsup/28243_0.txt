Been coming here for over 10 years and this is a first.\nOrdered my usual lunch, and the fries came cold over cooked and greasy, ( they were deep fried twice). My sandwich was good though so I let it go. However, my wife ordered fish tacos, and the fish were cold in the centre, and the lettuce was brown and wilting. After one bite she stopped eating I pointed out these issues to our server, she apologized, took our plates, and then charged us full price for our meals that we couldn't eat. We paid our bill and left. We are the worst kind of customer, we just don't go back, and we pass on this experience to others.
