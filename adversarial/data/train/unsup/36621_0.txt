Who doesn't like Oregano's? I mean the food is super tasty but the only thing that sucks is that 90% of the menu takes about an hour, even appetizers. Went in one time for pizza, was told it would take 45 min to an hour and we decided to skip it. Second time we went in, for lunch, all three of us got salads, but were super hungry so we wanted to order the stuffed mushroom app (seemingly the only somewhat healthier choice) and were told it would take 45 min for those since they were baked. Skipped it too then. The food here is good, no complaints, it's just kind of ridiculous to have to place your order over the telephone and wait a bit before you go out to eat. At that rate why not just get it to go?
