Nice place to just drink and be social, until the volume starts to get cranked up so high that conversation becomes impossible.  Drinks were priced well and not weak.  \n\nOnce, when waiting for my turn at the urinal, the guy pissing looked over his shoulder at me and said, \"I've got some good news...I just saved a ton of money on my car insurance.\"\n\nOf COURSE you want to hang out at Champagne's.
