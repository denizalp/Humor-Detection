Reef 'n Beef is located in the Rundlehorn Drive area NE of Calgary.  Its one of those places you would miss if you didn't know exacty where it was. \n\nA colleague told me about this place because she lives close by.  She raved about the $5.95 steak sandwich. I couldn't believe my ears when she said FIVE DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE CENTS steak sandwiches so I had to see for myself.  There are two different areas, the dining area which is more formal and the lounge which is...a lounge. We sat in the lounge.  Our server was pretty nice and the chairs are comfy.  We, of course went for the steak sandwich each.\n\nWhen the steak sandwiches arrived, I was pretty surprised, there was a piece of toast, steak on top and a nice portion of fries.  I got gravy (which I believe is an extra cost). *SEE PICTURE* Of course you can't expect a steak from the keg.  The steak was ok, I mean $5.95 you can't really expect anything spectacular, but it was seasoned nicely and the fries were deeeelicious!  Nice and thick with lots of potatoe and a hint of crunchiness. YUM.  The gravy is nice, it tastes homemade, but who knows!\n\nI've only been to this place for the steak sandwiches, but its definitley a place I would stop by again and try something else.  But!! Its a MUST to try the $5.95 steak sandwich, I mean.......$5.95 need I say more?!   \n\nPs. Happy Hour Daily from 3pm - 8pm.
