Frequent Sam's town as an Emerald player. Walked into The Angry Butcher , the place was more than half empty at  4:30. The hostess was so rude told us we couldn't be seated until 8. I walked by the patio several times , still half empty. At 7 went back to cancel our reservation the place was about 1\/4 full and asked why they couldn't accommodate us and the hostess rolled her eyes and said they had reservations.Where these invisible patrons were is a mystery to me?
