I love The Bus as much as the next Pittsburgher, but I normally stay away from celebrity endorsed restaurants as they strike me as fancy Applebees.\n\nOur group came here due to proximity to our hotel, and to the Grille's credit they had our group of 14 seated before we could finish a beer at the bar.\n\nThe menu was pretty standard, and most of us stuck to burgers. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food, and they dedicated two servers to our table who did a great job.*\n\nWhy only 3 stars? Well the seating area was pretty dirty with crap and food debris all over the floor. I know Bettis' mom personally** and I'm sure she would not have been happy with the cleanliness.\n\nAlso, the 2-way mirror in the mens bathroom allows you creep on the hostess desk\/entire restaurant while you pee. I'm a creep so I liked this, but it just felt so wrong.\n\n__________________\n* They even filled our request of delivering a round of shots we ordered and paid for by announcing they were \"Compliments of The Bus!\"\n** By personally I mean from the Campbells chunky soup commercials.
