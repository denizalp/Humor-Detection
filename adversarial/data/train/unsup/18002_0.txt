The best place to skip work and goofy golf in the spring and summer. Sure, it's a little musty, old, run-down... but it's a slice of my childhood and at least it's still here. \nI can't gather the courage to ride the roller coaster anymore and bumper cars just aren't as appealing as they once were but the two story arcade still makes me squeal a little.\nThe golf is great too! I would suggest playing courses one through three. The last two times I've been we played course four and three and four has the least amount of attractions. Courses one and two are busiest, so it's a choice between being stuck behind a bunch of kids or some really un-fun holes.\n\nOh, and they do have a black and white photo booth.
