I wish 6 stars was an option for places like this. \n\nAwesome decor - gorgeous cherry wood mixed with shiny diamond-plate steel everywhere, comfy and relaxing patio furniture on the patio, comfy bar stools, and even a beautiful bathroom! \n\nFriendly patrons and super friendly staff! Our first visit there on a Tuesday afternoon one of the regulars bought my husband and I both a drink, the bartender chatted us up for awhile and really made us feel welcome, and the owner (Renee) made a point of coming over, shaking our hands, and introducing herself. I have never, ever felt so welcome at a bar before. \n\nRenee let us know that she has open-mic nights, as well as full bands playing regularly. She has been in and around music for many years and we even had an opportunity to hear one of her songs during our short visit! \n\nI'm so sad that I didn't venture into this place long before my departure from Phoenix. Despite this place not being walking or short-bike-riding distance from home, I would have made a point of cabbing it for the pleasure of hanging out here for real.
