OMG - I thought I already wrote a review- but the damn App just holds it for later publication on the computer. Suffice it to say: Excellent - loved the whole experience and inventive dishes.\n\nThere was ad odd smell to the restaurant that really changed the taste of the food - like wet, reused rags to wipe down the tables kind of smell. \n\nWe had a show to get see and they were really helpful in getting some of the more complicated items through the kitchen and onto our table ASAP!!!!\n\nKind of expensive - but hey, Las Vegas has changed a lot in the 30 (or so) years I've been going.\n\nWould I go back? If I had to, otherwise there are so many outstanding options in Vegas. However, if you haven't tried it I'd say DO IT!!!
