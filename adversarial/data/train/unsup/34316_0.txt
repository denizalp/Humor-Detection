Huge portions but tasted sort of bland unfortunately. We split the family dinner A where we chose the beef broccoli, kung pao chicken, chicken in spicy garlic sauce, and shrimp n vegetables. They all kind of tasted the same. The hot n sour soup was the best of the meal. Super nice staff and pretty clean restaurant.
