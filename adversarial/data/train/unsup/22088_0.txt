This place is pretty cool and it's in a very unexpected location.  OFC has an amazing assortment of candy and well, confectionery of all types, including ice cream and froyo. \nThey have a squeaky clean layout, screaming just how seriously they take their craft at every customer who walks through their door. I didn't see a single speck of sugar or topping out misplaced or out of the tray. \n\nTheir fudge is a huge selling point, though I think their strength lies in their cakes\/cupcakes. I've tried the froyo, though it was a little too sweet and it tasted a little more like ice cream than the tart frozen yogurt, I've come to expect from Menchies\/Yogurty's. The fudge on stick options are so delicious, and extremely fresh and worth bringing along as a gift or to a potluck. \n\nThey've got several seats outdoors, like a mini patio without an enclosure. I think this is definitely a place at which to bring friends\/out-of-towners. They'll love you for it.
