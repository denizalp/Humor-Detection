1\/30\/10\n\nCame in for dinner.  My second time at this location (the first was when it was the newly-transferred Digestif during Yelp Eats Week).  What a great transformation from a dark, smoky venue to a warmer, much-more inviting space- thanks to those b\/w and prismatic floor tiles!\n\nMy EXCELLENT meal consisted of table bread and basil olive oil; the marvelous and perfectly cooked flat-iron steak, medium to medium-rare (cauliflower, golden raisin salsa verde); and the stupefyingly-addiciting puff pastry Chef Charleen created that night w\/ AZ pecans, vanilla ice cream, and Wild Turkey caramel sauce (corn-free!!).  I had to muster up all of my willpower to sock-away half of the steak (the raisin salsa verde made this dish a winner!) for my Mom to try at home (she's hard-to-please, but LOVED the leftovers), so that I could demolish the pastry creation :)  [I just recently found out I'm allergic to pecans, but y'know, this dish is so good, I'd definitely keep it in mind on my next visit when considering my dessert options!]\n\nWhile still enjoying in the aftermath of such a wonderful meal, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my table ticket arrived w\/ a small chunk of homemade toffee crunch.  However, this lovely-looking sweet contained an allergen or two, so Charleen switched it w\/ a two-bite chocolate chocolate chip cookie.  What a sweet way to wish me good night!\n\nYelp Eats\/Restaurant Week, where are you??
