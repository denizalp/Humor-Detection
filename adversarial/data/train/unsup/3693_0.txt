I felt like trying a different location today to meet different people. This location is pretty chill. It had one lady working the whole store. Which was fine since it's a pretty laid-back store. I also came here to treat myself. As I was about to take my morning shower, I realized I had no body wash. And I was certainly NOT gunna settle for those little travel size-hotel bottles, that my mom loves to collect either! So, I made a quick run. In any bath & body works it's always to treat yourself first. But the high energy in there just sets you up for the giving mood. I mean on top of that they ALWAYS have sales. Even if it's just a Wednesday in August. So, what I'm basically getting at, if I shall return to my story.. I got carried away and didn't just buy body wash. I got a body cream! And since it was \"buy 2, get 1 free\" I just had to grab my free other body wash.\n\nMy favorite scents stand waiting for me under the Cuddlers collections. They're called Moonlight Path & my classic, all-time favorite; Black Raspberry Vanilla. And I don't get lotion, I get the body cream. It's more rich and thick. Which means using less and saving more! Plus the quality is much more luxurious (got that word from reading the back of the bottle in the shower). So, I'll be definitely coming back to this location more often.
