My last visit I decided to stay in and eat. While I was eating my nachos, the girl starts sweeping the floors, started in the bathroom and is headed towards me. I see stuff start flying in the air, I'm thinking \"she's not gonna come sweep that towards me\" well she did. I see fuzz, dirt and whatever else fly in the air around my food. I glared at her, got up and threw my nachos in the trash. Thanks for crop dusting my nachos with dirt you idiot.
