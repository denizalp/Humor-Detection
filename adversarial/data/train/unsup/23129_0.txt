If I lived on the west side, I'd probably frequent this Chinese\/Taiwanese joint more often. This place has a winning combination of good food, service, pricing and ambience. \n\nItems tried:\nSpicy pork wontons\nBraised pork noodle soup\nChicken and eggplant\n\nMr. Chopstix makes a good version of spicy pork wontons. There's a lot of flavor going on and enough heat to tingle your tongue. I have not been to one of the newer places in town to offer this dish (Shang), but my husband has. He prefers the way Mr. Chopstix makes theirs compared to Shang, Noodle Pot II, and Noodle man. \n\nThe soup was really good and of course the tender and tasty pork was the star of the dish. \n\nThe chicken and eggplant was our favorite dish here. Adding tofu is optional. The flavor was great and much more refined than a typical eggplant\/tofu dish at a Chinese take out place. I like the way they cut the eggplant into thin strips to get some crunch and texture on the outside, rather than large, soggy eggplant pieces that other places serve. \n\nI think for Asian places that serve entrees like the chicken and eggplant, white rice should be included. When our dishes were served to us there was no rice. We assumed it was automatically part of the meal. Apparently, white rice is an extra charge. A slight annoyance, since we couldn't eat right away and had to pay extra.\n\nThey offer boba drinks here. I tried to order a green milk tea, but for some reason they couldn't make it. Our server said they could only do the flavored iced teas. Not sure if it was an ingredient issue or lack of trained staff to make the drink. \n\nThe interior was done nicely and I like the open kitchen concept. Service was very polite and attentive. Usually, unheard of in Chinese restaurants. \n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge*****\n56\/100
