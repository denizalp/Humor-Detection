A cute store with a huge selection of jerky flavors & a nice assortment of a few novelty fruit items, sauces, nuts, etc. Super friendly assistance is offered & they're generous with giving samples-which rates high on my ratings scale, lol.\n\nEvery couple years I get a craving for some good beef jerky & after reading reviews of this place I couldn't wait any longer to visit. After sampling a few flavors of jerky I can see why \"Candy\" is in their store name: every flavor is very bold. The sweet flavors were sweeter than any jerky I've ever had & the \"hot\" flavors were way too hot for me. The sweet options were extremely syrupy & sticky-they should probably add wetnaps to the bag. (BTW, every bag does include a tooth flosser. Thank you.)\n\nI don't drink so I don't hang out in bars. Maybe I should start visiting this place & hang out on the barstools & eat jerky!
