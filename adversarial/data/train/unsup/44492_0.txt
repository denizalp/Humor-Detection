Sunday happy hour all day!!! This place is great, loved every bit of it. We had the coronitas for our beverages, delish! The blue point oysters were on point! The shrimp app was so good. We loved the sushi rolls as well. The tacos(shrimp and Kobe beef) were just as good as everything else and finished it off with the mango cake. What a great cake. We will be back for some entrees next time!!!
