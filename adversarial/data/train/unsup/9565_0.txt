The office initially prescribed me a drug that was extremely out of my price range. When I called back for an alternate prescription, the office never returned my call, despite verbally promising to do so with an update on my prescription. A week later, I called back to check in to see if there was something wrong with said medication. Only then did they inform me that they had prescribed an alternative and discuss treatment with me. When I went to pick up the new prescription, I found they had yet again outlandishly prescribed me something without my knowledge, in addition to the medication they had discussed on the phone with me. \n\nBy this point, I was extremely frustrated with the office. I immediately called back to inquire my medication situation, only to receive minimal explanations and platitudes. I asked to remove myself from their care, and was hung up on. Though in the office I was treated professionally, by Dr. Nyugen, I have received nothing but rudeness and ineptitude by reception and staff over the phone.\n\nIn short, great doctor, but awful staff that turned a satisfactory experience very sour.
