The air in my vents were not flowing so the first company I called was Silver State Refrigeration & Hvac they sent out a technician that spent a total of 15 minutes and told me I need a new motor ($580) and a new thermostat ($180 - $280) plus the service call fee. I did not have a good feeling about the diagnosis because of the time spent (even though he was the \"repair manager\") so I told him I would think about it which I could tell did not make him very happy at all judging from his sour expression. I eventually called another company for a second opinion. The new technician diagnosed that the problem was a emergency power switch that was turned off. He had surmised the problem withing 2 minutes but he went ahead and spent around 35 minutes diagnosing every other possibility just to make sure. This included testing the thermostat which was functioning just fine and did not need to be replaced just like the motor which was also operating correctly. I was so impressed with his honesty and work ethic that I have already recommended them to 2 of my neighbors. To top it off the second company does not charge for a first service call or a second opinion even if they do not do any work. I am so glad that I received a second opinion which saved me the cost of a new motor and a new thermostat. I would not recommend Silver State Refrigeration & Hvac to anyone!!
