Beware Of This Shop!! \n\nMy 18 year old daughter and I decided get our first tattoos together. Our artist was Scott who was supposed to be great at watercolor tattoos. \nThis review is just for my tattoo, although my daughter's result was at least as bad as mine if not worse. \nAnd since a pic is worth 1,000 words I am attaching two. Can you guess what the tattoo was supposed to be??......Not a Demented Clown :\/\n\nNot only did Scott do a terrible job he caused severe damage to my skin and the end result was a HORRIBLE tattoo! My skin was so severely damaged by being overworked it caused major deep scabbing. This happened in several places. The tattoo is on the outside of my ankle just above the ankle bone. It was red and so swollen all the way down to my foot you could no longer see my ankle bone at all.\n\nI tried calling the shop but my messages were never returned. So after a month of getting the run around I finally tracked down the owner Matt on Facebook. \nI sent him a message, his response was that Scott either had his machine turned up to high or over blended trying to achieve the desired effect. He also said that overworking a tattoo makes it more susceptible to infection. Although he admitted all this he said he trusted Scott so much that he let Scott do a watercolor tattoo on his wife. \nWell good for the owners wife! To bad they dont treat the customers the same way. \nWere now left with terribly ugly tattoos, that caused a lot of pain and scarring. \nThe only thing that was offered was Matt saying he was \"sorry for my plight.\"\n\n**UPDATE: He never offered to touch up or cover it for free, until this review that is. I had the tattoo done in Feb 2014 and never heard from him further than his FB reply to me as I stated above.
