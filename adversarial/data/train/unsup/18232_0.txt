I'm still wondering why the bartender Amy is still there. I have never been treated so disrespectfully in my life and all I did was walk up to the bar in a cute Santa outfit for a drink and she wouldn't acknowledge my presence from Timbuktu. I finally had the guy next to me order my drink after she disregarded my drink order and helped all the men at the bar first. The sad thing is, every woman in our group had the same problem. She's a woman hater and really bad for business. We were all there to have a good time and she's a total grinch. Oh... And she charged me an extra $2 for my drink. \n\nI will walk out the door and take my business elsewhere if that tall woman with long mousey brownish-blonde hair is still serving there when I return. As a local that contributes A LOT of money to this business, I expect to be treated with at least a little respect.\n\nI'm truly disgusted by her bad attitude.
