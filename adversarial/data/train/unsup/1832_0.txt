If you're an Indian food newbie, the best time to go is during lunch time from 11am-3pm . They have buffet style set up and you get to try a little bit of everything. It might seem awkward if this is your first time going there as the place is huge and sometimes you don't know if you should start serving yourself, but the plates and everything are at the back left. Just start as soon as the waiter gets your drink order. \n\nMy personal favorites is the chicken tikka masala and chicken makhani. The veggie tikka masala is great too! The cheese pieces are always delightful. I suggest just loading your plate up with some rice and try a little bit of everything like me! The garlic naan is yummy! Warm and fresh! I always ask for seconds. The rice pudding is my favorite dessert! I had to get some to-go because it was so yummy! Service was great! Kept the naan and the water refilled before they ran out.\n\nI will definitely come again!
