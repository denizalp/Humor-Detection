I grew up shopping at NoFrills and then FreshCo, I know what to expect. This place does not deliver. \n\nMost produce is BAD. I'm taking limp green onions, broccoli with a lot of black spots, avocados that either ripen too fast or fail to ripen at all (apparently same case with their bananas). They seem to be out of stock of at least one thing in each section, but it's worse with the produce.\n\nOrganization is HORRID. Employees were deshelving items while the store was still open to rearrange it. There were bare shelves in a grocery store during peak hours (after work). I wanted to laugh. As it is, their arrangement makes no sense. You can find frozen fish products in two different parts of the store. We spent awhile searching for quinoa, only to realise there was none. Next week? Three bins FULL of quinoa. What the heck?\n\nThe sandwich bread at this store goes moldy in a week, no matter the expiry date!\n\nSurprisingly we got a better deal on packaged dried apricots at METRO of all places. The bulk dried apricots are now missing but also way more costly.\n\nFor all my complaining, we still come here because it's close and cheap. We find what we can't get at FreshCo at Metro (wild rice, yellow zuchinni, non moldy buns). Can't wait until better options open up around the Fort York area.\n\nForgot to mention that the cashiers are courteous and speedy. If you see a new cashier that is slow and they're still slow the next week...you don't see them again after that.
