Very impressed by the amount of work and attention to detail that has gone into zak bagan museum. over 30 rooms filled with items such as serial killer memorabilia, haunted dolls, most haunted item in the world...the list goes on. It doesn't hurt zak bagan was there to make an appearance. You will sign a waiver releasing them from any responsibility being exposed to their haunted collection. \nBe prepared to wait in a long line, that was the only downside to the experience. However the wait is worth it to see the extensive collection inside.
