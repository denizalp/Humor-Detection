I absolutely love going to this place! As soon as I walked in the door, I was greeted. All the employees were super nice and helpful. The person that did my nails was fantastic, she didn't rush and she was very helpful on what was better for my nails. I got an overlay ($23) and they look very natural and I love that! I also got my eyebrows ($7) done and I got to say, perfection! They were cleaned and arched the way I wanted! I paid a total of $30, which is a reasonable amount. I recommend coming on a weekday because they are busy on weekends, which is a good sign of good business, but if you cannot make it, the wait is not that long! I will return! Thank you!
