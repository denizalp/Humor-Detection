We found this little gem after an early morning Sunday Peak hike. It's a small little place with a dog friendly nice size patio. It looks and feels like it came straight from Venice beach. The burrito was very yummy . . . Special ordered with no cheese and crispy bacon.  The rosemary mixology was yummy and I'm now an official Chai coffee fan. Seriously the best chai I've ever had the pleasure of sipping.  The service is top notch and I don't say that lightly. . . Attentive, up beat, and they are moving with urgency yet creating a calm vibe.  And if that wasn't enough . . . The prices are really good.  Cocktail, Chai coffee, and breakfast burrito for under $24 with tip. The cocktail was the most expensive thing on the menu. I will be a regular here.  \n\nP..S. Rocking Drive threw that is packed yet moves professionally. There is a reason this place is thriving!
