I really don't understand why there are so many good reviews for this place. I ordered red jade chicken bowl and my husband the jerk chicken. The fried rice was the only good thing that I actually liked. I would compare this to a Panda Express. Nothing special about their food. It wasn't horrible food but it absolutely wasn't that good at all. If you live close to here the. I guess it makes sense why you would come here versus some other fast food Chinese. \n\nThe tables were so disgusting dirty.  The floors were gross. I wonder what the kitchen looked like. Will never come back again.
