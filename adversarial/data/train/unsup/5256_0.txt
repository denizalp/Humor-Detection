Postino is my go-to girl talk, wine & munchie hangout! Their bruschetta board is off the charts ~you pick 4 options off of their delicious list~ {Warning: It's so hard to choose!! They're all amazing.} I've been known to get an entire board to myself for dinner! Whoops, carb overload but worth every calorie!! A few of my favorite classics are: Warm Artichoke, Red Pepper + Goat Cheese & Brie w\/Green Apple +Fig Jam. Monday & Tuesday evenings after 8PM you can enjoy a bottle of house wine + a bruschetta board for $20!!!! Having a case of the Mondays? This is your spot!!!
