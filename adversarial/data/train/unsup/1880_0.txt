Over priced...Not authentic Mexican!  Tamales are small and too expensive! the Chef and Owner need to re-think their whole menu and price. Not worth the money whatsoever!  The Tamales are about 1\/3 of how big they should be! \nDon't bother there are better hole in the wall places worth your time, taste and money...Sorry Espee but your over priced, your tamales are too small and it's not authentic Mexican what you sell just a knock off of Chipotle!\n\nHAHAHA THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS!
