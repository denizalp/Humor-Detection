Some Swiss Chalet's are good, some are poor and some keep you coming back with good food and service. This location is the third type and keeps my fiance and I coming back over and over when the two can dine specials come on.\n\nThe staff is solid and has never let us down in making us happy. The food is usually pretty quick (obviously depending on how busy it is at the time) and more often than not the fries are fresh and crispy which can be tough to come by in other locations.\n\nFavorites on the menu include of course the two can dine specials when they come on, (fiance prefers white meat, I like dark) with fries and the delicious chalet sauce. We almost always get the garlic cheese loaf as an appetizer which is great for sharing, but if I had the option to make this a 4.5 star rating, the reason is its the 1 food item that is super fantastico when its done right, but can be underwhelming with lack of cheese and flavor and freshness if they aren't on their best game (just like fries). Thank goodness 9\/10 times the fries and cheese loaf are great.\n\nOverall, it may be a chain restaurant, but its our favorite swiss chalet location and has won us over others so much that we probably get it every 2 weeks. I think other people are reviewing it low because in signal hill people tend to think their money is worth more or something and love to expect a $100 meal for $40
