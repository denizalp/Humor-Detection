I would put zero if possible. \nTried to get one of what was going to be many suits altered because I lost some weight. \nWent in at 515 pm. Habib comes out and says he does not measure after five. \nI went out of my way because of the reviews on yelp. \nWell so much for that. \nDo not go here. \nRude. Bad service.
