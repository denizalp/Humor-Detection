Cheeee hoooooo!  5 star service, baby!\n\nHonest!  Priced right!  Great work!  No pressure!  Local boy!  From now on this is where I will take my lil' 86 Honda Prelude Si for service!\n\nKawika is one heckuva guy!  Was hesitant at first to take my car there but he proved me wrong!  Treated my classic ride like one of his own kids!  With care!  He did a full check of my car, top to bottom, and right away knew what needed to be done NOW and what can be held off for a little LATER.  Luckily, all I needed was an oil change and a tire pressure check this time.  Island Auto's price rates are excellent!  The shop is not fancy like a dealership, but their quality is job #1!  Under $30 for an oil change, very comparable to other shops.  Good service comes free!\n\nHe did mention my car would need a few things down the road, and that he would call me back in a few days to get some pricing for parts.  Guess what, a few days later I get a text and his price with labor for getting the work done was more than reasonable.  Work guaranteed!  I will be taking my classic baby down to Kawika and staff at Island Auto from now on.  He will get the job done right.\n\nHawaiian!
