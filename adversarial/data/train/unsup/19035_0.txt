Once you've experienced the Benihana chain, it's hard to make comparisons. Nakato is another Benihana replica where the chef slices and dices and sets onions ablaze in front of your onlooking eyes. Nakato probably has the worst imitation I've seen though. \n\nIf it's your first time, you just might be in for a treat. If you get a bad chef though, the overall experience will leave you less than satisfied. And once you've been to one restaurant, you've pretty much done them all. \n\nAbout two weeks ago, we ate here for a birthday party and we had enough people to fill a table. Typical with this style restaurant, you will be seated with strangers if the party isn't large enough. This could be a bad thing if you're socially awkward, but most people enjoy this part of the meal. \n\nService here is horrible. Our entire party wasn't on time. We were missing two people and they refused to seat us. We had to wait an additional hour (No fault of theirs - Due to the nature of the meal, scheduling is to the T), but they rarely even gave us updates as to when would be seated and what was going on. \n\nBy the time we were seated, it took 30 minutes before we were even asked for our drinks. On top of that, once orders were taken, meal preparations must be proportioned and met. That took an additional 20 minutes so it was very frustrating having to wait. Granted, our entire party wasn't on time, but If they would have just sat us initially they would have made it with plenty of time to spare. \n\nOnce the chef made it out and our dinner experience had set sail, you can imagine the suspense that had already built up. We were all expecting a grand display of ninja knife wielding, shrimp tail dicing, veggie flipping, but in comparison it was more like butter knifing a bread roll and veggie flops. \n\nAs the chef started dishing out portions (which someone didn't proportion correctly), I noticed the seasonings and spices. It was all very basic; soy sauces, some teriyaki sauce variation, salt and pepper and their signature \"shrimp sauce\" which tasted horrid. I guess the sauces was a direct explanation as to why the final products also tasted so vile. \n\nEverything was under seasoned. Fried rice teased like, plain rice. Their sauce that goes on everything had a strange odor and the steak I had was even contaminated by that odor\/taste. I hardly even touched my meal and about the only thing I ate was the shrimp and veggies. \n\nA friend had forewarned me about Nakato not being good, but I thought to myself, \"No way they can mess up a steak!\" Oh little did I know.
