****specifically a review for cat boarding****\nAs a cat mom, I would not bring my cat back here. I was told specifically before booking the sound from the dogs barking downstairs doesn't carry to the cat space up stairs... very very false. My cat doesn't live with or around dogs so the barking had her in edge as soon as we walked in. It appeared to be very safe, clean and well kept, kitty litter and cat tree provided. But noise factor prevents me from returning.
