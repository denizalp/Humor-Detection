The treads on my tires were getting low and with a winter road trip coming up, I decided to get new tires from tire rack. I picked this shop because I wanted road force balancing done on the tires and they are one of the few that offer the service. I had tires shipped directly to the shop and set up a time to drop off the car in the morning to have them put on. I expected a phone call from them when the car was done but that didn't happen. Before closing, I went ahead and called them and was told that one of the tires did not road force balance and would need to be replaced by tire rack. I ended up picking up the car and paying for the service anyway that day. Ryan at the desk explained to me how the replacement process with tire rack was going to work and promised to take care of it the next day and let me know through a phone call, which was exactly what he did. I went back a few days later to have the defective tire swapped out. I was notified via text this time upon completion of the work.\n\nWith the exception of the missed phone call the first time, they were professional and Ryan was very helpful. I can't speak to other services that they offer but I do recommend going there for tires if you need that done.
