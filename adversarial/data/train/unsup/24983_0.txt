What a great spot!\n\nWe made 9 PM reservations for dinner after the Zarkana Cirque du Soleil show at the neighboring Aria.  No Vegas trip is complete without a nice dinner, and we couldn't have picked a better spot for what we were looking for that night: delicious food and wine in a classy, yet relaxed atmosphere.   Located within the Crystals shopping complex, you don't get amazing views of Strip, but the environment still exudes class and modern decor.\n\nWe had the works.  A bottle of Pinot shared among the three of us while we nibbled on the best damn bread assortment I've seen.  Two salads: Caesar and a Wedge, standard fare and did not disappoint.  And then....drumroll....the entrees!  Juicy, thick bone-in ribeyes for my two burly man-pals, who both only ate about half before conceding to the dish's fate as leftovers.  And for myself: perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, jumbo sea scallops sauteed in a rich butter sauce and served with a few Parmesan-crusted crostinis.  Crisp golden brown on the surface while tender and delicate within, the plate came with about 6 jumbo scallops, but try as I might, I couldn't finish the dish for lack of stomach space!  Wonderful side pairings of garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms to share.\n\nAbsolutely no room for dessert.  It was a fantastic meal.
