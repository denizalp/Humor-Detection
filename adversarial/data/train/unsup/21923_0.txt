I was totally underwhelmed - and totally shocked given all the exceptional reviews from other trusted Yelp Elites.\n\nThe rice was WEIRD. There were frozen peas, carrots, and green beans in it, and I swear the rice was Uncle Ben's. \n\nThey don't really have chips. They broke up some tostadas and put them on a plate. How weird. \n\n2 stars for the authenticity and quality of the food, lack of chips, prices not in line with the level of quality of the food, and totally overdone vibe.\n\nOverall: Not great, over priced, overdone, and... weird.
