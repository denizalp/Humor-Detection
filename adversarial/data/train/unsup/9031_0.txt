As soon as you walk into this place, it feels like you're in a pizza joint in NY. There's tons of pictures of NYC which gives it that authentic feel. The lights that they use are wine bottles handing from the ceiling and they look mighty nice. Now, lets get to the good stuff-the food. Their pizza is really good. The crust is amazing! We got a large pepperoni and mushroom pie. My kids really enjoyed the food and they're pretty picky eaters. Service was really good, I'm not sure what everyone else is talking about, but our waitress was very friendly and fast. I highly recommend this place!
