If I could give Goldwater 10 stars I totally would. LOVE the Desert Rose and the Blood Orange Pale!!! My goodness the beers here are AWESOME. It is within walking distance from a lot of hotels - really like the tasting room and the popcorn machine. Been here a few times and can't wait to go back the next time we are in town.
