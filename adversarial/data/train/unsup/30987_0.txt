Went to see mission impossible at 10:15 in the morning. The movie was supposed to start at 10:45am. We spent over forty dollars on drinks etc. sat in the movie theatre till 1120am with no movie. Absolutely no one came in to explain why the delay. We finally got up and went out to request a refund. The guy said no refunds after the start of the movie... What an idiot, the movie never started... Also no refund for refreshments. I complained to corporate and got an email from manager wanting me to come in to talk about it. I will NEVER step foot there again. Extremely poor customer service. Will stick with harkins forever.....
