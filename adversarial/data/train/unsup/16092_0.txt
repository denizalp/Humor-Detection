I almost don't want to write this review as I don't want all of your cramming up my place, but here goes: So head on down the alley on de la Montagne street, between St Catherine and Rene Levesque, and behold what are some of the best burgers I have ever had! Great music is always playing, there are benches to sit on and the guys making up your food are so much fun and super helpful as the choices can be a tad overwhelming.\n\nThis hole in the wall is run by the guys behind the restaurant Queue de Cheval, so you know that the meat is gonna be good; I however, had the salmon burger here, and it is TO DIE FOR and the fries are cooked to perfection and the milkshakes are super yummy as well with rotating specials.\n\nThe burgers are huge, messy, and come with all sorts of toppings (hello, sunny side up egg!)...they even provide hand sanitizer as they know that you're paws are gonna be a mess. Your mama may have told you that alleys are dangerous, but this one is well worth taking a stroll down.
