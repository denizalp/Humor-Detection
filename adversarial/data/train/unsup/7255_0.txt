This place is a joke. Hallmark is a lack of service and organization. Were about #5 in line when they opened at noon. 20 minutes later before we were seen.\n\nStep daughters phone froze last night and the verdict is that it is D.O.A. even though it's only a couple of months old. She and the rest of her family are in route from PA to Myrtle Beach on vacation.\n\nVerizon Rep said they could send the replacement to their hotel in Myrtle so sounded good. Did not have the address on us and no one answered at home.\n\n\nWent home, got the address and we have been waiting 30 minutes to just drop off the  address.\n\nWaste of time and my family has been customers when the we're SW PA Bell which was before they merged with NY Bell and became Verizon.
