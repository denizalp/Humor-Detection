Ah ! That granola place ! I used to call it that because I had no idea the name of the place was and I avoided it calling it that hippie place. \n\nI know people talk about prices but I dont honestly know much about them so that was never an issue for me. \n\nThe place is always clean, well stocked and have everything I need and then some.I rarely eat meat, but I think they have a Boar's Head Deli section so going by my carnivorous friends I think thats all you ever need. \n\nThey even had mangoes at one point. Mangoes ! I'm of Indian origin so if you know a thing or two about us, we love our mangoes, that alone sold the place  to me ! \n\nThey are open late, I believe they close at 11 and thats always a plus. The check out lanes are quick and efficient - Dont you just hate getting in line at walmart. Ugh. This is so much better.\n\nSpeaking of service, the staff is very helpful. When I say helpful, I mean helpful. Im the kind of guy thats never cooked in his life.. ok maybe a few times, but when you are standing in front of exactly what your wife gave you and you ask for help, they dont have that - are you kidding me kinda look but are just genuinely helpful. The last time I screwed up they helped me find everything on my list ! Now thats nice. \n\nGood beer and wine section. quiet a big assortment, not AJ's big but big enough. I could see why you would want to give it 4 stars but I've only had good experiences here so 5 it is !
