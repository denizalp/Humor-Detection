Jason's Deli ... Good place for a salad and sandwich\n\n\nI have visited a few of the  Jason's Deli's around town, and have eaten at the Jason's  Deli, Chamdler location  several times. Every visit to any of Jason's Deli restaurants has always been a great experience.\n\n\nI cannot seem to stop myself from ordering the fruit platter every time I visit Jason's. The fruit is always fresh and the fruit dip is delicious.   I always want to try something new but always  get caught up ordering the fruit platter. My lunch companions  ordered several different items off the menu, and there were  no complaints.\n\nThe staff at Jason's Deli is friendly, accommodating,  and the service is always quick.  Jason's Deli has a large drink selection, and you get a complimentary soft-serve ice cream cone with your meal.  Can you think of a better way to finish a meal?
