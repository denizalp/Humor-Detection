Came here with high hopes but was a little disappointed. I didn't enjoy my food as much as I thought I would. The mac n' cheese side was very good, but my brisket sandwich was lacking on the flavor end. The brisket itself was moist and good, but the sandwich itself had too many flavors going on. With the jam, mayo, and cheese, I couldn't really enjoy the meat itself. Service was good. I might give it another try next time I am in town.
