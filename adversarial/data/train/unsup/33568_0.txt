Went to Drais three times. \n\nUsed Uber or Lyft to get there every time. \n\nApproximately $60 for women. I've used my card at the door, as well as paid online before arriving. \n\nVery tight security here. Walk in through the Cromwell casino. Get in line. Go up the elevators. Stop and take pics. Then proceed to the entrance. The bathrooms have a decent amount of stalls. There are people there with mints, jolly ranchers, and other necessities. Just give them a tip. They don't really go crazy about how the women dress because we are usually in a dress and heels. (Ladies, be cognizant of the heels you wear; make sure they'll be a little comfortable). But I've witness them take baseball caps from men and throw them away. So to be safe, don't try it! \n\nThe first time was during a Migos appearance. Went with my girls who I grew up with. Very cool experience. We were literally next to the stage and had a very good position in the club. We stood in the same area the entire night. (It gets old very fast that way). Overall a good experience. It was summer time so the outdoor area was open too. \n\nThe second time I went was a regular night. Fun music. Great drinks, but not cheap haha! I knew I didn't want to come back after this night because it was just overly packed and everyone was bumping into each other. \n\nThe third time I went was during a party bus. It ended at Drais so we stayed at Drais. Fabulous was there. It was a Sunday night. Not too crowded. We ALMOST bought a section with another couple but we ended up leaving because we were just worn out honestly. \n\nI recommend getting a section. No matter where the section is, it's nothing like being able to rest your feet and really enjoy the club. Majority of the time when I was ready to go, it was because my feet hurt haha! The sections are expensive but you're not in Vegas to budget haha! \n\nGo get the Drais experience at least ONCE! The DJ\/music is ALWAYS popping!!!!
