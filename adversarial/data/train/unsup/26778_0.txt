My take: Taj Mahal's flavors followed by a cold IPA is a little taste of heaven on earth. Best Indian food in the Valley, in my opinion.\n\nTaj Mahal is the Indian restaurant we'd been looking for. Others have either lacked the rich flavors or have weird quirks about them -- such as refusing to alter any items on the menu. Taj Mahal is the exact opposite -- delicious and accommodating!\n\nIf you want the best experience, leave the menus on the table and ask the owner what he recommends based on your preferences and tastes.  You like chicken? Spicy? He has the dish for you. You like lamb? A little more on the mild side? He has you covered. He has never steered us wrong.\n\nThe owner is not only knowledgeable, but also extremely friendly.  If things are slow, he may even pull up a chair and chat you up for a bit.  For us, that's part of the experience at Taj Mahal.\n\nThe food is the number one reason for my 5-star rating, but Taj is also at the top of my list due to their beer selections. While I don't drink much, Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA is a definite favorite and it goes GREAT with Indian food.
