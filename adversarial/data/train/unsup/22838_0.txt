I'd take a real taco truck or robertos over this place. The service was schizophrenic and the food was basic. The cost high.\n\nThe staff is confused. Everything was in the form of a question \"Did you order this or that?\" \"What did you order again?\" \"Whats your name?\" ( why does it matter)Despite these questions the orders came out late and  incorrect. \n\nIt took too long for follow up. Waitress didn't even know the tequila menu. Asked what my price range was (tasteless)\n\nThe waitress screwed up our bill 4 times.  Mixing other tables with ours.  Also put generic items on the bill (seems deceptive and even fraudulent)\n\nDon't buy into the hype. There are far better places in terms of service, quality and atmosphere
