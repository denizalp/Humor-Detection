We went there being tricked by awesome photos at MTL Blog. Place itself small and was crowded when we came showing a hype. Ice cream itself tastes like cheapest one from generic selections available at any grocery store. The only tasty part was cone itself and that's it. Definitely not worth 7-8 dollars.
