Good ol Mike. Saw his show again for like the 8th time. I usually take friends and family to this show if they have never seen him. Even though I have seen it many times before, he is still funny and each show is different for you will have different kinds reactions from various audience members.\n\nLocated at the Canyon Club inside the Four Queens Casino on the Fremont Street Experience, the place can seat about 60 people and there is bar for all you alcoholics.\n\nI dont recommend bringing kids under 13 to this show because of adult oriented inuendos. I think that by the time kids are 13, they are pretty smart to know whats going on. If you are also easily offended, you shouldnt be going to this either. If you do go for any reason, I say get some drinks in you before the show starts so that you are much more loose. \n\nMike has quick wits about him when it comes to some of his story telling and jokes. He does a great job of interacting with everybody in the audience. Doesnt matter if you are sitting in the back, the side, the front, in the bathroom, or standing at the bar, nobody is safe from getting picked to participate. His jokes can be offensive if you are anal and are not open minded. He definitely doesnt pull any punches and he covers all bases whether you are black, white, short, tall, fat, thin, snobby, quiet, shy, male, female, bi, gay, or just downright a normal person. \n\nAs for the magic, he doesnt use huge props, animals, or special effects. He doesnt even have a lovely, sexy, scantily clad assistant. He has all sleight of hand tricks which in my opinion is only secondary for he uses that as his platform for his comedy. \n\nIn closing, I dont mind seeing this show every so often especially if you are out on Fremont just hanging out. Its not a mind blowing show but definitely way more bang for your buck than Criss Angel. \n\n2017 Yelp Review #10 \"Get Hammered with Mike Hammer\"\n643 overall
