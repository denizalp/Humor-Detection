My hubby and I ate here last night for my birthday dinner.  I wanted to go somewhere close to our house but didn't feel like steak.  A lot of independent restaurants are closed on Mondays so that is why we had to do a chain. I am not sure if that also explains why this place was so packed.  It may also be due to the fact that they have a great prix-fix deal on Mondays where you can get almost any appetizer, entree, and dessert combination for just $37.  Not a bad deal since we both left the place absolutely stuffed to the brim and we are both big eaters.\n\nOverall, the service at this place is really great and the food is prepared well.  I really enjoyed our visit there but I would never really become a regular since for some reason I am just not a fan of their menu.  I love seafood, but most of their dishes come with a ton of sauce or crusted or wrapped in something.  I think if you have fresh, high quality seafood then you should just let the flavor of the food shine through.  That's just me.  I did really like the taste of the wasabi sauce on my butter fish entree. I highly recommend ordering that dish. And also, their cocktails. I have sampled a few of their specialties on the drink menu and they are all quite good even if they are way overpriced.\n\nI think Roy's is a great option for happy hour when you are looking for something a little higher class than your basic patio bar or for dinner when you feel like a taste of the islands. But I can't honestly say I'm a fan, hence the three stars.
