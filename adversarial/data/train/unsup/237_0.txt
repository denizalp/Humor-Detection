Always wonder why this chain calls themselves Terrible Herbst.  Are they really so terrible?  Well, I've been to several of their locations in Vegas.  Some have been nice.\n\nThis branch which is next to Silverton Casino lived up to their name.  They weren't very clean inside their store, and service was not so good.  At least they had Chevron gasoline.  Yeah its more expensive, but considered higher quality cause of their techron.
