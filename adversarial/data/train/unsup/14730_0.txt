What do you do with a former K-Mart building that has been closed and vacant for several years? Apparently you put in an indoor go-cart racing track, RC car racing, and a complete hobby shop catering to RC car enthusiasts.\n\nI was pleased to see that this is here now and I will probably be taking my kids back at some point. Now you'll want to save up some money because it's initial layout of $25 per kid for safety training and the first race, but who goes to only race one time? Additional races are anywhere from $10-12 for kids and adults but its a fun experience and definitely would be a great place to visit when summer temperatures are hot!\n\nOh, and I'm not going to get into RC car racing, but watching it is fun. There are at least three tracks, including a big dirt track inside, and you can watch from above so you get a complete overview.\nI'm not sure how much the birthday party packages are, but its probably worth checking out if you have kids.
