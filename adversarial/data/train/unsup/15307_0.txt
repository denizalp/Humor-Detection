This is a solid place to for pizza. I had the Pastrami Sandwich which was generous with meat for the price but it didn't live up to other pastrami sandwiches i have had around town taste wise. My wife ordered a large pizza and I ended up eating a couple slices and damn it was good. I am picky about pizza and will admit the \"thin NY\" type isn't usually my cup of tea but this one actually had flavor and hardly any grease. My wife ended up coming back for lunch a couple days later and had one of their White Pizzas. She could only eat half so I ended up eating the rest for dinner later and it was pretty good. They have a check in offer on yelp for a free mini cannoli but I'm not so much a fan of those like my wife is so I just shared hers instead of redeeming mine. \n\nThey make bread fresh on site and sell it along with meats, cheeses, desserts, etc. The glass cases are clean but not too much pricing was posted for what was in them. Staff here is friendly and when you see them sitting down eating the food it is usually a good sign. Check out their lunch specials and they also deliver.
