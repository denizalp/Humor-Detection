What a terrible dump! And why haven't I been here before???\n\nI skipped out on the mardi gras beads on my way in - have more than enough at home. I did, however, accept the coupon for the buck off the BIG daiquiri. BIG. As in 48 ounces!\n\nI wasn't driving, was with a group of people I have no qualms trusting my life with and face it - sometimes 48 ounces of liquid \"I don't give a shit\" are just what ya need! And when I decided to pay homage to the \"I don't give a shit\" days of NOLA is when I started having a blast.\n\nThat - and the look on a friend's face when he cashed about $300 from the slot he was playing and it paid in nickels! Got used used to the paper ticket - having any coin drop is a throwback...but NICKELS? Wasn't even a nickel slot...so the look on his face was classic.\n\nYay - I will totally be back!
