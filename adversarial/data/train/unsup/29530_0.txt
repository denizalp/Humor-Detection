The service here was deplorable. I heard several complaints of the lack of service, and I experienced it firsthand. It took 10 minutes to get a menu, and another 20 to get the coke I ordered. How do you forget rice with an entree at an Indian restaurant. I hope the food is excellent, but I doubt it.
