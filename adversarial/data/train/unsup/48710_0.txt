Totally not worth the wait! Took my family here last night for dinner and we all very disappointed. After 1h wait in line, we are all starving so our satisfaction expectation are very low already. However, everything is wrong from Kobe beef to King crab legs. The crab legs are all frozen and tasteless even after boiled up upon oir request. The Kobe beef tastes mediocre just like any kind of beef u can get at Vons. Even the sitting area is just plain and boring looking like other 3 star buffet such as ones at Paris or Ceasar Palace. Save your money and Time guys, check out Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo. 10x time better!
