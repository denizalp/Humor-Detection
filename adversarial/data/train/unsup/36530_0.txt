This place is a great adult playground I would suggest going a little early so you have a chance to play all of the games without it being too crowded they have life size cornhole ,chess, shuffleboard, Jenga and beer pong a little later in the night they have a DJ and outside they usually have a live band all in all it's a pretty cool spot to hang out downtown oh and don't forget the FourSquare and ping pong
