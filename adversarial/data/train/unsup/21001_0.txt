Got a gift card. Had a 7 oz filet and salmon combo for 25 bones(no pun intended). Came with a pretty tasty sweet potato drenched in butter and cinnamon. Highlight of the meal. A serviceable salad included. The steak was palatable, but lacked any distinct flavor profile. It tasted like the cow had died of boredom from listening to Alan Cox, and had been cooked over several days by the ambient light of a Kindle displaying boring Cleveland yelp reviews. The salmon was served on a rice pilaf. Both were not great, but better than the steak. All that for 25 bucks is a pretty good bargain. I might try again, but I'm not in any hurry.
