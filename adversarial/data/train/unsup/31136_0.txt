My family and I are from California and haven't found a Chinese food place that compares to what we're used to having in California until now. This is the best Chinese food we have tasted. We love the orange chicken and the egg rolls. We also had the wonton soup, bbq ribs, shrimp lomain, and pepper beef everything was delicious. The portions are perfect to have enough leftover to have a second meal.
