This is a place I will come back to time and time again.  I can eat beautifully presented, proper portioned food -- and have a dessert that fits the same bill!  Our group had everything from Salmon, to Chicken Ceasar, to guacamole, to poached peach.  All excellent.  One downside for the moment but being a business person I did not mark them down because I know how challenging it is -- they currently do not have a wine\/beer licenses, making evening dining out other than for a great dinner before yoga or meditation.
