Some of the nicest people to ever own a coffee shop in the old port. Inexpensive, tasty espressos and milk based drinks, they also have great, cheap sandwiches and pre-made lunches, I think they have the most inexpensive lunches around that area. \n\nThey also have a small but solid cold cuts, cheese and dairy, and pastries section, and a small grocery store for the people who lives near there.\n\nOne of the coolest find I've been to in the entire vicinity of downtown.
