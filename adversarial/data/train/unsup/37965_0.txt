Probably the best meal we had on a recent trip to Vegas. We were looking for a Mexican restaurant, and our daughter recognized one of names as a Top Chef person, so we went there. The empanadas were both unique and delicious. Our server (Sarah __) was very helpful: when i said how much i liked the empanadas, she offered to ask the head chef to _email us the recipe_! When was the last time you had _that_ experience at a restaurant? She also told us how they make their Black Cherry Mojitos so we can try them at home. Overall a great experience, with great food, and reasonably priced for a \"name\" restaurant in Vegas. This one we'll definitely go back to.
