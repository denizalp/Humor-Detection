Came here on Friday, 8\/19\/16 with my cousin because we were in town for a bachelor party and proceeded to power drink for 7 straight hours until they kicked everyone out of the pool at 6 pm.  I'm only giving this place 4 stars because someone either stole or threw away my Broncos floppy hat, but we had a helluva time regardless.  As with any pool bar, do not go underwater or get any water in your mouth.  Not everyone gets out to go to the bathroom...\n\nAnyway, we got there pretty early (11 am), so there wasn't much of a line.  There was actually more of a line at the McGregor-Diaz UFC weigh in next door.  The guy working the gate asked if we had free passes, and we were like, \"Um, no...\"  He then directed us to the MGM Grand main pool entrance like 50 yards away to a guy who was handing out free passes.  Okay, that's $80 saved right there.  Lockers were like $40, I think.  They do allow waterproof cell phone bags, so you can bring those in.\n\nBe prepared to have an ugly tab because beer buckets are $65 for six beers, and 32 ounce mixed drinks are like $40.  You can also ask for a \"loaded\" mixed drink which is damn near all liquor and will put you on your ass.  (I'm not sure how much my cousin paid for those.)  Also key is making friends with people who have a poolside cabana.  I thought Canajuns sucked for the most part until we met these crazy ass guys from Toronto who were also in town for a bachelor party.  Thanks for the booze!\n\nSpecial shout outs go to:\n\nCaroline from Ireland - Not sure if your boyfriend into the corner was into watching you hang onto every guy within a 10 foot radius, but leaving in your two piece and coming back a couple hours later in your bra and thong was definitely memorable.  Kudos for smoking a wet cigarette.\n\nEstefania from Spain - Super hot Norwegian Air stewardess with an awesome accent whose cans just didn't quit.  You should have listened to me and done the Hot 100 contest.  You would have won!  I can't remember your friends' names, but they were hot too.\n\nAustin from NC - ECU sucks!  Go Wolfpack!\n\nToothfloss girl from parts unknown - Not that I'm complaining, but I think your bathing suit was on backwards...
