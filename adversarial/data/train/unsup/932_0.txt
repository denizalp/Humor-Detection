After seeing the disaster on Kitchen Nightmares, my wife and I were very intrigued.  We went here on a Saturday night around 7:30 PM and the restaurant was at about 20% capacity.  Samy was very nice and even Amy smiled at us from the kitchen.  Our server was almost too nice if that is possible.  It was very clean, which is why I couldn't, in good conscience, give it 1 star.  \n\nI ordered the sausage and pepperoni pizza and my wife had the spinach and goat cheese salad.  Hers was average and mine was fairly weak.  The middle was soggy dough and needed to be eaten with a fork.  It also had pesto sauce on it which was very much overkill.  \n\nWe got the dessert to go which was some white chocolate\/coconut pie deal.  Not very good at all.  \n\nWhen we left the restaurant, there were 5 other patrons at what should have been the busiest time of the week.  Samy and Amy were seated at a table near the front since there were no more meals needing to be made.  She was scanning on her iPad probably reading reviews.  \n\nIn all honesty, my wife and I kind of felt bad for them.  If only they could have swallowed their pride and let Gordon Ramsay do his thing it would probably would have been a huge success.  Instead, they are empty on Saturday evenings and will probably be out of business in the not too distant future...too bad...
