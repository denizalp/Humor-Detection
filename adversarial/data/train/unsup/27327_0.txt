We kept procrastinating about checking this place out....and finally had an early dinner here.\n\nHere's the deal...the food is good, the beer selection is good, the menu selection is ok and would rank 3-1\/2 to 4 stars on their own. The layout and theme of this place do rate 4 stars as well...but when you take a good restaurant and have excellent waitstaff, it kicks it up a notch.\n\nOur server, Victoria, was certainly the highlight of the evening. Wife and I totally appreciated her suggestions, her great attitude, and attentiveness.\n\nWe had a few appetizers, deviled eggs (with crispy prosciutto)..a little underseasoned but very tasty. (hey chef...salt and pepper are your friends in the kitchen)\n\nMeatballs Al Forno...these were perfect (some of the best ever) with a little heat to the sauce and grilled levain...which is an ostentatious way of saying tiny pieces of grilled sourdough bread. Chef...more sauce and a couple more pieces of bread...uhhh...levain.\n\nFor DInner, wife had the Pan Seared Salmon which she loved and I had the Skirt Steak Tacos with a side of Bacon Cheddar Tots. Tacos were a little on the dry side but tasty and the tots were amazing with the sriracha ketchup. \n\nAll in all, for the menu, they have a little room for improvement. You guys make it fun so we'll be coming back to school for more lessons.
