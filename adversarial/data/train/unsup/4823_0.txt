You can put lipstick on a pig, but...you know the saying.  The Clarendon Hotel looks like it was recently purchased for a steal of a deal and someone came in, slapped on some paint real fast, did minimal work to make it look \"hip\" and invited a ton of college hipsters who cannot drink at bars to come and party in the rooms.  Truth be told, I really do not have a problem with that kind of place, but some people may show up here and wish they spent their money at a Marriott.\n\nLet me break it down:\n+ = the pool and pool area has been retiled and it is rad.  It is in the center of the hotel room blocks, so anyone can look down and see some hot, young bodies playing in the water.  That pool is the selling point.\n\n+\/- = the rooms are okay.  Make something look nice and people will like it, but dig deeper and some things are janky and the features are cheap.  The showerhead was messed up, but that was the only major problem.  The beds were nice and soft though.\n\n+ = nice bar\/restaurant area.  We only drank there and did not eat anything.\n\n- = my credit card was stolen from here.  Granted, I was in a drunken haze and forgot to pick it up after paying, but what really disappoints me is that the most creative places the thief went to was a gas station, a grocery store and a Wal-mart.\n\n+ = late night snacks available for free from 10:00 p.m. - 6:00 a.m. (or something like that).  Doritos, Kit Kats, sodas.  Pure junk food.  Goes great with a six pack.\n\n- = some tacky broads vandalized a car with white shoe polish.  I think the car belonged to the lady working the front desk overnight and these bitches didn't get their way, so they had to be dicks.  Tacky.  Based on this alone, I will never stay here again.  I can't support that.\n\nSo, family of 4 having a nice vacation in the desert?  Do not stay here.  This place is for 19 year olds who want to have a hotel party because they cannot drink anywhere else.
