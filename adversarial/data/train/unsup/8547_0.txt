Yee haw!!  I went shopping for some Cowboy gear and popped into this joint.  They have a great selection of hats & boots.  I was tempted to buy some boots, but didn't want to spend the dough that day.\n\nInstead I bought a nice hat by Justin for $49.99.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_user_photos\/HdTps1zqsZ_j17bghTPIlA\n\nThere weren't too many people in the store the day I stopped by.  The workers here are friendly and helpful.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%
