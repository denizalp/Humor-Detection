took my team to las vegas to celebrate a good year of lots of hard work and ended up with an hour or so to kill before we all went to see Mystere. since we stayed at the bellagio, i was able to make it back and forth from Caesar's palace mall in time and bumped into burberry. \n\nnormally don't review places like this but geez, what service.  i was due for a new wallet. the last one must have been made of cheap leather or something because it wore out too fast. i have a lot of burberry stuff and liked the looks of their wallets so was going to go with that.  made a pathetic attempt to wait for a sale by postponing my purchase till after xmas.  note to self: burberry wallets don't go on sale, ever. \n\nfutile attempt to get a discount abandoned, i needed to haul my butt into a store to buy one at retail price. so here i am. and for buying a wallet, they really give you amazing service.  they sent me - not only thank you emails - but actually sent me a _handwritten_ thank you note , hoping that i was enjoying my new wallet from the sales lady that helped me, with her card included!  wow.  definitely a creative way of motivating people to come back to the store next time they visit vegas.
