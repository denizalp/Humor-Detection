We came a few days before Christmas and of course we had to pay for the holiday pricing of close to $50\/person (which was to be expected during the holiday; not complaining about the price). The line extended all the way outside and around the buffet. I took this as a good indication of how good the food was going to be.\n\nWe were quickly seated (had the front of the line pass). It took awhile before someone came to get our drinks. Seem like they were a bit understaffed that evening.\n\nONTO THE FOOD:\n\nPho Station: \nNot really a pho station since they didn't even have the pho rice noodles. Instead you get to pick either udon or mei fun (Chinese cellophane rice noodles; yes these were rice noodles but they're not the ones you find in your standard bowl of pho). The broth was either the dark broth (which honestly tasted like can beef broth; very salty) or the vegetable broth (which tasted funny). Definitely suggest you skip this station.\n\nHand Roll:\nTo my excitement I saw sheets of seaweed next to the sushi bar. I asked if those were for hand rolls and the guy said yes. So I asked for a California hand roll...  Nope, only roll they make there is spicy tuna hand roll. Great for tuna lovers, not so great for me.\n\nCrab Legs:\nThey had 2 separate areas where you can find the crab legs. (Good job! Crowd control.) Once you select your legs, you can ask one of the staff to heat it up for you. The legs were hit or miss. It's mostly just ok tasting legs with the occasional super yummy\/sweet legs in between.\n\nSalad Bar:\nWho pays for a $50 buffet to eat salad? I do! (Mainly because everything else just looked whatever... so sad) I have to say, this was the highlight of my buffet experience. Three types of greens you can select from. A variety of toppings.\n\nDessert:\nLots to choose from. Portion was nice and small so you are able to try everything. I love flan so I had to try one of those. It was just ok. Didn't bother finishing it. \n\nOVERALL:\n\nWould I come here again? I don't think so. For that price I would rather eat at Bacchanal.\n\nWhat a disappointing first and last meal here :(
