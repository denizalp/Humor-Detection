I have a cool perspective as a review that can attest to the following: knowledge, integrity and customer service.\n\nI called and spoke to David. He has so much industry knowledge. He took the time to speak with me about the chemicals, looked up what another company used in the past, shared his opinion based on experience and offered advice. This was free of charge.\n\nHere's the important part: I asked him to schedule an appt to follow up and examine what an inspector we had at our appraisal saw as possible termite damage. This a new home purchase so we didn't know much. Instead of just taking our money, he saved us a lot! He helped us find who did the treatment for the original owners and suggested I call them to see if there was a warranty. YEP there was.\n\nIt might seem like a weird thing to write a review for someone who I didn't end up using BUT I'll tell you this-- there are companies out there willing to do anything to sucker you out of your money. I think his knowledge and integrity should be considered by others who are deciding between companies. I totally trust this guy and would definitely use him\/House Dr because they earned my trust in the future (if those darn termites come back).
