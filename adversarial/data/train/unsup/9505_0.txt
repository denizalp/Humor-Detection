I really would love to give Barrio more stars, but I can't bring myself to actually do it. I've been here 3 times - I'm 1 for 3. My first experience (last year) was terrific, but I haven't had a great experience since. I keep TRYING to love this place, I really do. \n\nThe staff has always been uber friendly and I've never had a single problem with service. The interior is interesting, hipster Mexican \"hipexican\" maybe? The drinks are pretty good, although are not very strong. The chips and salsa are hit or miss. The salsa is really good and the chips CAN be equally great, but as it usually is with home made tortilla chips, sometimes they are salty and crunchy and sometimes they are bland and chewy. \n\nMy biggest complaint with Barrio is with the tacos. If I were to describe the tacos in one word it would be \"wet\" - if I were to describe them in two words they would be \"cold\"  & \"wet.\" Salivating yet? They do have a few salsa options, but I don't think they strain the salsas at all, leaving your taco literally dripping salsa water and leaving a nice pale cloudy pool of wetness at the bottom of your tray (yak). I prefer hard shell tacos and it's really unappetizing to have to set your hard shell in a puddle in between bites. The shells get (I apologize for using this next word) moist and start to break apart. If you are not a fast eater, it's a serious shit show by the time you are nearing the end of your taco. Now, I understand everyone doesn't prefer hard shell, but my fiance had the same complaint about his soft shells being too juicy. (blurp)\n\nI would also like to point out that their inability to make a decision on the \"fish\" tacos is a detriment to their restaurant. When I first went to Barrio I believe they had a grilled shrimp which was excellent. Shortly after I went back to indulge, but when I was given my tacos I send them back because I thought they had brought me the wrong order. I was then informed that their \"fish\" option changes and that what they served me was, in fact, the day's fish taco - it was WALLEYE. I'm a Midwest girl. I love walleye, but not on a taco! I hadn't \"dressed\" my taco accordingly, although I'm not even sure how I would've done that. Gross. I had no idea that the fish option changed. I recently had shrimp ceviche, which was also terrible. Again, cold and dripping with shrimp & onion water. No thanks. \n\nIf you're feeling up for an adventure - go for it. I know that some people LOVE this place and I get it. I just don't think my personal tastes are on track with what they offer. Maybe I should just stick with traditional beef, lettuce, sour cream and cheese... Maybe it really is safest inside the box.\n *sigh*
