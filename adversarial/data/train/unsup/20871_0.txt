DO NOT SUCCUMB TO THE BLITZKREIG!\n\nAs you wait to be seated, and are surrounded by the intense aroma of deliciously seasoned red meat... control yourself!  When they finally seat you and your stomach is rumbling as daggers of sizzling beef walks past you... slow down.  Try with all your might to enjoy the experience and not stuff your face as they drop a bazillion bombs of meat on your plate.\n\nWish someone told us that before we sat down and was disgustingly full in 30 minutes and couldn't move.
