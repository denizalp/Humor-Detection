It was clean.  \n\nIt was 103f when I checked in. My room, 227, didn't have the a\/c on. It was about 100 in the room. I left and went back to the front desk. The front desk clerk was right off the short bus. He told me that all the room a\/cs are turned off to save money.  These are cheap models that can't cool a room down in any good manner of time. \n\nI cranked up the a\/c and left for 3 hours. When I returned it was nighttime and the room was somewhat comfortable. \n\nAt breakfast I saw some of the other guests. Scary looking people\n\nLa Quinta, this is one of your worst properties.
