I randomly came across L2 Lounge in the summer of 2008.  It's located in Chinatown on a 2nd floor.  We were surprised to see how many kiddos were hanging out there.  They're even there on school days!  It has a rec room \/ game center atmosphere combined with a bubble tea cafe.  The teas are decent, but my friends & I simply go there for the Naked Photo Hunt.  We can play that game all day long.
