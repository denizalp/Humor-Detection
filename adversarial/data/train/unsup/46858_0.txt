okay, so here the thing! I went back to this restaurant and gotten my favorite item on the menu the \"orange duck\". but this time it was not very pleasant, it was tough and over cooked and definitely salty an not tasty at all. I am almost curtain they fried it in Clorox bleach EEK!!! :^X \n\nI'm never going back here ever again. disgusting!!!!!!!!
