Mannnnnn my first in-n-out! I'm 23 and I had never experienced this heaven sent restaurant until about a week ago. \n\nOrdered a Double Double, side of fries, animal style fries, a chocolate shake, and a strawberry shake\n\nThe man taking our orders was so fast (and nice.) But he didn't make us feel rushed or anything. I literally went to go wash my hands in the bathroom and then my husband was already picking up our food! Very fast!! \n\nAnd holyyyyyyy ghost it was delicious. Like I'm so glad I'm moving to AZ where these are all over the place. And gyms too, luckily they're all over the place cuz yeah ;)
