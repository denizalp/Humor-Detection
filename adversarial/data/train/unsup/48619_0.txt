My friend and I were in town for a concert and didn't make reservations for dinner anywhere (big mistake).  We stumbled across Fuego and were just thankful they could seat us in a reasonable amount of time.  Considering how busy they were, I was impressed with the quick and attentive service.  We both had tostadas, which were good but spicier than I would have liked. The chips & salsas were a good addition.\n\nI would go back again, but probably more for a lunch spot.
