I had never heard of this place but  when we went this weekend it looked like it had a good vibe when we walked in.  Loved the ambiance (and the fuzzy wallpaper!) but the service and the drinks were not only subpar but were downright horrible.  We had no idea it had been on Bar Rescue until we got there and it said it on the menu.  It took me several minutes to get anyone to even pay attention to me.  Our first round we ordered an old fashioned and a Vesper and they were both just ok.   The second drink that my husband ordered was a dark and stormy and it tasted like they were just using club soda instead of ginger beer.  He went to the bar to say that his drink was wrong and the bartender tasted it and said that it was fine.  Three of us tasted it before he took it up there and we all thought it was wrong.  It's a simple drink and super hard to screw up.  She remade the drink but it tasted exactly the same.  He ended up not even drinking it because it was still horrible.\n\nWe had never been to this place and honestly we will likely never go back.  The drinks were cheap for Vegas on a Saturday night but the things that we saw on the bar rescue episode are still there - horrible service, inability to make simple drinks and it STILL says that they have food on the menu, which they do not.  We definitely love Vegas dive bars and we frequent a few of them as residents but if the service and the drinks are incorrect it doesn't matter what the bar looks like or what history it has.  They need to step up their game!!
