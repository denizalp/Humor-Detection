Fancy Italian in Southend, Luciano's is part of the Steel Yard and Sullivan's property at South Boulevard and Tremont Street. White table cloths and heavy cutlery and back & white waiters.  They do have a good, if limited, selection of Italian classics and then a few other dishes.\n\nI opted for the capellini bolognaise and it was a good portion of a rich and meaty sauce, already tossed through. My wife opted for the lamb chops and she enjoyed them. Three good sized and meaty chops in a savory sauce with small potatoes.\n\nDessert was a chocolate torte that was excellent. Nicely plated and very sweet.\n\nValet parking available.
