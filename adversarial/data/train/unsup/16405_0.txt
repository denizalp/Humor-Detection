M&M world was awesome! They run sales and specials often so ask around and see what deals you scoop up! You'll be lured in by the amazing candy and chocolate smell from the strip! \n\nIt's pretty much 4 floors of M&Ms everything! The have escalators and there's also an elevator tucked away in the corner. \n\nIt's fairly easy to get to. Across the street from NY NY and next door to the MGM.
