Really enjoyed my stay at the Venetian with my girlfriend. The restaurants are 5 stars and the gondola is pretty cool itself. I think I will be taking it next time we visit but we mainly did shopping and I made sure my girl was smiling the whole time. It's really close to the miracle mile which has a bunch of other nice restaurants and shopping. To sum it up I really liked this place and look forward to going back soon!
