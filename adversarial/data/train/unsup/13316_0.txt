Bring on the MEAT! The gyro here is jam packed with tender and succulent, seared bites of beef and lamb seasoned with zesty spices. You can see it being broiled from the counter. The pita bread is barely big enough to hold it all in with the onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce. The \"steak gyro special\" came with piping hot fries and a drink for about 8 bucks. It's the same as the regular gyro on the menu, so I was told. I was craving something on the healthier side, *not* a chain or sit-down restaurant. Luckily I spotted them from Northsight, right next to the Title Boxing Club. Do yourself a favor and check them out when you're in the area.
