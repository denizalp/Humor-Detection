The food is always good. I never have any issues with anything that I order.\nThis particular evening, Lexi, was our server. From the first interaction on she was cold & unhappy. \nWe wait 15 minutes at our table before we were ever greeted. She brought our salad before our silverware. Our waters were never refilled by her. I had to stop a different server twice to ask him for refills. When she was sat a second table we were completely ignored, all together. I had to get up to ask for my check. Then a third server helped me, she offered to get the manager for me. I did decline to speak to the manager. (Even though she had only checked on us once.) It was late & I needed to get the family home. However she insisted, so I spoked to him. The whole time it was blatantly obvious that Lexi was trying to hear everything I was saying. \nI don't plan on returning to that location, anytime soon. However, if I do I will definitely be making sure I get a different server.
