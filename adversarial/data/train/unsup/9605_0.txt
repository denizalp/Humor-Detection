Are you serious? $5.50 for ONE scoop of gelato? And then $7.50 for TWO scoops? Holy!!! This has GOT to be expensive. I guess they get a free pass since it is located inside the Palazzo but still! They have tons of flavors ranging from lychee to guava to passionfruit, to tiramisu, etcetc. \n\nCome here if you absolutely NEED a gelato fix but if you can wait it out, go elsewhere.
