Love this place!  Tavia helped me last Saturday when I came in. What a sweetheart!!  My Mom recently passed away and I was on my way home from her house, after we packed up all of her belongings to sell her home.  Very sad.  Am so glad I made a quick decision to stop for a bite at Chilis that night. Tavia made my night!  Very nice, so genuine and absolutely wonderful. She was very kind and honestly she really lifted my spirits. PLUS, of course my food was fabulous, as always. Chilis is always a fantastic place to eat at.  Delicious meals every time, warm, cozy atmosphere and awesome employees, like Tavia, and that makes a great restaurant!!
