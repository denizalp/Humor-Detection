Had an amazing dinner tonight!  Was amazed at the atmosphere of the restaurant. It was not what I expected when I pulled into the parking lot!  The inside is elegant and spacious with beautiful statement pieces.  The staff was prompt and polite. Our server Tim was absolutely great! Very honest and funny.  Was a pleasure to have him serve us, he made sure to constantly check on us regardless of how busy the restaurant was.  I loved that he knew the details of the dishes and made great recommendations. The French onion was delicious as were the truffle fries!  All in all a great evening!  Will definitely be back again.  Thank you sparkling a and Tim for a memorable evening
