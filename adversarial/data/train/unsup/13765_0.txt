This place tips people off when they are drunk. Why would you take advantage of drunk people, or wait maybe they are the one to put some \"low key drugs\" into the drink which is why some customers don't remember?\n\nGo elsewhere, as this place doesn't help with relaxing as at the end of a day you get ripped off! STAY AWAY! Try Club Paradise.
