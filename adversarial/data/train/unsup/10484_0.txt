3.5 stars\n\nLocated by the entrance of the Miracle Mile Shops along the strip, inside Planet Hollywood, across from the Sugar Factory.  Known for its warm toasty bread and reasonable prices. \n\nFollowing other reviewers suggestions, we ordered the Montague and the Caribbean Jerk sandwiches.  The Montague being more traditional with roast beef, turkey, Swiss, lettuce, tomatoes and sweet mustard was very tasty.  The Caribbean Jerk Chicken was tender, moist and the sweet peppers had a spicy kick.  Also, had the Cobb salad, a side of pasta salad, macaroni salad, brownie bites, and a frozen lemonade.  All this plus a soda and a bag of chips came to total $30.  It would have easily fed 4 people!  \n\n It's definitely the best place to grab a sandwich on the strip.
