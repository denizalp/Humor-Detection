I know several people personal at the Peoria Sandbar and try to get over there as often as I can, with the Scottsdale location being closer to my house a group of friends and I decided to party at the Scottsdale location for New Year's Eve this year. \n\nOverall we had a great time. The theme of the evening was Paparazzi. They had a red carpet outside with a photog, disposable cameras on the table for everyone to document the evening, and crazy drink specials. I choose to partake in the Champagne Bucket special, $20 for 4 mini bottles, which I bough two of. Probably should have rethought that one, as the next day I hurt, but who didn't? \n\nThings I didn't like.... the dance floor was crazy packed, the line for the bathroom was out of control (but there isn't really any helping that, don't go pee? lol) and some of the female bartenders had a difficult time serving me, it was as if I was completely invisible to them at times. I finally caught on to this and walked to the other side of the bar and they guys took way better care of me. \n\nWe had fun, I would recommend partying here. I haven't had the food in a long time so I cannot speak on that aspect at this time.
