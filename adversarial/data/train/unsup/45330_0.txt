Great Italian grocer and restaurant! Philly cheesesteaks, calzones and pizzas are all excellent. Check out the freezer section for Gelato and fresh pasta. The fridge near the to go pick up counter also has raw pizza dough if you are wanting to stretch it and make your own at home (fun date night). Not a 5 because the pizza needs to be eaten fresh, otherwise it gets soggy and a bit rubbery.
