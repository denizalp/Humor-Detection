Wish I had better things to say, the spa looked amazing! They have all the right things but it just falls short. I had a gel manicure and a pedicure without paint as well as eyebrow and lip threading. My sister had a pedicure, manicure and mustache waxing. Pedicure - good - water was warm not hot enough. Chairs looked clean and had a massage component. The girl who provided the massage was good but didn't speak English all that well so it was hard to communicate. I had the pedicure with a hot paraffin treatment. Overall my feet came out nice. The manicurist had me pick out a color and then when went to paint my nails I explained she had the wrong color. She argued that two coats would make the color be exactly what I picked, she was wrong. The gel manicure completely peeled off within a week (I have had a gel manicure several times before and it's been near impossible to take off). The threading lady was good, quick and efficient. My sister was waxed and looked raw and red (blotchy) therefore I elected the threading. Because I spent over $140 for both my sister and I to be pampered and wasn't blown away and the fact that the gel manicure peeled off within a week I will never go back.
