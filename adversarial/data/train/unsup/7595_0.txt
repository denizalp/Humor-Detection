As a place to go to w\/ your friends and laugh about the ridiculousness of it all, great.\n\nAs a haunted house, sub par.\n\nI expected so much more from \"one of the scariest haunts in America\". I found my way thru the dark portion by feeling along the walls the entire way, why wasnt there anything gross feeling to freak people out? And the train horn...Listen. It is NOT scary to walk by a wall and suddenly be deafened by a loud horn (we heard it over and over from the line). The 2nd maze seemed like just filler. The hall of mirrors, meh. And Jakob Kells actual house, even more meh. \n\nI know, I know Im totally negative Nancy right now. IMO there were 3, no 4 cool things. 1) The 3rd maze was admittedly very cool. It reminded me of one I used to go to when I was a kid back east. 2) The bedrrom in Jakob Kells house w\/ the contorted girl- awesome. Very Exorcist-y. 3) The badges that linked to Facebook. Awesome. Im just sad that my zombied out engagement photo that appeared in the house wasnt transfered to my page. 4) Nothing is creepier in scary movies than children. So while the mirror maze was meh, the kids that were in there along w\/ the \"La la la la la la\" music was creepy as hell.\n\nI really expected more \"scare\" moments.
