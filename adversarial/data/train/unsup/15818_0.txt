Went to Fear Farm on Friday night, luckily we got there when it first opened and didn't have to wait in line long for any of the attractions.  They do not accept credit cards but do have a ATM on site that charges a $5.00 service charge, just so you know.  For $18.00 you get all 4 of the haunted attractions.  We started with the Apocalypse corn maze all the way at the end, there was no one in this line because everyone who gets tickets automatically goes to the first attraction.  This corn maze was good and alot of fun!  It was well done, with lots of scenes and it made me scream a few times, which is always a big plus.  I would recommend this corn maze for sure!  We then went to the asylum, which I knew just by being in line was going to be bad.  The gentleman working the tickets kept yelling at everyone for everything and was quite annoying.  Upon entering, every single scene just had the actors standing in the room?!?  No one was hiding trying to jump out and scare us.  I know that when I walk into a room that has a poor quality scene and a actor just standing there, I am not impressed.  This was one of the worst haunted houses I have ever been too.  I am from Ohio where haunted houses are a major thing at Halloween, and I was so disappointed.  We then went to the Carnevil corn maze, it was pretty good, not as good as the first corn maze, but it was still ok.  It had a few good scenes, but not as many actors.  By then we had just about had enough, we had been there for almost 2 hours and the crowd was really big by then.  When we arrived at the mortuary, the line was so long we just decided to forget it, it was however another building attraction like the asylum and we figured it would be just as bad.\nOverall I had a good time, it was chilly out and it was fun to be out there for Halloween.  I would recommend the 2 corn mazes, they were fun.  I would also recommend that you get there right when they open (7:30) because later on it was a mad house.
