The Lion's Tail and the clams in garlic are all I needed to make me a fan. Add to that it was Reverse Happy Hour = bigger fan. Went with bros Tien & Anthony for part 2 of the Potluck 3 part after party. \n\nIt retains the clubby darkness of the Venetian Restaurant which used to be here for years. It should be noted that wells ($3?) & some beers are on Happy Hour prices, but the Specialty Cocktails they are so well known for are not. Still: the Lion's Tail is epic, spicy, and deep with many right notes hit. (10$)\n\nSpeaking of high notes: those garlic clams were delicious. A generous serving Tien was glad to share as he devoured the famous Happy Hour steak Special. It was great to have Amanda pop in and hang out, gift me a picture of beautiful Petra and enjoy (?!?!) the old skool Hip Hop videos and mating rituals as the bar. The wee hours bring out interesting people, for sure. \n\nOur waitress was adorable but not quite familiar with the menu (or maybe didn't know a LT is spicy) Suffice it to say the Eye Candy is there; MENSA members? Not so much. Location is last place you'd expect a Hipster bar, and that is good. Wasn't overly Hipster for me = no hives ;))\n\nThink it would make a sexy date night spot and will try either of the HH again. It can get pricy: but pricy + quality is just fine with me. Much rather pay more for real food & drink by mixology masters than cheap processed food\/greasy HH specials\/cheap booze. \n\nThis again is a highly rated Yelp place which lived up to the hype for me. Always a good thing. \n\n\nYelp 100 Challenge
