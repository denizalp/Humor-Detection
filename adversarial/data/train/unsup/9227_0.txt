For the price, it's excellent. Now that Lychee Inn is gone from the area (tears, tears, tears), I'm having a hard time finding Chinese food nearby that's better than this at any price. So far I've had the egg foo young and General Tso's chicken, and both were great.\n\nThe fact that they deliver is icing on the cake. The only downside is that they're close enough to my house that I feel stupid lazy if I don't go and pick it up myself.
