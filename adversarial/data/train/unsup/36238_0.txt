They are always so nice whenever I come in.  Even though I always do take-out, the service and quality of their food is wonderful.  I'm always greeted with some boiled peanuts (yum!) and some water or green tea while I wait for my food.\n\nI've been on the search for some good hamburger steak\/loco moco and I do have to say, it is one of the best that I've tasted here in Vegas.  The gravy tastes homemade, not from powder like most. And the hamburger is yummy, but a bit overdone.  I need to remember to ask for it to be cooked medium.  Even with my drive home clear across town, the egg is always perfectly over easy.\n\nAlso, the have some super delicious fried noodles.  That is also a hard thing to find out here.  Whatever we order, we ALWAYS have to have an order of fried noodles to go with our food.  Most places seem to use a lesser quality noodles when making this, but yours is perfect!!\n\nWe're still making our way through the menu, but so far, everything has been great!
