Man alive...I just ordered from this lovely place and had it delivered because I'm stuck at work. It's so nice to have places besides pizza and Chinese that deliver. \n\nI ordered the - Taquiza Cilantro. Yes, it's huge. It's 1lbs of meat. I got 1lbs of carnitas and I didn't even eat half. I'll bring the rest home. \n\nEverything was freaking delicious. The tortillas, rice, toppings the grilled peppers...yum.\n\nI don't have much else to say since I didn't go to the location, but that was an excellent deal for $24.95. \n\nI will order or go in MANY more times.
