***UPDATE***\n\nI really appreciate that Lin from lala lashes reached out to me regarding my bad experience. It really showed that they care about their customers and not just our money; which is hard to come by now-a-days. \n\nShe reimbursed the amount I have spent at her business, even though she did not ask me to update\/change my rating I feel it's only fair to do so.\n\nThe rest of the lashes fell out within the next 2 days, so after 7 days, all my lash extension fell out.
