DO NOT GO HERE!! Terrible! Dale and Henry ruined my 30th birthday when we dropped over $1500 to have a \"Cabana\" in which I got accused of taping a drunk, puking girl... Which Unfortunately wasn't the case as i was preoccupied with my WIFE who was topless in our pool chair. They walked up to us in our cabana and directly accused me of taking a video in the pool. Then when I provided proof they asked us to leave. (Forced us out of the pool area). \nWorst experience I have had at a spot in Vegas. I am a local- born and raised here and the service we (all 8 of us) were given was straight UNACCEPTABLE! They will be hearing about this in management and every other social media outlet.  DO NOT GO HERE!!
