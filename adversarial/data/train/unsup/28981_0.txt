Overpriced. No amenities. \n\nEven a $30 a night dump has a coffee maker in the room. You probably wouldn't want to use it, but it's there.\nThe only wifi they have is for rewards members or you can pay more for it. It's also an unsecured network, and they seem to block VPNs, so it's pretty worthless. \nThere is no door or curtain on the shower so the whole bathroom floor becomes a slippery death trap after a shower.\nThe bed is hard as a rock.\nThe thermostat is super loud.\nThere's no place next to the sink to hang a hand towel.\nThe walls to the hall and to the bathroom are very thin. \nThey don't have breakfast of any kind.\nThe couch in the room is hideous and uncomfortable.\nThe pool is a tiny, shallow joke of a pool where they play some kind of awful music so loud you can't even talk to each other, relaxing by the pool is impossible. \nThe only reason I gave them 2 stars is the room is clean. Ugly, dangerous, and uncomfortable, but clean.
