The place to be evenings in Denver. Decent food and open late on weekends.\n\nCost to worth it ratio: 2.5 (bit pricier for the area)\n\nHighlights:\n- Weekend hours: open til 2am with full bar and food menu\n- Space: roomy with a long bar, pool table room, and tables by the bar and raised up area beside it.\n- Menu: traditional bar aps, slew of wing  flavors, salads, sandwiches, and entrees. Also a good amount of beer and liquor choices. \n- Fish and shrimp: you have the choice of preparation and mine was blackened fish and cajun fried shrimp. Both were tasty and cooked well (not overdone like I was concerned about), but as a nit the blackened seasoning was a bit too salty for me.\n\nLowlights:\n- Volume: Even though it does offer a nighttime meet up spot, not the place to catch up with friends. There's a band playing that isn't bad but blaringly loud and they seem to have stamina such that they don't need to take breaks, so you're limited to using sign language, yelling, or waiting for the few seconds of down time between songs. \n- Smoke factor: people can smoke inside so even though our table wasn't , I still came out of there smelling like an ashtray.\n- Missing hush puppies: I was excited to see this side included on the entr√©e, but when my plate got there it came without them and had a sole onion ring instead. \n\nIt's nice that as our friend said Denver is trying, so we may be back as it still is a viable non-sketchy late night eats and drink option.
