Soooo fun!\nWhat an awesome experience.\nFirst of all, no cell phone.  Awesome in itself.  \nPitch blackness has a way to make you feel all of your other senses. We thought we had superhero hearing.\nThe food was delicious and VERY allergen friendly.  \nOur server Anthony was the absolute best! As my son would say,  100 thumbs up!\nWe'll be back for a different menu next year.
