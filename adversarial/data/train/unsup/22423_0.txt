This was our first trip to the historic West Side Market. It had recently caught on fire and was restored within the last 18 months or so. \nAfter living in northeastern Ohio for the past almost 9 years, this was one of our opportunities to explore the area. The West Side Market was fabulous. \n\nWe arrived there hungry and wanted some place to sit down. The vendors inside the Market directed us to the Cafe. In retrospect, we wish they hadn't.\n\nFirst, our server literally threw our utensils towards us on the table. She would later go on to toss the plastic cups of blue cheese dressing, tartar sauce, and salsa on our table. She probably thought it was fun and familiar, but we thought it was completely unprofessional.\n\nSecond, my wife and I ordered the chorizo dip, a fish taco, a cup of chicken poprashaw, a cup of coffee for me, and a cup of tea for my wife.  Our total was $39.15. We were stunned! The service was below average and the food was barely average.\n\nSpecifically, the fish taco probably would have been better if it wasn't fried super dry. The chicken poprashaw was super thick and had the consistency of gruel. Finally, my Buffalo chicken chopped salad was so salty, I could not finish it. In all fairness, the tortilla chips with chirizo dip was all we should have ordered. The rest of the menu, the environment, and our server, we're all a disappointment. \n\nNext time we visit the West Side Market we will eat somewhere else first and make our way through the wonderful market environment.
