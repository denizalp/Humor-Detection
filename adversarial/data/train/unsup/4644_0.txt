So this  place is definitely for foodies.  I like food. Actually, I love food.  However this isn't my type of place. It may be *too* foodie for me.  However, if you are really into food this would be the place for you. Basically you are given basic ingredients from which your meal will revolve and you are asked to pick what you absolutely won't eat.  I'm not talking \"I won't eat mushrooms\", but they ask if you will eat really out there things like snail urethras. Not really, but I didn't know what a lot of the stuff was.  Perhaps I'm not as adventurous as I thought.   \n\nI've eaten meat from little shacks in Morocco (and subsequently got worms) so I'm not *that* scared, but I am just not into eating really really unique foods. Besides, the street meat in Morocco was super cheap. ;)
