I had to have 3 lengthy phone calls prior to the \"service\" in regards to my kids, bugs etc... honestly way more work than any pest control I ahve ever dealt with.\nhe then forgot he had an appt me with and cursed about it over the phone.\nwe set up a time of noon and he arrived at 11am, I had my mother at the house to allow him access.\n\nWorst service ever! He Yelled at my mother to get off the phone, she tried to explain she was on the phone with me (the person hiring him) and that I would anwser any questions. He got angry and said \"I will only deal with ONE person, so get off the phone\" \nAt which point my mother was scared for her well being and refused to hang up the phone. He then said \"this will not work and left the house slamming the door) NEVER providing the service I had already PAID for!!!!\n\nDO NOT CALL THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!
