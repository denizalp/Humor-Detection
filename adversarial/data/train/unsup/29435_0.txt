Was in town for a convention for work. Had heard good things about this place so me and 3 other coworkers decided to check it out. \nFrom the SMALL PLATES Menu we ordered 4 Crispy Taquitos (Yellowtail) to start. Soooo delicious. I thought the shell looked generic but one bite, and my taste buds were exploding. So many yummy flavors packed into one small dish! \nA coworker suggested we ordered the Seaweed Salad. The middle variety was the type I am familiar with but I was delighted to discover that the complimenting two were flavorful as well. \nFrom the SAMBA ROLLS Menu we all shared the Samba Strip, Sao Paolo, and the California Snow Crab (Cucumber wrapped). All were delicious and I would highly recommend them.  Although I was partial to the Sao Paolo. \nFrom the ROBATA Menu we ordered the Sea Bass. Perfectly cooked and seasoned, tender and the homeny style corn was a great balance of sweet and savory. \nWhen we tried to order the Filet Mignon from the ROBATA menu and the Mushroom Tobanyaki from the SMALL PLATES menu the server suggested we combine these two dishes. This was an excellent suggestion. The Steak was perfectly cooked, the sauce from the mushrooms deliciously complimented the beef, and the poached egg was the icing on the cake!
