Food is alright, but customer service was bad. We came in and the employees looked at us but didn't say hi or anything. When ordering, they barely put a small spoonful of ingredients, so we had to ask them to put more of almost everything and the employees looked very annoyed. Employees looked like they hated their jobs, they need to definitely improve on their customer service skills. Food and customer service is way better at chipotle.
