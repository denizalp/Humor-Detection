I really enjoyed Palmer St and it's concept. It's situated a little tucked back from the other bars and restaurants in the area, but don't worry the place is great! \n\nMost of the games, with exception to ping pong, air hockey and skeet ball, are free. It mostly consists of your classic throwback games from the 80s, but they had a great mix. The games to people ratio on a Saturday afternoon was good, as it wasn't too busy. We didn't have to fight or wait for any games of our choice. \n\nLastly, they had a good selections of beers and cocktails - along with daily drink specials so make sure you ask about them.
