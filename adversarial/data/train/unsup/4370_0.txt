So disappointed ... Took my girlfriend few weeks ago to purchase a new laptop, apparently Canadian taxes are higher than here, but the old lady we go to explain her about the retina laptop had no idea what she was talking about, so we had to find somebody better train.\nThan few days ago decided to visit the store again in search of new gadgets, but the place was toxic...smelled worse than a Golds Gym in a Tuesday night! I had to run for the exit and never look back!\nI guess I'm gonna have to resume to Internet shopping or go the another location.
