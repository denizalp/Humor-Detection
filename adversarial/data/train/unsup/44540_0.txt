I went to this place thinking I could get a good hair cut, but I was wrong. The hair stylist was friendly, I showed her a picture of how I wanted my hair and for the most part it was going well. Until she cut my bangs, she cut off way too much from the side and now I look like I'm back in elementary school. Then when it came to paying, I tried to use my credit card but they didn't even have a working machine. I was very disappointed in this place.
