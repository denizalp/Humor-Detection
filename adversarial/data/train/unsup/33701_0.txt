This place is awesome!!  \n\nAs much as I frequent Las Vegas, I have always wanted to give this place a try....I'm so glad we did.  I've never really been one to want to stay on the strip, so this Casino was right up my alley.  Just 2 exits or so away off the 15 from the Strip, Silverton is in a great neighborhood across the street from a Target, Lane Bryant\/Cacique and many other stores.\n\nCasino was not smoky at all, was very clean, the staff was friendly.\n\nOur room was nicely cleaned, beds were comfortable and they had GREAT pillows.  Only gripe....bathroom was rather small, and you have to drag your luggage through the Casino to get to the hotel check-in area.  \n\nI would definitely stay here again
