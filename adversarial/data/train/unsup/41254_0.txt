They did a great job detailing the car inside and out. Very happy with that. The only issue I had, is most of the workers did not speak English very well and I sat there for an hour and a half. I had to ask someone the status of my car, he said it has been done for awhile and they were looking for me. Mind you, I was sitting outside the entire time. I never once heard anyone call my name when my car was finished. Once I got my keys from the gentleman who detailed my car, he even questioned me if the car was really my car! I'll definitely be going back because I love how clean my car is, but the communication from their employees, definitely needs some work!!
