Very interesting trail.  Follow the white bumpy unpaved road of White Rock a few miles after Sandstone Quarry in the Red Rock Scenic route.  It starts off like stink on sh*t of an incline.  Not as bad as Mt. Charleston, but it will steal a breath or 2.  After that it's all gravy.  Come up around the darker hard rock mountain and into the valley to another red crumbly type mountain.  \n\nI wish I could be more technical, not to sound like a complete geological ass.  Alas' I like to experience my hikes then research them after.  Not much to see on this hike as far as animal wise.  Yet, it does have the makings and vibe for some formidable creepy crawlies later in season.  I'll keep you tuned if I suddenly run into the fangs or teeth on another hike here.\n\nSeeing as the desert meets the Junipers at this very geological intersection I was hoping to cross some Mojave or Speckled rattlers.  Maybe a Gila Monster under some rock chips?  Since its barely October 1st they are probably just having a late start.  \n\nI really dig the rewarding views and significance of this trails end.  Also not too many folks like to drive the rocky unpaved path. Not a long hike and definitely worth the bumpy road in.
