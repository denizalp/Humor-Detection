Downtown Container Park is the latest in the East Fremont DTLV development.\n\nThe concept is solid: Stack up a bunch of shipping containers and turn them into clothing, art, and novelty shops....Include a few food spots, a couple of bars, a concert stage and an aesthetically impressive children's tree house\/play area...and set it all in a part of town where interest is growing = 3.5 Stars!\n\nI've been here twice since it opened.  Both times I was heading someplace else but our group was distracted by Container Park and we felt compelled to explore.\n\nThe shops tend to be a little overpriced.  But that's to be expected in a place like this.  We had just eaten both times that I came in so I haven't tried any of the food here.  There aren't many drafts available from the bars inside, but they both had options that would appeal to the more discerning beer drinker.  The park closes to those under 21 after 8pm or 9pm and this was great because they were packed on Friday night.\n\nThey appear to have a wide variety of music artists scheduled to play.  The music was great both times I went.  ...a true highlight for our group.  Another big plus for us was the local aspect of many of the shops.  I'm not sure that I would come down here to specifically hangout...eat...and drink here, but it was a great distraction between bar hopping!
