Worst Spa Experience EVER!\n\nI am a local and have received massages at many casino spas in town and this was by far the worst spa experience Ever! Not worst massage ever but it was such a bad spa experience it ruined the whole thing. \n\nThe \"room\" I was in should NOT be allowed to be a massage room! It was next door to what I'm assuming is the men's jacuzzi\/communal area. I know this because the volume of men's voices were SO loud. The last thing I want to hear while I'm getting a $140 massage is people talk about their plans to ride the rides at stratosphere later that night, or their Excalibur room cost $300 or someone giving directions to lake mead by taking Sahara to Boulder. Yes, I got all of that information while my masseuse is turing up the \"calming\" music to drown them out and apologizing for the noise. \n\nFinally 20 mins into my massage I can't take it. All oiled up I ask to be moved into a different room. By the time I get re robed and move rooms its impossible to get relaxed. By the time my massage is over I don't even care to use any of the other spa amenities. So I just head out front to complain about my experience and wait on my BF.\n\nAs a local you already receive 30% off all spa services(this is a standard at all casinos). So when I complained about my experience they added an additional 20% off. Where they got 20% from I have no idea because I wasn't dissatisfied 20% I was dissatisfied 100%. They then proceeded to tell me they told the guys to be quiet and keep it down. I was like, wait, what??? You we're telling them to keep quiet while I was in there, before I asked to move myself? So you know that room has issues, I'm obviously not the first to complain and you still put people in there? \n\nAs I'm about to pay they remind me theres a 20% automatic gratuity. So that made complete sense after what just happened?!?!\n\nAs you can tell I'm really relaxed and happy from my \"spa\" day.
