My Filipina wife and I ate here a couple days ago and we liked it. Its vastly improved from the previous VEGAS BUFFET.\n They don't have the big selection or $12 price of BUFFET ASIA down the street but its the best \"value\".\n All you ASIAN buffet snobs need to go to some fancy assed place for your fkn crab legs n sashimi.
