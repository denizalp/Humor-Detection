I like this place a lot,it is a bit of an older crowd but I haven't been to a swinger place where there is only 20 years olds...idk why it bugs peope on that asoect lol there are good looking people every time I go.maybe it's because I'm not picky lol we are a young Latin couple and we like the chill and laid back vibe.love that there is security and and I think it's dated but I don't mind.we usually like to go and have a few drinks and talk with people.we don't always do things and the more we go,the more we just like the good vibes.\n\nfor me I think Saturday is the best day to go,I wouldn't really go any other day and we haven't had any creeps doing things we don't want them too.maybe one or two guys that would follow.my gf gets a lot of compliments when we go and people hitting on her but it's not in a disturbing way,they are nice about it and get the hint when we are ready to go...I'll keep coming here but wouldn't mind finding a bit more of an upscale place every now and then too.sometimes it's too warm here....\n\ngreat place to people watch
