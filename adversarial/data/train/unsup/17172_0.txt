This is the adorable looking patisserie shop in the Paris Casino on the strip. They offer amazing looking pastries, sandwiches, coffee and more. I walked by this shop a million times and finally decided to try out one treat the chocolate mousse pistachio dessert because it looked terrific.\n\nMy first bite was offensive in my mouth. The slick looking chocolate glaze is really loose brown colored gelatin that I had to scrape off. Then I took a bite of the almost dry mousse that was dense and too sweet without a good chocolate flavor. My last attempt at tasting something yummy was to try the pistachio ribbon. Sadly it seemed to be just green cream. I do think it's possible that this dessert was a few days old and might have been better when it was fresh.\n\nThree small bites and this went in the trash.\n\nBased on trying only one dessert I'd say the quality is equivalent to buffet desserts.
