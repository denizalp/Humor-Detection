Aw shooooot I really like going to Nelson's Barber Shop. They don't take appointments, ca$h only,  closed only Sunday, and never is a real long wait. \n\nMy favorite cutter is Minh, shes tight like her sharp razors that give me an excellent cut, fade, taper, and (insert barber technique). Always takes her time to make sure everything is to my liking, offers suggestions, works fast, and uh she doesn't smell. It took me a real long time to find someone I was comfortable with and didn't cost AYCE sushi money. I can see myself going here for years just like the fellas that hang out at barber shops in the movies.
