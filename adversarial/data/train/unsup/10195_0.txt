This ice cream place is a dairy free\/vegan\/ice cream lover\/scientists dream!! I absolutely LOVE this place. As a person who cannot eat dairy, but loves ice cream this place is very magical. You can get literally ANY custom flavor with a cashew or lactose free cream base (milk based and yogurt based available as well) The ice cream is amazing and it is so wonderful to have such a vast selection! Not only that but they freeze your chosen cream and mix ins with a nitrogen blast, and POOF! Custom ice cream!! Their mix ins range from brownie, to berry, to cheesecake, to cookie dough, and so much more! The texture is very nice and the taste is sooo amazing!!
