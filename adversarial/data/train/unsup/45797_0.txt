We visited Pieology Pizzeria on 6\/8\/17. Location is fairly new so there were only a couple tables in restaurant. Pizza was delicious, staff was friendly and professional and restaurant was clean. Pizza only took about 8 minutes so it would be a great location if you were in a hurry.\nLove the whole Pieology concept of customizing your pizza. We would definitely return. This was our first visit to Pieology so we were impressed. We will also try the other locations.
