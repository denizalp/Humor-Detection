So Roppongi has been a huge surprise to me! I was watching it under construction for some time because the name, being the name of a trendy neighborhood in Tokyo, really caught my eye. (They even stay true to the kanji characters on the sign!) I honestly wasn't expecting a whole lot - you know, the typical Chinese-run fusion sushi joint. I was sorely mistaken!\n\nYou walk into a very classy layout here. They have the color scheme and materials theme down pat. The restaurant is huge with seating for plenty, including a couple of nice Asian-style party rooms with pictures of Tokyo on the wall. They remind me of karaoke places in Japan. The huge bar combines both a standard bar and a sushi bar and faces off with three TVs.\n\nOn to the food, I was totally blown away! They had some excellent sushi combinations. The Fantastic Roll speaks for itself with deep fried lobster and mango topped with filet mignon slices and a tonkatsu dipping sauce. And if you couldn't already tell I like lobster, the Lobster Explosion Roll and Roppongi Roll go without saying. Think of it like replacing the shrimp tempura in most rolls with some sweet fried deliciousness.\n\nOn a side note, servers and chefs here are great and very service oriented. They stick to the classy theme and provide informative service despite the fact the restaurant just opened. I highly recommend going here! I've been back three times already!
