Service is friendly, but the price is too steep for food that can be hit-or-miss. Here's the lowdown ~ \n\nI RECOMMEND:\n-- Uni Nigiri. It looked great and tasted fresh.\n-- Rock Shrimp aka one of the best orders of honey walnut shrimp I've ever had. The batter was unbelievably light and crispy, the sauce was balanced, and the cranberries were a great addition.\n\nI'D SKIP:\n-- Chu Toro. It looked sloppy and it was average quality.\n-- Beef Teriyaki Lunch Special. It comes with a lot, but it wasn't done well. Both the teriyaki and the salad dressing had too much of a raw onion flavor that was overpowering. The tempura was not much better. The batter was too heavy, while the vegetables had too much bite.\n\nCLOSE RUNNER UPS:\n-- Clam Miso Soup with mushrooms. While good, I don't think the quality justified the price.\n-- Sashimi Rice Bowl Lunch Special. Presentation-wise, it was beautiful with the different colors of different fish, ikura, micro greens, and radish. Flavor was decent and fish quality was average.\n\nOverall, this place was just okay. I expect better quality for the price, and the food here is too hit-or-miss to have me rushing back.
