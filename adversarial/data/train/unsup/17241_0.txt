Before you read this 1-star review I want to say that the place is well decorated and food is well presented (just the look), just to be fair.\n\nHere is the part that I highly recommend that you should AVOID this place, and I truly hope no one gets the bitter experience me and my wife had.\n\nWe ordered the 5-course menu since it is \"very popular\" and highly recommended according to the waiter.\n\nDeep fried appetizer, deep fried shrimp, a pot of beef with half a pot of grease. We were so grossed out just after having the appetizers and we can't have a bite on the main course, it is just way too much grease!!\n\nOk we have all got bad dishes but we can easily just complain and replace, especially when the dishes are untouched! But no, things get more disgusting from here.\n\nWe explain to the waiter that a set course should be balanced and this is just too gross. We want to switch these two main dishes (that we barely touched) to two light vegetable dishes and expect we simply pay the set course's price, not to mention the vegetable dishes are cheaper.\n\n\"From a business standpoint, since you have had the appetizer already, you should pay for the 5-course order.\", \"Do you want to take it to go?\"\n\nSounds nice? Ok this is what it sounds like to me:\n\n\"Even we give you crap, you should pay as the menu says, if you can't bear to have them all on the table, we will be happy to wrap it up so you can enjoy it at home.\"\n\nARE YOU KIDDING ME? This a $20 per dish restaurant and I had the expectation that they put customer's satisfaction on the top. We have been to average places that replaces your dish simply if you don't like it without giving you this \"from the business point of view\" crap.\n\nAfter back and forth we got tired and give up, trying to pay and leave, no left-over take out, no dish switching.\n\nOh the story is not ended yet.\n\nOur bill is $60 and the waiter gave us a $110 bill. So he think I will just pay whatever he throw at me without noticing there is a bunch of crap he added to the bill that we didn't order?\n\nAgain, the story is not ended YET!\n\nAfter giving us the \"right\" bill, he insist that we try their complimentary dessert, a green tea pastry he described.\n\nMy wife took a bite and almost threw up at the table (well there was nothing to throw up since we didn't have any real food). The \"pastry\" is full of PORK. And my wife don't eat pork.\n\n At the end of this visit, we paid for the dishes, only had the appetizers (spring-rolls), and total disgusted by their attitude and way of \"business\".\n\nI highly value people's opinions on Yelp because I trust them every time i go to a restaurant. I hope this review serves as a warning sign.
