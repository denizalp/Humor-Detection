I am not really sure what Adria R.'s problem is, maybe she was smoking a bowl as her remark was in bad taste and not the food.  I eat here on an almost daily basis and can not get enough of the lunch specials (priced from $5 to $6, especially the L03 (shrimp and chicken combo)  which comes with a healthy helping of freshly stirred meat, veggies and choice of white or brown rice. You also have the choice of a drink or soup with that lunch special.  Other times I will just order the chicken rice soup or the chicken nuggets which are moist and ABCDelicious!  On average I eat there about five days a week and I don't gain weight but it leaves you feeling full but not like your going to bust a gut which is perfect.  Even my daughter who was staying with me for a few weeks could not get enough and she wanted to take some back to Vegas as she can not find food like this out there that tastes this good.  I refer everybody over there and the consensus from them is a 5 star rating and they go back for more!\nI would not focus so much on the rare one star reviews that like to inject drug innuendos on a delivery guys looks, that is callous and vain and speaks bounds to Adria and her up in the air nose attitude.  As a matter of fact just ignore the little girl and go in and try the Grace Garden yourself.  You will love it!
