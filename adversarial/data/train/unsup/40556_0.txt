My favourite place to get poke in markham, although they don't really call it poke.  It's named the Tsuki Don and consists of salmon, purple rice, avocado (my fave), seaweed, crab meat and Japanese mayo.  Normally the Tsuki Don has an assorted selection of raw fish but I only get it with salmon (beware though, they add an extra charge of 3 dollars to change it).  \n\nThe other things I get here are ok.  It's your typical Izakaya affair.  My friend got the Oyster Kaki, which was deep fried and battered oysters.  It was a heavier dish, but what you expect from what you order.\n\nTsuki Don is the best though.
