The Farm: First impression so cute! You enter and immediately want to have a picnic but luckily there are picnic benches for days. There is a map of the layout of the farm to navigate through their amenities definitely suggest a nice stroll before or even after your meal. I would give this part of my experience 5\/5\n\nFood: The carrot cake was highly recommended but just FYI the baker just had a baby and the carrot cake will not be available until she returns. We went to the sandwich and salad shop and ordered the Tuscan sandwich and slice of pecan pie. This was quite a pricey sandwich it was $11.95 so I was looking forward to the execution and ingredients of the sandwich for the price. The sandwich was lacking in flavor and was disappointing in the ratio of thick focaccia bread to the ingredients which made the sandwich too dry. The focaccia bread also was tough to bite into with an expectation of being much softer it seemed like the bread came right out of the refrigerator.  I would have enjoyed the sandwich more if it was toasted and salt\/seasoning levels improved. The slice of pecan pie was enjoyable not overly sweet and enjoyed its custard like filling. This food part of my experience was a 3\/5 there is a lot of potential for improving their sandwiches.
