Met my sister who was in town for a convention at the Westin for a late Sunday night dinner.\nI ordered the turkey meatball slider with marinara sauce and prosecco .  She ordered the turkey meatball panini with smoked Gouda.  I also ordered the Parmesan herb fries  and this order was enough to share. We both enjoyed our meals.  The staff was helpful and attentive. The menu was unique.  Loved this place and I will return.
