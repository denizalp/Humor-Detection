We had Stumpy's on vacation\nIn Phoenix over Thanksgiving. They are right down the road from our hotel (Hilton Pointe) and my husband went for pick-up after we came down with the crud on our last day there. \n\nI had a single slice, and my husband and son devoured the rest of the pizza. One month later, my husband is STILL talking about that pizza. It is the sauce that is compared to all others. Even the local Italian joint suffers in comparison. \n\nSo if you want to get a pizza that you'll be talking about weeks, even months later, go to Stumpy's. I can't vouch for the service or even the other food, but the pizza will be once in a lifetime.
