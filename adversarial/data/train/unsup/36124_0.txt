I recently had a prenatal massage with Glenn as I received a coupon from CISaves for Mother's Day. It was my first time there, but not in the building itself. The building is old, but that is in no way a reflection of the service received at Body Therapy. It was pretty hot in the room itself, especially for an 8 month pregnant woman, but other than that, the message was fantastic. He has been in the business for almost 30 years, so he clearly knows what he's doing. I will definitely go back to him and refer him and the center to others.
