Trente-Cinq was such a surprisingly great experience. We had the Croquettes de crevettes for an appetizer which was nicely done (and more importantly not overdone). The two croquettes were a creamy and exceptionally good and these were served with a very light mixed green salad - the perfect dish to get your taste buds looking for more. Then came the entrees...we ordered the Steamed Mussels and Lamb Shank. The Steamed Mussels were by far the best tasting mussels I've ever had and the Lamb Shank was falling off the bone. When they brought the Steamed Mussels, they did not skimp on the portion size. This is an excellent dish to share with a group. The Lamb Shank melted in your mouth as was nicely served along with a vegetable ragout and couscous. The meal was perfect and they have a nice wine selection to accompany the meals quite well. The chef used to work at Coup De Tart in Phoenix, and I can certainly see why he started his own restaurant. Please check this restaurant out while you're in Phoenix, as Mr. Lionel Geuskens deserves the visitors with his excellent cuisine!!! 5 Stars!!!!
