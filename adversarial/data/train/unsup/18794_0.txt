I was talking about this place for a while and received a gift card for my birthday so decided to stop in for breakfast. We were the first ones to arrive at 7:30 and had our choice of tables. I did notice they were extremely close together so when it gets busy that may be an issue for some. \n\nOur server quickly brought over water and coffee which is always appreciated. We started with an order of monkey bread and after so many good reviews I ordered the pork belly benedict. My other half chose the breakfast burrito. The monkey bread was served warm with a melted cinnamon type sauce. \n\nThe main entrees came out a little while later. After about 3 bites of my bene my nose started to run. The jalape√±o hollandaise was extremely hot and spicy, way too much for me for early in the morning. It was just too overpowering drowning out the eggs and pork belly. I had to scrape it all off to finish the rest of it. My other half said his breakfast burrito was dry inside and needed some sort of sauce. The potatoes on both however were good. \n\nThe check came and it was $42. I left the $50 gift card and we began to leave. This is where the problem started. \n\nAs we reached the door the waitress stopped us and said we couldn't use the balance for the tip. The gentleman at the register (The chef I presume?) said the gift card could only be used for food. Since we didn't have any cash we had to buy a pastry and then add the tip to that. Ridiculous. I have used gift cards from everywhere from Mimis and Carrabba's to Flemings and Roy's and have always used the balance for the tip. Gift cards are the same as cash so whats the problem?\n\nI wanted to leave 2 stars as I have had much better, however our service was good as well as the pastries so I will leave 3. The issue with the gift card really turned me off to this place.
