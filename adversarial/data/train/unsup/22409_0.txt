Song Cook's have to be one of the nicest Korean\/Chinese Restaurant I have been to.\n\nWhen I was greeted by this young Korean man that speak perfect English asking if I want to sit at the table or at the warm seating platform, I know it will be different from the other places I visit.\n\nPrices wise, I am surprise how affordable the prices are. All the items are priced under $10!! \n\nAnd this place is perfect for solo diner like me that could not make up their mind since they have 1 person Combo!! Now I can try more than 1 dish without stuffing myself crazy or paying double the price!\n\nHalf JaJangMyun + Half ChamPong (Veg, beef, black bean sauce on noodles & spicy seafood noodle soup) - $8.50\n- the portions are huge!! I was full after eating the soup noodles...\n- Spicy Seafood broth was quite spicy and rich.. not that waterdown version.. definitely have a nice kick to it..\n- The seafood though is really small... baby versions of everything... shmrips, squids and mussels\n- The Korean version of the black bean sauce noodles was good too. Not too salty with a lot of onions inside.. if you don't like eating onions, you might have to skip this dish.. and of course more raw onion on the side if you want extra!\n- Noodle are Homemade... a little chewy with a lot of bite... really light not floury at all.\n\nAll the waitstaffs at Song Cook's speaks perfect English so you will have no problem asking questions about the menu... and if you want to practice your Korean too, you are more than welcome. They are all polite and helpful... + 1 star to that!!\n\nNo lunch Specials though... but with their price, the quality of their food and services and the nice deco... they don't need lunch specials to bring in the crowds!\n\nThey accepts Amex, Mastercard, Visa and Interac.
