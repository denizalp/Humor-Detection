If you have ever had ramen in So Cal (Santouka and Shin-Sen-Gumi Hakata for example), you'd know this place does not measure up at all.  \n\nMy Miso Ramen was thick and salty.  It was more like gravy than soup.  My fiance's Gyoza tasted like they were bought from the asian supermarket.  While the botton was cooked, the top was still cold.  \n\nBad choice for dinner.
