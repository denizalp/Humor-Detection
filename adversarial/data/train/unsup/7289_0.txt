That was a spicy meatball! \n\nI had the meatball sub and it was an explosion of happy in my mouth. The bun was toasted and the meatballs and sauce were delicious. For 6 dollars how can you beat this deal? The owner is friendly and a native Italian. HIs wife and him work the place. \n\nCheers to him and his meatballs.\n\nDamn it was good.
