I am a FTR slut. \n(First to review.)\nSure all the glory that comes from being the first to review is great, but more importantly I enjoy scouring the site for awesome places that nobody has written about yet. This is a great example. Not only was AlphaGraphics prompt to process my order, but they also tweaked paper choices slightly and quantities to ensure I came in under budget. And speaking of prompt, from the time I placed my order, it was a speedy 24 hours before I had my prints in hand. Printers rarely get love because let's be honest, who thinks, \"I should really write a review for that place that printed some work fliers\" but I gotta tell you, the info is so instrumental when making an informed decision. How did I settle on this place with no reviews as far as the eye could see? A recommendation from a biz owner I trust. \nWord of mouth wins!
