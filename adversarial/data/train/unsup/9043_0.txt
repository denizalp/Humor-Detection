The emperor has no clothes!\n\nThis is one of the most favorably reviewed highly touted coffee houses in Toronto.\n\nI drink a lot of espresso house coffee, love my coffee, and know my coffee.\n\nThis joint is all pretension - zero delivery.\n\nI got the house's favored preparation method (pour over) on their featured star rare opportunity coffee of the day.\n\nThe ritual of making the coffee was beautiful to watch.\n\nThe coffee was served in a beautiful matched set of a custom designed wood board with a coffee snifter and a glass turkish style pourer.\n\n(A fantastic decorating idea for your sideboard)\n\nThe coffee had overtones of void, with subtle undercurrents of zero and nothing.\n\nIt was a beautiful cup of brown water.\n\nWorse still - the beautiful glass decanter made the coffee cool to room temperature in about 90 seconds.\n\nSo I was drinking room temperature water the whole time.\n\nNow it was obvious from talking to the barista that he truly values a very light coffee with almost no body -\n\nand getting this glass full of emptiness was a positive accomplishment on his part.\n\ni can make hot water at home.
