I decided to forgo waiting in line due to the 100+ degree day last Friday and ordered ahead (kudos to those who brave the heat!). I arrived at 10:30am and there was already a long line and people waiting in chairs they had brought from home. \nThe online ordering process was easy and LMB sent email reminders.  They do require a 5 pound minimum to preorder. The sliced brisket is insanely perfect! Pulled pork was delicious yet lean. The beef ribs were a huge hit as well. I went with a quart of each of the sides and don't regret that decision. The jalape√±o grits could speak to any true southerner's heart! The ranch style beans were surprisingly delicious considering I'm accustomed to the \"typical\" barbecue style beans (think Ina Garten style). Potato salad was just meh, I would nix that in the future. The coleslaw was very crisp and not overly sauced. \nThe pecan pie was delicious, but you could tell it's not a homemade crust (1 pie will feed up to 4 people if you're feeling very generous I recommend 1 pie for 2 people). I have to admit I'm a pie crust snob hailing from the Midwest I grew up with only homemade crust. \nThe customer service was great. I recommend giving Little Miss BBQ a try!
