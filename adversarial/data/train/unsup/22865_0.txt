Taco y Taco. Every Friday. Sometimes on Monday. Or if I'm having a rough day at work it doesn't matter what day it is, my car can practically drive itself there. My obsession? An Al Pastor burrito. Add on a side of chips and an cold bottle of real Coke, some cups of salsa from the salsa bar and life is instantly better. \n\nOrdering if you're unfamiliar with the place can be frustrating. But that is the only thing negative I can say about the place. The staff is super friendly, you have lots of different choices, and the price is good. But for me the Al Pastor burrito is just so over the top good...it keeps me coming back again and again and again...and I'm craving it as I sit here writing this updated review! \n\n5 Stars! The pile of receipts in my car makes it clear they deserve no less.
