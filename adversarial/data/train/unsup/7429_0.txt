Phenomenal shawarma, freshly made to order falafel. \n\nAssad's is a small grocery store with two tables out front when you walk in and a smattering of smaller tables in the store. Once you walk inside you see the kitchen area off to your left and the expected aisles of middle eastern spices and groceries. Ordering is a breeze just head over to the counter and let the cashier know what your heart desires (chicken shawarma, with tomatos, pickle, tahini sauce, and garlic sauce) and watch as it is put together. I've had shawarma in many middle eastern countries and other large US cities, and I can comfortably say Assad's is still one of the best. It is always exceptionally fresh, and the quantity of food you will get in one shawarma will have you looking for your bed. I normally have to get two shawarma sandwiches at other establishments to feel satisfied, I only made that mistake at Assad's the first time I went, since then I only get one.\n\nPricing is fair, quality and quantity of the food is awesome. The ambience isn't great, but it's a grocery store what did you expect. Owners and staff are very polite and helpful.
