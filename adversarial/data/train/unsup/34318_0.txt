Called to order a small pizza and was convinced by the trainee on the phone to get their deal which is a  large pizza and then you get another for 30 cents. They deliver a large pizza, charge us full price and when I called back to ask where the 2nd pizza was, they said we didn't order the second one. \n\nCalled to ask why we didn't get our 2nd pizza as sold to us and as advertised on TV, the manager Kevin would do nothing to fix the problem and was completely rude and clueless to boot.\n\nMediocre food and terrible service from this location. Hasn't been my first time here but will be the last. Order elsewhere, there are a dozen other pizza places nearby and they're all multitudes better than this place.
