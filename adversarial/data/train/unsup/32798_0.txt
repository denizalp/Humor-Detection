This is absolutely my favorite place for sushi hands down.\nIf you have seen the documentary, Jiro Dreams of Sushi, you will definitely appreciate this restaurant.\n\nI went last summer just before word got out about their sublime sushi, back then you could get a reservation for 4 just two weeks ahead, but I'm sure the wait is much longer now.\nAs probably have read there are only 10 seats in the restaurant with only two seatings per night, so the sushi chefs could really hone in on their attention to detail and craft some of the freshest and most delicious sushi I have tried in a long, long time.\nThe place is sleek, modern and minimal, a casual and very comfortable place that doesn't distract from the food and service. I really like the cut crystal-like glass serving trays which really elevates and make the sushi morsels stand out.\n\n$80 for 18 pieces of sushi is reasonable in my opinion considering the quality and preparation -- there are no trendy gimmicks here which is great if you are a sushi purist. I also consider watching the three sushi chefs preparing the sushi a performance that's part of the great dining experience. They know how to highlight the taste of the fish and each piece had its own characteristic.\nThe service was great even though their English is not very good. The three sushi chefs work in almost zen-like quietness crafting each piece of sushi with grace and attention, they will often try to engage in conversation with the diners even though they may not fully understand the English. My water glass was always filled right away and I fell in love with a rare sake that was recommended to me -- the waitress managed to pick the perfect sake for me based on the flavor profiles I was looking for which took some time to explain what I wanted.\nThe amount of food for this omakase meal was just perfect for me, if you are still hungry for more they will make more pieces for you with the limited amount of fish they have on hand for a little extra, though they shop many times a week specifically for each dinner seating.\n\nThe black sesame ice cream to end the meal was very good and I like the creamy rich sesame flavours which pleasantly nutty and toasty. The grey colour of the ice cream was both unusual and really stunning to look at -- I want to paint a room that colour!
