Very good Italian food so close to my house, really enjoyed my dinner here.\n\nStarted dinner with octopus salad (not on the menu but was special on that day). Really loved that tangy salad dressing. Portion size is large, could possibly just have that for dinner. Good octopus should have nice texture and theirs had that. \n\nI was going to have pasta but decided to go with gnocchi after seeing the list of cheese they use. Gnocchi was prepared perfect. Combination of cheese and quality cheese with nice texture of gnocchi made this dish so good. \n\nCasual ambiance, fancy price, excellent service and great food. I couldn't drink on this particular night I came in but a table next me had a bottle of wine. Based on wine glass I saw, I am looking forward to coming back to pair my dinner with a nice glass of red wine.
