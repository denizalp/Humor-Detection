The staff is one of the most friendly we have ever encountered. From the moment you walk in, you are made to feel welcome, and the kids are happy, at ease, and comfortable. Dr Blacker is very soft spoken and gentle with the children. We are very happy with this office and plan to use them again when our third child needs braces.
