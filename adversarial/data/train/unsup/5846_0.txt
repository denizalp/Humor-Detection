My late birthday was held here last night -- 10 adults 2 children. The bill came out to be 330$ and we tipped 50$. The service was awesome - always on top of our refills, changing out our hot plates and dealing with the two erratic children pacing around the whole restaurant, but the food was Meh... \n\nI've been to an AYCE Korean BBQ (Tofu Hut) before and prefer their meat than what meat we tasted here. And the prices are MUCH cheaper there than here. The sushi was not good and so plain. The one thing my boyfriend and I liked the most was the soup -- mine being the beef raddish soup and his the kimchi soup. The dessert section was small as well as their salad bar. \n\nFor the price per head it was, and even the kids being charged 13$ per child, I was highly disappointed...
