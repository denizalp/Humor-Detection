Okay.   A new executive chef and a new brunch menu at this location.  Whereas we were always blown away before, the menu changes are a little uninspiring.   No more lobster egg pancakes or jalape√±o PBJ.  Now, we have a few far reaching choices that actually reach too far -  but just unconvinced about cauliflower tacquitos and oyster tacos.  The creative nods lean more to the Latin inspired non-breakfast dishes.   If Chef would dial back the more lunch-y creative options back to brunch, it would improve to previous levels perhaps.   Maybe a first timer would enjoy it more, but we were let down.   Plates come out quickly and menu is more accessible, but Border Grill didn't need either of those things from our diners' perspective.  Other brunch options will now be able to compete.   We could never duplicate a jalapeno PBJ anywhere.  Now, no one needs to.  If it's not broke, don't fix it.
