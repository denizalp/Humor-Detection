This is a one of a kind burger joint. Very unique. The atmosphere as soon as you walk in is very relaxed and the workers are so friendly and kind you can't help but be infected by their happiness. On top of great customer service the burgers truly are delicious and spectacular and are not to compare to your typical American burger they have an Asian flare to them that is to have you coming back for more. Try the jazz fries!
