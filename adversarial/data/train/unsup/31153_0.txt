I don't care if this place stinks, I don't care that it's probably filled with frat guys looking for a fight and 50c beers on certain nights of the week, and equally as much I don't care that they serve $2.83 (or whatever it is) well long islands\/margaritas\/etc. The only reason I come here is for wings and fries. Something about their wings puts them in a category above everywhere else in Phoenix for me (except other Vine T\/E's). I know plenty of people that don't like them but to me they absolutely dominate Native\/BWW\/ whatever you want to throw out there. Nice and crispy, tangy sauce, and cheap during happy hour every night of the week. Throw in the fries which I think are the best I've had in Arizona (not saying much) and I'm a huge fan. Cheap, dirty, and delicious. If this place was nicer and had a better vibe to it (or maybe the rest of the food came close to matching the wings\/fries) I could throw in the 5th star but as of now it gets a quality 4 star, just make sure you know what you're getting into.
