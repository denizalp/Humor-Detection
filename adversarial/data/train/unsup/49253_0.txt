Thank you Wolfgang Puck for opening this bar and grill that is open late! I went to visit Las Vegas Saturday through Monday and decided to see a late night show on Sunday evening. I was shocked to find that not many restaurants are open passed midnight. There are plenty of fast food restaurants but when in Vegas, my husband and I want to experience different and unique places (not your standard fast food). Luckily this bar and grill is open late and provided the exact solution we were looking for! \n\nWe ordered a pizza and the half jidori chicken plate. We didn't say we were sharing but it was so nice of the staff to split our plates evening. This created a simple and small touch but really left a lasting impression. It's the simple things that go along way! Overall they were both absolutely delicious. We didn't expect the chicken to be so tender and flavorful - it was so fantastic we couldn't stop talking about this dish days later. Definitely recommend! Don't get me wrong, the pizza was good too - but the chicken was so delightful! \n\nTurns out that because we enjoyed our experience so much and know they're open late - we will be visiting again and can't wait to do so!
