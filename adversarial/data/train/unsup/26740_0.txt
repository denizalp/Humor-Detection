My wife and I ate here on on a cold Friday night. When we came, there were customers sitting down but actually waiting for their takeout hehe. I've heard this place is a hotspot for Hawaiian locals living in Vegas  who miss the good chinese food back home. This resto does remind me of the chinese restos back home in hawaii and the food is the same too which is great. We had the Beef with Vegetable Chow Mein ($9.95), Wonton Soup ($6.95), and General Tsao's Chicken ($9.99). The wonton soup was good. The Chow Mein was ok but Im glad they ask your preference if you want the sauce on the side (dry style) or wet. The chicken was best thing we ate. It was a little sweet and little spicy with a bed of steamed broccoli. I've tried this place before and had their oxtail soup and beef with bitter melon which were great.  I love coming here for the nostalgia of Hawaiian style Chinese food and will definitely come back to try their other dishes.
