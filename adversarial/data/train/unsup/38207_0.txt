I went to Elements Massage a couple of weeks ago because I had a card for a free 30 min massage or pay $26 to upgrade to a 55min so I thought, why not? I have been massaged at a lot of different places but let me tell you, Sarah has been one of the best experiences so far. She got deep into the muscles and I found myself feeling a lot more relaxed after the session. I am on my back, knees, and sides a lot for my job and sometimes my neck and other spots become very tight so this was such a relief! Thank you Sarah I feel so much better and I will definitely be a returning customer!
