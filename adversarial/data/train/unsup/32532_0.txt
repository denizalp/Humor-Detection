Kudos to Samantha,the manager of the north Scottsdale Target!!  She went out of her way to help me with a return that had been credited for an amount $145 less than it should have been.  She was polite and respectful, and handled the correction quickly and efficiently.  I was very impressed, and will recommend Target to anyone who needs good quality, stylish merchandise and a generous, honest return policy!
