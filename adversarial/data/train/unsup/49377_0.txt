We arrived around 910 pm for my birthday. We tried to order some of the speciality drinks from the bar and were then told that they don't make those after 9 pm bc they are too complicated.  But we could order a pitcher of one of them? Came from out of town to go to whiskey row. I am very disappointed and sad to say that I will not return. On the bright side we went across the street to El Hefe and we helped right away and served anything we wanted to order.
