Date & Time of visit: Sunday, August 06, 2017 @ 7:00pm-8:20pm\nAtmosphere: Tiny, Fast Paced - In & Out eatery.\nCleanliness: Restaurant appeared to be clean, however the cushioned seating had food debris on it. Cutlery, plates and glasses were clean.\nConstructive criticism: Wipe down the cushioned seating.\nCuisine: Italian\nFacilities: Did not visit the facilities.\nFood: My fianc√© ordered the Misticanza salad to start. It came with shaved fennel, radish, mixed greens, orange, and fresh dill, excellent size portion. I ordered the Roasted Radicchio salad. It came with fruit, greens, toasted almond, and white wine vinaigrette. Excellent size portion, dressing was the right amount, and flavorful. \n\nFor our mains, we both ordered the large size (6 squares) Soppressata pizza. On the pizza was: spicy soppressata, crushed tomato sauce, Fior di Latte, and fresh basil. The flavor wasn't bad at all. You're not going to get that authentic Italian sauce which nonna makes. Unfortunatly, it was just ok. The pizza could use more flavor. Romania pizza, is usually deep dish in style, so this replicated the roman style pizza fairly. The fior di latte cheese was good. \nSince we were there on a Sunday, Levetto has a free desert special! We chose the Panna Cotta. A seasonal compote, crumbled amaretti cookie, with cinnamon. It was delicious!\n\n\nLikeliness of returning or recommending to others: We look forward to coming back with our little guy since the menu can be child friendly. Sadly this location of Levetto is not equipped for large groups. We heard about Levetto buy browsing College St. Pizzerias on Yelp.com.\nParking: conveniently located in front of the restaurant on the main road. Since it was Sunday after 5pm, parking was free\/\nPortion Sizes: Satisfied. We left feeling content! \nPrice: Good. 2 salads, 1 alcoholic beverage, and 2 entre pizza's, came out to approx. $65.00\nService: When we arrived, we were greeted by the waiter who sat us. Server was friendly and quick to help.\nSelection: Good. The menu offered just the right amount of items. Not overwhelming, and all items looked delicious.\nWhat makes this restaurant stand out from the others: It looks like a fast eatery. In and out.\nHours of Operation: Sunday - Thursday: 11am-10pm and Friday & Saturday: 11am - 11pm\n(this is for the College street location only)\nWebsite: Levetto.com
