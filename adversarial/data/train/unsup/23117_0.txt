We made a visit as I had a severe sweet tooth after dinner. I wanted two scoops of ice cream, I chose strawberry cheesecake and mint chocolate chip in a waffle cone. It was really good and hit the spot as I knew it would. Mmmm classic ice cream full of yummy rich goodness! Also picked up two pints of classic pralines and cream to take home. The staff is super friendly and offered samples.
