I was reluctant to come here because our past experiences with other restaurants in this location have been horrible. BUT this is so enjoyable. We came on Monday for lunch and I ordered the hamburger. It was on special for $7.00 and that was a steal. It puts Ted's Montana Grill's $15 burgers to shame!! My husband got the gyro plate and that was incredibly flavorful. The salad that came with his meal was fresh - the olives and feta cheese were over the top delicious. Our waitress was friendly and efficient and keep our glasses full. Thank you for a wonderful dinning experience.  We will be back
