Went visiting some relatives out here in sin city and we decided to take our little cousins somewhere fun! \n\n\nThis place is a treat! They had a great deal going where it was unlimited games for $12.99 (not including the ones that gives tickets) and that was perfect for us. Ended up getting one for each kids and set them loose. Plenty of games to play and they had this esports center that had  game consoles and tons of gaming pcs to play. \n\n\nI also would love to point out the surrounding area had plenty of food options and shops also a movie theatre! Great place to go if you want to escape the craziness of the strip!
