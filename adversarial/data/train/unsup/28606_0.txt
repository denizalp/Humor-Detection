Amazing food. We ordered catering for a very large dinner party (70 people), and everyone was raving about the food. It took a while to negotiate our order and the menu, but they provided a fair price, and prompt delivery service. The baklava arrived warm! Highly recommend La Shish Kabob for any catering services. Will definitely visit the restaurant soon. Also, the portions are very large, so if ordering for catering, plan to have plenty of left overs.
