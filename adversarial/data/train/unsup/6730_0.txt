$29.97 for a wash\/blow dry WITH Brush and a trim of my ends (this part was requested) versus the $19.97 online. \n\nI was told that the $19.97 included a wash\/BLOWDRY\/cut no brush can be used. \n\nIn order to get a flatiron I'd have to pay $49.97 then $14 for the cut. \n\nI booked online, checked in online, announced myself as the web told me to and was asked again at the shampoo bowl what service did I want. I said the wash\/blowdry\/cut. I ensured we were using the handheld dryer and not the seated hooded dryer and after seating me in the chair wet.... that's when the prices went left. \n\nI couldn't just leave because I was wet. \nI was told these changes went into effect in October. \nThis should have been disclosed at consult and I would have opted out. \nSo, here I am: a survey and a tweet later....warning y'all on Yelp. \n\nP.S. I'm all natural and don't have $30 worth of hair to cut. Hashtag: you can laugh.
