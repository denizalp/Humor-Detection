I had the best lunch today at Bodega 13!! The baby kale salad was delicious and just the right size.  Since it was my birthday I splurged and got the Tahitian Pearl which was beyond amazing!! The food was so fresh and yummy but the icing on the cake was Lauren.  What an amazing waitress!! The wait staff has EVERYTHING to do with how good a restaurant is and Lauren was top notch.  She was attentive and friendly and gorgeous to boot! You won't be disappointed so get out and give Bodega 13 a try - and if you can get Lauren's table, go for it!!
