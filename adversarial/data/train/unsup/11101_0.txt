Recently I was talking to a friend about how much I enjoyed eating at Harley's Italian Bistro when the restaurant participated in Dining Out For Life. He looked at me blankly and then it finally clicked. \"I totally forgot about that place!\" he said.\n\nIt seems that many people may have the same reaction because during several recent visits many tables sat empty, even on a Friday night. Let me just say, you're missing out.\n\nIt's understandable that Harley's has been voted some of the Valley's best Italian food for several years in a row the food is delicious, comforting and affordable. The sauces are made in house, carrying on a tradition of from scratch recipes dating back from the Roman Table days, if you can remember that far back.\n\nOwners Lynn and Mike McGarry have recently updated the space with new artwork and fresh paint, but the friendliness of the staff is unchanged.\n\nThe food is simple and uncomplicated. Roasted Garlic & Cream Cheese Bruschetta ($8) is bread, cheese, garlic, tomatoes and basil, then finished with a bit of olive oil. Nothing masked or hidden, the flavors of the creamed cheeses and garlic are tasty. I only wish that the tomatoes had been ripened a bit longer, as they weren't as tender as they could have been.\n\nSalsiccie Alla Vodka ($13) starts with farfalle pasta combined with sweet Italian sausage, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, onions that are tossed in a vodka gorgonzola cream sauce. This bowl left me reaching for more of the house made bread to pick up the remains of the sauce.\n\nWhen you visit Harley's Bistro's Web site you can sign up for e-mails about nightly specials. For instance, Thursday nights are getting to be known for Lasagna ($10), a thick slab of layered pasta sheets, sausage, cheese and ricotta all baked up hot and bubbly. If I had an Italian grandmother, I'd hope she'd cook just like this, comfort and joy.\n\nAvailable for dinner only Thursday through Sunday, Harley's also serves a mean Hand-Tossed Pizza (small $10\/large $13). The crust comes out pale, but the chewy texture makes up for the lack of color. The many toppings include tender meatballs and juicy sausage, paired up with a choice of sauces, including one of my favorites, creamy alfredo. You can't go wrong here.\n\nDesserts include the usual suspects, such as Cannoli ($5), Tiramisu ($6.50) and Cheesecake ($5.50). After eating so much, we just shared a few selections of Berto's Ice Cream ($6.50) Pistachio Tartufo and Lemon Strawberry Sorbet. I wish that these had been served in a bowl rather than on a plate with chocolate syrup and whipped cream; some things are just better plain.\n\nFood this tasty should never be forgotten.
