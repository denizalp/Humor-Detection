This converted rec center has a huge indoor play area with a good number of nicely sized party rooms. \n\nThe play area is dominated by a large padded and net screened jungle gym with many paths, entrances and exits, and mulitlevels. There is good line of sight for parents to locate or watch their child anywhere at play.\n\nThe kids absolutely loved it and ran wild. The party was good and we were treated to an early bedtime for the little one who was completely tired out on the way home.
