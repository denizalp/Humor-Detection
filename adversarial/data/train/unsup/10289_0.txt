So, I wanted to go to Thara Thai, but the owners have closed it for a week.  My friend Liz and I were starving, and Real Hacienda was next door.\n\nFirst off--Real Hacienda?  As in the other ones are fake?  Or this one is Royal?  I don't know.\n\nThe ambiance is....different.  It's got some cute, gaudily painted chairs that belong in a Loteria game, and the booths were comfily familiar to any other C-U area Mexican establishment.\n\nHowever, the food was pretty good.  It was a step up from Dos Reales, and a little under El Toro.  The servers were friendly and attentive, and it was a place where, perhaps because it was relatively empty that night, you coudl just chat, en espanol, with the serve staff, and with your friend and pretend you lived in Southern California.\n\nFun times.
