I would give it 3 star but THE GARBAGE SMELL forced me to reduce to two stars.\n\nI'm sure it's fine on other nights, but on a Thursday night (I'm assuming the night before College St garbage collection) this place reeked of garbage throughout the whole bar. Gross.\n\nOtherwise, I was expecting some kind of music playing but it was very quiet on a Thursday. \n\nThey do have lots of whiskey variety on the menu. Place is dark and cosy, old school decor, awesome ice buckets just screaming for you to slip them into your handbag and take home. \n\nService was great - very quick considering we walked in with 30+ people and I managed to get a few drinks without having to wait long at the bar.
