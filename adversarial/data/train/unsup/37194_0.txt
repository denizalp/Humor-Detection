This place has great prices, huge portions, and delicious food. We really enjoyed eating here. The service was friendly and fast too. We were very pleased with the sweet and sour chicken, Mongolian beef, orange chicken and the raw salmon sushi we got. The egg rolls could use something other than cabbage in them and my husband thought the Las Vegas roll was missing something. On our trip to Phoenix we have had terrible service almost everywhere we have gone. This hole-in-the-wall Chinese place was the best by far.
