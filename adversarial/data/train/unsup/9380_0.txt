Cool English place on Central Ave downtown. Once you walk into the bar, there is English memorabilia all over the joint, it almost feels like you are in an English Pub. Great brews on tap as well. Thursday nights are trivia night, which are a fun time. I ordered an English kebab which was seasoned and tasty (English version of a gyro). My friend had ordered the Cornish Pastie and couldn't stop raving about it. Overall, we had a good experience and would definitely come again.
