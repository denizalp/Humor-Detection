Outstanding dinner.  I rarely want to shell out this kinda dough on cooked fish but this is a place I make an exception for.  I imagine most of these reviews are 4 stars because they ONLY did happy hour :)\n\nOur server was really friendly and a wealth of information on all the cuts of fish and after some hemming and hawwwing...we went with the Maine lobster roll and tuna tartare for appetizers.  Both were excellent!  The lobster roll was more like a lobster salad tostada and I savored every freakin bite.  My wife's tartare was just as good and she deemed it the best tuna tartare she's ever had.  That says ALOT!!\n\nWe went with the waiters recommendations for entrees and got the Tasmanian ocean trout baked in sea salt and the mustard-marinated black cod.  Amazing cod!!!  I assume for Yelper, Seth Y, that this dish was the one that gave him his \"mental erection\".  The trout was great too but I couldn't get enough of the butteryness of the cod...truly worth coming back for.  \n\nThank god we didn't order any sides because we would've had no room for them.  The entrees came with some small sides on the plate and that was more than enough.  \n\nStill had time before we were off for Viva Elvis so we got the Valrhona Chocolate Custard (aka the red velvet dessert thingy) which was the perfect ending for a fantastic meal.
