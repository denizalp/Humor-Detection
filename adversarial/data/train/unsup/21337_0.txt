Always wanted to try this place  on Cactus and tonight we did. Never again. Nothing like I expected--guess I didn't know the type of place it was.\nEverything served in styrofoam and plastic utensils. Ordered a tamale and a cheese enchilada. Could not differentiate which was which or if there even were two items.  There was not a single Mexican person in the place, Guess they knew. No thanks....
