Public school is a great spot. Are usually stay at the red rock just around the corner, so I make a point of coming by whenever I can. It's a little tricky to find, up the escalators in an outdoor shopping mall. But once you get in there, the food, the people, and the atmosphere are fantastic. They have a great selection of beer on tap, plenty of food options for all different types of nutritional needs, and the general good time! I came here on my birthday back in November, and they were so friendly to me! I've had both the burger as well as several of the appetizers, and all are very good.
