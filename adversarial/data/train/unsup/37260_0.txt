Stopped for a double date with some friends and we enjoyed our food.\n\nAfter we ate, we chatted for a bit and sipped on our drinks. As I sipped on my drink, a random waiter came to our table, asked if I wanted a refill, and when I declined, he walked away. He didn't even ask the rest of our table if they wanted drinks, enough though they were the ones who actually needed drinks. My friends and I laughed about it after, but it was definitely an unprofessional move.
