'Nellies with Pearls'\n\nWelcome to Mission Diner\n(good ridence to the nasty Nellies on 4th)\n\nNot a lot has changed as far as the menu goes.\nYou can still order a scramble or have your banana pancakes and the price has stayed the same. (low-reasonable)\nThe positive new change is they have taken the 'nasty' out of this 4th street location. I didn't feel like I was eating at the mustard seed.\nThe place is clean and a fresh coat of paint has gone along way.\n\nFor Breakfast I ordered 2 eggs, toast and sausage.\n I had a couple concerns... \n\nWhere was the whole sausage?\nI recieved what looked like 75% of the butterflied sausage.\n\nThe breakfast also came with, what tasted like,  the passed down 'family secret' Nellies breakfast Potatos.... Yuck!\n\nMy friend had ordered the Eggs Benny and commented that the sauce was quite good (above average)\n\n\nPros:\n\nLocation\nClean\n(you don't smell wierd when you leave)\n\nCons:\n\nService \nPotatos\n\n\nAll in All this place is great if your in the area, but hasn't left me craving to come back.
