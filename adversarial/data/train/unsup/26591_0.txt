I love the Honey Seared chicken with rice.  Everything else on the menu just isn't that exciting to me. I wouldn't really choose to go here except it's close to my house and easy.  Prices are good for me cause I can eat half for dinner and then the other half for lunch the next day.  Sometimes getting the food takes a while cause they're always busy.  I don't really like eating there either cause it's really loud and echoy.
