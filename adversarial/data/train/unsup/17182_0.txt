About wings: small, dry, tasteless, taste like they've been frozen for months\n\nAbout my experience:\nCalled to complain about the wings, said I wanted a credit for next time or something else.\n\nNot possible. Agent says I'm either getting replacement wings or nothing.\n\nI get replacement wings. Same horrible quality. Driver comes to pick up the previous wings, opens the box in front of me, counts them. Of course they're all there. Never seen such bad manners in my life.\n\nCalled back, said I still hate the wings, you can have them back. Agent says that was all they can do. No credit. No refund. Attitude of \"now they're your wings, your problem\"\n\nThrew out the wings. Attached is a pic of them in the garbage, where they belong.
