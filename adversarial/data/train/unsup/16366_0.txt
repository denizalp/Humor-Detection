Live here with my boyfriend and we love it!!! Its the best price for the area, they gave us a student discount,  and we're 5 min away from old town and Tempe marketplace which is so nice! \n\nMaintenance isnt the best, but they did come and respond to our work order in a timely manner. The gate doesn't close and I doubt it even works, but it still feels nice to be in a community setting.\n\nOverall we enjoy living here at scottsdale springs and love our experience so far.
