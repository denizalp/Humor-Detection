Excellent service, perfect tan!\n\nAngie is so accommodating in every way!\nFrom the time I called to the time I dried, she made it all so painless.\nI was in a bit of a pickle and Angie let me use the shower at her spa to \"prep\" before the tan.\nShe also made sure she didn't have to charge me extra for the late time I needed. Instead, she made it work earlier.\nShe mixed up a beautiful reddish tan, that looked so beautiful! I posted a before and after picture. \nFor reference, I wear Alabaster or Ivory foundation (the lightest colors available). I was looking like a sexy Native American goddess when I was done! \nDrastic, yet believable change!!\n\nI'll definitely call Angie next time I'm in LV!\n\nTell her the crazy blonde who shaved in her shower sent you! hahaha :)\n\nxo-\nAndrea
