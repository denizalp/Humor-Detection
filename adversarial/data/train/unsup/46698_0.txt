Tweakers sleeping in units. Gate frequently broken. Usually a challenge to navigate the broken down trailers or cars in the access road behind security gate. When the rear gate is broken, one has to back up through 50 yards of narrow building or broken trailers \/ cars to back out of the main entrance gate, which is very narrow due to the number of U-Haul trucks in front of the gate, plus the employees cars. Several times, the back security gate has been propped open because someone has covered the autoclose electric eye. They secure facility has been unsecured at night.\nManagement simply shrugs It Off. This afternoon the comment was, \"there's not much that we can do, I'm sorry.\"\n\nThere is a real U-Haul down the street, they cost a little bit more, but probably are worth the extra cost.
