This place is authentic and great.  Opens at 8am and if you're not Latino you'll be the only one. This is a good thing.\n\nThe breakfast burrito (Good Morning Burrito) with bacon, eggs, potatoes and beans is amazing.\n\nThe salsa bar is fully stocked with several great salsas and even some guacamole salsa. \n\nOh, if you need your taxes done, to buy trinkets, get a massage or many other things, you'll be able to do so inside this small indoor mall.
