Great park for kids sports.  The kids played baseball, soccer or football here one time or another.  I've never been over to the dog park though.  They also have a half basketball court and sand volleyball.\nTips and observations (mostly for parents)\n1.  If you are watching a game during any part of the day, bring a shade tent if you have little ones, older folks or just don't want to bake.  There are some shade trees but you may end up far from the action.\n Also don't forget chairs if you are watching soccer or football.\n2.  If you are hauling lots of sports gear, bring a wagon as you might have a long haul depending which field your kids game is going on.  Parking is north of fields.  Fortunately the baseball fields are close.\n3.  Bring frisbees, ball and gloves, football, basketball or volleyball to keep your non participants busy.\n4.  Bring toilet paper.  I had to take to restroom a couple times and people aren't clean at times.\n5.  There is a playground for little ones.\n6.  There is 3 shaded areas with picnic tables.\n\nOther than that.  Groundskeepers do a great job.  Very nice park and facility for kids getting their game on.
