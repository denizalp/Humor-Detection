Since I was a little kid I've always liked their come slaw, I still do.  That is one of the main reasons for coming here.  My family was in the mood for KFC so exercised to try this new location.  I went inside to order a carry out order.  Their menu board says that you get a free cake (chocolate chip or red velvet cake) with a 10 pc meal or larger.  I ordered the 16 pc meal for $36.99 and waited to get my order.  \n\nAfter getting my order I headed outside and looked at my bag while walking.  I didn't see the cake included in either of the bags I received so I went back and asked where the cake was.  The guy that took my order said that you specifically have to ask for the cake otherwise you don't get it.  I said that it shows on the menu that it comes with it.  I asked shouldn't it be included automatically and can't you just give me the cake?  He said no.  I said that that's not right but eventually he gave me a chocolaty chip cake.\n\nHe says that the manager will yell at him for giving out the cake without ringing it up (I don't know if he did this after I left to correct it).  Then he said something about food costs which I really didn't pay attention to.  Actually, I don't really care what their food costs are.  But if you're going to start talking about stuff like that, bring out the invoices for how much the food costs if you even have access to it or keep your mouth shut.\n\nSadly I believe him about his manager yelling at him.
