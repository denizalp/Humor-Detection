I came to Nails with Love on Shirley B's recommendation of Tina gel polish work (specializing in ombre).  Unfortunately, Tina called in sick today, but Jenny, who manages the shop with her husband Anthony, was able to do my service.  I got the deluxe pedicure and a gel manicure.  Jenny was very detail oriented and did a great job. \n\nThe deluxe pedi and gel mani w\/ nail art is $80, but there is a 20% Yelp discount for 1st time customers and a 10% Yelp discount for subsequent check ins. You can book services, look at their prices, and pick your tech on their site www.nailswithlovelv.com.  The time listed on their site for my service is 105 minutes, but mine took about 145 minutes.  \n\nThe pedicure bowl had a new liner and the implements were in a fresh UV purified pouch. This was a good sign.\n\nThe deluxe pedicure includes everything that the regular pedi does plus eucalyptus oil in the foot bath water, a salt foot scrub, sugar leg scrub, OPI green tea mask, and a longer massage.  I got the deluxe mainly for the last item.  Jenny's massage was okay, but too light for my taste.\n\nWhile I had my pedi, Jenny soaked off my gel polish in the stylish tin foil acetone pouches.  I know this is the norm unless you have acrylic, but someone has to create a better system one day.  There is no way to look cool with mini baked potato fingers.\n\nOn to my manicure.  Jenny paid way more attention to my cuticles than anyone other than me ever has, so that was really nice.  She also was very careful when polishing.  I didn't wind up with any bumps or bubbles in my polish.  And her nail art was good for me.  I did not ask for anything too crazy, just a snowflake design on my ring fingers.\n\nI will be back in two weeks for candy cane stripes to get even more in the holiday spirit!
