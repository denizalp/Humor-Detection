Had the vegetable curry spinach with paneer, thinner (watery) than I expected.  Would have liked more substance.  Flavor was okay, did not excite my taste buds.  People are nice tho.\nOne thing I didn't know was that their take out food may be pre-made and refrigerated- found out when I was asked if I wanted the saag heated up.  Kind of deflated my expectations before I even left the restaurant.
