Well anyone who knows me understands that if I must review customer service for a corporate brand I am certainly appreciating how hard the regular people work to get the service rolling for new residents.\nOn Saturday of last week we moved to Las Vegas and made an appointment to have the internet and TV configured.\nAlex was our serviceman and he worked very hard for 3 hours. He was helpful, polite and knowledgeable.\nThe weather was stifling hot but he never lost his cool and he remained positive and gracious.\nAlex is a great representative for the company.
