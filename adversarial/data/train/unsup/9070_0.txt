I went here after visiting other bike stores and seeing a lot of mountain and road bikes, and that wasn't what I wanted. I wanted a bike I could ride around town in, so my friend from Chicago told me to check out Linus bikes. I found this store through their website and went to pay them a visit. They weren't douchebags at all and helped me figure out what bike to get. I went to some other bike stores and they were full of some pretty douchey dudes. That's all I'm sayin'.\n\nAnyway, I ended up ordering the Linus Roadster Classic, and ordered front brakes to be installed on it because it's a coaster brake and I'm a nervous person so I wanted the extra brake. Didn't take long at all and since I bought the bike through them I get two free tune-ups. Jon was really great with everything and even helped me install the bike rack on my car. \n\nIf you need a bike, and aren't looking to win the tour de france, I would recommend you check these guys out first. Apparently they also do yoga here as well but let's be honest I'm far too lazy to check it out.
