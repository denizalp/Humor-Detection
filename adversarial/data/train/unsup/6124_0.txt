Four stars, again, might be stretching it for the overall package (IE. the abandon parking lot at night , the tacky menus both take out and dine in and the price point for all of these lovely features) Having said that, the fried rice (Kow Pud) gets four stars for sure! And they have this special sometimes it's crispy chicken and scallops that is fabulous! The coating and crispness of the chicken and delicious scallops covered with a yummy sauce is an awesome dish. \n*Hey General TSO (flippin him the bird)* \n\nI am thinking of boycotting Chinese fried rice for the rest of my life.There is so much more flavor with Thai fried rice. And many other food choices on a Thai menu for that matter, that are similar to Chinese dishes. \n\nI love Calamari. Though sometimes a little tough here, the \"sweet and sour\" sauce they serve it with is good. It has a nice little kick to it but still very sweet at the same time. I want to Sharpie (a Sharpie pen seems fitting for the tacky menus) the sour part off of it and replace it with spicy so it reads sweet and spicy sauce. \n\nIf you do not ask for a spice level here most everything (I have had) comes mild meaning no spice present what-so-ever. Dare I say almost everything taste kinda sweet. Mainly the Pad Thai. So be sure to tell them how spicy you like it. Kick it up a notch will ya! Hell, give me another reason to down a Singha! \n\nThe poultry and the fish that I have ever had included in the dishes were good. \n\nService is good but like someone else mentioned it was pretty empty on those visits. \n\nThey must be doing something right they have been here for 16 years I believe. Maybe everyone that dines here enjoys \"packing heat\" \nHA! Pun intended! HA!
