Real casual.\n\nTwo words that first came to mind when I walked in.\n\nCame here with a friend on Saturday night for some birthday drinks. \n\nA good variety of beers to choose from. If you're not a beer lover, don't fret - wines and mixed drinks are available too.\n\nPub grub is served too. Pretty good too!\n\nYay, I'm a fan.
