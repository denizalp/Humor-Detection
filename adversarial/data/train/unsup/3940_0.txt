After reading other Yelper's reviews, I was curious to see my reaction when I dined there with in-laws yesterday. \nIf you go on a weekend, go early.\nWe arrived shortly after 8:00 A.M. and had no problem other than the screaming child the parents of whom felt the other diners should listen to for fifteen minutes while they casually finished their breakfast\n(Note to self...open a restaurant that charges DOUBLE the adult rate for kids rather than offer free or discounted dining for the little screaming rugrats.)\n(Note to parents....If you won't consider the comfort of other diners as regards your children, consider leaving the little sh#ts with a sitter or getting takeout from McDonalds like every other parent in the world.)\nNot a single diner at our all adults table screamed even once, so it IS possible to consider the rest of the room!\n\nBack to timing:\nWhen we left, however the Mongol hordes had descended in such numbers that, as I donned my coat I nearly inadvertently elbowed a man who had taken refuge behind my chair  from the rest of the people waiting for a table. \nIndeed getting out of the place was like trying to merge on a short entrance ramp in L.A. rush hour traffic!\n\nThe food:\nI was particularly intrigued by the bacon-cheddar multi-grain pancakes everyone reviewing seemed to love.\nMulti-grain is one of those innocuous phrases the definition of which is whatever the purveyor wants it to be.  In this case it means 85% to 90 % bleached white flour and  a little maybe bleached oat and whole grain white wheat flour thrown in to \"qualify\" for multi-grain. (Note the phrase whole grain does NOT apppear in the title.)\nWhy bother?\nIf you want to serve people diabetes on a plate, just do so, and don't pretend.\n\nNabisco doesn't call Oreos tofu, do they?\n\nThe bacon-cheddar component was just what it sounds like.\nSomebody threw hamburger fixins' in the mix one day and people liked it.\nAs far as the pancake itself is concerned, it was no better than and likely no different than the box mix with the kindly old \"Aunt\" on the label.\nMy \"Tri-fecta\" included a pancake, two eggs and two strips of bacon.\nThe rest of the meal was fine, and the cake wasn't bad, it was just not as advertised, not all that great and therefore disappointing. \nKind of like a movie made from your favorite book.\n\nI was already coffee'd out so iced tea, or, as it turned out, colored tap water was the beverage of choice.\nAnother diner got a skillet type breakfast dish with everything combined into one dish and plated.  She said it was fine but left between half and two thirds of it on the plate and didn't ask for a take home container. \nThe two oatmealers seemed to like their oatmeal, and the turkey sausage plate was about half eaten by that diner.\nNo one at the table made mention of their meal, so gauging was altogether subjective on my part.\nThe help was friendly and attentive, although it was confusing early on, as our table was latteralled several times before one particular waitress became our server.
