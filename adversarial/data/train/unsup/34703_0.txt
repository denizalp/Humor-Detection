I have lived in Las Vegas for years and love this nail salon.  They take appointments and are always on time.  I do the gel polish and it looks great for weeks!!  All three girls have done my nails and I loved them all!  Very clean..and they are open 7 days a week!!!  Also,  they always offer tea\/water and always have a bowl full of candy!
