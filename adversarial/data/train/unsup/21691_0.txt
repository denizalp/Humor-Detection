I came here for biscuits and gravy at a friends suggestion. The service was great, but the biscuits were just ok. They were rather large biscuits, and kind of dense. The gravy was bland and didn't have a lot of sausage in it. A couple shots of Tabasco took care of the blandness. I read the menu and decided I would come back for an omelet or an evening entre.
