When you're over house made bitters, fancy twists and muddled fruits and just want to root for the Giants (the ones with a northern accent), play some shuffleboard and drink cheap beer, you visit Johnny Fontane's. I am pretty sure my draft beer was $4, and it wasn't Coors Light. It was something moderately fancy, although I can't remember exactly what. There are plenty of bar games, including a pool table, and I witnessed people eating calzones the size of their heads. There is a cast of regulars (the sign of a great bar) and friendly faces behind the bar. (Wait, isn't that Cheers?) For a fun, low key evening, it hits the spot.
