I was pleasantly surprised by my lunchtime visit to the Arrogant Butcher.  I am sometimes underwhelmed by Fox Concept restaurants, so I went in with fairly low expectations which were thankfully exceeded.  The service was helpful and very friendly.  She was great at suggesting items and drinks, and steered me towards the AMAZING lemonade\/vodka drink with fresh muddled raspberries.  It was refreshing and delicious - so fresh!  The crushed ice was a really nice touch.\n\nMy lunch was the chicken club sandwich with fries.  Wow! Delicious!  Chicken, ham, bacon... really great flavor, and the bread just put the dish over the top.  I also enjoyed sampling my friend's fondue with pretzel bites.  \n\nIt was a great experience, and I'm looking forward to a return visit.
