Eek! Meat (burgers) lacked flavor. Nice romaine lettuce but green chilies canned.  Marble rye bread option appreciated. \"Roasted garlic\" appeared to be browned on grill, and not roasted as advertised.  Beau felt that burger was a lot of mess with no flavor.  Homemade potato chips too greasy to eat. Steak fries pretty good but the color questioned if the fry grease needed to be changed.\n\nToo many nearby restaurants that compete with price point for lunch. Admittedly, the decor - for me - is a turnoff also. All the paraphernalia are dust magnets.\n\nService friendly.
