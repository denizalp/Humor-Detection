Best meal that my wife and I ever had.  OMG. That was fantastic. Thanks for all the reviews.  It helped immensely.  Yelp rocks.\nBeet salad.  Awesome\nFried fois grois   Stupendous\nBeef Wellington for two. That was even better.  The true climax came with our 25th anniversary sticky toffee pudding.  It is a must.  And the service was also that good.
