This is the 2nd time we have come to this restaurant and both times we have had excellent food and service.\n This visit we were helped by bar\/server, Jeff. \nHe was curtious and provided excellent service. We would recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone. Some of the best seafood we have ever tasted!! Thank you RM Seafood for having us today....
