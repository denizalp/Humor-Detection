The food is very tasty and well presented. I enjoyed the avocado and basil sandwich on the whole grain bread. The only reason I am giving this establishment  a three is because it only offers food that contains nuts in almost every item. I love nuts but my husband can not eat them as well as lot of other folks. The hummus is yummy but it is nutty, the whole grain bread is very nutty and grainy as well.
