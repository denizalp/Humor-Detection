I was here are the Grand re-Opening in the summer 2012 under new ownership. Amazing renovation, over $1Million I heard. Big difference from when I was there in 2010. And what fanfare of distinguished guests were present! The food was authentic Chinese as told to me by my friends, delicious. Fresh ingredients and great value. It's right across from Pacific Mall, so it will make a great stop for my family & I in the future while I'm in the area.
