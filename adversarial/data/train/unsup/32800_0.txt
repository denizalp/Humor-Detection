This tour is definitely worth doing. The car museum was great and the people there were very helpful and friendly. The home tour was great. It showed old style architecture. Nothing creative like a frank Lloyd wright home but showed how that family showed their massive wealth. All mahogany covered rooms with hand installed aluminum leaf as was paper. Tons of items from Tiffanys. A music box that was huge and had an entire band is instruments in it. Very very interesting. Very low tour fee. Definitely a great deal for a lot of things to see and learn about.
