If you're a fan of Good Food on Montford (same people behind Stagioni and Barrington's) you must, must, must try Stagioni.  (The name, BTW, means 4 seasons.)  Farm-centric, in-house everything.  Well executed and balanced and the service really knows the menu. \n\nTo give you an idea of what we ate...er, what DIDN'T we eat?  4 of us got about 15 dishes to share, and every bite was excellent. \n\nStandouts: Housemade ricotta. Cauliflower truffle spread.  Chicken skins.  (Which taste real meaty and delicious.  They actually ran out the night we dined b\/c they're so popular.) Grilled octopus (oh man, the sauce...we lapped up the sauce long after the tentacles were all gone...) agnolotti (all homemade pastas...as they should be) and this crazy delicious parsnip puree and brussels sprout pizza. Oh, and the dessert zeppoli are possibly the lightest, most addicting melt-in-your-mouth delicious way to end a meal.  \n\nPS:  Take note of the cool decor, including the fake-out bookshelf that's really a door.  Also, they've got prosecco on tap (how cool!?) and their pear cocktail is simply light and sweet and smooth.  \n\nPPS: The dress-up scale on this place is about the same as GF.  You could wear a suit, or wear jeans and a button up and be perfectly comfortable.
