This place has been a life saver these last few months for me! I initially bought a Groupon for two 60 massages for The Healing Joint at the reasonable price of $39. I saw Alan and he was amazing! Since that ended, I have joined their membership program, which is $49 a month for one massage per month and it has been wonderful. Alan is very friendly and professional and focuses only on my problem areas, as I requested. They even sent me a $10 coupon for my birthday, and I could use that even with the discounted membership rate. I am so relieved I found this place and am looking forward to my next massage in a month!
