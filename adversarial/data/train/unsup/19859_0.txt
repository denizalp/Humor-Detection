When the plans to rebrand Imperial Palace (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/imperial-palace-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas) were announced a few years back, I was happy that one of the worst mid strip casinos was to get a makeover. The subsequent result is the Quad, which has been a disappointment thus far. \n\nThe obvious improvements seem to lie within the casino and the food options. Brighter and more contemporary than its uglier predecessor, The Quad also features more beefed up table and slot options than ever before, with quite a few dedicated to black jack (cheap minimums as well!). Even the dealers are friendlier, which is always a huge bonus. It has become the most attractive feature at the resort.\n\nFood options are pretty minimal as the property itself isn't very big, but the explosion of Hash House A Go Go (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5) is one of the only reasons I ever come here. Surprisingly Ginseng 3 (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/ginseng-3-las-vegas) addresses Asian food lovers with a decent attempt at combining East Asian flavors; which is already an upgrade from the former IP.\n\nBut where the fail comes is the hotel side. The rooms of which I got to check out were not only dated, but borderline filthy. It's as if Imperial Palace never left. The antiquated decor, the strange odors emanating from the room, and the random floor, wall, and bathroom stains are enough to scare any potential visitor away. Considering the bump in prices, staying here isn't exactly a great deal, which was the only reason anyone ever stayed here when it was still IP. Housekeeping might need a raise.\n\nLet's hope the room conditions will improve once the Quad is fully renovated. If not, it's only a matter of time before they knock this place down and start from scratch. Come to think of it, that's not a bad idea.
