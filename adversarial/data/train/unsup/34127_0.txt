If you are looking for a friendly and family oriented dental practice, this is the place for you!  Jaime is the best dental hygienist I have ever been to, so thorough and gentile at the same time.  These guys really focus on the details...from coordinating with your insurance company before you come in, to working you into their schedule for your needs, to high technology that makes the appointment faster and easier on the patient, they take great care of their patients.  Such a difference from my previous dentist, I'm happy to say these guys are my new favorite dentist!  Definitely the best dental practice in Phoenix!
