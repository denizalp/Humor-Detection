Oh Good God. NO!\n\nI stopped by here the other day for lunch because I had to do my weekly run for lunch for our pricing meeting. I wasn't in the mood for what I was getting for everyone else so I thought Chinese, as long as they have a lunch special - why not?\n\nSo tried I did. And never again.\n\nYou walk in and they are helpful and friendly. The place is big and clean.\n\nOf course it's your typical standard \"Chinese fare\". Their menu was big and many, many choices. \n\nI had to spend at least ten dollars so I could use my debit card so I ordered the pot stickers (which cost the same as my lunch special, go figure.) and chicken in garlic sauce with fried rice. \n\nOkay, truth be told I am never satisfied with fried rice from a Chinese place because I know how to make good fried rice but most fried rice from any Chinese spot is always bland and under seasoned so I don't have much gripes when it comes to bad fried rice. I can pile on sriracha and soy sauce and make it work somehow. \n\nHowever, my chicken dish was NASTY. The chicken tasted like pieces of rubber chicken that was slightly chewy but not chewy. I don't know, I can't explain. It was just odd. The flavor of the sauce was off, just not good. The broccoli in the dish was not fresh, you could see the yellowness in it. Bad idea to cook and serve this to customers. Yeah, I just didn't like it.\n\nPot stickers is the saving grace of this place. Only reason it gets two stars because I could and did eat them. \n\nGood thing I only paid $6.00 for my lunch special. But let's just say I paid $6.00 for a very upset stomach for the rest of the day. \n\nPass, do not stop at Go. If you do, you deserve to go directly to jail.
