This place has a very rustic feel on the outside and a very warm, welcoming charm on the inside.  You come in through the side door and line up while reviewing the menu.  They walk you in front of the bakery display where you are tempted by giant cinnamon rolls and cakes.  They also have sweet potato muffins which are another one of my favorite items here.  Once you get up to register to order, you are usually torn between what you already decided on the menu and the giant cinnamon roll!\n\nAfter paying, you might have to stand a little longer and wait for a table.  I have noticed that if I arrive before 8am on a weekend, there is usually no wait for a table.  \n\nI have been here a few times and have had smothered burrito and just a pastry.  Last time I was there, I just got the cinnamon roll and took a bite of everyone else's dishes :)  You have to try their chorizo as a side as it is one of the better chorizos I've ever had.  Also, if you like cortado's, you will enjoy their version here!  \n\nIn summary, great place for brunch, just try to avoid rush times if you can.
