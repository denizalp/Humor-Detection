I havent touched a comic book in about 15 years.  I've recently decided to get back into it and I cant say enough about Drawn to Comics in downtown Glendale.  I think I've been to every comic book shop in Phoenix and the surrounding areas and Drawn to Comics is hands down the best comic book shop in town.  Ken and his Wife are incredibly nice people, willing to help in anyway they can.  Ken truly has a passion for the comic book world and is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to anything comics.  I find myself stopping in multiple times a week and anytime I find myself in the area.  They have a large back issue selection and the back issues are in pretty fantastic condition for the most part.  Their back issue prices are competitive and a lot of the times lower than All About Books and Comics on Central.  If your looking for anything comic book related, do yourself a favor and stop by Drawn to Comics in downtown Glendale.\n\nUpdate:  July 06, 2012\nJust a brief update on the current shape of Drawn to Comics.  Its fantastic.  I wish Yelp would let me add additional stars.  Ken and Susan are such fantastic people and with a such a friendly and knowledgeable staff you could find yourself in the shop for hours on end. when you just happened in to pick up your weekly\/biweekly\/monthly comic book or action figures.  Be forewarned before stepping into this amazing shop.  You might experience the following symptoms:  Extreme Joy, Jubilation, Amazement, Comfort, Fleeting Wallet Syndrome, and last but not least, Happy Tears.  Ken, Susan, Daniel, Jason, Chris, Carlos thank you for being such a wonderful group of people that are genuinely excited about the comic book world and not in it for greedy ambition.
