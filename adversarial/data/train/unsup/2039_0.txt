I was skeptical of this place at first. I mean 2 dollars and some change for a cupcake is that worth it really? Also the space was very clean but the selection was very little. I bought the red velvet and the strawberry cupcake. I brought the cupcakes home and tried the red velvet first. The cake was very moist and the frosting was decadent!!  I could not stop next I had the strawberry cupcake dare I say it was better than the red velvet!! This medium sized cupcake was absolutely amazing!! The cupcake was well worth it!! Yes there selection is small but The flavors they have they have mastered and perfected. I would go and have gone back there. Pure decadence!!
