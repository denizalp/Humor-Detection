Ordered a custom burrito and banana nut crunch smoothie online through their website and it came to $15.77 after tax. \n\nThe custom burrito comes with six toppings, a sauce\/dressing, and rice or quinoa. You also have the option of adding other toppings for an additional charge, $0.25 for the regular toppings and $1 for the premium (e.g. avocado). \n\nI tried to copy the Tex Mex burrito minus the cilantro, so I got quinoa, black beans, corn, chick peas, edamame, roasted red peppers, avocado (+$1), aged cheddar (+$1), and spicy yogurt. Honestly, I forgot that I even ordered aged cheddar because I didn't taste it at all. It was kind of bland, but extremely filling. \n\nThe online order pickup process could use some work. I arrived and went to what I assumed was the pickup area (as opposed to the ordering line). Instead, I was instructed to line up where everyone else was lining up to order. Thing is, I already paid online, so I didn't understand why I had to do that. Eventually, they asked if anyone had ordered online and allowed me to skip to the front of the line. I feel like they should just do online orders in the pickup area. Seems more efficient as I wouldn't be slowing down the line of people trying to order.\n\nThe banana nut crunch smoothie was really good. Very strong banana taste, which I love, but I would have liked it to be a bit thicker. More smoothie, less melted smoothie. I found the smoothie to be way too expensive. At $5.99, it was the same price as a basic burrito (minus the premium avocado and aged cheddar toppings.)\n\nNot a bad alternative to the usual junk food but a boost of flavour wouldn't hurt.
