This was an extremely fun experience. I have never been to a NASCAR event and I have to believe this is one of, if not the best tracks in the country.\n\nMy visit was part of a trip I won for work to see the DC Solar 300 Xfinity Series race. We had some special privileges because we were part of a group and had the privilege of touring the garages on the infield before the race.\n\nWe then had the opportunity to meet Daniel Hemric who could not have been more approachable.\n\nOur seats were in the skybox which was an extraordinarily privilege. The food they served was average at best. And average is what I've found from every skybox.\n\nI was not really into NASCAR before but, man, you can see the strategy and beauty and horror of it all. This is not a sort for the feign of heart.
