Whether it is your first time, or your hundredth, there is something magical about it.  Whenever the fountains dance to the song, \"The Prayer\", I get chills.\n\nI always take our visitors here and it is so easy to park at the Bellagio parking structure, walk through the indoor botanical garden and under the beautiful glass sculpture by Chihuly, then a very short stroll outside to Las Vegas Blvd.\n\nIf you are visiting Vegas, this is a must see.  It is free and it is fun for all ages.  \n\nShowtimes:\nMonday - Friday\n3:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. show every 1\/2 hour\n7:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. show every 15 minutes\n\nSaturdays, Sundays* and Holidays\n12:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. show every 1\/2 hour\n7:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. show every 15 minutes\n*On Sundays Fountain show times begin at 11 a.m. and run every 15 minutes for the Fountains Brunch at Jasmine. \n\n*Yelp 100 Challenge: Review 28\/100*
