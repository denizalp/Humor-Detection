What the hell is up with this place, and how the hell did it get such decent ratings. They have lots of \"fusion\" or \"speciality\" sushi roll on the menu, but not in a good way. The appetizer seaweed salad is of a very small size. Poke salad was a very disappointing spring mix with very small, very stingy portion of fish. Tried 4 rolls and they were all very forgettable and some downright weird. You can tell the fish wasn't of the highest quality. Rolls were kinda warm, and the weirdest roll had almost like an Alfredo kinda white sauce saut√©ed with little tiny scallops and mushroom. Who was on crack when they thought of that weird combo?
