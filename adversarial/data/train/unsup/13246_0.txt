3.5 stars. \n\nThe chairs are totally horrible with no head\/neck support if you are over 4 feet tall, but the movies are two dollars. \n\nThe atmosphere is totally laughable. There are plastic icicles hanging from the ceiling, and when you turn into the theaters, the ceiling there  is a chrome with blue lights. Its sort of like 80's futuristic tack threw up on the place, but I love that it went all out with that theme and really stuck to it!
