I took a chance and hired GCC \nI had heard horrible stories about these companies taking your money and not really doing anything \nWhen I started my score was 515\n12 months later it's 725 avg\nThese guys are the real deal !\nI now have the highest score I've ever had in my life \nMoney well spent !
