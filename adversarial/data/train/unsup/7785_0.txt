Came in for a last minute ice cream cake and I'm glad I came to this location. I was immediately greeted by friendly workers when I walked in. I had a little panic attack when I saw their empty freezers but they said their cakes were just in the back. I needed an Oreo ice cream cake that can feed 4-6 people & a round was available! I was able to write my birthday message on a colorful cake & I was out the door in less than 10 minutes! I'll definitely be coming back for future ice cream cakes.
