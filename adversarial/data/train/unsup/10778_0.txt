BOTTOM LINE: Tech geek's wet dream FTW! This place has the best components at the best prices, though their \"customer loyalty\" program is laughably bad.\n\nThis is the only store I go to for computer equipment simply because it has the best selection of quality components at the best prices. I have no idea why they've moved 4 or 5 times in the past 10 years within the same 1-block radius, but its current location has been their largest.\n\nWhile the store can be a bit intimidating if you're a tech n00b, I think their customer service has really improved over the years so that you actually get good advice if all you want is a new laptop. At the very least, the staff have way better knowledge than staff from the big box stores. \n\nBut for those who enjoy building their own system be it a gaming station, home computer or a home media centre, you will have access to quality components (HDDs, cables, network storages, cases and enclosures, etc.). I've stopped by on a few occasions to discuss potential setups and the staff have always made some great recommendations. \n\nPerhaps of more comedic value than anything else, is their \"customer loyalty\" program whereby you can collect points to purchase shitty prizes like water bottles, toy robots and garish clocks time warped from the '80s. It's like getting first dibs to the garbage dump from the comfort of your own home! Can't wait to redeem my water bottle after spending $200 on computer parts - IT WILL BE MINE! W00t!
