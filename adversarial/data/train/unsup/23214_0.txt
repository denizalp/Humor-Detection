As a native San Franciscan and resident New Yorker, I feel confident in my palate judgement. This was a huge disappointment. Our server never explained the menu, a la carte vs tasting etc, the butter tasted like the fridge, and the wine list was vague. Food was average, hostess was rude and snarky, and I left smelling like a cheap fifth avenue hooker. I could actually taste perfume in my mouth. We asked to be moved away the offender, but we still had stuffy smelly air around us across the room.  The wafting euro trash stank was so pervasive I could smell the restaurant in my hair the next morning. I just didn't have an overall pleasant experience. I \nWould enjoy this if I was drunk, and it was comped.  \nMore ventilation, better service.\n\nOnly perk:  I liked the black napkin for my black pants. And the kitchen staff was working hard.
