I've been an In-N-Out Burger fan for over 20 yrs.  Since my first bite into an In-N-Out Burger at their Camarillo location when I was in High School, I've been hooked.\n\nNow that I'm well into my 30's, my visits to In-N-Out have dwindled to only a few times a year.....I can't seem to burn the calories like I use to, so visiting one is a huge treat for me.  Last night was one of those nights.\n\nI ordered a Double Double & a Cheeseburger & Fries.  Of course, they came out prepared just like I remember them.....Sloppy, Drippy, and Nom-ilicous!  I am talking about the Burgers....ok?  The Fries are my fav's too.....you can always tell that they were just cut moments before I walked into the door.  I love it!\n\nThis location is the closest to my house, but for some reason I've never eaten here.  The drive thru was a madhouse of course, but there was no line inside....bonus!  I love watching them prepare the food as I wait....It amazes me that they can crank out so many burgers and fries so efficiently and consistently.....one of the major reasons why I come back.\n\nWill I return?  That's a stupid question.....of course!
