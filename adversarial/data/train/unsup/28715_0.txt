If I'm ever in Las Vegas, I will definitely come back to this restaurant.  I have always wanted to try a celebrity chef's restaurant.  But actually, I hadn't planned on coming to this restaurant; I had originally planned to go to another restaurant.  \n\nWell, after losing some money at gambling, I decided to go to here instead, since it was cheaper than the other.  Oh my goodness, it was THE BEST decision I have EVER made!!\n\nWe hadn't made reservations, and so, we got there at around 7:00PM on a Monday evening.  They told us that the wait is 10-15 mins, but we only waited for five.\n\nMy husband and I ordered:\n1. Garlic-Chili Glazed Chicken Wings with Scallions,\n2. Truffled Potato Chips with Maytag Blue Cheese, &\n3. Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Onions and Oregano.\n\nIt was ALL delicious!  We were stuffed that we couldn't order dessert, and I regret that now.\n\nWe were able to be a bit casual, which was a nice change.  The ambiance was really nice.  The hostess and servers were really polite, and our server checked up on us periodically.  And even more importantly, the prices were VERY reasonable for the quality of Wolfgang Puck's meal.  We paid about $70 for the two appetizers, one pizza, and two drinks (not including tip).\n\nI highly recommend this place. :)
