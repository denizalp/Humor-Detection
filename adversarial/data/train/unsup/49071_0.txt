Dr. Cruz saved my little dog's life I wouldn't go anywhere else, he called me so many times to tell me on the update if it wasn't for him my baby would have died, the staff is so nice and always there to help, my little dog is family so price mean's nothing when it come's to her life....so thank's to him she is running around the house like a puppy and she's 15 you would never know it! thank you so much Dr. Cruz
