My boyfriend and I eat here a couple of times a month because we are regular movie goers to the Cedar Lee theater on Saturday nights.  Service has always been efficient, we let them know ahead of time what time we need to leave and have never had a problem.\n\nThe garlic buttered pull apart bread is SOOOO good!  Entree portions are generous, and taste great.  The way they made over the space from the previous restaurant is a real improvement.
