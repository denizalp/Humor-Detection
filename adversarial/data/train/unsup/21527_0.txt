So I really fought coming here because it always looked like a hole in the wall to me. \nMy mom loves coming here (but then again she loves wildfish )So I said what the hell. She chose this place for here bday. \n\nWe got there at 5:30 right when it opened so we were instantly seated. \n\nIt was happy hour and they had the basic rolls half off. We ordered the spicy tuna and the tootsie roll. \n\nThe tootsie roll was not the normal salmon cream cheese schpeal it normally is. It was just cali roll with Shrimp tempura. \n\nI would give the spicy tuna roll 3 stars, it gets 3 and not 2 only because it wasnt fishy. \nIt was just rice and heavily mayo'd tuna, with no spice. \nThey should have added a little green onion put half as much mayo and maybe added a little cucumber for crunch. \n\nThe tootsie roll is impossible to f up there, so it was good for what it was. \n\nWe also ordered one of the speacialty rolls the yellow tail tempura. It was ok again 3 stars only that high because no bad fish flavor. \n\nIt seems the quality and care for the fish is there but the sushi chef destroys all the rolls with too much mayo or Krab. They should invest in a few new chefs or training or something. Even the shape was off, it seemed this guy was straight out of school? Maybe it was  just the guy who happened to be there that night?\n\nI would go back but only if I was meeting someone there.
