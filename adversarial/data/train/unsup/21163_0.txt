This place is hit or miss. Sometimes the food can be superb and sometimes it could be just average. I do have to say that I do come here every now and then for my Taiwanese food fix. \n\nMy usual suspects as far as dishes ordered here are the 3 cup chicken, braised fish, pork with chives and bean curd, various cold dishes and noodle dishes. \n\nNot a bad spot to eat usually.
