My lovely bride and I decided to get inked to celebrate our 20th anniversary (yeah, we're hopeless romantics. For the record, it was her idea).\n\nPrior to this venture, I had a grand total of one tattoo, she had zero. So we don't have a whole lot of experience in this world.\n\nBut I have been to a few tattoo shops in my day and can definitely say 5th Estate was the least.... seedy... one I've seen. The shop was spotless, the music was great and more importantly, all the people that worked there were totally cool.\n\nThey treated us with respect and dignity, even though we weren't looking for huge artistic projects. The wife got a small rose on her shoulder and I had a rose added to my existing tat of the state of Texas.\n\nLex was the shizz. Super cool guy, and a terrific artist. VERY reasonable prices and the work was flawless.\n\nWe may not ever be back, but that's just because the three tats in our combined 101 years of existence makes for low odds of getting more ink. But if I do get another one, I'll be going to Lex at 5th Estate.
