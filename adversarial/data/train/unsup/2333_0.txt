My son had the idea to go to South Point for Bingo.  He said it is fun and you get free drinks while you play...a great deal for $25 for the electronic card. Bring cash...they don't take credit cards for the machines.\n\nYou basically set up your electronic card and it plays the games automatically for you, sounding little alarms\/songs  as you get closer or win.  We ordered drinks at the counter before we sat down and then the server came by for the next round.  You get one chance to order from the server while playing so I highly recommend getting the first round before getting seated.  The drinks are VERY WEAK!!! Just sayin...\n\nI won $50 on one round of play.  Yay!!! They bring the cash to you so you don't have to get up from your play.  \n\nAll in all, a fun night with a friend!  I had never been to Bingo before but I would go back!
