One of a pair of headbangin' friends is vegan, and when the three of us passed through Monroeville en route to Greensburg for a show, we really had no other choice off the tops of our skulls but Mad Mex, and overall, my experience was a rung above my last one nearly 3 years ago. \n\nNot really knowing what in Perdition to order for myself, I closed my eyes and planted my finger on the Grilled Chicken Torta, and was rather pleased with it after scarfing down the last morsel. An exercise in shamelessly inauthentic fusion, this take on the torta is essentially a Mexican shawarma, the sandwich was filled with pleasingly charred, seasoned, and tender chicken breast, hummus, alfalfa sprouts, pico de gallo, lettuce, Monterey Jack cheese, and red onion with a chipotle aioli served on the side for dipping. A spicy, creamy, meaty, crunchy mess of flavorful, hearty fun, the \"pita\" or \"tortilla\" was as pillowy as that which holds shaved lamb in the Mediterranean, and the orange, doctored-up condiment played the role of tzatziki with devil-may-care irreverance. Furthering the heresy was serving of waffle fries so hash browns-meets-mashed potatoes, I was wondering if a collaboration with the Original Hot Dog Shop was occurring. \n\nOf course, I also had to have a serving of what is the apex of guacamole in Pittsburgh. The avocado was left chunky. Tomatoes, chili, and lime accentuated the lardy texture and taste without overpowering the superfood. The chips were freshly dunked in hot oil for a spell. The salsa was typically fruity and left a light spank on the tongue. \n\nThe Authenticity Police can go after Taco Bell for all I care. Leave Mad Mex be. What they do isn't about tradition. It's about good times and delicious food. So get over thyselves, foodies. \n\nP.S. The service was fine.
