Noodles and Company is an okay place for lunch, and by okay I mean not that great. It's located on campus, which makes it an easy destination for lunch. They serve Asian-style noodles, Italian pasta, and American pasta (think: macaroni and cheese etc). They also have soups and salads. You get to pick your size (regular or small), and can add ingredients (such as meat) if you like. I tried a couple of the Asian noodle dishes: they were alright but really not too impressive. I wouldn't mind so much if they were a dollar or two cheaper.
