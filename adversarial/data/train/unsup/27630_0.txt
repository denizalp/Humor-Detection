My dog and I come here often, it's such a cozy spot and a very dog friendly place. Tonight I ordered Thai salad, the worst Thai salad I ever had- lack of texture and flavor, the chicken was dry, dressing was not Thai whatsoever. Also, the service was slow. Overall the experience was very disappointing. \nIt's still a nice spot for me and my dog to spend quality time together, maybe have a drink or two.
