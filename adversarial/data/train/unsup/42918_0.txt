Very kind and compassionate people work here. I brought my unwell cat in at 11:30pm on a Thursday. He was taken back and they started to assess him right away while I filled in paperwork. Long story short, I said goodbye to a piece of my world at 2:00am. I was heartbroken. My husband wasn't with me and I hadn't been expecting to deal with this, but Dr. Fischer was kind, patient, and extremely knowledgeable and helped me through. I was given clear information on what was known, what the next steps could be, and time to call my husband and discuss our options. I never felt rushed, or pressured to make decisions. She was direct and kind and I appreciate that she didn't sugar coat the situation yet was compassionate. When the hard choice was made, I was taken back to see him and we were put in a comfortable room with a couch and plenty of Kleenexes. I was given time to say goodbye and he stretched out in my lap, purring like he was at home. I have such sweet memories of his last moments thanks to Dr. Fisher and her coworkers. Thank you.
