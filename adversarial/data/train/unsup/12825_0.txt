Gave this a 2nd go a few weeks back.  I wish I had something better to report. \n\nWe ordered the lobster tail special & bang bang shrimp. Just like my initial review, my meal was okay.  Lobster tail was okay. It could have been better. Not the freshest or tastiest - I've had worse. It was obvious it sat in the pass longer than it should have.  It arrived room temperature, not hot, but not cold either. It was served on the shell; I was able to manipulate it without burning my fingers on the shell. Mash wasn't great...again, room temp.  Bang Bang shrimp was ok. The sauce its tossed in is too creamy for the amount of batter these are fried in. \n\nI've spent a good amount of time trying to figure out what it is about this place that doesn't sit well with me. I think I figured it out. \n\nAtmosphere? Great\nService? No complaints. \nFood?  For a seafood place, the menu confuses me; it just seems heavy. Too much batter on the fish & chips & bang bang shrimp.  Too many \"fried\" options...and burgers, & I recall a steak?\n\nDuring my last visit a plate was brought out to a nearby table. The smell alone made me ill. When I realized what it was I vowed not to come back. BROCCOLI by CHEF MIKE!!  You DO NOT MICROWAVE BROCCOLI.  You steam it, saut√© it, serve it raw but you never nuke it. Not only does it kill the nutrients but it stinks to high heaven. Seriously makes me wonder what is going on in the kitchen...in a Gordon Ramsay Kitchen Nightmares kind of way. \n\nI know this review may read a bit bipolar, but Bonefish kinda is. I really wanted to like this place...I really did. Subpar food & confusing menu vs. Great atmosphere & nice staff. The broccoli though....killed it for me.
