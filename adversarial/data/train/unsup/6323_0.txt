This review started as a draft in January 2010 stating simply \"Love that Larb!\" It has sat unchanged since then, reminding me of responsibilities abandoned and tasks left incomplete.\n\nI first went to Basil in the week that it opened, and it was already near-perfect. The owner had started with a similar restaurant in Charleston and did a wonderful job of smoothly transplanting the expertise. It has since become a mainstay of uptown dining. The food is excellent without the expense and stuffiness of Bentley's or Capital Grille. These days the only danger is that the restaurant will be too crowded. On weekends reservations are essential, and often the small entryway will be filled with a hopeful but soon-to-be-disappointed crowd. Muscle through and claim your table.\n\nBut I have one quarrel. Although the dinning prices are very reasonable, charging full price for take-out is a slap in the face.\n\nOh! And their website has a great mobile version that is dead-easy to use on your iPhone\/blackberry\/android\/whatever. Very slick.
