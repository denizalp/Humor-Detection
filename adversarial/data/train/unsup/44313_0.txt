Well what can I say I stumbled upon this gem looking for a Cz pistol and found the holy grail! This place caters to competition shooting. They have a wide array of shooting equipment and hard to find custom firearms. They have a great selection of custom Cz pistols from Cz customs and other brands. Jj is also an awesome down to earth guy. Tip: bring cash Magnum sports is a fairly new shop so they still charge for the 3% credit tax.
