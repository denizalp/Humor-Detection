Definitely enough staff, and very friendly. I had the Pulled Pork sandwich,  not bad,  not as tasty as I assumed Flavor town would be. BBQ sauce was non existent. Nice touch with the 3 different type fries that come with your fries. Atmosphere was good,  music is loud.  I think this is a hotel owned restaurant,  licensed from Fieri,  at least by the taste of it.  The burgers looked amazing I must say,  wish I would have e gotten one of those. . I think you should try it just to say you have been there.
