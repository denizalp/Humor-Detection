I know this update to this review is a long time after I originally wrote the first one, but I had to think about what I was going to write. First of all, I will say that since I stopped seeing Dr. Farrell I've noticed a few things:\n1. I can finally chew solid foods again. I went SIX months on a soft foods diet (i.e. couldn't chew anything harder than a BANANA).\n2. I stopped using the mouth guards that were custom made for me and reverted back to the NTI guard my dentist had made me originally.\n3. Pain is gone.\n4. I have about $3000 in medical bills that I'm paying off for services that DID NOT HELP ME WHAT SO EVER.\n\nDr. Farrell is out to get your money and preys on desperation. How do I know this? Because I was desperate to feel better and instead of helping me, he made things signficantly worse. \n\nPrior to visiting Dr. Farrell I had facial tenderness, jaw popping, the occasional headache and jaw tension. Nothing that was unbearable and something that I just dealt with on a day to day basis. Visited Dr. Farrell and I went from managable pain to excruitiating pain as soon as he gave me the anti-inflammatory shots. I'm pretty sure those shots just immobilized my jaw for 6 months. I was literally in hell for 6 months as I couldn't chew anything. I was on anti-depressants, muscle relaxers, insomnia medication, pain meds, etc. for all the issues that insued after the injections.\n\nFast forward to now...I'm off all medications, my jaw feels normal when I stopped drinking caffeine and cleaned up my diet AND I can finally chew solid foods and not be in pain. \n\nPeople - save yourself pain and money by not coming here. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
