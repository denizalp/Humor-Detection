Spicy mac and cheese burger. Nuff said.\n\nSeriously though, this place is delicious. They have a lot of great options, from salads big ass burgers and turkey sandwiches. I've tried the Japaleno Popper burger, Spicy Mac and Cheese burger, and the Veggie burger. All were very good, but I'd recommend getting some spicy sauce to go with the veggie burger, it's a little plain if you have a zesty palate.
