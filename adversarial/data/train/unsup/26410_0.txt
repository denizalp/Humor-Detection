Being from out of town and loving bbq, I decided to give Old Carolina bbq co. a try. I went with a group of 5 and when we walk through the door, we were greeted by a very pleasant individual by the name of David. He was ready and willing to explain the menu if we had any questions.  After ordering, our food came out in a very timely manner with the same kind and pleasant service as when we walked in. All the plates we had were great tasting and the pulled pork was a favorite of the group. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is in the area. So glad I stopped in.
