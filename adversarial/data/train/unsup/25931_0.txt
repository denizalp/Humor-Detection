I arrived on a nice hot and sunny day!  It's a line up to go through the staff were very nice and smiled.  \nAs you drive through the signs tell you what to do and it was very clear. \n\n\nThe price are 23.01 + tax for a reg clean and they clean my inside also.    I would say for the time they clean and the price it was not bad.  \n\n You could add wax for a couple more dollars.  But I would rather do it my self cause I think you know it will be clean better.  \n\nI would return but if I need it clean fast when I can't do it.\n\nAfter getting home I notice the back window from the inside was not clean and the small corners on the floor were not done.  This place dose not do detail work.  But over all it was worth the money.
