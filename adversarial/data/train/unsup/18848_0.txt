Despite the fact that I lived down the street from this museum, driven, ran and rode my bike past it 100 times, I never noticed it.  This partly because my interest is not piqued by fire or fire trucks, and partly because it is well-hidden in the shrubs of Papago Park.  But, I must say, it was a pleasantly surprising treat - and surprisingly large.  First, beware that the large bell by the front door does indeed work, very loudly, so resist the urge to bang it.\n\nThe museum has everything from antique fire trucks, to pictures and medals, to a kids' play area.  It even has a fire pole that you can slide down. The only thing sadly missing is the firemen.\n\nThe first gallery is filled with historic fire trucks that are so old, they are not even trucks.  They are carriages!  That were once pulled by horses!  The second gallery is filled with old fire trucks, including a large truck that kids (and adults) are allowed to climb on.  The third gallery is filled with more trucks and includes a child's play area. My kids really enjoyed playing in this area, we had to tear them away after nearly two hours.  The air conditioning is not stellar, so its humid and stuffy in there, but it still beats the 110-degree temperature outside.\n\nThe last gallery includes (yup - you guessed it!) MORE fire trucks. It also shows a 70s equipped dispatch center. Even though the computers and switchboard are decades old, the calls coming in are very real, as they are the real calls currently going to dispatch.\n\nAnd then there are also lots of photos and medals displayed on the walls, fire safety videos and information, clothing and hats for the kids to wear, among either trinkets and visuals.\n\nHaving never been a 7-year old boy, my interest in fire trucks can only be stretched so far, but for $6, this was definitely worth the excursion, and my kids and husband loved it.
