How wouldn't I not order xiao long bao (steamed soup dumpling) in a place called Xiao Long Bao?!  They came in 6 in a bamboo steaming basket.  The thickness of the wrappers were just perfect and kept the soup inside nicely.  My only complaint was that they didn't provide dark vinegar.  Dark vinegar is the perfect match with Shanghai food.  Shanghai fried noodle was a bit oily, and the portion was a bit small. Service is excellent.  The manger, Michelle, told us that they take reservation.  They have a private room with a table for 12 which can be reserved with no minimum charge.
