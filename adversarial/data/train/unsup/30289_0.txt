Was thrilled to find this place in my travels. There are places I can buy meat slightly closer to my condo by Parklawn but the freshness, selection, great service and availability of free range chicken and home made non pork sausage makes this butcher shop well worth the extra walk.  They also sell Ontario grown produce in season and the field tomatoes and corn I bought were so much better than anything I got at the local grocery store. Today I am picking up my fresh turkey for Thanksgiving that I pre-ordered earlier this week. I find the prices to be very good and the quality is exceptional. If I could give them ten stars I would.
