It's been a while since I've reviewed Floridino's and I have been here a lot of times since my last review. Bottom line, they never have messed up my order. The food is always great and cooked\/seasoned very well. The baked spaghetti is my favorite pasta dish. I always get either meatballs or a side of spicy Italian sausage with that order. The buffalo chicken pizza muffins with bacon are my favorite appetizer although you can't go wrong with the amazing original variety. Other favorites that are top notch and melt in your mouth good are: baked lasagna with a side of meatballs and\/or sausage, fettuccine Alfredo, calzone, chicken Parmigiana, baked ziti and baked manicotti.
