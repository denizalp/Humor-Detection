Super excited that China Gate came back after a several year hiatus. For as long as I can remember, my (Jewish) family would go there for our traditional Christmas Eve dinner. We were lost without you China Gate.... But now you are back and we are able to enjoy your delicious, huge portions-always reasonably priced. My mother still occasionally finds your old 10% off coupons in random coat pockets and purses and reminisces about the good times we have had there. I highly recommend this spot if you are in the mood for some good Chinese.
