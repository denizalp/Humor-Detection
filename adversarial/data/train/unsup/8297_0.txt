I usually go to hole-in-the wall Vietnamese owned and operated nail salons to get my mani's and pedi's, but my husband got me a gift card to this place, so I decided to try it out finally! \n\nAs my first visit here, it completely decked out girly...hot pink painted walls, neon 'fusia' name in front desk, lots of glitter and glam. Not exactly my taste in interior design, but hey, the service might be good! I notice immediately that there are no price lists anywhere, so it automatically said 'expensive!!' in my head. Then I remembered, I have a gift card, it's ok!\n\nWhen I first made my appointment, I specified to the lady over the phone that I needed a french manicure and regular pedicure. The lady that took care of me did a regular manicure and when she finished, I realized that she just thought it was a regular manicure, not a FRENCH manicure. I bit my tongue since she finished already and I should have caught her earlier. \n\nThe color of the nail polish for my pedicure came out pretty bright, and I told her that, so she said that it will turn darker when she puts a second coat on it, which she forgot... blah. I could have said something again...but decided to just not. : \/ Not sure why. \n\nI thought, oh well, maybe the bill won't be that bad.\n\nIt was $85! Just for a regular mani and pedi. I usually pay $15-$20 for a mani and same price for a pedi. What a huge difference. Don't think I will be coming back since the value is definitely shot, and I never really got what I wanted in the first place. They would get an extra star if they only took walk-ins, which they don't, obviously.\n\nIt's sad when you have $60 left on your gift card, but you don't want to come back to use it!\n\nBack to my Vietnamese salon it is.
