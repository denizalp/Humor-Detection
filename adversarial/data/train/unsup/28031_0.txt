Not really worth the calories. We came here the first time for a large group dinner and it was delicious! Been back three times and each time was worse than the last. Something happened.\n\nThree stars for Monday night pint night! All pints three dollars. Go for the booze and then hit up the delicious smelling halal food truck down the corner.
