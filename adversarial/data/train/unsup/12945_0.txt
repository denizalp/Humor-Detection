I wish I had never met Gainey. I wish I had never opened the glass doors and peeked my head in to the treasures that lay inside. I'm ruined for life, no other gym is ever going to compare. Mamma was right when she told me \"You get whatchoo pay for\" because the membership fees here are outrageous. I think I can justify the cost though... I should spend as much money on keeping myself healthy as I do on keeping myself intoxicated each month. Right?!\n\nAlright, cost aside, here is why Gainey rocks the Health Spa -\nThe equipment is fairly new and in great shape - The treadmills have individual Ipod docs and televisions and they actually work. \nLocker Rooms - WOW! Awesome locker room, well stocked (deodorant, body spay, lotion, shampoo, shaving cream, razors ect) and very clean. There are individual showers and getting ready stations, there is a hot tub, steam room, sauna and an outdoor pool. \nSTEAM ROOM - You can sit in a large clean steam room and spray Eucalyptus.  Breathe in healing scent,  sweat out toxins and impurities, breathe in.....  \nClasses - Kick boxing, pilates, yoga ect... Although they do seem to fill up rather quick\n\nI still haven't bitten the bullet and purchased a membership, but I think I may, it is worth is just for the steam room.
