Wow I don't know how to explain the excitement of this ride. I had no clue how it would feel we had no idea how it takes your breath away!\nIt was absolutely a THRILL for sure. Stratosphere knows how to have you get scared!\n\nI remember years ago when they had the roller coaster. I thought that was cool and they took it down.  That wasn't near as scary as the Big Shot.\n\nI hung on so tight like that matters if it decided to shoot off the top of the needle.\nMy husbands knuckles were so white he was holding on so tight! hahaha\n\nI have to tell you while on the ride I thought what did we do.\nWhen we got off I said to my husband \" Do you want to go on again? \"\nSo the next time we went on which was minutes later we knew what to expect and I kept my eyes open the whole time.\nIt was fun but I knew what to expect so it didn't take my breath away like the first time, It was still a rush but a more enjoyable rush.\nWould I go on again? Yes! I did not mind this at all. It really feels safe and secure.\nI really liked it!\nIt is not for everyone! But if you like to be adventurous you have to do this!\nThey do have a unlimited pass but I thought 2 times was enough. I wanted to rest my heart  lol\nAll I can say is TRY it!!! You have to live life!  Have fun!!!
