Went here to perform an upgrade to the software my 2008 Civic Hybrid's battery uses, after receiving a notice from Honda.\n\nFor the next few weeks after leaving, I noticed I had gone from getting 40-50 mpg, down to 28-32 mpg. \n\nI called them several times to complain about this, and asked them to change it back to how it was. When I went in, they said they'd look at it, and during that process my husband and I went to look at newer models of cars. The sales staff were nothing short of pushy, rude, and unprofessional. After telling us they could not do anything for our car, they tried to steamroll us into buying a USED 2010 Accord (Sorry, but 700+ miles on it and the car smelling like someone's been using it, does not mean it's a new car...) for $38,000!!!!\n\nWhen we told the salesman we were not interested, he kept trying to pressure as to what a great deal this car was, and how they couldn't put us back in a normal Civic, even though they were the ones who had done the \"upgrade\". We asked for our keys back, and he instead went and got the manager to try to high pressure us again. We told him no, and left.\n\nA week later, I got a call from the manager, once again trying to pressure us into buying this used Accord. I told them that they had somehow fucked up my car, and refused to fix it, and would not be doing business with them again.\n\nLast month, I ended up taking the car to Findlay Honda, since that's where I bought my hybrid from years ago. After inspecting, it turns out that Desert Honda cracked my gas tank, which was causing me to lose gas, and therefore mileage. So much for \"Can't do anything\", I guess... \n\nFindlay happily put me in a new Civic (the same car that I was told Desert Honda couldn't put me in), after telling me about the new Honda HFX, which I will be going in to buy in another year or so. \n\nTL;DR version - Desert Honda cracks my car's gas tank, attempts to force me to buy a used car at HUGE markup from new price, refuses to fix problem. Stay away from this awful shitty place.
