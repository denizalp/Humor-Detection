I ordered the chorizo con huevos. They asked me how I wanted my egg cook and I asked for \"over easy.\" When my food arrived, it looked like a big pile of poop with an egg on top. The egg was cooked all the way through, and the chorizo tasted like smoked hamburger meat. \n\nMy boyfriends retried beans tasted like bleach. He complained that his tacos were cold when served. Actually, everyone at our table complained of their tacos being cold. \n\nOn the other hand, I did enjoy the guacamole and sangria. \n\nIt is decorated very festively, but the food isn't worth it.
