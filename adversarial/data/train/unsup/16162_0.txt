Fun concept, but I now know I am not one for secret movie nights!  I think going in knowing that a movie might be one of three listed down might work for me, but definitely not secret cinema.  I just didn't enjoy watching \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.\"  I somehow missed it the first time it was released on screen, or perhaps I already thought it was so bad then that I had blocked it from memory, but the only scenes I recalled had to have been those included in trailer shots, or during 80s trivia.  \n\nThank you Yelp for paying for my first taste of Woodchuck Pumpkin hard cider-- delicious stuff!  I'm keeping an eye out for it on drink menus from now on.**  The bar, off to one side, is cool.  The space can get pretty crowded, though, so I don't think I'd hang around that area.  Nice to order drinks from and just go directly into the cinema.  Again, thanks to Yelp for the Yelp grab bag of free candy, which I gave to a friend.  His son devoured the candy, or so I heard.\n\nIt was a fun event, but not something I'd drive 45 minutes (construction and rush hour traffic) for again.  I was dreading that \"Psycho\" was going to be tonight's choice, and now I wished it was!  Heck, I'd have liked to see \"The Green Mile\" again...\n\n---\n12\/04\/14 UPDATE:  Found Woodchuck pumpkin hard cider at Bev Mo'.  I believe it was $9.99** for six- 12 oz bottles.  Woodchuck offers MANY hard cider varieties-- at least six, I'd maybe even say eight, or more!
