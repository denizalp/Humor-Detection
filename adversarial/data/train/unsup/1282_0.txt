[Review #187]\n\nI learned about Pet Kingdom USA through my ex almost 20 years ago... I was gifted 2 ferrets as Thanksgiving & Christmas presents. I loved my little balls of furry fun; they had personalities of a dog & cat - they follow you around & can learn simple tricks like a dog or ignore you & sleep away most of the day like a cat. Sadly, their life span was short, at most 5 years due to adrenal cancer, =*( which is common with ferrets on the west coast according to their vet.\n\nOver the years, whenever I'm in Las Vegas, I would visit PK to see what unusual animals are in-store, & I would notice the slow decline of space & care for their animals... overcrowding & dirty wood shavings (or whatever else is used for their \"litter box\") in the ferret tank, limited water for the beta fish (yes, they don't require much but it's hot & water evaporates; 1\/2 cup of water isn't asking much), water bowls are dirty with food & litter shavings, etc.\n\nOn my second to last visit, they had a gorgeous lynx. My boyfriend (now husband) said she was trying to get my attention; she stuck her paw through the cage & was reaching out for me. When I focused in on her, she pranced back & forth, & rubbed herself along the cage. I tried to pet her by rubbing her ears & scratching her neck; she had the loudest purr & most melodic meow. I fell in love with her but couldn't afford her (though I wished I had gotten her anyway & figured out how to pay off the cc debt). That was one of my biggest regret... it's been several years, but I still think of her & wonder if she is in good hands & if she's happy.\n\nWe went to PK one more time after that, but it didn't feel right. There's a \"no touch\/hands off\" policy, which I understand may be stressful to the animals if they're constantly manhandled when they need to eat, sleep, or rest; however, if the customer is interested in an animal, how will they know if they're a good fit if they don't feel them? There's a fine balance between an interested, potential pet owner vs. people just wanting to play with an animal. I've adopted several pets through the years, & I don't always decide right at that moment. The staff's rudeness & the continued downhill care of the Pet Kingdom USA animals is a such a turn-off that I'm not sure if I want to be a part of this realm.
