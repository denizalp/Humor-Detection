I looove this place.\n\nI have bought some beautiful bracelets here. Also some loose crystals.\n\nI regularly purchase sage spray and holy trinity water spray as a refill. Once you purchase the small or large bottle you get a discount to refill. Perfect.\n\nThe young lady I usually interact with is an amazing person. Her energy makes for a calm and inviting experience.\n\nFrom loose herbs and ingredients, to candles, to crystals to books...this place has it all.
