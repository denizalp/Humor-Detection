WOW! Andy and i were totally blown away by our dining experience here. We came in this last Sunday (for my birthday) and enjoyed everything. We sat on the gorgeous patio and had the most amazing server. Cannot for the life of me remember his name (thanks to bottomless mimosas) but he has tattoos and apparently just started there recently.\n\nWe opted for the $40 all you can eat tapas and $15 all you can drink mimosas. We started out with the mango mimosa. Amazing!\n\nFood wise you truly couldnt get better. We had the shrimp and grits, steak and eggs, and fries dish. All were outstanding. We loved the shrimp and grits\/ steak and eggs so much we ended up ordering them again. All the dishes are tapas so you get to try so many different things! We love that.\n\nThe next round of food was soooo good. we had some type of sweet tamale. OMG if i wasn't so full we could have ordered 3 more. We also had the chocolate chip cookies with ice cream for dessert. \n\nWe also had a few rounds of the passion fruit mimosas and those were by far our favorite. If you're going to come here for Sunday brunch make sure you have a reservation. it was PACKED! We cannot wait to come back.
