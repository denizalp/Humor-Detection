We ordered our favorite. White rice with soy sauce. The food was great. The atmosphere was great. The staff was great. Especially the cook with the scruffy facial hair and faux hawk. I think his name was Seth. He was really knowledgeable and added the perfect amount of soy sauce to our rice. Will definitely come back the next time were in town!
