I realized that I have been coming to Defalcos for the last 15 years and never raved about this place.  This has got to be by far the best Italian Deli in the entire Phoenix area.  The food is authentic and Delicious.  The pasta dishes are just like grandma Taormina used to make.   The sandwiches are excellent.  Don't forget the desserts.  Cannolis and cookies are perfect.  You can't go wrong here!
