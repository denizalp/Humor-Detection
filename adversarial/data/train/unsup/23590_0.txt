Certainly not my favourite mall in Toronto, but it's always crucial to bring relatives here who are touring the city. Eaton Centre is more of a landmark than a mall, with Dundas Square always hosting activities, this mall is always packed as in uncomfortably packed where you'd have to be mindful not to walk into anyone. \n\nThe interior isn't very spacious, and the roofs are very low making the space seem even more constricted. The parking lot is also a pain to get in and out of - one lane exiting out into Yonge Street with pedestrians constantly in your way on top of having to wait for the traffic light causes a huge line up of cars waiting to leave. \n\nThe stores inside Eaton Centre are the same as any other mall, except for Stuart Weitzman. I'm very impressed by the improved food court - lots of seating with a modern\/chic design. \n\nAnyways, if I could avoid coming to this mall, I would.
