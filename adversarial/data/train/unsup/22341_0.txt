This place is a JOKE! My husband went here 2 years back for his truck never had a issue so his truck is about paid off so since he was here I figured maybe I will give them a chance... Well after researching vehicles online and requesting info for a call back. I called in the am to see how much my husband owed so we can pay off his truck and purchase a 19000 suv from baja.. Well for a man in sales named Johnathan I was trying to explain my situation and what I was looking for him to cut me off told me he doesn't have time right now for over the phone and that I need to come in.... well one you are not close to me and two you didnt even try helping with my questions I had needless to say called carmax found my car with low miles and low payment so their loss is my gain! Save yourself the headache and rudeness go to a professional dealership... He sounded a little scattered and un organization anyways so when you are messing with money you need someone with a little more togetherness.
