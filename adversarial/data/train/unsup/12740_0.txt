Not sure what the other doctors are like, but had a terrible experience with the Asian lady doctor. She was also cold and blunt, and talked to me like I was stupid.\n\nI had to take off my pants for my visit, but instead of leaving the room (like a normal doctor would), she just sat in the room while I took off my clothes... then proceeded to ask me all my medical history questions while I sat there with no pants on. Finally she told me to lie down, but my pants were a bunch around my boots, so she said she'd leave the room (which she should have done in the first place), but before I could finish saying \"wait, don't open the door yet, I want to put my pants back on first\" she had opened the door really wide and everyone walking around in the hall could see me half naked. Which they did. It was pretty annoying. But it was more annoying when she left and did the same thing, except she left the door open for even longer. Also she didn't say if she was going to come back or not.
