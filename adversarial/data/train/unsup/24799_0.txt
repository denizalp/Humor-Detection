DON'T GO HERE! It's a ripoff. Absolutely Go anywhere else. This will be my first and last strip club experience in Vegas. Decided to come here after decent reviews and also was close to my hotel but was the worst mistake. Didn't use the limo service and probably got asked a few times if i came by taxi or something else which I'm guessing is a whole different thing. \n\nI should've gone back after they mentioned the 50$ cover charge for an open bar till 8pm which is an incentive to rip you off more later on after you're drunk. Reached there around 630pm but i decided to go ahead and check it out anyways. The place was deserted, there were about 4 people there. Apparently it only gets busy after 8 or 9pm and even then not really till after 11pm.\n\nAnyways I thought I'd have a couple of drinks and leave until one of the short haired girls walked over and asked me to sit on one of the couches for no reason and then got her friend from Czech or wherever. They were there for 5 min max and basically sweet talked me to do a private dance with them. When i refused, they said it was 180$ for the both of them for the time they were there. Said it was 200$ a person downstairs and 400$ a person upstairs. And that i shouldn't use a credit card because they charge a huge fee and that they were saving me money and getting them cash.\n\nAnyways, I regret my mistake and hope no one else does the same or goes through the same. Service is definitely nice, everyone's smiling at you as you're getting ripped off and certainly got better after i spent all that money. It is definitely aptly named Hustler and they hustle you and your money for sure. WORST PLACE EVER. Thank you for a great time.
