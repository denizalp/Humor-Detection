After making the foolish attempt at going to Anju for dinner without reservations,  Ihad to find another Korean place. I remember a friend telling me that I had to try Bow Bulgogi. \nIn it's non-descript location it would be easy to pass it by, but a grave mistake.\nI ate the beef bulgogi and bi bim bap, kim chi and deep fried tofu to start. Twas glorious.\n\nI have nothing bad to say, food was good, prices were decent, waitress was cute.\n\n5 \"kim jong il's\" out of 5
