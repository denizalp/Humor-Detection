This is probably my favorite steakhouse in the country and I really enjoy coming here when in Vegas.  First the dining room is spacious and swanky.  The service is very attentive and fast. \n\nOn to the food.  I always order the domestic Wagyu tasting menu- priced at $155 per person you get a corresponding number of cuts of Wagyu steaks depending on how many people order it.  For instance if two people order the tasting menu you can choose two Wagyu steaks and so forth.  You get to choose three appetizers\/salads, lobster bisque is included as well as shrimp cocktail, steaks, three sides and they bring out desserts.\n\nI highly recommend the warm Frisée salad, spinach salad and buffalo mozzarella.  Order the Wagyu ribeye and NY Strip- so rich and melt in your mouth goodness.  Please order them medium-rare.  Anything above it is doing it injustice.  Now, Wagyu steaks are rich so if you don't like that then the regular grilled steaks are fine too- just a different texture.   Steaks have a beautiful char and is seasoned perfectly with a nice crust.  \n\nThe potato purée is so good but one order can feed four people so don't over order that.  The sides can all be shared.\n\nBy the time dessert arrives my belly is so full I don't touch it but it looks great.
