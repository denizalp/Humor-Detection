While the actual fry bread isn't bad, it's certainly not great. The green chili meat contains mostly potatoes and a few small pieces of meat if you're lucky. However, the kicker is that after you spend 40 bucks for 3 people and ask for honey for the fry bread they tell you that they don't know how to ring it up so they charge you 89 cents for a half filled tiny 1oz container. So between the service and food, I think two stars is generous.
