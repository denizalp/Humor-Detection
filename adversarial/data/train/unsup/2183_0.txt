Aesthetically gorgeous show  with a  large cast performing in a unique wheel-shaped stage, set to Beatles music- you don't need to be a superfan to appreciate and enjoy an amazing night here, nor do you have to shell out for any particular seating section as they all offer amazing views. In fact, I'd sit further back to be able to take in more than just what's right in front of your seat.\n\nLucked into some amazing second-row seats via a generous Yelper (thanks Janel!) and spent the evening swiveling my head back and forth and up and everywhere trying to take in all of the action. At times there are up to 30 performers on stage or in the air with no central focus point, as such it seems like it would translate to one of the few shows worth seeing more than once, as you could easily see things you missed before.\n\nFavorite parts:\n\"Strawberry Fields Forever\" with bubbles\n\"Here Comes The Sun\" with candles\n\"Octopus's Garden\" with lights\n\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" almost a literal interpretation\n\nConsistently rated one of the best shows in Vegas, recommended as one of the best Cirque shows, LOVE lives up to the hype-  and then some!\n\nTIP: Don't get a drink in the lobby, you don't want your bladder to force you to miss any of the scenes!
