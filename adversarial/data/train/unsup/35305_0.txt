Pretty dissapointing for Sat afternoon seems to be the same service on Sat we have been multiple times because of proximity only. \n It was wing day so we started with wings, honey garlic they were really good and quite large it just took a long time to arrive. We placed our food order after the appitizer was done because the server kept dissapearing. It seemed like there was alot of servers on we just didn't get a good one. \n This was the first time we ordered meals we usually just go for wings and again not very impressed for the price. I feel if I'm paying fourteen dollars for a burger it should not be a frozen patty. All around bad will not be returning. Calgary has so many other choices.\nSorry Brewsters....NEXT!
