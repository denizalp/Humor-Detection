Celebrate Kids is our go-to event company for all of our Halloween and kids' parties. We use them for meet and greet costumed characters, water slides, bounces houses, carnival games, face painters, fortune tellers, clowns, fire eaters, and more. We have been very happy with all of the personnel they've sent to work our parties and increase the level of fun for all! We have never had an issue with punctuality, missing equipment, rudeness, etc. We continue using Celebrate Kids year after year because they're the BEST at what they do and are more than reasonably priced. Once you hire them, you will never feel the need to hire anyone else for your kids' events again!
