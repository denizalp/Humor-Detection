Junk quality. The frames of the upholstered sectional I bought is the cheapest thinnest garbage crap that you can imagine. The cushions are turning to mush. The fabric stains VERY easily. The springs in the frame are falling flat. Overall, the quality of this piece is POOR at best. Had I known how this was constructed PRIOR to buying it, I wouldn't have bought it if it was HALF what I paid for it. My sectional is FOUR MONTHS OLD and I live alone for the most part.  If this POS lasts 18 months I will be SHOCKED. The upholstered dining chairs sinking in and the tucked buttons are crooked. The white painted dressers I bought for my girls, permanently stained after setting a desk fan on top of them. All that said, the staff at this store are incredibly helpful\/ Too bad their furniture is shit. Honestly, spedn a little more money and buy quality.
