If you live in the valley, you've heard of Pizzeria Bianco.  We finally had a chance to visit and they definitely lived up to the hype.  Is there usually a wait? Yes.  The dining area isn't very big; however, with the bar next door, the wait isn't bad.  You can go enjoy an appetizer and a glass of wine and they will come get you when your table is ready.  One of the things I loved most is that the staff was really on top of things.  You didn't have to wait around for your server.  Everyone was working together in unison and I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it.  Great way to do things.  We ordered the margherita pizza and it was delicious.  Of course I'd return.  Kudos to Chef Bianco!
