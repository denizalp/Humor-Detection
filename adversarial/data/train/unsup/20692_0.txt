Service was a bit awkward, the person who I'm assuming is the owner or manager suggested I order a slice and pop for 4 dollars, a decent deal right? But when I paid he told me the Hawaiian slice is actually not part of the special (so why would you tell me to have this kind then?) so I was thoroughly confused.\n\nAnyway, the pizza itself was your average run of the mill type: stale cardboard dough, mushy cheese, runny tomato sauce (they say they make their own), and toppings they aren't even Hawaiian on a Hawaiian pizza (who the hell puts hot sausage?)\n\nIt's really a shame that this place doesn't make good pizza, this area really needs a good pizzeria.  If rather go back to the crappy pizza pizza at the corner of sheppard and VP than this place.
