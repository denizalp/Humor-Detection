today I had the best experience st this business. We were running late for airport...bartender went and personal spoke to chief. Meal came out in less than 10min...and was perfect. I'd say good was a 4 star, buy the attentive, helpful service put it over the top.  Ordered pork belly with shrimp dumplings, Cobb salad with docked turkey and pork belly...both excellent. Other other at table was lunch special of brisket & pulled pork with Coleslaw. Also perfectly cooked.\nGreat choice for excellent lunch.
