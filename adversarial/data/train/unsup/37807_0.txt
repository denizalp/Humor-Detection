This place was disappointing.  The rules, up charges, tip policy and salad bar were upsetting.  One man show w\/owner as host, barkeep, cook, waiter, busboy and buffet replenisher.  Service is slow.  Bin covers on salad bar are unsanitary. Reservations required but ignored.  Not up to standards of other Brazilian steakhouses.
