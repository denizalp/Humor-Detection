I'm sure the Presto card works better for the GO transit system than it does for TTC. But I can only comment on the latter. \n\nCan you believe, that I got one when it first came out, and waited until it finally installed a machine nearby at St. George Station. I still haven't used it yet, and it probably is eating away at my wasted $20. \n\nIn order for me to use it, I had to travel down to Union Station to activate it. I don't go there often, so abou a few months after I got the card, I finally made it down there. \n\nDon't confuse the Activation Machines with the machines that go an take your money. They seemingly simliar. When I activated it, it says that card error and I had to call them. So I called, and they said that it's because it was too long since they gave it to me it wasn't working. Okay, so she says that I can try again. \nI tried again for the next 5 mins and it still said the same thing. I was standing in Union Station like a fool wondering what the hell was going on. \nI called them, and they said, it was activated on the system end - but the MACHINE was giving me a different message. There was apparently some lag. \nFine so i left. \n\nThe next time I tried to use the card (probably at least more than a month after), it was STILL inactive. I went to Union again (at my convenience) and the same thing was happening. It's awfully frustrating. \n\nThe same frustrations happened to AT when he first used it. It allowed him to OVER PAY (with a minus balance) and didn't indicate it to him. When we went to reload the card, the online system didn't allow him to reload on to a negative balance! The solution was to go to Union Station and have them do it in person, then go online and reload. \n\nMaybe it's all better now, but seems to me a failed process. It's like the TTC doesn't want these cards being used at all, but it was a great way to integrate modern payment system (we are one of the few archaic systems that still useds token\/tickets). Instead they *ucked it up. \n\nIf this card became more mainstream, I bet more people would take the subway, or be inclined to, instead of being reminded that each ride costs $3.00
