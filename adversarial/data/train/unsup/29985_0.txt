Wonderful staff, very caring and attentive to the look I was going for! Nu was my lash tech and she did a wonderful job. This was my first experience and she was so gentle and I am so happy with how full and dark my lashes are now :) Miley did my nails and is so sweet. The shop is very clean and I loved how they do not rush but take time to make every shape perfect and the color beautiful. While in the shop I was also impressed how well they were treating two guests who were, in my honest opinion, becoming a bit bossy. The talent and professionalism at Pop will have me coming back as long as I'm in Vegas :) Very glad to have found my new nail and lash spot!
