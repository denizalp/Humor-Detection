I absolutely recommend this place! I do feel the need to give some details though as I give the good, the bad and the ugly on all places I review. I had a computer that was trash and took it here. They did their best, but in the end had to give me lots of new parts. The price they gave me was incredible and I am super happy with my machine now. There's not a lot of negatives here, but I do have to say I was a little surprised that it took several days as I've never had that happen before with computers. I would have liked just a bit more of a feeling that they put a priority on my repair as a couple times on the phone they seemed to not remember what was happening with it. All in all though, the results were great and I'm sure they're slammed with business.
