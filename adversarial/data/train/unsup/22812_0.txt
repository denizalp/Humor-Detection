Nothing to write home about.  Dessert was considerably better than their entrees, but, since it is called Amy's baking Company, maybe that is to be expected. I was surprised that my friend and I were the only diners as it was prime time, but I did feel their entr√©es - because they weren't very good - were overpriced. Their desserts, which admittedly were very good, I felt were way overpriced. The desserts at Chompi's and AJ's are just as good and much less expensive. If I was looking for a meal, I'd probably opt for Pita jungle which also serves sandwiches and soups that are just as good but at a much more reasonable price.  But I might consider going back for a dessert. This place may be pricey but you don't have to battle crowds as they don't seem to have developed a following yet.  Especially handy if you're trying to make a movie next door.
