This rating is 3.5 stars. The food was quite delicious. \n\nGrilled salmon was mediocre, lacked seasoning, and EXTREMELY small portion. Crab cake was very good, great spice, needed a sauce, a little dry and over cooked. Scallop delicious and perfect. Asparagus tasty, but too much lemon zest. Grits delicious and perfect. Harmonizes the dish and brings everything together.\n\nLOL this sounds like an episode of Chopped :)\n\nWhat brought this down was the bread. After reading the reviews I was expecting a wonderful bread option. it was extremely difficult to get the bread person to come to my table. She seemed to neglect me because I was dining alone. She would serve others and pass right by my table. It was really annoying because I was very hungry. The portion size was also very small, so more bread would have compensated. The piece she did bring was stale and cold. This was a major bummer, because I wasted carbs on some old bread. My high expectations and this lack luster bread course really brought the experience down for me.
