So before I moved to manage the new Sack's location on the west side, I had put in my time at the University & Hardy locale-- putting the Cornish Pasty Co. in ridiculously close proximity to myself and the other happy hour enthusiasts I happened to work with.  I still call over to that location to see if anyone there wants to give me an excuse to make the drive across town to meet for a Black Velvet. Hello, my name is Kara... and I'm an unabashed alcoholic.  \n\nSo if you're following along, when we meet at Pasty Co, I'll already be full from a Sack's sandwich-- but as soon as I smell the baking dough & simmering spices, I'll be perusing the amply stocked vegetarian section of the menu and trying to decide between my three favorites-- The Mexican, The Rosemary Chicken, and the Tikka Masala.  And man alive, you can't drink at a place that's got such a great pub-style atmosphere and not have a great pub-style ale of which they have many.  That's my only complaint about this place-- I am compelled to eat hearty, drink hearty, and be merry until I about burst at the seams.  \n\nManaging a kitchen myself, I'm continuously amazed at what they can do with what little space they have!  Their seating area is only a bit longer and wider than their kitchen\/prep area which is open to ogle and runs parallel to the grubbing area.  I enjoy sitting at the bar to spy on the process and trying to catch the staff eavesdropping on our loud bar banter.  I love when someone mashing potatoes chuckles at our drunken philosophy sessions.  \n\nParting Tip: As mentioned in other reviews, and their claim to fame (rightly so)-- $3 Irish Car Bombs! (I've seen places charge $6!!!). Oh, and don't forget the Banoffee Pie for dessert.  They make their own whip cream!
