Allegiant is the worst airline I've ever ridden on. Trying to leave Las Vegas today. 1st plane the crew didn't show up. Then they got a new crew and the air conditioning wouldn't work. They switched planes and gates and the new plane had too much fuel and was over weight. They pumped the fuel off the plane and the auxiliary power unit wouldn't work so the engines wouldn't start. We are still sitting on the plane and haven't taken off. It's a one hour flight and a three hour drive. We have been hanging out now for 3 hours waiting for this airline to get their act together. Why?
