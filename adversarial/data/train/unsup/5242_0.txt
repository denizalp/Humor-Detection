This is a hard review to write because so many of my favorite places have gone to \"Strip heaven.\" With today's Stanley cup parade downtown I had the opportunity to venture down some of Penn Ave hassle free. Yes there are many fine places to eat here a lot of which are on my to do list.\n\nThe strip best known for great produce at very reasonable prices did not turn out to be that way today as I stopped at one store. I was looking at strawberries. They sold for the same amount I pay in the grocery store and were just as bad. However, they hold some of the best venues such as the PA Macaroni Company, Mon Aimee Chocolate, Robert Wholey's. Not to mention everywhere I turned there were clothing stores and of course sport tees everywhere!!! However,  it is the home of the Heinz history center, Prestogeorge fine coffees,PIttsburgh Popcorn factory, and a whole variety of shops. Parking can be bad. If you are lucky then you can get a metered spot. If you plan to stay for more than an hour you are best to pay a flat rate at one of the lots.\n\nI visited a few coffee shops along the way and as I looked over Smallman St and Penn Ave my heart sank as I remembered the old days when Benkowitz fish sandwiches was the place to go on 22nd st. Mike Fineberg's is now gone along with the Pittsburgh Public Market. Yes and you will even find some street vendors and an occasional food truck here or there.\n\nYet it is a bike lover's dream. No time I can say is really the best time to visit. The strip district is always crowded but it is one of our neighborhoods and one that makes me Pittsburgh proud.
