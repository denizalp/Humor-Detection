I've taken my two boys to several different doctors\/PAs with Mesa Pediatrics. Pretty much without exception, everyone has been empathetic, knowledgeable, and has gotten our problems solved quickly.\n\nMy only complaint is because of some difficulty contacting the office. They have weird, short hours for answering their phones, and it usually goes to voice mail even during those hours. And although they have a patient portal, it looks like they've turned off the functionality that lets you send secure messages through it. I would much rather communicate through email or the website than have my work day interrupted by return calls.
