I have mixed feelings about the Holiday Inn Toronto Downtown Centre. \n\nWhat did I like most about this hotel?\n+ Customer service - it was fantastic, Nellie and Darryl were both awesome\n+ Location\n\nWhat did I like least? \n- The room - we were put in a handicap room which was fine except for the bathroom.  The floor was all tiled and after taking a shower, water would pond around the base of the toilet and sink. It took forever to drain so we were constantly standing in puddles throughout our stay.\n- Lighting in the room was dim\n- The number of outlets.  There were not that many outlets in the room and the few ones that we found were in very inconvenient places. \n- No breakfast included
