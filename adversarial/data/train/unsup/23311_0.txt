Considering the club thing is not my scene I actually had a pretty good time.  The only thing that bugged me was the smoking.  I can't complain about the drink prices either at $5.25 for a highball.  The music was good for a Saturday night and I learned some things:\n\n1.  If you are a male under 5'6\" you must wear a wife beater with your button-up shirt tucked in your back pocket and act like a douche bag.  There were two or three of these guys here.\n\n2.  The waterfall is the catch-all when you don't want to put your empty glass or beer bottle on a table, just throw it in the basin.  Also the waterfall smells like puke so don't stand anywhere near it.\n\n3.  If you're too drunk or lazy guys, just ask a girl to hold \"it\" for you.  It's a shared bathroom, just pick your side.  Though I can't guarantee you won't get slapped for asking.
