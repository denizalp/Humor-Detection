If I'm ever back in Toronto, I will stay here again. The front desk service was outstanding and they were very knowledgeable about the area. They gave us a map of downtown and tickets for a free gift at the Hockey Hall of Fame. The room was clean. The price was great. It's in the entertainment district, and walking distance to shopping on Yonge Street, the Air Canada Center and CN Tower. However, they don't have private parking. The garage is shared, but if you ask the front desk, they can get you an \"unlimited\" access pass for $30 instead of paying the $24 a day permanent parking (7 am to 6 pm which would have been $48 for us arriving at noon and leaving at noon...)
