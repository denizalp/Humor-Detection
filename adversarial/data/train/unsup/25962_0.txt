I had been shopping for a car for awhile and when I went into Las Vegas Auto Sports I could tell they were serious about their business!  I love enthusiastic sales people who know how to get it done and Junior is just that.  I was in the car of my dreams the same day with a great deal!  Couldn't recommend this dealership enough!
