I came here a while ago for a birthday dinner. Let's just pre face this with I'm surrounded by picky eaters! Completely surrounded. So this was the only place nice enough that still had decent food that I knew everyone would eat. (Because Who doesn't love fried chicken?). Anyways we made reservations about a week before hand for five, unfortunately when we were in the Venetian we got lost AF and were about 15 minutes late for our reservation. We finally showed up and the hostess was gracious and super sweet and still sat us a beautiful dimly lit table, which we appreciated because the restaurant was PACKED. \n\nNow the service and the food was impeccable. From the time we sat down we had the most amazing and attentive server. Water glasses were never empty, drinks were plentiful and she was super efficient with our order. I hate that I forgot her name! The food was well cooked, not as seasoned as I would have preferred (I'm from the south we throw buckets of salt and pepper on everything). I ordered the ribs and the rest of my table ordered the fried chicken and we also had various sides (Mac and cheese Brussel sprouts etc) everything came out hot and crispy. The ribs were juicy. The BBQ sauce was sweet with a pinch of savory. Mac and cheese was gooey and the crumbly topping was amazing. Fried chicken wasn't as flavorful as I'm use too BUT it was crispy hot and juicy which is always a plus. I left happy, full, and sleepy which are ALL signs of a great 5 star dinner. I'll be back....!
