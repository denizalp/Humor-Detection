I received a Groupon gift from my hubby for 6 Lipolaser treatments and 3 thirty minute infrared sauna sessions. It was cool because I've never had lipolaser before and I like trying new things, especially things that arguably slim you down!\n\nThere's one lady with long blond hair who I first met at the front desk who continued to speak to me in French when I was responding in English at my first appointment, which is generally a no-no when it comes to customer service. The man, who looks like the Owner, told me at the end of my appointment that I could speak English, when I was trying to make my next appointment. I *can* speak French fine, just when I am tired I struggle with it as it is clearly not my first language.... he could see that and hear my accent, so he finally helped to put me at ease in that regard.\n\nThe waiting area is really nice. The fish bath is so tantalizing and tempting. Walls and floors are wood. The women's locker\/shower area is very private. They provide you I key with a # with it. You simply find the locker with the same # as on the key. Very secure for your personal belongings. Beside the locker room there are slippers for you to wear with or without socks, it's as you wish. \n\nThe room for the lipolaser treatments could be nicer. A few of the ceiling squares need to be replaced because there is an ugly yellow \/ brownish stain which I see constantly because I am laying down on my back staring upward. The treatments are painless, although I haven't seen any *huge* effects... none at all almost, lol. It's fun to go regardless. I'd recommend this Spa to someone else.\n\nI'll be experiencing the Infrared sauna for the first time on Thursday evening, haven't been there yet so I cannot comment but in general, definitely Return-Worthy!\n\nThanks!
