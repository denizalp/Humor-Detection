Yes... all the hype is true. We went to little miss bbq on a Saturday at 11am and waited for two hours before we ate. Luckily we had each other and a fun family behind us to talk with.\n\nBy 1:00 they still had the fatty brisket left (thank goodness).... they let us sample a piece and we almost fell over with happiness after one bite. We then tried the pork ribs and short ribs, grits, and potato salad.. all amazing... literally can't say one bad thing about anything I tried.\n\nService is friendly and fast! The reason it might take so long is the guy actually is cutting your pieces off for you and trimming any fat... how amazing is that?
