This is not Pizza. It's a Pizza-like snack on a tortilla type crust. I like the customization and the varied options for cost depending on size. I ordered the preset BBQ mini pizza which was very sweet with the double dose of BBQ sauce. The cashier rang me out for the personal size and had to re-do my transaction. She was focused on balancing her till rather than getting my purchase amount correct. The dining room was mostly empty except for the store manager and an associate discussing personnel issues along with a couple more associates off on side having a personal conversation. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you really like flatbreads.
