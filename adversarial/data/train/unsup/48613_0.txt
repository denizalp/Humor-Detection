Got take out lunch last week, was not impressed. The wrap comes with some overly oily plain potato chips, so I asked for a substitute salad instead. I was charged $2.50 extra, but didn't know how little the substitute salad is! It's tiny! Finished the countable pieces of lettuce in a couple of bites. This lunch was definitely not worth $12. Why do we have to pay more to eat healthy?\n\nThe wrap was only ok. Ingredients were fresh but there were only 5 pieces of chicken in my chicken perk wrap. Not happy.
