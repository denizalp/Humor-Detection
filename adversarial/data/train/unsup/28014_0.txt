The food was very reasonably priced and Absolutely Fresh. They sliced beef right in front of you on an old-style steam table. I could not finish the sandwich and I can eat a lot of foods. It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I had to Vinnie's Deluxe which is sliced brisket, turkey, pastrami with Muenster and deli mustard and mayo. On rye. My wife had the New York Sky High which is corned beef, pastrami, turkey, coleslaw and thousand island on marbled Rye. It was phenomenal. I will come back here and eat again
