I was here for lunch recently with a friend.  The lunch time clientele were mostly working professionals, but we had no problems getting seated right away.  I like the layout of this place as it is open and inviting.  I ordered the Kobe cheeseburger with garlic fries and my friend had their signature beer battered fish and chips.  I asked for a medium rare burger and I was not disappointed.  It was cooked perfectly and was quite tasty.  Their garlic fries are to die for.  A real treat for those who love fries.  My friend's fish and chips were equally as good.  We had a great time here with good food.  I would definitely be back to try some of their other dishes.
