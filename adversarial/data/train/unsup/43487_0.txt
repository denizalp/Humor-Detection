The wooden accents makes this cafe a great afternoon relaxing spot. I usually not a chai latte person, but the one they made here was not too shabby. I wish they had more seats though and more electrical outlets. That would make this a great study spot. \n\nIf you browse around the back of the cafe, you'll find a hipster little corner with typewriters and books. Be sure to try their bake goods though!
