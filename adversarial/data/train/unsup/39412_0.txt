Went on Sunday night and it was a great atmosphere outside on their wooden porch. Brought my dog and she just laid by my feet. We got the yellowtail and grapefruit appetizer (very interesting - was reconstructed sushi), the pork buns (SO GOOD), and the Fire & Ice Ramen. Virtually impossible to eat the ramen with chopsticks and I don't know why forks aren't given to people who are clearly struggling. Soda is in cans and no refills. It was nice to try this place, just for something new.
