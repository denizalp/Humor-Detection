The facilities are excellent, clean, and well-maintained by helpful and friendly staff.  I would love to rate MNJCC on a high scale, but their membership policies seem to fly against the rationale of customer retention. \n\nI recently moved back to Toronto after living abroad.  After inquiring about re-starting my membership, I was told that there is a $59 enrollment fee!  This is above the $79\/month adult rate. \n\nI think this is absurd.  I've been gone for only 1.5 years, surely they kept my records for auditing purposes.  The administrative costs for them would be minor.  \n\nAs a returning customer, why would I tax myself an additional $59 to give them my business?  \n\nUnless you plan to keep a perpetual membership at MNJCC, you may want to ask them about their cancellation and account re-opening policies before you sign up!
