I drive by this place every day on my way to and from work and it just so happens that today I needed a haircut before my trip out of town this weekend.  I did some research about places in the area and Armis Salon was still the most reasonably priced with great reviews.  And let me tell you, they did NOT let me down!\n\nI called and scheduled an appointment for the same day at lunch (very nice!) and was greeted by Armis herself.  To my surprise she was the one who cut my hair too!  She is so sweet.  She took me back to the shampoo area where they have chairs that actually massage you while they wash your hair!  Amazing.  Talk about a relaxing experience.  \n\nI printed out a picture of what I wanted and of course forgot it on my desk at work.  I was a little worried about explaining what I wanted but  Armis got it DEAD ON!  She even blew out my hair and teased it just they way I like it.  \n\nNeedless to say the experience was fantastic.  And all for a really reasonable price.  I will definitely be back for any of my Salon needs.\n\nTwo thumbs wayyyy way up for Armis and her Salon!  :)
