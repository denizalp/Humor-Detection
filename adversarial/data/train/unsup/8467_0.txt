Highlights of milkshakes:\n#Cereal bowl: vodka, fruit loops, cap'N crunch!\n#Birthday cake: vodka, birthday cake crumbles, sprinkles\n#Coffee & donuts: coffee ice cream, cake donut, malt, kahlua, chocolate espresso beans\n\nEach order come in 2 cups: the milkshake cup (fancy glass) and then the flowover milkshake cup (metal bowl), so by buying 1, actually you will get 2 separate cups, meaning: BUY ONE, GET 1 FREE. \nHuge portion in each cup. Very delish,  just right sweetness for my taste.\n\nBillionaire burger $32: kobe beef, foei gras, port onion marmalede, trifee, trufle mayo. The most expensive burger ever, but interesting to try. \n\nService: 4\/5\nGuests: mixed, but mostly white\nCleanness: 5\/5\nArea: strategic, crowded, in hip place (in front of marquee club- cosmopolitan hotel)
