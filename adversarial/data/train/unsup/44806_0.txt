This is a new Starbucks location, inside the Hilton Hotel.\n\nLocation 5\/5 The establishment is a major draw due to its convenient location for a number of reasons. First, it is inside the hotel, making it easy for those who stay there to get a drink. This seems sort of obvious, but this Starbucks location has very good hours (6am to 10pm) on weekdays and weekends (7am to 9pm). It is not uncommon to  see some \"famous\" hotel goers come here for a drink. For example the Real Madrid players came to get a coffee here when staying during their game in Toronto. Additionally, this location is next to a few offices, and the Shangri-la hotel as well, making it convenient to go for coffee on a break. Lastly, many of those who access the path from the west side of the city can stop here for a coffee, in fact this is the further north west PATH location which can be reached. \n\n5\/5 Coffee is quite consistent, and tastes as good as the best starbucks locations.Never burnt. Both drip coffee and the specialty drinks are good.\n\n5\/5 Service generally good, fast and efficient. The line up can be out the door, but this is due to the sheer volume of patrons. \n\n4\/5 prices are Starbucks prices.\n\n5\/5 overall place decor is quire nice, it can be summed up as rustic\/modern. their bathroom are very clean as well.\n\nGood new location for Starbucks!
