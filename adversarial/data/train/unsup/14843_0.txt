This Walmart location currently holds the award for worst Walmart in America. This store not only is a horrible place to shop and work (I will have to imagine), but it is also a total poison for the surrounding community. So many disgusting people are attracted to this Walmart location. Shopping here makes me feel really good about myself. I have never felt so beautiful before I started shopping here. The Wal-Creatures at this store are real and they are scary! I would highly recommend not shopping here after dark or ever for that matter. There is a Target on the other side of the complex that you won't be murdered at.
