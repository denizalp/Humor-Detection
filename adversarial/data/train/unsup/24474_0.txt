I'm an open-minded kinda guy; I'll hear you out if you really think that climate change is a hoax, or country music is way better now that only pretty people sing it, or you believe Appalachian Outfitters deserves five stars.  Hear you out, then tell you that you are so very wrong.  \n\nI've been to this place dozens of times, perhaps fifty or so, with my family, by myself and shopped for and\/or bought clothing, boots, ski stuff, fly-fishing stuff.  I've left some money there, okay?\n\nSo, I thought maybe I'd let the dust settle over the most recent disgusting bit of retail chicanery, and give the shop another try.  I tie my own flies, for the most part, and when I decide on a new pattern like to have one that was professionally tied to use as my model, for scale, color, texture, all that perhaps important stuff.  So back I go, to the lonely little outdoor store and head over to the fly display.  Then, I see the prices.  I had chosen eight fly patterns.  The least expensive was more than I've ever paid for the MOST expensive fly.  Guy comes over, \"Find what you need?\"  Yeah, seeya.\n\nHead up to Chagrin River Outfitters, get the SAME eight fly patterns, for about a third the cost.  Almost covered my gas.\n\nHow serious are they about fly fishing?  Their web page, devoted to fly fishing, reads, in total:  \"Fly Fishing.\"  (I cringe when I think of the poor, wide-eyed people staggering into this store, thinking that they'll be in good hands.  Your wallet will be.)\n\nhttp:\/\/www.appalachianoutfitters.com\/products-page\/fly-fishing\/
