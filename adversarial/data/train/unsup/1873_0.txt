This past Sunday was my second time going into this Coach location. \n\nThe girls there are always friendly and helpful. Though they do flutter about to other customers which made it a but frustrating when a new saleswoman would approach me and try to show me things I already told the other associate I didn't like. So having to repeat yourself a bit is annoying. \n\nThey generally have a good inventory even though its a much smaller store then the Fashion Square location. \n\nI've been very satisfied with my purchases from here.
