Love this place for all of my needs. This place is pretty amazing bc if they do not have in the store what u want they can make it or pretty much anything u want or need.\nEveryone in this place I have noticed is pretty nice except for one person I have noticed twice now she has no smile on her face and she just does not look like a very nice person. She should have a smile on her face. \nOne other thing I would like to say. I know alot of people go into that store and have no clue on what they want or what they r looking for but I really do not think it's necessary for them to ask every customer if they need help. There r alot of people like to go into stores to look around and see what the store is about. I think saying \"hi\" and letting the customer look r for a few minutes then going up to them is a  better approach. This is just my opinion bc I do go into this store pretty often.\nThis is a place to check out for sure.
