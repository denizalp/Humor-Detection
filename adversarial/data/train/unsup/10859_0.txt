I have been on a mission to support locals and the \"mom\/pop\" establishments. And I am glad I took a chance on this local gym. Currently, they are located on the southwest corner of Durango and Warm Springs. But they also have a location in Canada (if you are ever in that area haha). Chris and Shelly are super friendly and always willing to help you out. \n\nI really love the vibe from this gym. And I have been to a few of the local gyms (outside of Gold Gym... 24 Hr... and LVACs). But this place has got the right equipment! They have a crossfit equipment room too... which has the weight rack, rubber weights, ropes, and rowing machine. And they also have great clients! Most everyone that I have encountered there is super friendly, hardly monopolizes any equipment, willing to lend a hand, and are \"in n out\" (aka get their work-out business done!). If there is any verbal socializing, it is mostly about their workouts and giving some advice\/ recommendations. As Shelly would say, \"There is no workout 'BS' here... !\" YOU TELL THEM SHELLY!!!\n\nThey are NOT 24hrs, but they are open from early morning till 11pm most nights. So this isn't the gym for most Las Vegas service industry workers unfortunately.
