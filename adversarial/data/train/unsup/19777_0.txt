I think this restaurant should concentrate on making food that tastes delicious and spend less time harassing its customers.\n\nTo quote the owner in a 2012 Scene Magazine story of Cleveland's most interesting people (must have been a slow year for finding interesting people),\n\n\"When we get together, we're making food for 80, 90 people. It's serious stuff. I feel like I could cook in my sleep.\"   \n\nWell, the quality of your food actually does taste like you made it in your sleep.   You might consider taking some cooking lessons at Ty Fun. \n\nI had the mango yellow curry last week and it was a watery mess.  It should have come in a glass with a straw.
