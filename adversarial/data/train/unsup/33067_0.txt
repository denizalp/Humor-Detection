I like Jimmy Johns but not this particular location.  Their speediness gets in the way of them making a better sandwich.  Mine are always thrown together in a sloppy fashion and lately I feel like they're shorting me on the turkey.  I've also found a piece of plastic in my sandwich before.  Gross.  Very disappointing.
