i've always told myself that the best burger i'll have will be reasonably priced.  it will be simple, with the most basic of fixings and in a basic setting.\n\nman was i ever wrong.\n\nthe setting was as gaudy, arrogant, and loud [vegas] and the burger was just as much all of these things as possible.\n\nbut it was beautiful, much like vegas itself.  i ordered an angus burger with cinnamon bacon [i know, crazy, right?], a fried egg, pepper jack, on a wheat bun.  you can even get froie gras and truffles on your goddamn burger if you so pleased, although it'll cost you $60.\n\nthis place, being in the mandalay bay hotel and casino [?], is of course going to be expensive, right?  well, yes and no.  had i been in seattle and someone told me to pay $25 a head, i'd have told them to fuck off.  but in vegas, you spend all to get all.  so whatevs.\n\ni also had their unfiltered amber beer, which was actually pretty decent.  one of my friends ordered onion rings, which were pretty good, but not the best i'd had and the fries were pretty meh.\n\nthe chocolate shake was pretty good, though a little thin for my tastes.\n\nall in all, that was probably the best burger that i've had so far that i've paid someone else to make me.\n\nthe service was so-so, but they were busy as shit, in their defense.  all in all, it was the perfect pre-fight-spectacle meal.
