I went in for a day pass and was set up with Vanessa. She said she couldn't help me unless I had validation. I didn't understand, I explained I'm here now so how do I get a day pass? She still said she couldn't help me unless I had validation. After going back and forth she asked if I had a membership before, I told her yes. She then told me she couldn't help me with a day pass that I had to purchase one. I had read online that if you haven't had a membership for over 6 months you could get a day pass. (I told her this) she still insisted she couldn't help me that I had to purchase a membership now. She said it would only take $65 to start. I told her I couldn't do it that day all I wanted was a day pass and in a few weeks I would purchase a membership. She looked at me and said \"you don't have $65?\" I felt very offended. I then again told her I just needed a day pass and that if she had a list of memberships and pricing that I would look it over and get a membership when I was ready. She walked over grabbed a paper said something to another employee and rolled her eyes. She then came back with an attitude but finally I got a day pass but that was \"all she could do for me.\" WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!! Needless to say I won't be purchasing a membership now.
