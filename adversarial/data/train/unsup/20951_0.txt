This place has been open for over 6 months and I have wanted to try it since I first saw the sign opening soon.. \n\nI have been here a couple of times since I finally tried it and the atmosphere of this restaurant is amazing. You can tell alot of hard work and love has been put into this restaurant. \n\nThe food here is great, the pizza is delicious! \nThe owner is very friendly and is happy to have business. \n\nI recommend you fellow yelpers to go try Jazz Pizza as he needs business, you wont be disappointed!
