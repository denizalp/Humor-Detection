My parents live in the neighborhood behind Red White and Brew and thus we have eaten here many many times. In my opinion the best thing they have is their pizzas, we would always order in and pick them up. They are large and thin with great crusts and sauce. I love the garlic bread nubs that come with the pizza. When we dine in I like to get the black bean burger with their chipotle mayo, it is spicy and hearty. I love their specials, my favorite thus far has been their asparagus fries. I also enjoy their selection of beer, my favorite being a blueberry brew they once had and an octoberfest beer. I like RWB but I wish they didn't get so busy and had a larger building. There is almost always a wait at dinner, hence the calling in pizza.
