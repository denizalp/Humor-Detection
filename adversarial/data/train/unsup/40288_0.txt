I love the Fritz been staying there for my last 5 trips to Vegas and believe its the best hotel downtown for the money. The hotel is older but nice clean and the staff are the best. Last time there asked for a corner room I was put on the 27th floor had a great view. I do miss the coffee pot in the room. The elevators are fast the View bar has home time feeling. Had some luck in the casino not a lot but enough to have a good time.
