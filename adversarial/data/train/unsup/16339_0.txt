Krispy Kreme need to step up their game, because Léché desserts is way better. Before I knew this place existed, Krispy Kreme used to be my favorite donut place, but Léché desserts just proved that I don't know anything about donuts.\n\nMy wife and I found this place on yelp and after looking at their website, we decided to add it to our \"Must Go\" list in Montreal. Man, i'm glad we decided to go, because we were treated to the best donuts we've ever had. \n\nWe arrived at the end of the day around 4:30pm, so there weren't many donuts left, but we still were able to score some super legit donuts.As soon as we walk in the place, we smelled deliciousness in the air!  I love the smell of fresh donuts\/pastries, and this place seems to make them fresh everyday. They have an open kitchen so you can see the pastry chefs making art in the kitchen,and the staff are super friendly and cool.\n\nMy wife ordered the White Chocolate Mousse donut, and I ordered the Boston creme. They both were super delicious. We were extremely satisfied and glad that we walk through the ghetto to get to this place! \n\nI can't say that I will never go back to Krispy Kreme again, because I don't live in  Montreal. I live in Orlando, FL, and unfortunately, Orlando doesn't have a Léché desserts YET (hint hint). If you live in the Montreal area, please visit this place. If you're visiting the Montreal area like I did, please add it to your list of places to go. You will not regret it!
