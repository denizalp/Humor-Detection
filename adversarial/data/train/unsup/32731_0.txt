This place is amazing, I could  Have stayed there for hours. Not a good place for small children however, unless they are strapped in the stroller and can't reach anything, unlike mine. But it is a great place for small parties or getting gifts or if you are a chef or if you like to cook -its an oil and vinegar wonderland. The staff was Super helpful and walked me through delicious oil and vinegar tastings. Next time ill try the wine or scotch!!
