When I go to a shawarma place I look for 3 things: delicious falafel, overflowing plates and unique flavours. I'm very happy to report that Jerusalem Shawarma checks all those boxes and exceeds every expectation.\n\nJerusalem Shawarma features one of the best falafel platters I've ever had. Not only is the falafel itself fresh delicious but the enormous platter it comes on features savoury potatoes, a unique and tasty salad, heaping piles of rice and hummus drizzled with very flavourful olive oil. \n\nThe staff is friendly and accommodating despite some pretty big rushes at times. They never hesitate to offer you some extra pita, another spoonful of their tasty garlic and sesame sauces, or a to-go box if you can't handle all the food in one sitting. \n\nA vegetarian truly can't go wrong here and aside from some stinky breath after eating, there's nothing that I don't love about Jerusalem Shawarma.
