The only thing I had here was a smog check. \nIt was quick, easy, in and out. Of course I didn't \ndo my research so as I attempted to register \npost smog I was smacked back to reality b\/c they \ndon't do registration there.. Smog Only.. \nDah well, I'll be better prepared next time. \nNo real complaints, just wanted a little more \nconvenience..
