This is a fantastic little cafe in the old city.  The building itself is very nice and cosy, with a lot of seating for its size.  Their location is also a great one, surrounded by a lot of things to do!\n\nThe people working there are very friendly and kind.  They all speak French and English, at least that I know of, and are more than willing to have an interesting conversation.  Their croissants were fantastic and their coffee tastes great.  Great food, great atmosphere, and great service?  Sign me up!
