I had a Chuhuahua who was diagnosed with Valley Fever.  The first order was a little strange.  I had to pay for it over the phone, I could not stop in and pay for it.  I asked about picking up the medication as well and they seemed to only want to ship it.  I figured it would be shipped via UPS or something but someone then showed up at my apartment from the Pharmacy about a week later.  The second order went more smoothly and was delivered via UPS.
