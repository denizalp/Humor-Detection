I was at Brant House on a Friday night had dinner then went to Cheval (which is down the street). \n\nWe were in a big group (it was for a bday) and I must say all the food was excellent. I had steak with steamed veggies and it was cooked perfectly. The Burger and fries is HUGE.. so if you're really hungry you should order it. I found a lot of the guys were ordering it because as they put it \"it hit the spot.\" \n\nThe atmosphere was good too. Once the lights dimmed down and the music I found myself really enjoying the place. The DJ played a bit of everything, but he looked like he just came from a baseball game which was disappointing... don't ask why...I was just let down. \n\nAs far as the crowd goes you had a big age group.. people ranging in age from 21-65... So it would have been interesting to see how the evening progressed once the night really got started. \n\nOh and the drinks were cheap! 3 drinks (vodka water) was only $12. \n\nI'll probably go back again at some point.. when I'll do I'll give you fellow yelpers an update!
