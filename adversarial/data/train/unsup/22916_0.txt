I attended a corporate dinner at this winery and really enjoyed the outdoor dining area and their food.....the wine? Eh! Lets just say Erie County (where they proudly tell you their grapes come from) isn't where I want my wine grapes grown because they produce sweet wine and that is NEVER to my liking. We did order their drier, less sweet options and it turned out if you drink enough of it, you'll no longer care that it's not all that good. The wine is cheap enough to pound bottles like its your job and it was a corporate event where they kept those suckers popping, so yeah I had fun!\n\nThe food was a really pleasant surprise. We had wedding soup, Caesar salads and I really enjoyed the chicken Marsala entr√©e - flavorful, perfectly prepared and really delicious plus I needed the pasta it was sitting on to soak up all the wine. We also had strawberry shortcake for dessert that I happily passed over to my co-worker & he inhaled it because that's just what he does.\n\nIt's always fun to do a wine tasting and since I enjoy being critical, there's some fun to be had here. One of my co-workers kindly bought me a bottle of the Gewurtztraminer to take home. Unfortunately, without the benefit of the atmosphere & drunkenness of the winery to support it, I realized it was pretty undrinkable.
