Good god this food was GOOD! Only a slight wait when we got there in the late morning for breakfast on a Saturday morning, but the food was SO worth it.  Not big on service, but that's not why you go here.  I LOVED the extensive Gluten Free Menu and was thrilled to death.  One of the only GF options for breakfasts I've ever been to and I was so excited to find one while we were in Vegas on vacation! Would definitely recommend and return each and every time we go back! A ways away from the strip though, drive, as the taxi will be $$!
