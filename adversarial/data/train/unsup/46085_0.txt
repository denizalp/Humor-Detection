Awesome place even for vegetarians! I m a vegetarian who takes no egg, no meat, no fish. And this place served awesome pesto and bread :) we ordered flat bread - veg, bruschetta - veg. It was all great!! The waitress here are good too, she helped us make our choices. \nFine dine, with great ambience.\n A must try place :)
