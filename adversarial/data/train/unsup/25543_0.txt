Back from the States to visit family and needing to get my Fish and Chips fix in soI came straight to J's. I haven't found anything in the States that comes close to the great Fish and Chip I expect in Canada. And rest assured J's doesn't disappoint. My portions were great, fries done right and the Halibut fantastic and all at a great price.  They have Haddock and Cod as well but I'm mainly a Halibut man. The fries are like the chip wagon fries I remember getting as a kids. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for great Fish and Chips.
