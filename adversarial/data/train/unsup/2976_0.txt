This company's Las Vegas office is staffed by incompetents and thieves.  We were shown one RV and rented a different one...at the same price as the first; they didn't remember to send us off with a sewage hose and left the drainage valve open; they didn't clean the fridge...we were first timers and didn't even know the difference.  We do now!\n\nThey also have a \"leave it\/lose it\" policy on stuff left in the RV when you turn it in.  In other words, if you leave it, they take it.  We left 4 camp chairs in the understorage and 24 hours later, when we called to reclaim them, only 1 was found.  Now, the smart thief takes all 4 so no trace is left, but they took the three adult chairs and left the kid size chair...so we know we packed them.\n\nThen, adding insult to injury, they don't take customer complaint calls at their customer service phone line...instead, they steer you to a recorded message that tells you how to complain by mail or on their website...which will take up to 60 days to follow up on.\n\nI will not go away that easily...trust me
