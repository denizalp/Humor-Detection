Pretty good for Pittsburgh. The texture of the noodles is great, and it's also great fun to watch them make the noodles. Soup dumplings, pork belly bun here are decent. Some of the dim sum options are a little inconsistent (sometimes skin is a little thick, inconsistent fillings). But for the price point and taste it's a great place to get your fix of noodles! Also despite being a noodle place, their bubble tea is one of the better options in the area.
