I will never return to this restaurant ever again. 2nd try and it was awful.\n\nThe food is just boring. The decor is the only thing this place has going for them.\n\nThe 'street tacos' had zero flavor. The shrimp puffy tacos were absolutely disgusting. The 'puffy taco' was cardboard. I'm convinced they put cardboard under a heat lamp then put it on my plate. This is just sad and I really wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt.
