I was born and raised in hawaii and vietnamese food is quite common place there.  I definitely enjoyed the food here, very tasty and the staff is very friendly and welcoming.  I got to speak with the owner\/head chef at one of my visits and was quite thankful for the business.  I've tried the Pho, the soup that they serve there, the summer (shrimp rolls), the noodle bowls, and one of the broken rice dishes. As you can see I've eaten there quite a bit, lol.  Still, you can't go wrong with a place that has good service and tasty food.
