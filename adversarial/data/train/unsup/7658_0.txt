This is one of my favorite stores to shop at after I go to the gym.  I will admit sometimes the prices of the food here is kind of high but the convenience of the store located right next to where I'm leaving from is a determining factor of why I stop here so frequently.  Mainly I just get my load of sugar free drinks or something low carb.  Get in get out is my kind of grocery shopping.  \n\nThe store at this time is very empty so it's pretty much clear sailing.  Checking out is pretty quick as well.  On the way out they have 2 redbox terminals and I'll stop and rent movies depending on what's new.  One convenient plus about this store is you can pay your utilities when they are open.  Check it out.
