Restaurant Week 2015\nDinner $40.15\nDonation Level: Gold Platter ($5)\n\nFIRST\nHummus w\/ Tahini: A nice version of hummus; nothing special though. The bread served in the paper bag was nice - it was a type of flat bread with, I believe, Za'atar seasoning.\n\nCauliflower w\/ Vadouvan, Cashews: This was my least favorite dish. The cauliflower was cooked well in their wood-burning oven, but I didn't care for the dish's flavor and sweetness.\n\nSpicy Potatoes w\/ Cilantro Aïoli: Delicious! Fingerling potatoes cooked in the wood-burning oven with a spicy oil and served with complementing herby aïoli.\n\nDolmades: Cold stuffed grape leaves served with Greek yogurt. They were fine, but nothing standout.\n\nSpicy Cigars: Fried phyllo rolls filled with beef. Yum!! There's nothing to hate about these fried delicacies. You'll wish there were more than two.\n\nSECOND\nChopped Salad: Cucumbers, Freekeh, tomato, lemon. This was a bonus course for the typical 3-course RW menu. A very generous bowl of tasty and refreshing salad. Although great by itself, it was also fantastic with other dishes.\n\nTHIRD\nChicken Tagine: Preserved lemon, olives, almonds; served on saffron rice. The chicken was flavorful and moist. Solid dish.\n\nKebab Plate w\/ Saffron Rice (Lamb Kefta, Longanisa, Butifarra): The lamb kebab was tasty and served with a spicy paste-like sauce. The sausages were fantastic. My favorite was the Butifarra; described as a salami sausage, it's very flavorful with a subtle kick of spice. One of my favorite sausages is Linguiça and Longanisa is supposed to be very similar, but I disagree. It's described as a chorizo-like sausage and that's exactly how it tasted. Either way, still good, but not my type of sausage. The saffron rice with visible stands of the coveted saffron was delicious. There was also a small dish of pickled vegetables that went well with the kebabs.\n\nFOURTH\nGreek Yogurt & Fresh Berries: Earl Grey and Orange Blossom tea, macerated berries. The menu doesn't state that the yogurt is actually a sorbet and that was pleasant surprise. It was great with the tasty raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries and the fragrant tea.\n\nBaklava: There were two pieces of traditional baklava and another two pieces of chocolate baklava. Both were really fantastic. Nice layers and it wasn't too sweet or dense.\n\nWe also ordered Falafel ($9) and they were very good. Crispy exteriors with a delicious, moist interior. It also came on a bed of Tabbouleh and Tahini. I would seriously go back for this alone.\n\nService was truly wonderful. We never had to flag anyone down for anything because what we needed was in front of us before we actually needed it. The restaurant was beautiful. Also, it was very comfortable in terms of temperature. It's hard to find a restaurant that's nice and cold during our sweltering summers. Either way, Cleo is serving up delicious Mediterranean food in a really sexy setting. Great for date nights or special occasions!
