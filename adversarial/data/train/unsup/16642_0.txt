Have I found a Filipino restaurant that I'm finally excited about?! Shockingly, yes!!\n\nI grew up eating traditional home made Filipino food, so I definitely know what authentic is. Now that I'm older and live no where near my mom or my aunt, I crave the dishes I grew up eating. I'm always hesitant to eat Filipino food at restaurants because it just doesn't taste the same. Surprisingly, my non-Filipino BF was the one who found this joint and took me here. And I'm glad he did.\n\nThey have a large menu with pork, seafood, chicken, beef and pancit dishes. They even have the breakfast 'silog plates that Filipinos know about. Here's some of the things we've tried so far:\n\nLumpiang Shanghai: little fried egg rolls that are a staple to the Filipino culture. Crispy and freshly fried!! 5\/5\n\nTortang talong: grilled eggplant omelette. Just like my mom used to make! A little oily, but it was rich and tasty. 5\/5!!!!!!\n\nCrispy Pata: deep fried pigs feet. This is why Filipinos have high blood pressure. It's crispy and full of that fatty flavor that we love. 5\/5\n\nPancit palabok: a little too much sauce for my liking, but still had that good smokey flavor and the little crunchy pieces of chicharron. 3.5\/5\n\nSizzling Pork Sisig: pieces of pork belly and pork mask sautéed with onion, sweet peppers and jalapeños topped with a cracked egg. I usually don't opt for sisig, but this was full of the flavor and the egg added a richer flavor. 4\/5\n\nOxtail Kare Kare: oxtails simmered in peanut sauce with tripe and vegetables. Kare Kare is my favorite dish of all time, so I was a little underwhelmed. It wasn't peanut-ey enough for me. But I liked that they put the vegetables on top so they wouldn't get mushy. 2.5\/5\n\nI've been satisfied with what we've tried. This definitely fulfills that Filipino food craving. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu.
