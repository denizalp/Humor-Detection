Cute little Taiwanese bakery\/cafe (shares the same space as Chatime) tucked amongst numerous restaurants in the Sheppard\/Yonge area. I've been meaning to try to the mille crÃªpes but still haven't a chance to do so yet! I really like how there are free samples of some of their baked breads - it's a nice welcoming gesture for customers (given that it is a relatively new cafe)! The oolong latte that I had was interesting - not very sweet but very frothy and creamy. Overall, Bake Code is definitely worth it to stop by for a quick treat or for bubble tea.
