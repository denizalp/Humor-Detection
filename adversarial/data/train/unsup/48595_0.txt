My wife and I were on vacation and came to Flemings for my birthday dinner. So for those of you who don't know, everything here is ordered separately unless otherwise.\nWe arrived early and took a seat at the bar, lucky for us Brandon (bartender) was awesome. He went over some drink options, went over the happy hour menu and the dinner menu. \nThen it was time to be seated, our waitress Krista was great, just like Brandon. She went over the menu, made some good recommendations and we were not disappointed, she definitely made you feel welcome.\nI suggest the mac and cheese (to die for), my wife had the prime rib (which according to her was sooooooooo good) and I had the seasonal fish which was cooked to perfection. So after all that goodness and if you have any room left, get the carrot cake and you will love every bite.\nOur experience was wonderful, from the moment you walk in, we will definitely be coming back.
