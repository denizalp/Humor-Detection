I went for highlights for my daughter last Saturday, and that was the worst experience ever! My daughter, who's 16 years old, always does blonde highlights, this time she asked just for one tone lighter. Usually she had number 8. So her hairstylist named MEGHAN decided to use number 12, and toner, and she turned her hair ORANGE! Worst experience ever. But even worse was the way that she handle it! She was laughing and told me that was my daughter 's fault because she wanted to go lighter. At the end she asked me do Not saying anything at the front desk because she wasn't feel like! She charged me $130 for her useless job and she did not even apologize! Of course today, we went to a different hair salon and we fixed everything from the very beginning, I paid $200 but it was a completely different outcome. All of my friends are telling to go back and ask for my money, but I ignore MEGHAN from Posare Salon completely because she doesn't deserve a penny. Avoid MEGHAN totally, unless if you want to turn orange and deal with her irony at the end! She's not professional in any aspect.
