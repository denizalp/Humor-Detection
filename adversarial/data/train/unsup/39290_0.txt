Budget rental car \nThe worst customer service. \nThe cars are all \nMarked up with dents, scratches, scuff marks. \nThe first car they gave us had  marks inside and out. \nAfter 25 minutes trying to write everything down I refused the car and asked for another. \nThe same problem with the second car. \nCustomer service telling us any marks we would be charged. Any dirt we would be charged. \nThe small piece of paper they give you to mark everything - a joke-  had to write all over the paper and I took pictures. \nI definitely would not recommend
