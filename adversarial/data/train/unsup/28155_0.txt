One of the only authentic Turkish restaurants in Toronto. Mixed pide option (My gf's favourite) let you try all the different ingredients in a single portion. If you are into meat like me, try the Pastrami one, simply amazing. I was going to deduct one star for not having free refills for tea which served in 3-4 ounce shot size glasses but what the hell, enjoyed it a lot :)
