Ordered through Uber Eats. The delivery time was accurate and the driver polite.\nNot so keen on the food. I had the Lui Suan, fresh shrimp rolls. The sauce was excellent, sweet and spicy. There were two rolls, both cut into half. One half of each roll had a shrimp in it. So two bland shrimp for $6. Not the best.\nThen the Tom Yua Pla Tod, a lemongrass and kaffir lime soup. Let me say that the flavour was excellent, but the hard bits of lemongrass were big chunks that I had to keep picking out.\nMy biggest issue with this soup, and I realize this is my issue, is that the battered fish was weirdly stringy with that black underside of skin. I couldn't cut the fish chunks without a knife and ended up not eating most of it. Drank the broth though. \nAnd the biggest disappointment was the Soy Tod Kua Prik Kratiam dinner. The fried soy meat was in dried chunks. The jasmine rice was flavourless (eg I could have made it at home) and the small side of slaw was okay without a lot of dressing. So a very dry meal. Literally rice and spicy chunks that needed to be chewed and chewed.\nIt cost $38 (includes a $5 delivery, but does not include tip for driver to $43) for a meal that I am not even going to finish. Will be throwing a lot of it out. \nSad.
