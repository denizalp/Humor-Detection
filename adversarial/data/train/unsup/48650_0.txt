Awesome seafood! Lobster bisque and clam chowder were superb. Mussels are perfectly cooked and seasoned. Scallops and shrimp fresh and tasty. Dining with a large group we still were taken care of promptly with friendly, courteous staff. Our food arrived hot and timely. Will recommend highly and with confidence that the entire dining experience will be great!
