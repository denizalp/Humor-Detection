I went  to the AZ Mills Mall in Tempe AZ.  The bathrooms were disgusting.  I brought it to the store managers attention and his walls went up as if he was not paid enough to clean the bathrooms.  He dismissed me with a thanks for letting me know.  As if he did not already.  For this reason, YOU LOST MY BUSINESS!  The floors were filthy and the crust around the inside of the toilet looks like it has been months since it was cleaned!
