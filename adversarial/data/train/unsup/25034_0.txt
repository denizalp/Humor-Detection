Foood is really good and quick.  Hardly ever a wait. My biggest problem is that you are often left standing at the door while they wipe tables making you wait until they are ready to come so.  Service has really fallen terribly.   Ver\"unfriendly waitresss.  It is like you are bothering them.  If the food wasnt good and quick, i would pass on eating here.
