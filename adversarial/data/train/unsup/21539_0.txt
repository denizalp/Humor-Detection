Another stop on the Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition, I've had this place bookmarked since last year's Pizza Bender Tour.  I was eager to finally get to try it out.  I asked for 2 Slices of Sausage Pizza, but the girl behind the counter told me that all they had was what was in front of me.....wow, this was the first time I've been told that I couldn't customize my Slice order from a Pizza joint.\n\nOK, so I browsed the available Pizza Pies and decided to order three Slices:\n\nPepperoni & Jalapeno\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=kfLqk6iyi4eYWlLz45uuPw\nMeat Pie (Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni, Ham, Meatball, on a Double Crust)\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=69kV9XIlg2VoR8DTHSuqng\nSuper Meaty (Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni, Canadian Bacon)\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=9-R9RYbmNcXlysJbumdR9g\n\nThe total damage was 14.38 for 3 slices.....which seems like a lot to me, but  I couldn't see the per Slice price anywhere on the hand written menu.....so I just paid the bill and moved on.\n\nIt was lunch time (around 12 pm) and it was beginning to get really busy, so I quickly jumped on an open table near the door.  I asked for my Slices to be \"well done\", so it took a few extra minutes to heat them up.  It didn't take too long before I was called.\n\nOnce I brought the Pizza back to my table, I quickly realized that I ordered too much Pizza.  I could easily eat all 3 Slices, but then I'd feel too full.  The Slices are pretty big, so consider yourself warned!\n\nThe first Slice I went for was the Meat Pie.  The Crust is much thicker than the other Slices of Pizza and the Meats are buried within a ton of Cheese.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=q1Ts-19RUkbAy2GEi11Ciw\nI liked the flavor of it although I couldn't taste the Meatballs.  The Bacon, Ham, Pepperoni, and Sausage flavors were easily identifiable and delicious.  The Double Crust was more on the edge of the Slice than throughout the Pie.  Despite wanting to eat this with my hands, I had to commit the Mortal Sin of eating Pizza and ate it with a fork because the weight of the Slice was too much for the thin Crust to bear.  Next time I'll probably just go with the Super Meaty, which is the same ingredients on their normal Thin Crust.\n\nNext up I went for the Jalapeno & Pepperoni Slice.  Since it's NY Style Thin Crust, you have to fold this bad boy.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=ZiF9E3htkJ-ux6JLyyZtkg\nThe Pepperoni was full of flavor and the Jalapenos packed a nice kick.  The Crust was nice and crispy since I asked for it to be \"well done\".\n\nLast but not least was the Super Meaty.  I wasn't sure if the crust would hold up with all of that Meat on it, but it did.  The Slice was full of flavor and as I mentioned above, like the Meat Pie, I could identify every Meat on the Slice except the Meatball.  This Slice is the Thin Crust version of the Meat Pie.....very delicious.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/Z3ZSar8IVAR2qIupqxMynA?select=Gx_4cQ3K4pBUBY6L9974aQ\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the Pizza here at Joe's.  However, I thought the prices were a bit high compared to other Pizza joints in Vegas.  I guess being so close to the Strip is a big factor.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%
