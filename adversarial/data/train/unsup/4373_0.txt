Decided to go here because of the reviews here..  Picked up the Lucky Burger with 1000 Island dressing, took a bite and literally said..\n\n\"My God that's a good burger...\"\n\nand had to pause to write this real quick.  I'll let you know how the rest was shortly...\n\n**after burger**\n\nHoly s***...\n\nThe charbroil taste of every bite along with the flavor of meat, 1000island dressing and the veggies just sent this burger to the top of my list.\n\nImagine going to a family BBQ and everyone's favorite grill master is behind the grill doing his work.. this is what it's like.\n\nThe fries were also fresh and crunchy, just the way I like it.\n\nGlad this is close to work, cause I will be a regular here.  \n\n...sucks im on a diet!
