I have just pulled both my children from Swim Kids USA and will never be returning! My daughter's teacher Shauna has been an issue for our family for the past 6 months. I tried to pull my daughter out of swim class because of problems with her teacher being unprofessional, but wound up taking them up on a 6 month free private lesson offer, which I now regret. Today when we showed up for class we were told that my daughter was no longer enrolled in her class and her spot had been given up to another child. When the front desk woman, Annette(who isn't to be trusted either, lies, and doesn't do her job well) did some fact finding, the teacher Shauna explained that she was the one who removed my daughter from the class without notification or reason. I was told that we could come on Fridays now instead. My daughter left hysterical because she wasn't able to swim today, not to mention the fact that I was one heated Mama!! To make a long story short, we will not be returning after a day of bs, phone fights, and a series of lies! More importantly we don't trust the teachers because I watched a student fall off the step and almost drown a few weeks back, under Shauna's watch!!  The mother of the child noticed through a window, ran from the waiting area around the corner, into the pool, to save her daughter before any staff member knew the girl was drowning! The mother was in tears, completely understandable after her daughter almost died! I should have pulled my kids that day for sure... I can't stop thinking that could have been my kids!!  I am done with Swim Kids USA and would never recommend it to anyone for countess reasons!!\n\n****Please don't pay any attention to their retaliation to my review...It is full of so many more lies!! They lost so much business because of what happen to my daughter.  That place has serious issues! Non-payment was NOT the issue...the staff was!
