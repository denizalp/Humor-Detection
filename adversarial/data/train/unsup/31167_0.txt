Decided to try this place because it was near our Airbnb and open late. When we got there, it seemed like a take-out restaurant, although there was tons of seating. We ordered the chicken kofta, chicken shawarma, chicken kebab and samosas. We also opted to add hummus and pita for $2 extra. Every single thing we got was AMAZING. The kofta was our favorite. It was so yummy. The total bill came to close to $40 which was an absolute DEAL for our family of 4. We ended up going twice during our 3 night stay -- it was that good! If we are ever back in town, we are definitely going back.
