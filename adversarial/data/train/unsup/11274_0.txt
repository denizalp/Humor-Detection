I've seen Instagram pics (obviously InstaFood is important to my eyes) about this place and I will forever be keen on trying (local) Hawaiian eateries here in Vegas.\nEspecially when I see meat jun on the menu.\n\nOne \"Aloha Friday,\" two of my friends and I were off and since we were in the area, we came here as they just opened. \nAfter reading all the reviews on this place, I expected it to be a \"hole in the wall\" but, it was quite spacious with 10+ tables. I could see how it would be small when it gets busy but, it's not as small as a \"Hawaii hole in the wall\" would be. \n\nAnyways, when we first entered at 11:15 (15 mins after opening, there was already a couple people waiting on their orders. \nThe gentleman that greeted us (I assume, the owner) told us to sit where ever we wanted and had so much energy that he basically told us the favorites within 5 minutes of sitting down.\n\nI already knew I was going to order the meat jun. \nSince another friend couldn't decide on what to order, she just ordered the combo. \nAnd my roommate ordered, fish jun AND luncheon meat with eggs.\n\n- Meat jun was good that the meat and egg batter was sweet. Slices of meat was thin but, thick enough that it didn't fall apart from the egg. \nThe meat jun sauce wasn't to my liking tho as it isn't as vingegary as Jun's meat jun sauce but, the meat jun itself was good enough that I could eat it without sauce.\n******If I could eat Island Style's meat jun with Jun's sauce then life would be perfect.\n- The combo was good that the chicken and kalbi had a good marinade as it was sweet.\n- Fish jun was good for my friend but, not my cup of tea. He loved his luncheon meat meal out of the two as he hadn't had luncheon meat since being a kid in Hawaii.\n\nThe banchan (Korean side dishes) is better than most places as they had boiled peanuts. Can I just tell you that I haven't had peanuts in FOR-EV-ER!\nKim chee radishes and bean sprouts were yummmmy, too! Not to much spicy and wayyyy crunchy :)\n\nOddly enough, the best thing about the whole meal was the hot tea. We had 3 cupfuls of hot tea before we left. The owner even took the bag of tea root out to show us and told us how to prepare it. \n\nI was so full after this meal that I didn't eat til 9pm the next night. And I still have leftovers!
