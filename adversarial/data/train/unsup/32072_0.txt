The strip is pretty interesting. There always tourist walking around and taking pictures.\n\nThey have a lot of hotels and shops. Some of the restaurants on the strip can be pricey. Some people can be drunk and say rude things, because they let you drink alcohol on the strip. People that dress up in costumes usually ask for money when you take a picture with them. \n\nI came here in the summer and winter and I can say winter is the better weather to go. Because the summer is very hot.
