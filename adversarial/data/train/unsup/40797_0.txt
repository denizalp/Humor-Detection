My first time there I got the stylist Natalia who provided a good consultation. She listened to what I wanted and made suggestions on how to best achieve it (my hair was very texturized from many previous haircuts and she had good ideas on how to fix that). She ran all her ideas by me and made sure i was okay with it before doing anything which made me feel very safe with her working on my hair. \n\nShe put a lot of time into styling my hair afterwards even though the salon was closing she did not rush. However I was kinda iffy on the way she styled my hair - but you can easily style it yourself later. \n\nI have been searching for a great hair salon for 5 years now since my old stylist retired. Overall i thought she was pretty good, and I will be returning there.
