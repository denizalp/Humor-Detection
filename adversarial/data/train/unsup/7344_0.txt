I have yet to win or be witness to anyone in my party who has won at BINGO.  The experience bares a close resemblance to the dauber of life being smashed down on the dreams of B8 or N33.  Sometimes you get lucky and more often you do not.\n\nHaving visited on a recent Saturday night, I was impressed by the vast open space of this ball bouncing parlor. The Bingo Room at Red Rock is perhaps the largest of any I have  been in or walked past.  \n\nI found the premises to be clean and orderly.  The clerk behind the counter was all smiles and very helpful.  The electronic Bingo box was retrieved with ease.  The bar was quick and efficient.  Though I will admit watching someone in the party drink a cocktail out of a styrofoam cup....saddened me a little bit.\n\nAuthentication codes entered into the Bingo equivalent of the nuclear football, icons having been chosen, we all waited for the games to begin.  \n\nThere was lot's of chatter in the air, so much so that the voice of the Bingo overseer could not be heard.  This drew the wrath of several Bingo callers during the hour.  Rowdy Bingo?!  Not the kind one would expect at a ladies only Bingo night at a church social in rural Nebraska, but the kind one might expect from possible drunks in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Bingo smokers sequestered in the fishbowl in the Northeast corner were not at all culpable, but it was the LOUD TALKERS in the rest of the room who roared as I, pitied the ink droppers working multiple boards, who rely on the spoken word.  Non-traditional players (like me) who sit, sipping Irish coffee don't have this problem.  We sit and wait for the box to sing but in my case............sit and loose.
