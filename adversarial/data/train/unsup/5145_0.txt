I'm not mad at this place. It is what it purports to be - it is a bar and does in fact serve pizza. The menu was big, but it seems a little busy.  That might explain the \"just alright\" nature of all of the food that I tried. \n\nI enjoyed my Elizabeth Special - pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, onions, and delicious mozzarella. The crust was a tiny bit soggy, but it still held up well. My mom tackled the Greek salad, but it was too large. Fairly good, but overpowered with dressing. I sampled from the pizzas of my friends and had roughly the same experience. The combo of my flavors was better, though ;)\n\nOn the bright side, they have good table service and a good beer selection. I also liked sitting outside, even though the cafe next door allowed smoking on their patio.  We were seated quickly and got plenty of attention when needed, so no complaints there. \n\nSince I'm not in the area often, I'm not sure I'd seek it out again, though most places deserve a second go. Stick with the pizza and beer and things should be fine.
