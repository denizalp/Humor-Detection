i contacted Dan a couple days ago and emailed him at (dgjr95@gmail.com) the pictures on what to pick up. i got the quote in less than 7 mintues and was offer a deal. \n\ni decided to pre-pay for the work (scheduled in advance) which comes to $220. a day later, to my surprise, my new tenant had someone took care of it and i dont' need his service any more. I requested $200.00 refund instead of $220. paid, because of his lost time and credit card debit charge. \n\nI told him just \"$200\" is fine and I am happy. Instead he refunded entire FULL AMOUNT of $220.00\n\nAll i can say is he is a good honest local citizen of Las Vegas...operating with high integrity and providing a service you can call on...next time when in need...\n\nHe is the \"Pick Up Artist - the Junk and not the Girl\".\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nFelix Liu, Trustee\nF Liu, Trustee & Co.\n(a real estate hedge fund manager)
