Good enough to get my Hawaiian\/Asian food whenever the craving hits.\n\nOnly downside: minimum $5 for any debit\/credit card transactions. \nUgh...that was annoying. I only wanted to order my usual chicken bowl, with tax it was around $4 and some change. So I had to order something that I had no intention to get in the first place. Even Mc Donalds takes debit\/credit card with NO minimum amount...get your ish together Aloha Kitchen.
