Since I've already reviewed everything (exaggeration) inside The Cosmopolitan, this review is for the actual hotel itself.\n\nVegas is pretty dead during weeknights in mid-December (hence much cheaper), so I figured on my most recent business trip that this was a great opportunity to finally stay at The Cosmo and not feel too guilty about tacking it onto my expense report. Nevertheless, my cab driver told me she still thought the cost for 1 night was way too much.  Ironic, the only thing that's more of a ripoff in Vegas than a hotel stay is a cab ride.\n\nLIKES\n-huge room, if I would've known in advance I would've invited guests or planned a party\n-it's almost like a fully furnished apartment, but way fancier of course\n-beds were very comfy\n-after leaving your room you can get off on the 2nd or 3rd floor elevator to bypass walking through the casino (since I'm not a fan of casinos, this matters to me)\n-I don't mind the long walk, I enjoy seeing all the artwork and large heels on display\n\nDISLIKES\n-if you leave the sliding closet door open, it blocks entry\/exit into your bathroom. Weird\n-the charge for WiFi\n-the maid barging in on me when it took longer than 10 seconds to answer her knock (like I said, it's a large room so it took awhile to get from one side to another)\n\nPerhaps my cab driver was right, I don't know if I would've footed the bill had it been my own money.  If I split the room with someone else I probably would, but since I spent little time in the room it was just good to finally stay here and be in the same building as most of the places I visit.
