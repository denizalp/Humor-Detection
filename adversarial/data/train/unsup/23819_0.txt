Poke nachos are my absolute favorite here. The fish is fresh and the entire dish is delicious. I usually go for happy hour so I get a good deal on dinner. Things I usually order are the BBQ Chicken Pizza, onion ring tower, firecracker boneless chicken, and fried calamari. That usually feeds my entire family for under $40. I think it's a great deal and the food is BOMB! If you are looking for cheap and delicious dinner, look no further. Monday through Friday from 3p - 6p is happy hour. OH and you can catch football here too for all you NFL fans out there.
