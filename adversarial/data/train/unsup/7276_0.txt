This place is like having a dirty little secret.\nIt is almost as if it's only for the dive\/hole in the wall elite.\nIt's like an exclusive little club with knowledge of the entrance to this place...\nNo sign, no front door, no parking directions...\nA mystery. A maze. A secret.\nUnless you speak Spanish and have heard about this place from every single Central American you know (ahem, thus how I discovered it.)\nMy friends still approach the place uneasily when I first take them there, but once they eat they become Salvadoreans at heart.\nPupusas and Platanos Fritos are my favorite items from this place! \nBeing of Salvadorean descent I can approve this place as seriously legit!\nIt's super cheap as well!\nWhy can't it be pupusa day every day?\nBecause then I would become a whale.\nFor those cheat days, \nThis place hits the spot!\nReal curtido and salsa, none of that fake or \"Mexicanized\" flavor (yes there is a difference lol)\nI really want a pupusa now... \n:-)
