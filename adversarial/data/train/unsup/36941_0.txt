The staff is so sweet and gentle here.  I was very worried about leaving my highly neurotic maltipoo with them when I was in town for a funeral, but they treated her so kindly I was relieved right away.  I can't speak highly enough of the staff.\n\nThe facility was very professionally set up, but I have to say that it smelled pretty bad.  My dog's fur actually carried the stink with her when we left.  Time for a deep cleaning crew, Bow Wow.
