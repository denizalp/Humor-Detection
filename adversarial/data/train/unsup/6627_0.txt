I've been here more than enough times to give them a 3 the place is packed with creeps that don't leave you alone.\n\nDrinks are nothing special food isn't anything I would come back for. I had a bite of a wing and that was that.\n\nTry to avoid the dance floor unless you like being grabbed and grinding on so take the long way to the bathroom.\n\nService is meh unless you have Victoria b.\n\nDon't plan on ever returning after st Patrick's day lol
