A typical hotel Cafe. We came here twice while staying at the Aria Hotel Casino.  The Cafe itself looks beautiful. Very modern with large windows throughout the restaurant, thus providing enough natural  lighting for most of the restaurant. The furniture is also modern like with comfortable chairs, quartz table tops, and posh benches around the booths.\n\nNow for the food. I thinks it's mediocre at best. The first time I ordered their Deuce Breakfast. It had two of everything such as eggs, toast, sausage, and bacon, pancakes, with my coffee. I thought the breakfast was a bit on the pricey side. The quality and what was served for $16.00 plus my coffee. The food was more on the bland side. Yes, the eggs and my sausage wasn't too good. The bacon was good, but had too much fat in it. \n\nThe second time there, I ordered their Spaghetti and Meatballs. I think that order was $20.00. Again I didn't think it was worth it. Proportion wise was fine. Enough for an individual to be content. However, the whole dish was bland. Tasteless sauce, and flavorless meatballs had me use plenty of salt and Parmesan Cheese for the spaghetti. I finished it only because I was hungry and didn't want to drink alcohol later with an empty stomach.\n\nOverall the cafe was a really nice place. The service was decent, while the food took around fifteen minutes. The waiter and waitress kept filling our glass with water and asked if everything was okay. They were nice! But the quality of the food needs to improve. I thought it's a bit pricey for what was served, and especially when its worst than cafeteria food.\n\nAnyhow, a great place but mediocre food. It can use an improvement please. Three stars.
