I was expecting more from their Winter Lights Festival and was completely underwhelmed. Sure, the half-million eco-friendly lights look cool. But, I was thinking they would have different holiday scenes depicted throughout the place -- like a giant santa display in lights, an LED display of reindeer or something like that. Instead they just wrap the lights around trees along their walkways. At least tickets aren't too pricey at $8 per person. There are some fun things for kids to check out. Kids can meet Santa (and their wasn't a line at all... much better than trying to see Santa at the mall where the wait can be a couple hours). Pix w\/ the big guy are free with your own camera or you can pay $10 for them to take a picture and get a print. There's also a sleigh ride and train ride that kids might like (for an additional fee).\n\nThe landscaping and architecture of Springs Preserve is gorgeous. I'm sure it looks more impressive during the day. I'll probably come back to check out their exhibits and hiking but I probably won't be back for the Winter Lights Festival. If you want to check out cool xmas lights the Magical Forest at Opportunity Village off of Oakey Blvd. is a lot more fun for both adults and kids.
