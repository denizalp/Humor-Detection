Hmmmmm . . . . . Everyone and their mother goes crazy for this place. I'm just not seeing it. We came here early on a Friday night - way before the crowds. The place was not full, yet it took about 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us, at which point we were told they were out of a number of things. The food menu is very limited, which is fine bc it's obviously not their focus or why we came. \nMy husband and I both chose signature drinks recommended by our server. We waited some more. While they were full of booze, they were not good. We found them to be syrupy-sweet and WAY overpriced.  \nI will say, the place does have a fun tropical vacation feel, but the drinks just don't make it worth it. If your looking for a mini-vacation getaway feel in Cleveland try Johnny Mangos. The drinks are on point and you'll pay half the price!
