This gym had several easy \"opportunities\" to earn my business. They dropped the ball, MORE THAN ONCE. \n\nI originally tried Mountainside Fitness, a couple months after opening at the Pavillions. At the recommendation of a former friend, who had just signed up. I found a 5 day pass online, printed it and took it there to check out the place and with the intention to join. I was trying to keep up my boxing training, and was happy to hear they had boxing classes there too. \n\nUnfortunately, every single time I would stop by to have a quick 45- 1 hr workout, I ended up there longer than I'd hoped, just wasting time waiting to be \"checked-in\" at the counter. I had originally asked for a quick tour of the facilities so I could familiarize myself with the gym and know what my options were. Apparently, the sales people were always too busy with other members\/customers. Ok fine. I'll just get a free workout near my house while I consider other gyms in the area. I'm not the one losing money here...\n\nTurns out, I was better off anyway. This place is a crowded magnet for all the former LA Fitness, douchey Scottsdale members. Bunch of Snotsdale pretentious, immature, bar rats crowding this location. I would've hated working out there eventually, being stuck in a stupid, over-priced contract. Thank you for having crappy customer service and saving me the hassle!
