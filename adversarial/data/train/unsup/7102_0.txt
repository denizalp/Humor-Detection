One of the worst dining experiences ever. Way overpriced...small 30-40 dollar wine list. Dinner was awful ,my wife ordered the shrimp and artichoke salad . Artichokes tasted like right out of can greens were funny tasting. I ordered fish and chips which the fish was like mush.Appetizer was 2 small pieces of toast with apple slice on it for 5.00. We would have gotten shrimp cocktail but the shrimp were 5.00 Each! So 30.00 for the average shrimp cocktail. Dining area same as old Winkin' Lizard with a new paint job. Half of the back area is taken by a couch and table with 1 chair on the side A couple were sitting there with the guy having his feet on the table...must of been from the trailer park .Keep going and pass this place up go to Parkers in Avon instead. Oh also we were both sick that evening from the crappy food...enough said.
