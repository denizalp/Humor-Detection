Small menu, low price, big portions. \n\nAfter weeks of pestering my husband, he gave in and off we drove to The Noodleman with children in tow. \n\nWe stopped by on a Sunday morning around 11 and to my surprise, it was already packed! I wrote my name on the list they have by the door and patiently waited. Note that the restaurant itself is small so you may have to wait outside until you're called. They should invest in outdoor seating, though the wait wasn't too bad, about 10 to 15 minutes tops. Walking in, you could see the open kitchen with glass shielding it, they have a bar with stools so you can dine and see how the noodles are being made. \n\nItems ordered:\n\nMongolian Beef Pancakes- $5\nShanxi Knife Sliced Noodle Soup- $8\nHot & Spicy Noodle- $8\nHomemade Zha Jiang Noodle-$8\nStrawberry Green Tea- $3.50\n\nThe portions are big but they bring out smaller bowls if you want to share. We started off with the Mongolian beef pancakes which were a mixture of been and onions, a little too oily but they still had a good flavor. My husband ordered the Hot & Spicy Noodles for himself, which he enjoyed a lot, they had ground pork, vegetables, bean sprouts, and lots of chili which made for a very spicy broth. I had the Shanxi Knife Sliced Noodle soup which consists of beef brisket, cilantro, cabbage, and green onions. The broth was very flavorful but the beef was too fatty and I was not fond of the noodles. My boys shared the Zha Jiang Noodles which consisted of ground pork, mushrooms, carrots, cucumbers, tofu, and bean sprouts it was a very flavorful dish and preferred it better than mine, unfortunately for me, they didn't feel like sharing their dish with their momma so I got the leftovers, ha! To wash it all down, we had strawberry green tea which was refreshing. They have a good selection of flavored teas which also include black tea and milk tea. \n\nOverall, I'd return but service needs to improve a bit. Our waitress was very friendly but she only checked on us once and I had to flag her down for refills.
