If you are a musician I would stay far away from this place as the owner has ripped off musicians in the past.  Some of the bartenders are good at what they do, but some of the others are usually inebriated themselves and getting any type of service is definitely out of the question.  From what I was told they recently were busted for serving alcohol to minors!  Also, you will occasionally see people lighting-up cigarettes right at the bar.  I thought that smoking in public places was banned in the state of Ohio?   Are not both of the previously stated a smart move on their behalf!  (Being facetious here)\n\nI will never step foot in this place again, and once again if you are a musician, beware of getting your hard-earned pay at the end of the night! \n\n- CR -
