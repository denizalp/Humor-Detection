Lord. Have. Mercy.  I have to admit, I didn't have high expectations.  In fact, despite the good reviews, I was kind of hoping they were exaggerated because then, I wouldn't have to be bothered with driving back out there.  Well, the people inside were great, especially Sherelle (hope I spelled that right). She was SO patient, explaining what everything was more than once.  My mother and I went in to get my son s birthday cake.  We didn't preorder, so I wasn't sure we'd be able to secure a 6 inch cake.  We hit the jackpot with a strawberry cheesecake.  We also bought brownies, I didn't try them, but my kids LOVED them. But the show stopper was the Pina colada mini cheesecake.  .   It was layers of flavor.  I tasted the pineapple, the coconut, the rum in every bite.  It was sinfully delicious.\n\nWe will definitely be returning.  I highly recommend Jazzy Cheesecakes. They also have a rewards program.  It doesn't get any better!
