Yay! Got there for a little 5@7 with friends and what a pleasant surprise for my wallet: between 5 and 7 PM a selection of drinks are at $5 and some appetizers are at $7. I had a Cosmopolitan, a glass of red wine, a beer as well as a beef and a tuna tartar. The service was quick, the food was ok .....At a decent price you get a nice spot for a little get together with friends.... I will definitely be going back in the near future.
