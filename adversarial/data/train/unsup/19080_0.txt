At the height of gaming in the mid 2000s gaming corporations were only getting bigger and better, it was decided that Las Vegas needed a step in the right direction by green lighting the multibillion dollar project that is now known as CityCenter. Even 4 years after its inception, it can still be debated on whether the turmoil that lead to erecting this massive collection of properties was worth it.\n\nThere were a number of issues, which could directly be attributed to timing, bad management, and financial handling that kept delayed construction and its eventual opening in 2009. For instance, 6 people died in the construction of the site, prompting a strike from the workers who were concerned for their safety after working on the project for what was then a non-stop 24 hour schedule. \n\nThen there was the 2008 world recession, which left a virtual hole in the Strip, leading to a major decline in tourism and money for the city. Delays ensued when the Dubai folks decided to sue their joint venture partners MGM for a breach of contract. Let's not forget that after it opened, it failed to land much fanfare for almost two years the rash (pun intended) of sunburning incidents due to the construction of the Vdara reflecting beams from the sun? After initial estimates of 4 billion to complete the project, the subsequent total cost was more than double, at a cool 9 billion dollars.\n\nThere is still The Harmon, a tower that was meant to be a boutique non-gaming resort that has never opened to the public. Halted after realizing there were major construction defects during the building process, it has been OK'd for demolition which is likely to happen later in the year or in 2014.\n\nWhether it was worth 9 billion or not, the general makeup of CityCenter is aesthetically pleasing. The Veer Towers (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/veer-towers-las-vegas) are a nice high rise living option on the Strip to those who can afford it. In all of its sunburning glory, the Vdara (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/vdara-las-vegas-2) is a pretty non-gaming hotel and the Mandarin Oriental (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/mandarin-oriental-las-vegas-las-vegas) is one of the nicest resorts in the United States, let alone Las Vegas. There are eyeballs widening from all corners for Crystals (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/crystals-at-citycenter-las-vegas), a mall where no limit credit cards can be happily utilized. The most well known property through the thick of it all is the ARIA (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/aria-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas), if not one of the better casino hotels on the south Strip, if not among the most scintillating.\n\nThe CityCenter, in spite of its initial problems, provides all visitors to the Strip luxurious options to spend their time in the City of Sin. It brings out a new dimension architecturally, a flashy range of eateries, venues, and entertainment, and will hopefully live up to all the hype it has built up for itself for the better part of the last decade.
