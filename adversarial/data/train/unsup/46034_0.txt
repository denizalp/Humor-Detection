Went into Bareburger this past weekend, trying to find a place in the downtown core, with space and a TV with the All Star Game! \n\nOverall really great place. I'm a huge fan of gourmet burgers and Bareburger didn't disappoint :) All of the burgers are customizable and the ingredients are organic! We tried the Supreme and the Grindhouse- which I highly recommend.\n\nService was A+ and the place itself was cozy and adorably decorated. \nOnly downside is it's a bit pricey. Our burgers were about $14 -and sides were an extra $4-6.
