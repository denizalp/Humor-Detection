First Pool\/Day Club experience in Vegas. I think it was about $70 and Tiesto was playing that day. There was a cut off time of 1pm so my friends and I made sure to get there on time. We got in and the place was packed. Even though it was a fun and unique experience, I don't think I will be going to any Pool\/Day Clubs anymore for a few reasons: \n\n1. It is pricey.. Can't afford going out during the day, blow Benjamins at casinos, and go out at night again to blow some more.\n\n2. Can't hang: Getting old so I get tired easily haha\n\n3. Not my thing: I rather go to night clubs honestly.
