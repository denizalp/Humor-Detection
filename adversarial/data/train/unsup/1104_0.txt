Great place for Thai food!\n\n4 stars - Panang curry with fried tofu. This dish also had slices of red bell pepper and onion. Panang curry flavor with some coconut milk for the richness. I wish there was more curry in it though, it would have given the dish more depth. \n\n4 stars - Drunken noodles with seafood. The noodles and the sauce were very tasty. They seafood included shrimp, squid, mussels, and imitation crab. \n\n5 stars - Thai tea really hit the spot! It was authentic tasting, had a nice sweetness, and was classically given to me in a glass where the tea was separated from the milk at the top of the glass. Mix it with a straw and have a sip! I wish there was crushed ice instead of cubed, that's just how I was raised on Thai tea, but small detail, so still a five in my book. \n\nGreat Thai food at this restaurant, that tastes home cooked. Who could turn that down?
