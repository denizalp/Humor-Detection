Train was delayed by 4 hours but did not update until 30 minutes before arrival. This continued for the total of 4 hours. There is no Wifi and only two outlets. I decided to take the train because of the speed and comfort of walking around during my journey. The cons outweighed the pros. It would have probably been better to take the Mega Bus. The Washington DC train is on a performance standard which means it is constantly being checked for efficiency in time. Right now it is at 30% :(. Not good at all.
