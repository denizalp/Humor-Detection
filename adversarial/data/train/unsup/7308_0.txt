I've been eating here all week since I've been in town and the food is absolutely great. it is always packed and is very reasonably priced.\nMy first day in Phoenix I paid 12.85 for french toast at the hotel across the street when I could have paid a only 3.89 for the French toast at the plaza Cafe.\n\nThe menu is easy to read and pretty simple. They have Bagels, sandwiches, French toast, candy, cake and hamburgers. So far I have tried the tacos, cake, a croissant sandwich and a club sandwich. The tacos were amazing! I wish I could have more\n\nThey have tons of drinks like Jones' soda, Naked Juice and even a soda fountain. Great beverage selection!
