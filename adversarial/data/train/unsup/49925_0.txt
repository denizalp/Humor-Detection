I can't say enough GREAT things about this new dealership.  (Tucson Mercedes will always be my favorite but if you can't make the drive, here's your next best option.)  As far as service, they were helpful and professional and refused to make negative comments about another dealership to the north who may have inflated their prices, which I respect.  They were quick, thorough and followed up to make sure I was 100% satisfied.  Thanks, Nick!
