This has become my favourite breakfast spot in town.\n\nThe first time I had been, I waited in line and sat at the long table in the middle. I perused the menu but knew I wanted to go with the Soul in a Bowl. Holy cow, the dish knocked my tastebuds out of the table. It was comfort food in the most delicious possible combination imaginable. Potato wedges, egg, chicken sausage, cheese curds.. oh my! I could not finish it by myself so took the rest to go, which was super easy because it already came in the most adorable little chinese take-out style box!\n\nFast forward a few months and I am back there with my mom for breakfast. Waited in line again (not my favourite, but I'll deal.. only because it's OEB) while we were offered coffee, etc. This time we sat at a table on the side, and I ordered the vegetarian eggs benny, and my mom ordered this cod and egg scramble, topped with kelp caviar. We were both SO impressed with our dishes! My eggs benny's eggs sat on roasted tomatoes, peppers, artichoke, and had no hollandaise sauce on it, but instead had a boutique olive oil. Phenomenal.\n\nOEB claims they have their own flock of chickens running around happy and laying eggs all day. This gives me a nice warm fuzzy feeling and much of this love I have for OEB comes from that. \n\nTheir menu is extensive, and I think each item is well thought out, and terrifically well-prepared. I have never had a bad item from here. All in all, this place deserves the long lineups outside its doors every weekend, even though that is the only thing that keeps me from coming back on a weekly basis!\n\n\nReview #23 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012
