Can I live here plz? Chipotle is like my heaven. I'm a vegetarian and really picky. They are polite at picking the onions out of the veg mix before they dump it on my taco. I always get smiles + delicious burritos. I've only had then better on my own stove. Want to know why? Chipotle cares and it shows in their grub. They use meat & dairy that is only from humane sources and advocate against factory farms. They also are obsessed with recycling..so many reasons to want to keep coming back. A margarita tops it all off perfectly. Make sure to take advantage of the free limes and squeeze em on your food :)
