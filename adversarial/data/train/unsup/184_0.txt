Easily one of my favorite hotels in Vegas.  I highly recommend this place to all of my friends and family who visit.  Here's why:\n\n- Great selection of rooms.  You really have 3 choices of rooms & service here.....Mandalay Bay has mid-level rooms\/service, THEhotel has great rooms\/service, and the Four Seasons has excellent rooms\/service.  The giant 2 bedroom suite at the end of the towers of Mandalay Bay are my favorite.\n\n- Parking is easy.  The self parking and valet parking here is so easy.  The parking garage at the rear of the property has easy access from Frank Sinatra drive or Mandalay Bay Dr.  For locals or tourists it's an easy in\/out.\n\n- Great selection of restaurant choices.  From high end restaurants to cheap eats, there's something for everyone....and it's good food too.\n\n- Lots of bars and lounges.  Everyone can find a place to have a drink and enjoy themselves.....from hipsters to regular joe's, there's something for everyone.\n\n- Decent limits on table games.  You can find $10 min bet blackjack here on occasion.  There's also a good selection of slots and other table games.\n\n- The vibe here is awesome.  I can't explain it, but I always feel good here.  The people and the vibe are always energizing.\n\n- Great entertainment.  The House of Blues and the Mandalay Events Center always has great entertainers in their lineup.\n\n- Walkway to Luxor.  If you want a different experience, you can easily walk to the Luxor via a connecting mall area without going outside.  This is huge during the sweltering Summer months.\n\nOverall, this place has a little bit of everything for everyone....and they do it well.\n\nWill I return?  You bet I will!
