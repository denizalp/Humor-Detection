Giant Eagle, why do you suck in my neighborhood?  There are never enough cashiers and the ones you do have move at the lightning fast speed of molasses!  Last week it took me 10 minutes to purchase a bottle of orange juice.  OY!\n\nThe people who work here are mostly friendly (I cannot fault you for that..thank you for having nice employees), I just find you lack overall greatness.  And sometimes, honestly, I just want you to check me out not have a crazy long and involved conversation with every person in your line.\n\nThe produce selection here is ok, but overpriced.  The seafood selection almost always is less than desirable. Please Giant Eagle Corporate peoples, fancy my Big Bird up a bit.  We're in need.
