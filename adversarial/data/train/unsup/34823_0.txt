First of all, all vet clinics care about making money - it's a business after all.  Secondly, I've had some negative experiences with vets before (Rosedale and Annex hospitals being the WORST), but I've never had a bad interaction with anyone at Banks.  They have always been understanding of my dog's needs and sensitive to my neuroses.  They never push on medications or services, but will make recommenations and suggestions.  We would often go for their grooming services and Mr. Scamper would come running out excited, all clean and fresh, with a fancy bandana tied around his neck.  I don't even live in the east end anymore, but we still drive all the way out there because that is Scamper's vet.  I also find their pricing reasonable and on par, or below, with those in other areas of the city.
