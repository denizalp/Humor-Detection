Met some friends up here the other day and had a pretty good time.  Great beer selection but a tad pricey.  Looks like a cleaned up version of the old Eddie and Iggys but with table and card games for rent.  1.00 per person\/game is a good deal I say.  Trivia on Thurdays.  When I got there it had just ended and numb nuts DJ dude had the music so friggin loud my back teeth were hurting.  Crowd is kinda nerdy but its better than the jock\/date rape lookin dudes who used to come in here.  All these new places opening up need to get some bartenders that understand they are revenue makers for the business.  There were literally 3 dudes, arms folded talking 3 feet from me while my empty beer can sat on the inside rail of the bar for well over 5 minutes.  Bartending 101.  I just got outa work and I need a damn beer or I might die!
