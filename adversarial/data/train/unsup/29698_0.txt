I called Dave at AZ Landscaping due to the good reviews here on Yelp. He originally scheduled an appointment in the middle of the afternoon, but cancelled a half hour before the appointment. I had to take a half-day off of work, so I wasn't too thrilled, but he rescheduled for Friday morning at 7am. Friday came and I ended up waiting until 7:30am to leave and go to work. When I called him, it sounded like I woke him up. I let him know that I was disappointed and that I had other estimates scheduled, so I would just work with those companies instead. He wasn't very apologetic and hung up. With all of the other available landscapers in the Valley, why take a chance with this one?
