If you want excellent friendly service and want to browse through a bigger selection than other Goorin locations than come to this one. You won't regret it!\n\nI've been to about 6 different locations throughout the west coast and I'm about 100% convinced that this is the BEST Goorin Bros store.\n\nMy husband and I came in and wanted to check out what they had in stock. For us it's always exciting to experience a new store. This lovely location opened up in March of 2014 and so far their doing an outstanding job.\n\nMy husband and I were helped by a young friendly energetic man who was very knowledgeable and very thorough on his explanations about how the hats were made and the Goorin logo to the detail of the feathers and much more.\n\nI must say that it was pretty darn refreshing to come into a Goorin store where people actually want to help their customers... loyal customers.\n\nAfter being in the store for about 30 minutes my husband and I left with 2 beautiful fedoras and some awesome accessories and smiles on our faces.\n\nWe absolutely love this Goorin location and can't wait to come back in the fall. \n\nIt's an EPIC 2 thumbs way way up for Goorin Bros Las Vegas!
