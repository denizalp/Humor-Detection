What a cool place!! I had heard so much about this place and just hadn't been in yet.. Finally made it last night. Chef Week featuring Tory Miller (He beat Bobby Flay!) was underway and the menu had been transformed into a special Japanese inspired selection. They had their original pies available too for the less adventurous. \n\nMy party of 5 ended up getting A LOT of food. The portions weren't huge so it was fun to order several and everyone tried everything. \n\nOur reservation wasn't until 8:15, so unfortunately when we got there several of the special items had been sold out. We were still able to find PLENTY though to leave us all with full bellies. \n\nWe tried:\nAgedashi Tofu: Not as firm as I would have liked it to be, a little bland\nDandan Pizza: The absolute BEST thing on the menu. SO GOOD. \nDdeokbokki Gnocchi: Also very good. The meatballs were incredible! \nJapanese \"Wafu\" style carbonara: Very earthy flavor with shiitake mushrooms\nKaraage Style friend chicken: FANTASTIC. Good ol' fried chicken! \nCocnut Rice cake dessert: Super delish and perfect to share. \n\nWe ALSO ordered a Fat Uncle Tony pizza off the regular pie menu. It was super delicious! Big chunks of meats and a perfect tomato sauce. \n\nI can't wait to come back and try more!
