I'm posting this in regard to the in-store Bakery. I've shopped at Giant Eagle out of convenience. I don't want to make it a habit. I will, however, skip the bakery from now on. In summer, the self-serve donut case was filled with flies, to the point that the Medina County Health Department visited to check the situation due to customer complaints. Hairs are often found on cookies and other items. Aren't sanitary procedures followed here? Walking by the counter, you can hear a lot of coughing in the bakery, which makes me think how much crap ends up on the food. Needless to say I don't buy anything at all from them. A new location in the store is being prepared as part of Giant Eagle's renovation...I hope that the new bakery is clean and they hire people who are not pigs. But still I will buy nothing from here. Most of their products arrive frozen and are simply heated in the oven. You might as well buy Entenmann's or Hostess- cheaper and I guess much more sanitary.
