I've been going to Paul at Above & Beyond Acupuncture every Saturday for the past 2 months. Prior to going to Above & Beyond, I had been to numerous doctors to see why I was having stomach issues and to see what they could do to help with it as well as some anxiety and stress related issues. I was a little hesitant with acupuncture, as this was my first time trying it. The experience has exceeded any preconceived expectation I had of what it would be and feel like. While the doctors I saw looked to stop the symptoms, Paul has worked with me to actually cure the underlying issues. I will say I have a holistic bias so I was much more open to the idea of using acupuncture as an alternative than some others might be. Along with the acupuncture, we have also done cupping. I highly recommend if it meets your specific needs and goals (don't be scared of the bruises). \n\nWhat to expect:\nThe first consultation you will go over what issues you have be having and dive into what they may stem from. Paul will listen and give feedback when necessary. After going over these, you're on the acupuncture table. He will choose the points that are suited for your specific needs. The needles are very thin and you barely feel them. On a pain scale of 1-10, I would give them a 0.25 when being inserted and a 0 when you have them in. Once they are in, Paul will shut the lights off and leave the room to allow you to relax. The first time I will admit that it felt a little weird laying there but when it's all over, you feel light, uplifted, and nostalgic. \n\nAfter the first session, you are more relaxed about the process and can go into deeper meditative states. At least that's what I use the silence and time away from the world for. \n\nEach week, Paul will discuss your progress and get an idea of how you feel, what's working, what's not, and where to focus on. \n\nAll in all, I would say it has been a great experience and it is well worth it.
