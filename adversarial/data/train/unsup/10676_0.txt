I have been here several times in the past but this time I came to try their lunch thali plate...what a mistake.\nI came on a wednesday a little after noon, the place was 3\/4 empty and the staff were at their usual spot, all grouped together around the cash register whispering. \nNot at all a very welcoming attitude. \nOur waiter was a mumbling low talker dressed like a young thug from the street.\nAbsolutely no class to be found here.\nWe order our food and he grunts away with our menus.\nI start looking around at others that have their food and notice that all the naan breads seem to be burnt. \n\nA sign of things to come.\n\nOur thalis arive seperate from the naan which comes several minutes later, burnt and nowhere near hot at all. Seems like they were just in a basket waiting for the last 15 minutes to be brought.\n\nThe butter chicken was as mentioned by others VERY SWEET and dry, WORST I've ever eaten.\n\nThe rest of the thali consisted of an oily vegetables side, tasteless rice, ICEBERG LETTUCE trying to pass as a salad, dry and room temperature tandoori chicken, yuck.\n\nAll in all a completely dissapointing tasteless meal served by a lazy uninspired waiter in a creepy restaurant.\n\nYou're better off taking your $12 elsewhere, anywhere else.
