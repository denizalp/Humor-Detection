WOW!  Freakin awesome pizza!  My wife and I were in The District for a mid-afternoon walk...not even that hungry but since we only come here maybe once a month I HAD to try this place after reading so many rave reviews.  This didn't disappoint at all.  The reviews lived up to all the expectations and I already can't wait to go back to try all the other pies they have.  \n\nWe just split the margherita w\/ half of it topped w\/ cured prosciutto and bite after bite was simply heaven.  I hope this place is successful.  Why the hell would anyone go to Metro after having this????
