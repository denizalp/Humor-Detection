stopped here with my little daughter after swimming for some ice cream.  they have  so many flavors to choose from!.  we both got small, I got her the smores and I enjoyed the mint chip.   gelato was really tasty and flavorful.  the only reason I gave them 3 stars is because the girl behind the counter looked sick, she was sniffling and just looked like she didn't feel well.  also I wanted to bring home a gelato for my husband so he could enjoy it after dinner, but  she helped the only other customer who walked in, and then disappeared, I waited like 3minutes another  said forget it I'll have to stop some where else and buy my husband ice cream.  which is a shame because they would have gotten another 2 sales,I was going to get him orange and  I was going to try the death by chocolate which looked amazingly dark and yummy too ! what a shame kinda ruined my expectations of this place since I've heard such good things about it...needless to say I won't be stopping here again
