So I was on hold since 10:40 for 20min and the phone cuts off I call back and they say we are closed, I explained the situation with the \"supposed manager\" named \"Kre\" who sounded like an adolescent child spoke very unprofessionally I found it hard to believe she is in the position she is in, she must have landed it by luck. Didn't resolve anything. And have no pizza unfortunately this is the nearest Pizza Hut.
