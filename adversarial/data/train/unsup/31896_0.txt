Usually my go-to Mcdonalds in Sun Prairie as they are the closest to my house. They have been remodeled recently and while I haven't checked out the inside quite yet, the drive thru has been redone. The last time I went through, there wasn't any monitors at the drive thru that allowed you to see what was being added. I'm not sure if it was only a temporary thing but the construction seems to be over so maybe it's not? The only problem I've had with ordering consistently is that I'll order a diet coke and receive a regular coke which is annoying and seems to happen more often than it should
