Let's put it this way: My wife just loves this place but my wallet doesn't.\n\nThis place has arguably the best selection of fresh and natural meats and produce in the neighborhood. While rarely crowded, there seems to be a following from folks who like all-natural products.\n\nThere's also a good deal of product sampling in here, which something I very much appreciate.
