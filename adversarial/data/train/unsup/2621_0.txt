This is our first (and last) AZ Moe's experience.  We lived 3 minutes from a Moe's in Ohio and always joked about the perpetual problems that NEVER got fixed.\n\nSomehow, 2000 miles away, the problems are identical.\n1.  Tofu is offered as a \"meat\" option but they were out of it.  The girl making the food didn't know where they kept the frozen tofu.  Same thing as Ohio.\n2.  Certain vegetables not available.  \"I showed up today and NOBODY had done any prepwork!  Sorry!\"  Again, same thing as Ohio.\n3.  One worker prepping food and ringing out on the register, and one worker rummaging around a freezer the entire 15 minutes they were in line (maybe looking for tofu?)  So, as the line lengthened with a Sunday lunch crowd, the poor girl became more and more frustrated.  (Yep, same as Ohio).  As I looked at my burrito sitting, getting cold, waiting for the girl to finish plating and ring it out, I just wanted to leap behind the counter and grab it.\n\nWe honestly do like Moe's food but there's some fundamental lack of management oversight to allow these problems to happen... over and over again.
