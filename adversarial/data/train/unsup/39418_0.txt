This place is cool, I went today after a horrible experience at bassett..... I had the scrambler it had pesto feta mushrooms and came with potatoes and a biscuit, oh mylanta do these fuckers know what they're doing. The plate was absolutely stunning I had to fight myself not to order a second. I skipped the dessert case but I definitely took a gander and it looks like they know what they're doing there too. Coffee sucks though.
