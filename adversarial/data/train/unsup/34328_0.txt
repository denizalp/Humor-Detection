awesome iconic eatery! whenever i visit az i make it a point to stop off at this ultra friendly, fantastic tasting joint. \n\nyeah, it takes a while to figure out the ordering process, but the staff is super helpful, and after the first or second time, one can figure out the system. it's just that everything is abbreviated which requires some thought. \n\ni usually mix 2 entrees to get different flavors. love the jerk chicken and fiery pollo diablo.\n\nalthough they are known for their snicker doodles, my dessert is usually ordering another entree to take home for later! \n\nhands down one of my favorite eateries. i wish we had one in minneapolis, mn...i would probably eat there daily for lunch, ha!
