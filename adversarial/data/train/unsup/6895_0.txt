One Sunday morning, I found myself wanting something sweet, high in calories, and doughy. A bakery of course could fulfill this need. But where to go on a Sunday morning when virtually nothing is open?\n\nI've heard people around town talk about the \"famous\" Oakmont Bakery. Lo and behold, it was open Sundays. I hopped in my car, packed a lunch, and headed there.\n\nWalking in the door, you're sure to be amazed. Almost every imaginable type of pastry, cake, bread, and other baked goods are available for sale. So that's impressive,\n\nTaste on the other hand, uh, no.\n\nI bought a few different items, some bread, a few pastries, cookies. Let me put it to you straight, there is nothing here that is any better than the partially hydrogenated soybean oil-laden shit at Giant Eagle.\n\nI asked the girl behind the counter where everything was made. She told me that day at the store. So at least stuff is fresh, but fresh crap is still crap.\n\nOk, I admit it. I'm a bread and bakery snob. So perhaps this store is good for people who like mass produced junk. As for me, I love stuff made with real ingredients like butter, eggs, flour. Shortening sucks, and this place apparently has stock in the shortening company.\n\nBottom line, if you're looking for run of the mill baked goods. Pick here or Giant Eagle.
