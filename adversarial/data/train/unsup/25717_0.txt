I cannot recommend Dr. Martin enough!  She saved my daughter's life during labor.  I have a happy,  healthy, thriving 2 year old now.  Dr. Martin is incredibly calming and soothing, her voice, her demeanor, everything.  I never felt rushed in any of my appointments.  She took all the time I needed for questions and calmed me every step of the way during my pregnancy.  She was present at all of my appointments and is present at just about ALL of her patient's deliveries, which I found, is not often the case.  Many doctors work in teams and someone on the team is there.  I felt strongly about having a female doctor and Dr. Martin was perfect!  She was exactly what I needed during pregnancy and delivery.  Very knowledgeable, very kind and a superb OB!  I am so grateful that she cared for me during pregnancy and delivered my baby girl!  I highly recommend her.  Her office staff and nurse are wonderful as well!
