EH. I needed to kill some time after checking out of my hotel at 3pm (flight was scheduled for almost 9pm), so I took a cab here for some shopping. While the interior looked pretty cool (the painted ceilings and architecture were definitely kitschy), the selection of stores was very mediocre. Quite a few souvenir shops, all of which sell the same crap. I went into a few stores I frequent at home, such as Sephora and H&M, but was unimpressed by most everything else. Also, while this is going to make me sound like a technology snob, I couldn't get past the fact that I couldn't get service while inside the mall. I ended up spending about an hour at a Starbucks on my iPad, and after circling the mall four times, went to the airport three hours early. \n\nI can almost guarantee that you'll enjoy this place more than I did, especially if you're drinking and with friends. I was alone and sober, so maybe I was just bitter and jaded.
