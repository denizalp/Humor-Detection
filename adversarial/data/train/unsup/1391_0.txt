You have got to be fucking kidding me. \nThere was no one in the restaurant. the place was a graveyard, yet no one thought it was important to wipe the tables or even sweep the floor. Crumbs and sticky stains everywhere. i ordered take-out before I got a good look at the place. While I waited for my order I looked around for a place to sit - no clean chairs. All had crumbs on them. Tables had folded-up pieces of cardboard shoved underneath the legs, balancing them out. One table had THREE cardboard balancers. All the chairs have chipped paint. There are stacks of sodas with a stained apron tossed onto the top of them - better wipe those bitches down good before you slurp, people!! The license on the wall reads 2008. HOLY GOD THIS IS 2010!\nThere is a BED that's not even hidden from view. Toothbrush and toothpaste and a shoerack! Damn, put that in the BACK ROOM not the FRONT if you so desperately need to do it. And give me a break - how busy can this place possibly get, that you need to sleep there overnight??? I shudder to think what the back kitchen looks like if they can't even pretend to make the dining area presentable. \nEven my dog wouldnt eat there... but since he's missing a leg, he might need to steer clear of this place before they try to stew him up. BTW I AM ASIAN so keep the racist accusations to yourselves, white weirdos. \nOkay, all joking aside: the place is GODDAMN DIRTY. PERIOD.
