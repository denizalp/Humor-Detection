The new ramen spot! I'm so glad this placed opened! Ramen fanatics have to try this place!\n\nI've had plenty of other ramen places and none of them really come close to the presentation, taste, and quality of the food! \n\nI would never hesitate to recommend this place. The staff is awesome and the vibes are cool. This place deserves the review haha and I hardly ever write reviews
