Airport lounge\n\nThis is a rather large Admirals club located between D\/E and the main concourse and well, it is big and airy and has free wi-fi and plenty of room to spread out while you do your whatevers while waiting for your flight.\n\nThere are complimentary snacks and drinks and clean bathrooms.  Great place to kill some time if you have a long layover.
