Many good things about this place maybe to make up for the service. 1) It's huge. 2) It has free, passwordless wireless. I'm really sick of finding small places in North York always packed to the gills with York and Seneca students and you can't get a table for a 45 minute sit down.\n\nI had the sweet 'n' sour fried chicken strips and rice. Oh heaven. It was good. For about $8 you also got a salad and spring roll plus a bubble tea. The salad and spring roll seemed more filler. \n\nNo weird stuffed animals in baby milk bottles for sale like Tea Shop 188. That just leaves me sad. And confused. http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz_photos\/Cy5VGp4Qhq6AI3Y9ukR2sA?select=3s0OsCuRC-QnlZYmLkb2Xw
