Supercuts!  A blast from the past!  I haven't been to a Supercuts in probably 20 years.  I needed a haircut and this was the only close place open on Labor Day.  Walked in and got my haircut.  This was the fastest damn haircut I have ever had.  I was in there less than 10 minutes total.  The lady did a nice job.  I mean, I get my head shaved with a 1 clip so its not too hard to do, but still, she did a great job, didn't miss any spots lol and trimmed my neck perfectly etc.  The only thing I didn't like was the price.  $15 and $2 tip is a bit pricey for a buzz cut.  I will look for a cheaper barber next time I need a cut but if I don't have any other options, I will come back here...its a few minutes from the house.
