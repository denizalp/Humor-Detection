I really like Chipolte especially their carnitas bowls with corn salsa! The reason for not receiving five stars is for the inconsistency of the size of their product. One time their bowl can weigh two pounds then the next time it can weigh 5 ounces with the exact same combinations of ingredients. It's the workers who dole out the portions that make it inconsistent. I don't know why they don't use measuring cups or spoons for the ingredients instead of tongs which are then eye-balled.
