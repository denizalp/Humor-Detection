I was so disappointed overall. I have been wanting to come here since the last time we  visited vegas.\nThe food really is just horrible. I got a Cobb salad which was bland just a egg cut in half with 4 little pieces of bacon. Plus the dressing wasn't anything to remember. We also got the Mac and cheese appetizers. Very bland no seasoning just fried mush.\nI didn't try the drinks so can't rate those but they looked pretty good. \nOverall... Drink here... Don't eat here.
