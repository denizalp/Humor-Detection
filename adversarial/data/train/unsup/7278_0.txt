Had dinner with a friend and had two of their Carne Asada Tacos, $2.99 ea.  To wash it down, I had a Dos XX Lager.  The Carne Asada Tacos are really good.  The Meat is fresh but the Cheese is what makes it great.  There's something about the Mexican Cheese they put on it that left me wanting more.  Next time, I'm tempted to try their 6 pack of Tacos for $15.99.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
