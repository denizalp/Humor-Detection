Great bar, friendly staff. My only complaint is about karaoke. When 85% of the singers are outside smoking and listening to the radio the whole time and only come in for their song but don't listen to or support anyone else singing it takes away from the experience and seems kinda shitty... They should tell people they need to be inside to hear their song called or they can't sing.
