Yes!! Finally, a decent Vietnamese restaurant in Richmond Hill. Most of the good pho is in Vaughan so I'm very happy a more convenient location popped up. \n\nThe menu is pretty comprehensive in its selection, and the prices seem to be lower than the average Viet restaurant. While the restaurant itself is spacious, they don't actually have too many tables set up. \n\nWe came here for lunch and ordered: \n- Spring rolls: A small order gives you two spring rolls, and they were pretty big. The filling was meaty and went well with the dipping sauce.\n- Bun bo hue: While the broth only had a tiny hint of spiciness, it was still very flavourful and not overly salty. This had a generous amount of toppings, including pig's blood, Viet pork roll and beef. A plate of purple cabbage was also on the side. \n- Beef pho with rare beef and beef flank: Broth was clear and light. Asked for the rare beef on the side as we don't like it to be overcooked, and it was very fresh and tender. The beef pho comes in four sizes so you have a choice to cater to your appetite. \n\nThe food came quickly and the service was very friendly. Overall, this restaurant is great for its value with its lower than average prices, generous portions and most importantly, good food.
