The queue too long for a green card?   Are you a Six Sigma Black Belt and want to practice what you preach? \n\nWhat can be better than a drive thru wedding?   They boast having COMPLETE wedding services available.   A formal wedding package is only $299!!!   Why do you want to even to go to 1789?.....or Ago Restaurant?....or a show at the Bellagio??....or get an Earl Sheib paint job???......when for the same money you can get married!!!  A great meal or show only lasts a couple of hours maybe 3 tops.   An Earl Sheib might get you through the winter.  A wedding is a gift that keeps on giving (especially if you are on the right end of the alimony payments)   This place redefines the concept of One-Stop Shopping.   \n\nAmbience:   Well you were the one that wanted to rent from Budget so don't blame us!!!\nSpeed of Service:  How fast can you drive your car???\nIntimacy:   As intimate as you want.
