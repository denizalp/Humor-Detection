Takes such a long time to get seen . After all test were done waited 3 hours then waited 2 more hours to tell me we had one more test to do \nGot there at 8pm got out at 2 am worse experience In a hospital . No rooms patients are on the hallways (on beds) staff is very low patience and bad service overall if I can give it 0 stars I will  . Don't come here they'll let you die .
