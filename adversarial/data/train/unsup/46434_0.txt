I usually don't do this, but I am going to say it was just o.k.  I went there for dinner to try something new.  I got the chole and my date had the dal makni.  We ordered the samosa and garlic nan.  I was going to order another appetizer, but the waiter said that you couldn't choose the spicyness of the appetizer.  He then explained that you are able to pick the spiceyness of the main dish.  This leads me to believe that the appetizer is pre-made and not made to order.  As someone from this region I am utterly sick of this kind of approach.  You are in the hospitality industry, bend to the wim of the customer!  The samosa's came rather quickly and there was 2 of them.  So, that means I got to eat one samosa and Elisabeth got to eat one samosa.  Would you even call that an appetizer?  Our dishes came out and they were not tiny, but not that great of a portion size.  Although you do get a salad with the small bowl of food and some basmati rice was it, maybe?  I am glad that we ordered nan and the appetizer because I would have ended up very hungry.  I like that they are trying new spins on Indian food, but there was nothing that really excited me and made me want to come back.  I did try some of Elisabeth's dal makni.  I have never had black lentils before so that sparked my interest, but it tasted like a dull combination of chili and soup.  The service was speedy, but the staff is like their food very unexciting.  Oh and I was going to order alo gobi and the lion stout originally, but there were out of both  :(\n\nP.S. - the website makes it seem as though there is a bar an area to hang out in, but there is no such thing.  The bar is basically the check out counter, it is very small.  I would hardly call it an actual bar.  You can order from like 7 choices of beer that come in bottles, no taps whatsoever.    It reminds me of what India garden when it was on Atwood would have, King Fisher, Lion, Sam Adams...etc.
