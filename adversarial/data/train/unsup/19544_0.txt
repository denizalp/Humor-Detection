Hands down best dayclub I've been to in Vegas. The venue is huge and has room to navigate around and the sound system and visual effects are mesmerizing. Make sure not to come when Kaskade is DJing. If you do show up to the dayclub on a holiday weekend, be prepared to wait 30 minutes to get drinks. \n\nLocation is highly convenient to visiting top golf after the dayclub for a bit of fun before heading back to your hotel
