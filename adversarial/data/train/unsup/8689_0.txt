It's been ages since I've had a poke bowl! Sweet Poke came to my rescue when a craving struck after a recent workout nearby. The online ordering through Yelp app is super convenient and I made a DIY bowl when I left the gym parking lot and it was ready just a couple minutes after I got here.\n\nBowls (and burritos) come in a range of premade options, but you can add on whatever extras you like. For the DIY, I used salmon (fresh, large chunks, good portion for \"regular\" size), with half and half base, garlic ponzu sauce, and a ton of added veggies. I really appreciate how masago, crab, seaweed salad, and avo aren't extra- and they weren't stingy with them, either! \n\nLocation is a bit dark inside and they have a current promo to add on a bowl of ramen- I didn't try it but it sounds like a great option with cooler fall temps on the way. Bonus points for having a refrigerated case of Asian bottled soda and tea drinks to grab and go!
