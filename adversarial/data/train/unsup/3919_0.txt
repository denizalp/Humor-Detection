I'm not in the habit of following incredibly handsome men in blue .  But just having watched the second BBC episode of Sherlock, this was reason enough and my inspiration to trace the footsteps of two of Toronto's finest (looking specimens) into Healthy Planet.\n\nCould it be the scene of a crime that I could help solve?  No.  The men in blue were buying supplements for their, we'd like to imagine, taut and rippling muscles.  The store was busy and organized like a rabbit warren at the front that made getting out of the store in a Sherlock Holmes discrete way difficult.  Loads of stock. Some items priced a dollar or two over what I'm used to paying (herbal teas).  I'm not a bodybuilder.  But if the handsome men in blue are coming here, it must be good.
