This place has switched up things a few times since they've opened.  They started with offering a variety of fancy grilled cheese sandwiches. I have never liked cheese, not even vegan cheese, so this option didn't appeal to me.  Then they began offering a sandwich of the month (which had some great features), but soon stopped.  Karaoke Fridays with a special flavor of vegan wings were a thing for a while, and I was really excited for this, but this too was over before I knew it.   \n\nSoul Food Saturdays is another thing of the past.  They had fried \"chicken\", greens, and red beans & rice. The fried \"chicken\" is not at all what I expected; it was more like chicken nuggets.  The greens were not southern greens, but they gave it a nice try.  The red beans & rice were pretty decent. \n\nI had a delicious strawberry lemonade cupcake here. It was sweet and very moist.  I never see them advertising cupcakes on their social media pages anymore, so I am not sure what happened.  \n\nWhen I was there on Soul Food Saturday, there was a man singing and playing his guitar live. He had an amazing voice and it was the perfect background accompaniment to my dine-in lunch. I don't know if they still offer this lovely entertainment. \n\nThey offer vegan donuts, courtesy of Welcome Chicken & Donuts.  They also offer bagel sandwiches for breakfast, which I have never tried.  \n\nThe employees were very pleasant, but the owner was unfriendly and cold. \n\nI don't drink coffee, not a bagel fan, and I don't eat cheese, so unfortunately, there is nothing to draw me here any longer.
