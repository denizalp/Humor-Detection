Since this is only a few blocks from home, I tend to frequent Copps. The first time I went to a Copps, I was bowled over by their rainbow of gorgeous produce( I had been frequenting Woodman's East because of location...which has scary scary produce). I think I heard angels singing...but maybe that was just the Muzak in the background...\n\nThey have a great selection of ethnic food(although not as large as Woodman's), a decent bulk section, and great meat\/seafood counter. The guys there are always pretty helpful. \n\nThe prices are a bit higher than several other chains in the area, but it's a great place to find those special items.
