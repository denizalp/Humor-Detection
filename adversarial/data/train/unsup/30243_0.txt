UPDATE: Revising my review to 5 stars. Kept going again and again, great restaurant. \n\nOriginal: I order the yellow curry as well and thought I was ordering Thai curry but was given Chinese curry or something else. I didn't like it but the owner refunded me the amount for that plate without me asking for that, so that was nice.
