I bought a regulator for my driver's side window through Showcase Honda's website.\n\nMost companies sell the regulator with the motor.  Showcase Honda apparently doesn't.  I bought the part I needed elsewhere so I have to return the regulator I bought from Showcase Honda.  \n\nI started with an email to the parts department and waited for a response.  After waiting two days I decided to call.  I was transferred to a guy in parts who told me that he's not the guy who handles that issue and that I would have to call again because he wouldn't transfer me.  \n\nSo I called again; the phone rang and I was sent to voicemail.  I left a message.  I waited a day and didn't get a response.  \n\nSo  I called again.  This time the phone rang endlessly.  I emailed again and got no response.  \n\nI called again today and straight up told the receptionist I need to talk to a manager.  Apparently there wasn't one available, but she would have him call me back as soon as he was available.  \n\nThe return policy is no returns after 10 days of purchase.  I've been waiting 5 days just to get a response and I doubt I'll get it before the 10 day expiration period.  \n\nCONCLUSION:  Don't buy parts online from Showcase Honda
