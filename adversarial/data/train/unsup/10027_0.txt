I have been here a few times now. Each time we had a different server,and each time they were good. Every time we came for Lunch we try to get there around 11:30am,  because, by 12 noon the joint is Jumping!\nThe Clam Chowder is good, not great . Salad ,just OK. The food is good,but my friend likes to go there all the time. I think It is a place you could visit once and awhile and be good with it.\nI have never had Desert here. But, they display them in the Showcase and they look amazing. \nI should of taken a photo,but I did not. They have the largest slice of cake I have ever seen. From one of the Tallest cakes I have ever seen.\nIt is decorated very Rustic, as if you are in a hunting lodge. It is very clean and parking is all around the building. So there is a lot.\nit is worth a visit. They are very friendly. The greeters in the front are very happy to see you.\n I like it.
