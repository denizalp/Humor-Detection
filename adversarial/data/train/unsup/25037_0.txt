I have tried several entrees and a wide array of the appetizers here and I would rate all of them a 2 or 3 out of 5. \n\nMy main complaint is that the chicken in all of my dishes,(orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, general tso's chicken, etc) has been rubbery, and often overcooked to the point of being hard and gross. \n\nIf you want cheap chinese delivery that is edible, then I guess this place will do, but if you want your food to actually be better than \"meh\" I wouldn't reccommend it.
