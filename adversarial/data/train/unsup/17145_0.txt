Oliver helped us a few times. We had a few issues in room. The person who cleaned room didn't vacuum. The floor was still with crumbs from my bf eatting chips the night before. But as we stepped out he had them take care of it. Oliver was so nice and took care of things quickly. Also helped us reserve a car rental for the next day.\n\nThen when we went to take a nap. The sheets had blood. Gross! So when decided to go get a snack and let one of the female check-ins and tell her the shower kept leaking water all over bathroom floor. I mean huge puddles. She waved resort fee for day. But i still wasn't feeling happy about it.\n\nWe did order room service. 68 dollars for food that came cold. They forgot my toast and mayo. But other than it be cold the food was good.\n\nBhalsma checked us in. Hope I got his name right. For my birthday\/graduation celebration he gave us a great view and a high floor. Got us checked in quick. I even got a card wishing me well and congrats for my celebrations. He was so nice amd had great info in where to go.\n\nThe pool was relaxing! Not like the other party spots. The tables should be wiped down by chairs though. And the poole should be open later for adults.\n\nThe hotel is low key and great to come back from the loudness. It is gorgeous and the employees  are so nice. Luxury is the trump.\n\nNo military discount which is disappointing when m life has it.\n\nYou can rent a car in the trump when u need it. Which is easy and convenient.\n\nMall right across street is great. \n\nStill here will update ....but at a three for me so far.
