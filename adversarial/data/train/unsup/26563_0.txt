I go to Dos Gringos for every UFC fight. I went last night for the UFC fight and that may be my last at Dos Gringos. The food was awful. There was 6 of us and not one of us enjoyed our food. The service was almost non existent. They are now asking for a cover charge which is good if it was comparable to other places that require cover charges. They really need to step it up for fight nights!!
