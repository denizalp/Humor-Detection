Place an order for pickup for pizza and wings. They did have the order ready as when they said they were. Got the pizza home and it still tasted very delicious. The toppings you can tell are fresh and at pretty good quality. The crust was done nicely and the cooked but still thin.  Wings were nice and crispy with mild sauce.
