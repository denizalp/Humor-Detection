Going here reminded me of a How I Met Your Mother Episode...you know the one where Marshall scours all of New York City to find the restaurant where he had the best burger ever.\n\nWell, after I left San Tan Brewery, I hope I never forget this place like Marshall did, because it was here that I have had the best beef burger I have ever had. And this beats Joe's Farm Grill as well as all the other hole in the wall places I've prodded my way into. \n\nWe ordered both the Stuffed Aegean Burger ($1!) and the Stuffed Mushroom Burger ($11). The Aaegean was the winner. It is a 1\/2 pound of beef patty stuffed with cheese, basil, and kalamata olives. It is topped with feta cheese and pesto aioli. The second both my friend and I bit into it, we looked at each other and were like no way. It's that good. No, I can't describe it. Can you describe Da Vinci's Mona Lisa? No, you cannot. The best I can do is that it was like Katy Perry's song, \"Firework\" was coming to life in my oropharynx. \n\nThe Stuffed Mushroom burger tempered my drive to give this place 5 stars. This is another 1\/2 pound patty of beef stuffed with cheese & mushrooms topped that is topped with swiss and Gordo Stout braised mushrooms. Both burgers were ordered Medium Well, but it seemed like this one was well done. Definitely a good portion of melted cheese and mushrooms, but the burger overall seemed drier. \n\nThe waitress was very helpful and attentive. The atmosphere was interesting. There was a group of 15 girls who had just got done with a dance recital that looked like clowns with all the makeup their moms had plastered over their faces....so definitely good entertainment value.\n\nTry the Aaegean burger. It's for your own good. \n\nP.S For your side, you can't go wrong with the house fries which are crispy and well seasoned or the jalepno cesar salad, which comes loaded with parm cheese, chopped tomatoes, croutons, and a hint of you guessed it - jalapenos.
