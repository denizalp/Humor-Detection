Went here last night for dinner. The place was very clean and unfortunately - sorta sparse. I guess the South Side doesn't appreciate Hawaiian food like I do. :( \n\nI had the Bulkogi short ribs. They were braised in this wonderful tariyaki-like sauce and were very tender!! I was in heaven while eating it and I tried my cousin's chicken katsu and it was wonderful! I loved it too!! i wish they had a bulkogi and katsu combo... but alas they don't! :( They have a pretty big menu and I needed a few minutes just to read through it all. and I didn't even get through it all! :( \n\nWhen our food came Steve is absolutely right! Our containers were BURSTING with yummy food! :) My ONLY complaint is that the Macaroni salad has onions in it. I hate onions. but that's just me. \n\nI am totally adding this place on my list of regular haunts. I know it's a fast food chain... but damnit it's GOOD! I look forward to trying the Span Masubi!! It's a giant piece of nori wrapped sushi made with SPAM!! How could that be bad?!?! I also want to try the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Noodle Soup. :) \n\nto my yelpers, I say GO! i know there's another location Phoenix... but if you're on this side and you want to dine in a clean and you're REALLY hungry and want to be REALLY full... and you love BBQ like I love BBQ and have a few extra bucks to spend and are willing to give a fast food chain a try... then give this place a try! Where the grill is always hot and the surf's always up! :D
