Zona Restoration is a construction company that specializes in water damage, mold removal and asbestos in Phoenix and the surrounding cities. Their attention to detail and quality of service are second to none. Water damage can be a very stressful situation and it's important you work with a contractor that specializes in this type of work and is licensed and certified. The longer you wait to have your property dried out after it sustains water damage the worse it gets. It's important to call Zona as soon as you notice the damage, so they can get out right away to start drying out the damage to help prevent black toxic mold from growing.  I would highly recommend Zona Restoration for any water removal, flood clean up, or mold removal needs.
