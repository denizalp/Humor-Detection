For the last few months I've had the opportunity to volunteer at The Las Vegas Mission. Had it not been for Terri R inviting me to join in this adventure I probably would not of come here on my own. \nOne thing I learned and I think is great about this mission is that they have residents. The residents are people that are going through a program to become drug or alcohol free. While going through the program the residents are placed into positions around the community. The positions can include security and working in the kitchen. Which also helps with placement into jobs once they complete the program. \nThere are two dinner services, one for the residents and one for those that are homeless. More volunteers are needed during the homeless dinner. \nVolunteering at the LV Mission has been a great opportunity. Marcus does a great job with organizing the volunteers. I highly encourage you to volunteer when your able.
