Lamb biryani and lamb kebabs were delicious and taste authentic.  You will experience cardamom, cumin, and rich spices in every bite.   Price and portion doesn't quite balance out yet but this is something they can fix with a bit of customer feedback (sometimes they give too much food for an order, and other times it seems they give too little).\n\nHope they last long because it seems they might close up if they don't start investing into some quality billboards.  Too easy to walk by them and not give this place a chance because their storefront advertising efforts are negligible.
