I really really really really really wanted to love this place.  Trust me.  I was willing to go to great lengths to love it.  The fact that it has all 5 star reviews from a ton of people that have less than 5 reviews total is a little concerning and shady in my opinion.  \n\nNonetheless, I am writing only in hopes that the management will take note so they can improve!  The place is small, awkwardly quiet and not really cozy by any means.  \n\nThe service was friendly, slow but friendly.  The rice was good, the naan was good.  The chicken however was not cooked through.  We had a couple different curry dishes and I cut into a couple pieces that literally had pink on the inside.  If it was a piece of steak then I wouldn't have minded.  But this was chicken.  Chicken under NO circumstance should be pink in the center.  Ever.  Never.  \n\nSo, needless to say that pretty much ruined my meal.  I tried a few other pieces that tasted suspicious so I really couldn't enjoy the meal.  The sauce was good and I was hungry but that still didn't make up for the wobbly, chewy, slimy, uncooked chicken.\n\nPlease correct this and I will gladly come back.  I would love to have a great indian restaurant in Matthews!
