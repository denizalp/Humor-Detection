This is as authentic as it gets! The hummus here is to die for! Way better than anywhere else in town hands down (Sorry Aladdin's you don't stand a chance). I had the falafel pita with tahini and it was the best I've ever had! So crispy and full of delicious flavor. This spot is a hidden gem!! Please check it out and I guarantee you will leave full and happy.
