3.5 stars.\n\nIt is getting increasingly difficult to rate restaurants in whole numbers on Yelp. There are so many places that fall just below a 4, but are better than a 3... Ah. \n\nAnyway, I will continue. \n\nMy friend and I were were feeling under the weather so we were looking to feed ourselves some steaming hot soup to nurse ourselves back to health. My neighbourhood favourite thai place was closed, so the next nearest place to me was Juree's. Off we went, with another relatively healthy friend in tow.\n\nParking was easy. When we entered the restaurant, we marvelled at how nicely decorated it was. We were quickly seated. I knew what I wanted right off the bat: the hot and spicy chicken soup. My friends ordered the wonton soup and the pad thai. We asked for an appetizer of spring rolls and some tea. \n\nThe food was good. Not exceptional by any means, but slightly better than average. My friends seemed to like it a lot, but even in the midst of a runny nose and Kleenexes galore, I still happen to be a food snob when it comes to ethnic food. What can I say? I have had better Thai food. The spring rolls were rather skinny, and the pad thai was more like a pad sew. But the spicy steaming hot soup was hitting the spot. We were sick and hungry, so we just gorged and \"mmmm\"-ed with our faces in the food. \n\nWe were all quite full by the end of the meal, and when they brought us the bill, I felt victorious. With tax AND tip, we paid $43. That's less than $15 per person. For all that food - warm and comforting enough to make some sick and whiny ladies momentarily feel better - that's a bargain.\n\n\nDisclaimer: If this review lacks clarity and makes no sense, its because I am still delirious and foggy-headed i.e. sick. MORE SOUP NEEDED.
