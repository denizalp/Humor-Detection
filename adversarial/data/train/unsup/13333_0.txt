If you're looking for rolls drizzled with mayo or stuffed with cream cheese, don't come here.  (Just wanted to get that out of the way!)\n\nNow that we've gone a second time, I think it's pretty safe to say this place is our favourite sushi place in Toronto.  \n\nWith only ten seats and two seating times (6pm and 8:30pm), make a reservation so you won't be disappointed.  \n\nThere is a menu for drinks with a selection of sake and beer.  \n\nA wet towel is given to each guest to clean your hands and to continue using if you choose to pick up the sushi with your fingers.\n\nThere is no food menu.  Everyone gets the chef's choice of fish for the day.  Everything is amazing.  The texture and taste of the fish is sublime.  We are talking straight up nigiri sushi---ranging from 18-20 courses with a small dessert at the end.  $80 per person.  Totally worth it.\n\nIf you want to have traditional, Japanese sushi, this is it. The range of fish is incredible.  Last time we had Uni (sea urchin) but since it's no longer in season, we were able to try other delicacies of the day.  I've never had Shima Aji (striped jack\/white trevally) before.  That was so good!  You can't find this just anywhere either!  \n\nI can't compliment them enough.  Service was extremely friendly and welcoming.  The pacing of the dinner is very comfortable.  You can savour each piece and never feel rushed.  \n\nI hope they get to the point where they are booked weeks (months?) in advance.  I want to see these types of places succeed.  You can tell the chef really cares about what he's serving and is maintaining high standards.\n\nI've already recommended Yasu to numerous people, some of whom have already been and plan on returning as well.  I love making a recommendation and having it so well-received!
