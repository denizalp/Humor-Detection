I will NEVER use this place again and will NEVER recommend this particular store to any one.  The service at this store is terrible and quite honestly I am not impressed with their product either.  We were in there a little over a week ago to make arrangements for four rentals.  Nothing but shoes were tried on!  My husband went in for a fitting in California, not only was he measured and tried everything on but the service was nice and professional.   $800.00 in tux rentals and we have to ask to have them steamed!  Oh and to top it off you give my son a childs size shoe with an adult size tux???   Professionalism and service should be a priority, especially now days.  Four people in the store and only one actually helping another customer, the other three were watching a video, which was unacceptable.  Then there was the personal phone call on the company phone...I don't care that you had a baby 5 months ago or that it was a girl this time, which you announced very loudly! And I don't care that you have a new manager (apparently they aren't doing a very good job either) and I don't care who is there and who is gone.  Hang up the damn phone and take care of your customers.  And another thing, if you are going to steam a tux maybe it should be cooled before putting it back on the hanger and you should make sure that all folds are straightened.  I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN and I suggest you don't either!!!
