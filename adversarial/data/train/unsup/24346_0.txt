Wells Fargo is truly an evil bank!  They bought Wachovia that was a great bank and ruined it.  They have been charging me $10 per month fees for a savings account I told them to close many months ago while paying zero interest!  Wells Fargo is a bunch of criminals and should be put in jail for theft!  They have the worst customer service!  JP Morgan Chase is 100X superior and I highly recommend you avoid Wells Fargo at all costs!\n\nWayne Gorsek
