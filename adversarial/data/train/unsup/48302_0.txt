Horrible experience. They wouldn't fax or email my cancellation form because of identity issues. Pretty sure my own name is on my email and you can confirm with phone number DOB, etc. also, as I was signing the cancellation sheet I noticed the guy at the front desk already filled MY form and said I had a \"great experience\" I remarked it saying it was \"poor\". I was pretty upset about that. I don't think he should vouch for clients. I wouldn't recommend t his place. There's more gyms closer.
