Food taste like shit as well as their customer service. They can't take criticism at all and the owners flip out for the truth. I saw them from kitchen NIGHTMARES from chef Ramsey, let me say it's far worse then a nightmare. I decided to go check it out myself and see if it is actually what the show presented them to be, they're not lying the owner is delusional.
