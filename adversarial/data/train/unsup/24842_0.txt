Ok I just loved the chicken Parmesan and Swiss over potatoes. Soooo good!!! And soooo much food. My love ordered some burrito and normally I would have asked what kind and took a picture but I was starving and since I took one potato and cheese sauce I was done one picture and started scarfing down this yummy meal. I did pop my head up fans ask how his burrito was, he said really good. Then I was back to stuffing my face. Lol. \n\nMy complaint is the margaritas weak as hell!!! That frozen slush tasted like a slurpee from 7-11 I had mango and he had strawberry after asking our server if there was any corn products in them because he is allergic to corn. She said not in the strawberry but yes in the mango. Oh and they were out of passion fruit btw I love passion fruit anything!!! We there must have been corn syrup in the strawberry margarita because he got violently ill like he always does when corn is involved. This is why only one star. We checked with our server about corn in his food and his drink and told her that he was allergic to corn and corn products. Apparently their staff is not trained on food allergies. I'm guessing fructose was in the margarita mix which is a corn byproduct. \n\nHad that not happened we would have given them 5 stars.
