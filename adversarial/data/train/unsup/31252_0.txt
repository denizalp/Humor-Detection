Showed up with an entire atom hockey team on very short notice. We had one waitress handle the entire group and she did a fantastic job. I love St Louis wings, they are just a little different from everyone else. You always get fries and dip with your wing order too. I will say however the wings were a little small and not as good as some other St Louis locations.
