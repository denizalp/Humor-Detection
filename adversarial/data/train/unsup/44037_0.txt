Food 3\/5, Server (Utah) 5\/5, Hostess 1\/5. We were driving up Yonge for fun and randomly looking for a new restaurant to try & came upon Lone Star.\n\nUpon entering, the young hostess w\/ long dyed reddish hair had a very cold demeanor. We were seated in the middle somewhere. However, we had wanted a booth (there were only 3 of us). This was close to 8pm in the evening on a Sunday & there were many empty booths (at least 8 +). However when we enquired for the booth, the hostess said they were reserved (really now?) & that the booths are for more ppl. One hour later, it was clear no one was coming. Also another party of 3 came in shortly after us & got a booth (seated by the same hostess)! Wtf? When asked about it again, she said nothing. Another guy came to her defence but his explanation made no sense. Excuses. Gotta love it. \n\nThe best thing about Lone Star were the FREE salsa & nachos. Had two of those!\n\nI ordered the ...\n\nCabo Tacos - Mesquite-grilled chicken with bacon, Jack cheese, fresh avocado, topped with crispy corn tortillas straws and brushed with our house-made Tomatillo & Poblano pepper sauce. \n \nIt came w\/ two tacos & I was so stuffed. The food was alright and the portions were generous. Our server Utah was excellent. However, the hostess's attitude really did it for us. We are not coming back again.
