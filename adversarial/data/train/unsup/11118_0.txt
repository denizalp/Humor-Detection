Ecstatic...\n\nThat's how I felt when I first arrived at this outdoor skate trail (ice in winter\/in-line in summer). A 250m 6-15m wide outdoor skate trail located in the West end of Richmond Green's Sport Complex. The trail is open daily, weather permitting from 10am to 10pm. The trail is full of trees in and around.\n\nThe best time to skate is weekday nights from 9pm-10pm as it will be much less crowded then early evening and the weekends. There are lights throughout the trail and they blast oldies such as Sugar Pie Honey Bunch and Mr. Postman all day all night. Unfortunately hockey is prohibited. At 10pm a zamboni comes to flood the trail. \n\n*go at 11pm and skate all night in the dark.
