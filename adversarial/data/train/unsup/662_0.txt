Yumminess! Really that's all you need to know! I was able to sample many Flavors before making a decision.  I finally choose the Creme brûlée and coconut! My favorite Flavors! \nYou can order one flavor, two Flavors or three Flavors, the dish size is bigger for the number of flavors but I'm pretty sure you can double or triple dip one flavor. \nDesyree welcomed us to her store and introduced herself! It was very refreshing for an owner to want to meet you! \n\nKnowing this place is 10mins from my work, is dangerous. I'll be back!
