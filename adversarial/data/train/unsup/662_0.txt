The guys behind the counter? Nice but stoned.\n\nThe pizza? Expensive, high quality ingredients, good crust, affordable with the coupons they have. The mexican was great, the Thai was lacking flavor, and the BBQ chicken was pretty good! \n\nThe salads? Borrrrrrrrrrrrring. Despite the descriptions, they're just lacking serious OOMPH!\n\nThe breadsticks? Like Drake sang, \"best i ever had... best i ever had...\"\n\nThe decor? Something about the lighting weirds me out.\n\nAll in all? It's close, it's open late, I love coupons, I will keep coming back
