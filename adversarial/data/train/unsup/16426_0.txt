I hadn't been to the dentist in quite a whole, so I knew it wouldn't be pretty. The whole office made the visit very comfortable and simple. My treatment plan was explained very clearly and my payment options were very clear.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone needing dental work. Rebecca up front has a great attitude leaving a great first impression, Dr. Valenzuela made everything very clear and comfortable, Ruth her assistant had a great attitude making it an even better experience, Lani the hygienist made the process simple and as comfortable as possible, and Ferdie made my temporary crowns very well and placed them perfectly. Thank you to the whole team. Wonderful experience.
