It took a while to find a provider here I could trust with my oral health. I'm glad I waited a while to find someone as they were phenomenal. The office was gorgeous and had an amazing ambiance. They had a wide selection of complimentary K-cups when you enter the waiting area as well. The staff was very kind and friendly. My dental assistant was caring and showed me everything I needed to know in great detail. It was wonderfully refreshing. I can't imagine going anywhere else after this.
