I ordered food online on Christmas Eve and trying to have a relax night with friends. It said on the confirmation email that the order would be delivered in an hour, so we were just waiting in patience since it was Christmas Eve. Until an hour and half, we were still waiting and we tried to call the restaurant numerous times with no one answering the phone. We left few voice messages and we were angry with hunger. \nThis restaurant is ridiculous! Will never ever go to this restaurant or order online from it. Even if it's Christmas Eve, it doesn't give them any excuse to mistreat their customers. I got no call back from them nor know if they even got the order at the first place.\nWe ordered thru JustEat.com, after that, we did a complaint and got our refund back.\nHonestly, I've never tried the food so I can't judge the quality of the food. However, some of my friends have dined-in before and they don't recommend it. I ordered because it was almost the only Japanese restaurant open for delivery at that time and we were craving for it.
