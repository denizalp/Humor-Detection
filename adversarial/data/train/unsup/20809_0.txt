It's been almost two months and still no mug. When I called the store to ask for an update (IMO they should have called me themselves to update me on the order status) I was told that they were waiting to place a large order and would lump my mug order in with that one. Could they not have called me to tell me this? \n\nIn the meantime I could probably have ordered the mug from Poland directly and received it in the mail. I could be sipping hot, perfectly spiced chai on my patio using this sweet mug by now. And I dunno if you've ever received mail from Poland before, but it takes extraordinarily long. \n\nWhy do I get the sneaking suspicion this review is quickly going to be downgraded to one star?
