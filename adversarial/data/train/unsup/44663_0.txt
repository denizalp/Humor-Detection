The food here is good, I work nearby so I usually come here about once a week. The staff is friendly and they have a CD that usually plays in the background containing a spanish version of the song \"Achey Breakey Heart\", which is just as bad as the original even though I can't understand the words. The portions are large, there is a full salsa bar and for the price you get a great meal. I'd recommend it.
