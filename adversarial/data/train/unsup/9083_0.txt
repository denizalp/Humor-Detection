IN-N-OUT IN MAH BELLY!\n\nSo freaking good it's almost criminal. Small menu here but what they do they do most excellently.\n\nAs we had a long ride up to Sedona today and needed to get some gas in the tank I noticed the sign on the highway for this In-N-Out location and made a bee-line for it after hitting the gas station. Did not want to get all bloated and sleepy by ordering off the \"secret menu\" so I went with the basic crave satisfying meal of a double double, fries, and a Neopolitan shake.\n\nGood beejeezus this burger is like an orgasm in your mouth! Two beef patties of juicy goodness, fresh lettuce and tomato, crisp onion slices, and a soft buttery bun. Oh my! Decent enough fries and a thick delicious shake to wash it all down. Just ridiculously tasty! \n\nThis location itself is super clean with a cool retro look to it like back in the 1950's. A bunch of tables outside on a front patio that we ate on with the perfect weather out today. It just doesn't get any better then this!\n\nThat little devil on my shoulder kept taunting me to eat another burger, but I had to resist. Sedona was calling and it was a long ride. After this I already needed a nap!
