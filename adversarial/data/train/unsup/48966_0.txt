Food was mediocre. When I dine in Vegas I expect way better quality. Burgers were huge but no flavor. Salads was disgusting! Honestly worse salad ever. McDonald's salad tastes better :-\/ friend loves guy but he was so disappointed in the restaurant. By the way he order what the waiter recommend was the best burger they had.
