This used to be my favourite place until they barely put any salad on my plate!! \nOver priced ! \n\nThe girls working there don't care about anything but talking to each other! Why don't you exchange numbers and chat over the phone! After shift !! Very unprofessional ! I've brought a lot of friends here and last time I came was delt in a very rude manner! Standing infront talking, why don't u just hire less people?  Rolling eyes is there profession ! Etc but if ur afghani u get smiles and 6 star treatment! ! Unacceptable ! \n\nnot happy!never coming back!
