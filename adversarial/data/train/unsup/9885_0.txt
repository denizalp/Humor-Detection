One of the worst experiences I've ever had in Scottsdale.  These folks need to head back to NYC and take their terrible food, service and bad attitude with them.   \n\nI cannot believe all the good reviews here.   \n\nThere were eight of us so they automatically add the tip and boy did we pay for it.   The terrible waiter who admitted he was from buffalo complained about us right to our face and the odd thing is we didn't do anything at all.  Owner came over at the end of he night and told me that you don't have to like everybody as he doesn't like his ex wives (?) and they didn't need our business as they're always packed. He also suggested I write a terrible review so I thought I should.  \n\nFood is expensive and below average. \n\nDefinitely not worth it.
