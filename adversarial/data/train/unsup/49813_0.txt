Salmon overcooked\nWaaaaaay overcooked. Ends were crunchy\nI politely told the server and a second puece arrived - waaaaaassay undercooked. Due to hunger, a lack of a rental car, a lack of eateries nearby to walk to in 109 degree heat - i ended up eating the crunchy one.\nCome on. Cooking a piece if salmon is a freaking challenge? Who is the cook? A Denny's dropout?
