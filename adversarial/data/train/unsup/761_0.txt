Found this place on Yelp while visiting the world's friendliest people (insert sarcasm here) at Hollo's Papercraft. We had the Big Show & Strawberry\/Spinach\/Goat Cheese crepes which were awesome.  Friendly place with nice, cozy atmosphere. Kinda long wait for the food but worth the wait. Will be back next time we're in the area for envelopes.
