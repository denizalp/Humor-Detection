I will say this is the most popular Chinese restaurant in sauga. We were expecting this chained restaurant to be opened here long time ago. \n\nThere is always a line no matter when we come. However, the waiting time is manageable, somewhere between 10 to 20 mins. \n\nThere are a variety of food, from Chinese congee, dim sum, stir fried rice and noodles, westernized chinese food to seafood, rice noodle soups and drinks.\n\nThe quantity for each dish is plenty and it is always recommended to have a group of people together for sharing. For individual diner, the food is a bit pricey but can be packed for the next day. \n\nI have been here for more than 10 times within this year and will come often after since the taste is good and it looks relatively cleaner and healthier than other food choice.
