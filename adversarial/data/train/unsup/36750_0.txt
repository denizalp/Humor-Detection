This place is a COMPLETE PRICE GOUGING RIP OFF!   I had a mere sliver under my fingernail to deep to remove myself..... and I am fully covered with insurance.... \n1st the Urgent Care Center and Doctor billed separate.   \nThe Urgent care bill was $578 -- for admitting me to a room, my portion $268 \nToday I received an entirely NEW separate bill for the doctor...$223 for his services of removing a sliver from under my fingernail.   NEVER EVER EVER EVER AGAIN would I use this service and feel I have to WARN others, had I read this review I WOULD RUN FAR AWAY .... they have limited capability to deal with anything serious outside of the flu or minor injury, I asked they will only transport you to a hospital\n\n2nd my experience of  $891 billed $491 out of pocket for a sliver under my fingernail, which they charged in total  PRICE GOUGE YOU TO DEATH.....$891 for a less than one hour sliver under the fingernail............. used a very basic medical kit, saw the doctor a whole 10 minutes..... this rate prices of this place are BEYOND OUTRAGEOUS!!!
