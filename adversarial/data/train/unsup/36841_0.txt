I came here for their 3-course lunch special. This place is gorgeous. The service was amazing and the price was right. When I first walked into the restaurant, there was a strong seafood\/cooking odor so I got a table outside. If I have plans after meal, I would definitely sit in the patio to avoid the cooking odor from sticking to the clothes. I got a lobster pasta for $10 extra but it was bland. Everything else was decent.
