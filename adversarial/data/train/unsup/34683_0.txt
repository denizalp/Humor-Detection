If you are looking for a relaxing, stress-free, quiet spot to stay in Vegas, this is your place.  This hotel is very off-strip but there is a free shuttle that takes you to and from the strip. So you can have your quiet relaxation and party on the strip at night.  Our 2 bedroom suite was very clean and well appointed. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  They even host cookouts by the pool for guests. They have other activities on-site, like board games and a putting green, but we didn't get a chance to participate in those activities.  I would definitely stay here again!
