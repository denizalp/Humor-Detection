When I'm near any sort of place that sells sweets, I must stop in and try it out. As we did with Insomnia Cookies. We went to lunch at The Dog Haus and spotted Insomnia. The plan was set to grab a cookie or 2 after our dogs. I got a Snickerdoodle and Doug got the Chocolate Chunk, they were good just nothing that would make me go back, especially since they are almost 2$ a piece and they are not huge. \nI'd say skip it unless you are nearby and really craving a cookie.
