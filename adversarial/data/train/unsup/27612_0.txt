Great good, great staff. Love the light fixtures and tables. The homemade mozzarella is amazing. The pizza and scissors are fun. Great place for family dinner or night out with friends. The chandeliers are pretty and the tables and chairs are all mismatched in a charming way. It's comfortable and homey but not in a cheesy way. Staff is always chatty and friendly. They sign the cheeseboard, which is a cute touch.\n\nDesserts are really good but if you have to choose between appetizers or desserts, the apps, especially the mozzarella are the best so Go that route.
