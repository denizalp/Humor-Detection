dont get me wrong, the show is amazing... saw it a couple years ago, and it was wonderful...\n\nHOWEVER.....\n\ncame back to see it again for my birthday and so my better half could experience it as well.  We went an hour early to the box office in our hotel to pick up the tickets only to find out that they showed up as unavailable.  When i called the mirage directly, they offered no explanation only saying that the tickets were RESOLD........  \n\nNo refund\nNo transfer\nNo manners\n\nthe girl on the phone was significantly good at marginalizing my concerns and offered no form of compensation for THEIR MISTAKE!\n\nhorrible horrible experience and i will certainly not be patronizing the mirage ever again.
