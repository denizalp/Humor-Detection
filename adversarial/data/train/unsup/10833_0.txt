I just went into the flower shop during normal business hours and was told that there's nobody able to work there so I cannot get a flower they asked why I was there. I told him I was there to get flowers and they said we're sorry you can't get any flowers here I said but isn't this a flower shop and they said yes but unfortunately we don't have anybody that is working.
