I only go to see movies here. Correction I only go to theatres to see Marvel movies...AND I only see them here. \n\nI won't see anything but Marvel movies in theatres simply put because everything else is too risky to suk a$$! Marvel movies are reliably worth spending money on...and worth spending a lil extra for the fabu VIP stylez viewing experience. \n\nAt VIP u can be guaranteed of several things:\n- NO KIDS!!!!!!!! \n- BOOZE is available! And decently priced. \n- All food, soda and snacks including popcorn are WAYYYY overpriced (and the only reason I knocked a star off)\n- Your Marvel movie WILL be 3D and the glasses work beautifully\n- The bathrooms are always clean\n- You can get served at your seat until the movie starts\n- It's a theatre u actually will wana hang out for at least a bit (before or after the movie) in their lounge\n\nNext Marvel movie expected Guardians of the Galaxy (2) May 2017...see u here!
