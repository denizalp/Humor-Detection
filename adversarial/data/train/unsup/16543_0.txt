The cheapest buzz in Vegas!\n\nFor $14, you get a plastic glass of alcoholic slush that is nearly as big as you are sitting down. You also get to sample all the flavors you want and mix them as well. I got the 190 Octane, which was the orange concoction that I later found out had everclear in it. Well, that explains why I passed out right after lunch.\n\nYou can also come back for refills for a few bucks less. It's definitely worth, definitely delicious, and definitely strong. You won't regret it!\n\nOh, and you can add an extra shot for a dollar, but you probably won't need it! They're pretty strong already.
