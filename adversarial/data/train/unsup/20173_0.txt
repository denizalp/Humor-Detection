This was actually the first of many venues visited by myself and my fiance (now husband) for our wedding ceremony.  The photos online look amazing, and we were anxious to visit the property.  We called and made an appointment, and arrived a couple of minutes early.  We stood in front of the open door of the office for nearly 20 minutes, all the while the two employees inside (who could clearly see us) joked and laughed.  We finally stepped out back to take a tour ourselves.  \n\nWe were not nearly as impressed as we thought we would be.  The place is in need of major repairs, and the attention to detail just isn't there.  The windows looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in a very long time, as they were coated with smears, fingerprints, goop-like substances, and a layer of the desert's dust.  The floor of the main ball room was absolutely disgusting, and the women's and men's bathrooms smelled HORRIBLE (seriously, they smelled like a well-used Port-A-Potty after midnight at an all-you-can-eat deep-fried sausage event).  \n\nWe were just about to walk out the door when one of the two employees who had been jibber-jabbering in the office came to stop us.  When we told her that it was over 30 minutes past our appointment time and we needed to get going, she inquired as to why we just didn't come into her office and sit down.  Really?  So it's our fault that we didn't begin the meeting on time?  We told her that the place just didn't look how we expected it to look. She remarked that they had had a big event the weekend before, and that the place still hadn't been cleaned.  That might be true, but there were things that looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months!  \n\nFurther, the \"castle\" is situated in an industrial area which is currently under construction.  If you're planning an event that does not take place in the evening, construction noise is a very real possibility.
