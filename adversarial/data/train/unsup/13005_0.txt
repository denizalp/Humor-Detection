Ok, Listen up. I wanted delivery, and this place had good reviews. I ordered Chicken Satay and Beef Num Tok salad.\n\nWARNING: I used the online order form. Which was stupid. Why? I realized after the fact that the ORDER FORM IS NOT SECURE. To all those hackers that have my credit card now: You're welcome!\n\nThe order form asked how spicy I want my beef num tok, on a scale of 1 to 10. I said 3. \n\nThe website says my total is $20.27. This includes their $2 delivery fee.\n\nOver an hour later, the order shows up. The receipt says I owe $24. I said, I thought it was about $20? I wasn't near my computer. She said, no this is how much it is. I trusted her. She was wrong! I tipped $4 and paid $28 for $17 worth of food. Yay!\n\nThen I brought my food inside. The satay was good. The beef num tok salad was HOT. I would rate it 7 on a spicy scale of 1 to 10. My mouth is on fire now. I have no idea why it's called a salad, as there's one piece of romain lettuce under a pile of scorching hot beef and cilantro. \n\nI got ripped off, the food was so-so and chances are someone is running up $500 in vodka in Romania right now. \n\nFuck you, Corner Thai Kitchen.
