Came here armed with a BOGO coupon for a weekday dinner. Selection and quality were just okay, nothing stood out. Effort seemed to be made for presentation but not so much for flavor. I am not a fan of how loud this location is, right on the casino floor with a half-wall surround- it's like sitting next to a slot machine.\n\nPROS: Lots of seafood dishes even on a weeknight, made-to-order pasta and stir fry stations, attentive service, house beer and wine included in dinner price. Even at 8:30, half an hour before close, staff were bringing out fresh food and replenishing dishes. Dessert section was better than expected.\n\nCONS: Whoever rolled the sushi doesn't know what they're doing- even AYCE spots that are intentionally trying to pack in the rice aren't this obvious about it. Some dishes were just improperly made, like the jambalaya and paella dishes that each had unpeeled shrimp, with legs falling off and getting all over the pan. Many dishes were barely lukewarm. \n\nAs I left, I was waffling between two and three stars and intending to round up- it's not a place I'd return without a discount, and I prefer Red Rock for similar price and off-Strip location. Rounded back down when my boyfriend got sick the second we pulled into our home drive way.
