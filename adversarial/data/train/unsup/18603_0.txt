First of all, yo Yelpers, this place is not fast food joint. It is a Gourmet Vietnamese Bistro which prepares your food fresh to order. So, if you expect to get your \"mush\" in a rush, I highly suggest calling ahead. The staff here is courteous and accommodating that you won't have a problem picking up your delicious and hot food to go. Second, I am an avid fanatic of this uber yummy, awesome reinventions of traditional Vietnamese cuisine -- with an urban twist so it's chic and oh la la, so GOOD.  As a self-confessed purveyor of all things delightfully delish, I think that the grilled pork vermicelli is Da BOMB and cannot be beat! try even the awesome wonton soup or hey, go lighter with a veggie Banh mi - this place doesn't disappoint and always gives me the bang for hard-earned buck. \nLastly, did you check the ambience? Super cool and chic, nothing else like it in the entire city! See ya in the next table soon!
