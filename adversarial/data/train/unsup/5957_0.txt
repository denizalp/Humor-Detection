When I've got my hips swaying as I make my way quickly down the grocery store aisle (because what busy and popular girl really wants to spend more than  1\/2 an hour shopping for food?)  I need some room!   This magnificently large and clean purveyor of food, wimps out when it comes to aisle width.   I couldn't help but collide with another shopper when I was forced to manoeuvre my ugly oversized yellow cart down the narrow lanes of Steve and Adele's.   Carts require a quarter (as if they think I'd take one home).  The store is neatly stocked and staff are polite if not overly-friendly.  Lovely fresh produce makes up for an overall bad design.
