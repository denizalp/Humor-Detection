Midway review\nWith so many kids in our family, this is a stop we always make when we visit Las Vegas\n\nI've been coming here since I was a kid and now that I have my own rugrat, this place is a kids paradise. \n\nThe arcade games with hundreds to choose from for all ages is great. They keep it in good working order which is a plus. \n\nThe carnival games are classic. Winning those stuffed toys never gets old. What do you really do with a giant minion, hahaha. Kids love them though =)\n\nThe circus acts are good. Hey, they're free, enough said. \n\nI'm glad Circus Circus still has the Midway. After all these years, it's still the same =)
