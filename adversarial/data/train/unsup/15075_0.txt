My friends and I decided to try Whiskey Row Gilbert because of the name. I've been to the one in Scottsdale once and it was \"ok\" but we decided to try this location because it's closer to home. \n\nWhen you walk up to the restaurant, you feel the energy. It was incredibly lively. There's a huge bar in the middle and games like ping ping and corn hole to play surrounding the restaurant. So far, seems like a very cool place.\n\nAfter we were told it would be 90 minutes to be seated on a Wednesday night, we decided to stay and just explore the venue while we caught up. Their reasoning for the long wait was they're still figuring stuff and and didn't want to overload the chefs. We thought maybe it'd be worth the wait. \n\nWe finally were seated and we all ordered burgers. Needless to say, the burgers were over cooked. They were edible but it definitely wasn't worth waiting 90+ minutes for. Food overall, 2.5\/5 stars at best. \n\nA day after, my friend realized he forgot his prescription glasses at the restaurant so he calls but they're not open. He decided to go down and speak to the manager Mike. After my friend explained his situation to Mike, 45 minutes later Mike returns and when my friend asks if he found them yet, Mike says \"oh I haven't even gotten to that yet.\" Are you kidding me?? I understand it's busy and I understand it's not the restaurants fault for misplacing someone's personal property but to come back and say that, come on. At least show the customer you care a little bit. \n\nMy friend gave them his card if they find them and still no response yet. \n\nIf you want to go to a place for the name, bad customer service, and high priced food\/beverage, this is your place. If you want a place that gives you great customer service time and time again, go across the street to Postinos or Joyride. The food is also much better.
