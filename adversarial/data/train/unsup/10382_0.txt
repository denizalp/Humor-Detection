The place looks cool, follows all the modern \"rustic\" restaurant decorating guidelines. Good beers. Unfortunately the \"BBQ\" tastes like steamed meat. Flavorless drowned in disgusting sauce. An insult to barbecue.\n\nHow can you say you smoke your own meat but there is no smokers to be found and the meat tastes like it came out of a combi-oven?\n\nMan this is pathetic...
