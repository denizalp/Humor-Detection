Saturday November 21st,2015 I attended my brother & sister Inlaws  beautiful wedding . The wedding staff were amazing. As with most weddings staying on track and using time line can become difficult. Alex was amazing with getting anything we asked for. Extra table, linens, vases easels, extension cord. He was my go to guy. Alex Kept checking for anything we may have needed.  Bubbly personality and extremely courteous and helpful. Meagan was my sister in laws coordinator, and she was so helpful with all the plans and arrangements. Thanks for making their wedding a memorable day.
