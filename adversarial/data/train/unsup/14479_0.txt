Let me just start off saying that I was an original tenant at Mandarina. I moved into my unit in Feb 2002 (the unit had never been occupied) and moved out April 2009 upon buying a house. \n\nI am very picky when it comes to my living quarters, and Mandarina lived up to my expectations throughout the years. I have to say that while every complex\/neighborhood is going to have its fair share of problems (crime, aggravating neighbors, etc), at Mandarina, there was rarely an incident. \n\nThree gripes throughout the years: \nParking Accommodations - \nAbout 95% of the parking is covered. If your guest parks in a covered space, they're liable to get towed if the resident arrives home to find their spot is taken. If there are no spots, your guests must find parking elsewhere. Most likely next door at the Draw-10 and walk over. \n\nTrash Pickup - This was both a perk and a pain. The perk was not having to cart your trash all the way to the trash compactor. You instead just left outside of the breezeway every pickup morning. My gripe is at no fault of Mandarina, but the residents who did not abide by the trash service times. \n\nLight rail - No fault of Mandarina. Waiting to get out of the complex to head east on Washington was always a pain after the light rail was completed. \n\nWhile I had no issues with the staff upon moving out, the original staff made it a truly great place to live back in 2002-2004.  Overall, I'd recommend Mandarina to anyone looking for a new apartment complex.
