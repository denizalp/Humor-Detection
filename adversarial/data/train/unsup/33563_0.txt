Sushi on conveyer belt, what can be better than That!!! I went to Phoenix to pick up my college freshmen so she took me there. The restaurant looked nice and clean.  Wait staffs are nice and respectful. I wish the sushi chefs were a bit more friendly but the moving sushi dished distracted me from feeling awkward.  Their pricing are very reasonable and lots of varieties.  I've read some positive reviews from other yelpers regarding dishes on the menu. I would love to try some of those next time I'm in town.  But the foods were good for the price we paid so I will definitely be back.
