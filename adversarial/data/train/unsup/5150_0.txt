Refugees from the 60's. The owner from Grinders own band puts on a hell of a show. Rock 'n roll and blues cover, the guys are damn good. Eric Claption, Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughn just to name a few. The Sunnyslope Art Walk this evening was super fun sitting on their sofa.\n\nI enjoyed the white chocolate cafe mocha and for the first time Grinders was offering sandwiches at $6.50. I ordered the club and it was excellent. The gals are always very pleasant. The couple of artist doing work in the store were very talented. I liked the Marilyn and Red Sun on canvas.
