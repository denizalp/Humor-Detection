Anando serves the best Kacchi Biriyani (rice and meat - beef, cooked together) I have ever tried in the city. Try this with Borhani (a kind of salty and spicy yoghurt drink - good for digestion). \n\nThey serve Kacchi Biriyani only on Friday and Sunday, unless there is any special order. On other days you can try Bhuna Khichuri (rice and lentil cooked together) - my second favorite dish with Beef or Duck curry; or Goat or Chicken Biriyani or Beef Tehari (rice cooked with small pieces of meat). For breakfast or as a light snack try Dhal Puri, or Parata with Bhaji (Vegetables) or Paya (made from trotters or hoof of a cow). All are very delicious. Try Ras Malai or Rice Pudding as a desert. Both are very sweet and yummy! Their Mango Lassi is also my favorite.\n\nIt's a family run restaurant. The ambience is very casual, don't expect anything fancy. Price is awesome (for the quantity and quality of the food)! The owner is very chatty and friendly, ask for suggestions. Though Yelp put them in the Indian, Bangladeshi categories, their cooking style is more Bangladeshi (very authentic) than Indian. \n\nHave fun!\n\n**************************************************\n\nUPDATE June 24, 2017\n---------------------------\nAnondo has been closed. The owner sold the restaurant to one of his relatives who opened it with a new name \"Red n Green\" just a month ago. Food, service and price are as good as Anondo. \"Kachchi Biriyani\" is still equally delicious.
