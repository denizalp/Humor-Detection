I stopped in here because I got a coupon for 2 free beverages. This is a stand with an order window and a drive through window. There is no indoor seating. There are a few tables outside. I ordered a black coffee. You can tell a lot about a coffee shop by ordering a black coffee. If the coffee itself is off, all the other beverages made with it will also be off. This was not the case. The coffee has a bold flavor without tasting bitter. Freshly brewed and piping hot, this coffee makes the perfect base for cappuccinos or lattes. I would say this coffee is a cut above most other coffee shops.
