I am going against the grain by giving this place 2 stars but I feel they really handled an issue With our reservation (their mistake) so poorly, that set the mood for the whole night.\n\nSo yes, as it's been beaten to death before two main theme here are:\n\n- The place is owned\/operated by Japanese.\n- Make a reservation as the place is tiny.\n\nOur food was pretty good, I'd say very authentic specially the temperature, no cold fish straight out of the fridge which was great.\n\nThe main problem: I had made a booking and requesting a Child seat. Once we arrived though we were informed that the child seat was already in use (by another family who seemed to have sat down not much earlier) and while the Japanese girl was profusely apologetic and took the blame for making a mistake, this really ruined our experience as we made a long trek to try this place and ended up having to take turns holding on to a squirmy, hungry 2 y\/o so each of us could eat. To add insult to injury she took away the extra one chair from the 4 person table we were at so we had no place to dump all our baby gear but the ground!\n\nI expected they would at the very least serve us an appetizer or a small order as an apology but nope, nothing was done to make amends. Needless to say we rushed through the dinner and left feeling extremely let down.\n\nGoing back to the trusty ol' Mi-ne in Richmond Hill closer to home with food that rivals this place.
