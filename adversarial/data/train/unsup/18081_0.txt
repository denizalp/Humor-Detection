Absolutely horrendous customer service! Walked in at 4.45 on a Tuesday afternoon without an appointment, as the sign in front clearly states \"walk ins welcome\". Was greeted with a hello from one person working there. Then 15 minutes later another person looked at me and said \"do you have an appointment\" in a rude tone. I replied that I didn't. So this guy then says nothing and walks away, only to go admire his own hair in the mirror. Seriously, started playing with his odd blue scalp dye job instead of helping a waiting customer. Meanwhile, the stylist closest to the front spent at least 10 minutes playing on her phone and did not once look up. So, I simply walked out and will not be returning. Too bad as I tip very well.
