What I like most about this place is they're constantly rotating out their Gelato, make it themselves each week, and have really interesting flavors that you don't see most places.\n\nThere was some sort of gelato made with a type of wine or alcohol, gosh I sound silly because I don't remember which, but it was so interesting. That flavor wasn't my cup of tea but everything else I've tried has been fantastic! \n\nBoth the husband and wife owner have been there every time I've come in and are more than willing to let you know what ingredients they use, their processes, etc. Highly recommended!
