Ok Hobak, you win, I submit.\n\nThere's a lot of buzz going on about this Korean BBQ restaurant. I've seen the pics, saw the reviews, yada yada. But eventually, it was bound to happen. And boy, did it. \n\nHobak is located in a small business strip mall off of Spring Mountain road. Lots of parking, so that's not an issue. Walking into this place is a trip. It reminds me of a an 80's Korean city street. They have the modern vent systems, which is great btw.\n\nI've made this argument before, and I will continue to in the future, Kbbq that is grilled over charcoal is different and tastes much better than when it's grilled over gas. And this is the only place in town that has it.\n\nOnto the food. Hobak advertises themselves as having black angus beef. So, I had to try it. The meat was fantastic. It's the creme de la creme. All the sides were well prepared, especially the steamed egg.\n\nThe service was great as well. The server was great and attentive. She also cooked all the meat perfect. Just great.\n\nOne of the best Korean BBQ places not only in Vegas, but one of the best all around that I've ever been too.
