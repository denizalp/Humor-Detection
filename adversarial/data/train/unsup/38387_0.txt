This is a comfortable place for a drink and a sandwich.  \n\nThe restaurant does not have an extensive menu so expect to order a sandwich or a salad.\n\nWe've been a few times and the service is very friendly and we've tried most of the menu between us and guests.\n\nNice bar, friendly service.  \n\nWhat they offer, they do it well.
