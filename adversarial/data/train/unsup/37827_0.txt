I love eating ice cream... It just relieves so much stress and plus, it's delicious. I was also real eager to try nitrogen ice cream since the smokey aesthetic was too much to resist.Â \n\nUnfortunately, I didn't enjoy the Tiramisu flavoured ice-cream. It wasn't as sweet as I would have thought. The flavour just wasn't to my liking. I would prefer to spend my $7 on other things.
