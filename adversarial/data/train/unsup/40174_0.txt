Thanks for being rude when you got my order wrong and then just transferring the incorrect cheese from one sandwich to the other instead of putting new cheese on both sandwiches. Now my sandwich tastes like an everything bagel. Not exactly what I was looking forward to this morning. This location gets my order wrong more often than not. I think it's time to find a new breakfast place.
