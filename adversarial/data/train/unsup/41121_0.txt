Walked over from the Embassy Suites North and was pleasantly surprised. It's not fancy. It's not expensive. It's simple and one-of-a-kind. The dude at the front let me sample. The jerk chicken has very good flavor, as does the jade chicken. I like the selection of rices. The snickerdoodle is not necessary, but tops of the meal nicely. Good value meal.
