Quite honestly one of the worst experiences for the price tag. \nThis was my second visit (1st visit was just a 1\/2 arm wax, which was reasonably priced and the technician was skilled and friendly). This time I had a gel manicure, spa pedicure, brow and lip wax. \nI purchased the deluxe spa pedicure assuming it'd be more of everything. It wasn't. Very little massage (basically just applying the lotions and oils) then painting. Nearly no grooming besides minor filing. \nThe gel manicure was basically a polish change, and both my fingers and toes looked as though they already had a weeks worth of growth once she finished (there was a decent gap between the paint ending and my nail bed beginning). \nFiguring, hey, ok, not a great experience but their wax was reasonable, so at least the nail pricing should be too, I proceeded to my waxing. This lady was painful but fast. She also over groomed (my brows are pretty thin now). \nHappy to be done and deciding I probably would not come back (except that the lady that did my nails was friendly) I went to pay. $125!!! ($20 for the wax, $35 for the gel manicure (a.k.a. polish change), and yes... $70 for the deluxe spa pedicure). I asked the cashier if she was serious, especially given the level of service. She just sort of shrugged. \nTo be honest, I wouldn't have minded the price as much had it been the full service I expected. If I had to price what I actually got, I'd say (and this is being generous) $10 for the polish change, $20 for the pedicure, and $15 for the wax. In my mind I was overcharged at least $80! And then I was silly enough to tip generously (that's my fault). \nTo top off the experience, the next day the polish came off my pinky. I won't be back ever and I warn you ladies out there, buyer beware.
