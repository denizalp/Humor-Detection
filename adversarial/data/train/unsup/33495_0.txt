So I've grown to being a regular here as I'm usually happy with the results of my eyebrows. I try to go to the same lady every time (can't remember her name) but if she is not available and depending on how bad I need my brows done, then I'll go to the other women. They all do a good job, it just the one lady I like to go to does an excellent job every time! My eyebrows come out so flawless and fresh. Today I got them done by a different woman as my lady wasn't there and they're ok. I'm happy with them. This place tends to get busy during peak hours, say if you go on a Friday after 4pm or early morning Saturdays, there will be a wait. It's worth it. Nice place, all the women are very nice and welcoming. I recommend trying it for yourself. Wish I had my go-to ladies name! Sorry guys.
