This was -- hands down -- one of the best massages I've ever had. I did something to my lower back the other day in the gym and it ceased right up (things like this didn't happen a decade ago...). I was in Charlotte on work and didn't know where to go to get help with this but everyone on Yelp loved these guys so I took a shot and they were able to get me in the next day.\n\nAnd it was great. Mike is cool and easy to talk to (there's no douchy-ness going on). He listens to how you use your body every day and what you want help with and he's really knowledgable about how the muscles of the body work \/ join together \/ rebel against you. There's no skimping on the time you pay for, you don't have to worry about tipping (it was a non issue, the price was the price), and Mike gives a really great massage. Go!
