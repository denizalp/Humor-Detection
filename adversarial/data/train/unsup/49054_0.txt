Just moved to the area, and I saw that this place was close to my apartment. I'm a huge fan of Thai food, so I thought I'd give it a shot and get some take out. The price was a little steeper than what I'm used to for Thai food (13-something for the pad see ewe with tofu I ordered), but they did give a very generous portion. It filled the entire to-go box. It wasn't the best pad see ewe I've ever had , but it was still very good. The noodles seemed slightly undercooked, but they were very tasty and there was lots of it. I'm definitely going to be getting more from here in the future.
