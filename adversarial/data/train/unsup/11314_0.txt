Before the amalgamation of the GTA into the GTA, North York under Mel Lastman tried so hard to be the new downtown, trying to show Toronto Classic how to do it right. Wide streets. Shiny new office buildings for Fortune 500 Companies. A live theatre to play host to musicals for the blue haired set. Ten years on, it's still pretty hard to convince your friends downtown, in the Beaches, and in High Park to come any farther north than Eglinton. It boils down to what they got down there, we kinda sorta got up here now. But if you're down there, you don't have to go up here. \n\nCase in point, the Grande Theatre. It's a nice serviceable theatre in the stadium seating tradition. The seats rock back. Not many theatres in Toronto have this feature. The arm rests don't move up, however. So you'll need a hotel room after. Might I suggest the North York Novotel? It's got your typical popcorn counter plus a caf√© counter where you can get a cuppa joe. There's a nice windowed seating area so you can sip your coffee leisurely before your flick and watch the non-hustle and non-bustle of Yonge\/Sheppard. And all the theaters are contiguous so it's another theater where you can one-plus-one it on the sly. The place could use several more self ticketing HAL 9000s. There appeared to only be about 4. For the 7 pm movie times, each had a long line and the human 9000 line was pretty long as well. And this was at a theatre not showing anything with vampires, werewolves, or were-vampires.\n\nGiven its proximity to K-town 2.0, I've noticed the theatre once in a while runs a Korean movie. So keep your eyes peeled. \n\nEnd of the day, though, it's nice to know this is in your own backyard: a decent enough theatre to catch a flick on a lazy Sunday or when winter hits and the TTC customarily completely stops working north of Eglinton.
