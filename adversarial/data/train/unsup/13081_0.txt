Let me go ahead and lay down this CLE-area brunch smackdown, mmmkay? \n\nIt's probably just something that comes with age, but when it's the weekend and I'm hangry-hungover, I want NO PART of a uppity brunch social scene. I don't want to squeeze into a corner and wait hours to be seated. I don't want to spend \"dinner date\/night out\"kinds of money on breakfast. I don't want some eclectic take on traditional dishes. And I don't want to be around brunch people--you know who you are.\n\nYou know what I do want? A good eggs Benedict made with REAL BUTTER. I want to be seated within 10 mins, tops. I want elbow room, calmness, timeliness and a cocktail wouldn't hurt. I want a check under $50 for breakfast--you can have your deconstructed breakfast sandwich with artisan whatever. I want a greasy, delicious breakfast on my time. \n\nEnter, My Friends. \n\nIt's a 24\/7 diner with stick-to-your-ribs food. It has booths, carpeting and no-frills service. I have no idea what the health score is, nor do I care. They serve a damn good eggs Benedict made with REAL BUTTER (unlike a nearby, popular diner) everyday and their bacon is perfectly crunchy. The coffee tasted a little bitter, but overall a decent cup of diner joe. They also boast WiFi AND a wine\/beer menu. That means they have mimosas! \n\nWe stopped in during the Saturday brunch rush and were seated right away, served delicious food within 10 minutes and checked out well under $50. This is my new favorite place for breakfast.
