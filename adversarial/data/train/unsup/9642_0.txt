I literally \"stumbled\" upon Silk Skin in 2014, and it turned out to be one of the best moves that I've ever made. Being new in town from SoCal was difficult to me at first, since I've been using the same service back there for a couple of years. I normally rely on Yelp, as many of you, to find the best of the best, especially being new here & not having any recommendations from friends. So I found a Groupon for six sessions of 'painless hair removal' for myself & my boyfriend, then came here on Yelp to check the business plus reviews. I was blown away by all the positive and decided to purchase the packages and make the appointment.\n\nElenir is not only my \"beauty angel\" but a good friend, the only one I have in Las Vegas :) She is one of the sweetest people you'll ever meet. Knowledgeable, qualified, dedicated, responsible, nurturing & beautiful. I'm extremely happy with all the results so far. I went from doing hair removal only to facials as well, and to be honest, I would do all the services offered if I could afford them lol. I've been suffering from acne my entire life, tried all the treatments out there with different estheticians, but laser was the most efficient and inexpensive. \n\nElenir my dear, thank you for all you do for us. We truly L O V E  Y O U!
