Hello friends,\n\nIt seems like they are going out of their way to lose stars (Yelp Stars, and star customers, or would be customers).\n\nI purchased a cigar from here a while ago. I walked in to Try to smoke one and Before the door closed, I was greeted. Good job.\n\nI told the guy I wanted to come cop a squat & smoke it. Well, this guy says...\"You can ONLY SMOKE what you buy from US. He didn't even ask. I could have matched his ignorance by going on & on. Why did he ASSume that I didn't buy it there.\n\nThat kinda pissed me off. I could have been meeting a few of my friends here to purchase and smoke here. HE LOST MY BUSINESS. I will spread the word. In fact, I left and went to another spot near South Park and was invited in with open doors. I told all the guys there about my experience. They said they have heard same thing from others & members. I understand the rule, no problem. But the Fact that he didn't even ASK if i purchased it there FIRST!!
