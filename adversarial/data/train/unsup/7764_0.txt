I am so giddy because I luv crepes!\nI found out about the opening in the zip code magazine I get in the mail, and bookmarked it forthwith.  I knew that this creperie served crepes on a plate, not hand-held style, but so what?  They serve up YUM!\nEven though it was a late lunch for me, I opted for a sweet crepe.  I will definitely need to get back here to try savory and breakfast crepes, but The Avalon called out to me: buttered pears, goat cheese, candied walnuts....\nit was amazing!  So was the service.  I was the only one inside (a few brave souls were eating outside) and I had a nice chat with the two ladies working.  I am intrigued by the flavored mimosas and will come back for those (they have a 3 mimosa sampler for $10 or one for $6) - white peach, passion fruit, lychee, traditional, pomegranate. \nThis would be a really fun place for me to get the yelpettes of Vegas for a crepe and mimosa brunch before my wedding (so keep your eyes open for that, belles!)\nYes, I will be back...they have guacamole for savory crepes and lemon curd for sweet ones so I have to come back for those options!\nThe interior is swanky, purple hues, fun art and mirrors on the walls, nice tables (I sat at the one by the crepe-making station), flat screen TVs, and even really nice flatware!\nCrepely speaking, you cannot go wrong here.
