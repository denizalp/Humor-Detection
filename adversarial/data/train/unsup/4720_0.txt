What kind of review does one write when he arrives to a place hoping to find it all seedy and smokey (like the way I remember from years ago), only to discover that the place has been totally refurbished and now everything is sort-of nice - at least at a glance - in a totally unexpected way? I don't know... All I can say is I'm a bit disappointed that they cleaned this place up and made it look somewhat respectable now. Well, at least it's still smokey as all get out.
