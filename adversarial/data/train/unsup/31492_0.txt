This Denny's had a make over a few months back, but still the same great breakfast JUST the way I ordered it. Fab with Steve as my server I felt like a qween. Terry was cleaning the windows and cashiering; she never rested! Carrie usually serves us and she came over to say hello. Warm and friendly with great food and coffee. Denny's rocks the dining world.
