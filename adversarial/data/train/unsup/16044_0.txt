I knew where this place was. I did. But when walking down the incredibly stinky alley towards the back, I started to question myself. It wasn't what I wanted. It wasn't what I expected. But it was kind of cool. \n\nThe door man takes his role seriously. I like it, and he lets me in. I escort my date like a gentleman and we take seats by the bar to get an overlook. Live music is about to start. The bar personnel isn't to chatty but friendly. The prices are a little higher, but for the ambiance I feel they should be. They even have a few simple rules that could be classified as a dress code. Don't wear your hat backwards. I like it. Only kids get away with that, and this sure is no place for kids.\n\nAnother rule is to adhere to the speakeasy - don't cuss, don't yell. I just love it. \n\nWe ate a little; we drank a little and embraced the milieu with our fellow patrons. This place is a gem, in its dark shadowy appearance. I wouldn't want to change a thing. \n\n- IF you are into wine and feel you have the capacity to soak in the atmosphere - Go!\n- IF you feel that nobody should tell how to act - Don't go! \n- IF you like to people watch and\/or listen to some live music that fits the venue better than your personality - Go!\n- IF you aren't sure what the front of your ball cap is, but you will not conform to the designed intent - Don't go!\n- IF you can't determine the proper volume of your voice, or control your flavoring of your language with the salty words that of a sailor - Seek help!
