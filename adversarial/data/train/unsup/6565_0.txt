I loved dicks! I came here for my 21st birthday and I was not expecting that type of service lol. Our server was so hilarious! I don't know how they come up with shit so quick! They also gave us those funny paper hats! Had such a good time here with all my friends..\nThe reason I give it 3 stars tho is because it is pretty pricey and there's not too much of a variety for food. I also ordered a Coronita margarita and it cost me $27!!!!!!!!!!!! Wtfffff !!! Double the price of my meal...:\/ even if the cup is a souvenir, I still don't think it should be priced at $27! If I would have known it was gonna cost that much I wouldn't have got it. \nI had a breakfast burrito which wasn't that bad but wasn't worth the price\n\nAll in all... You pay for the entertainment of getting shit talked to your face and having a good laugh... I had a good time! Nothing in Vegas is cheap so it's ok.
