Do you like decent pasta at a really good price?  Do you like decent beer and wine at a really good price? Yes?  Then get yourself into this place on Tuesdays.  It's just a little private club pasta dinner, but that's all they're trying to do and, as far as that goes, they're doing it REALLY well!\n\nIt's easily one of the two or three best pasta dinners in the greater Akron area.\n\nFor about $7-8 you get a big bowl of pasta, meatball, salad, bread & butter, and spumoni.  The quality is quite good and the price is very reasonable.  You can't beat the value.\n\nThe bar is well-stocked with beers (from Stella and Anchor down to \"Your Horse has Diabetes\"), wine, and liquor and, again, the prices are very fair.\n\nThe only real downside is that it attracts an older crowd and you do have to put up with slow, old people shuffling through the hall and doing things like grabbing the back of everyone's chair as they come to it to keep their balance, and saying things that start with, \"In MY day...\"\n\nI just talked myself into it...  I'm off for the place right now.
