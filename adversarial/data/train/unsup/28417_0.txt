This is a jewel in our desert that is located right across from the court house in downtown too. One can go to court for their speeding ticket or worse and at least be alert. I was so refreshed when I entered this Starbucks the wood and high vault of the ceilings are so high and welcoming. The staff is very friendly and attentive. An individual can see some amazing views from the inside or outside and drink some great coffee or tea at a reasonable price I might add; surrounded by beauty both inside and outside the restaurant.
