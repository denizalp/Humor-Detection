EFF This place.\nI go to Vegas every year with a big group of friends, and we have had some awesome experiences at so many great bars and clubs in Vegas...but this place is the ultimate in crap technology! If you are a guy...just do yourself a favor and walk. The bank does this really cute thing where they give you free passes to get in, as long as you get there by a certain time...then they keep you standing in line for literally hours- so that your free pass reaches its expiration time and you have to pay to get in. This is all going on while they let all the women have their own line that moves in constantly, while you stand still for two straight hours. Sound like fun? Oh it is! Best GD fun I ever had wasting my night! Haha. You might think...\"That's great, Scottish guy! That means there's TONS of hot women in there!\" Think again...Just because you see a lot of girls going in there, nothing stops the ratio from being any different than any other club. All the guys in line will get in at the same time as you. Really, it's the saddest attempt to lure guys into a club I've ever seen. Seriously, this place blows max goats. There's more- The drinks are insanely expensive! I asked for tap water because I didn't want to support these jerks any further...Tap water is free right? Wrong! They demanded 6 bucks! There's special place in trendy, cheap cologne-riddled hell for bastards of this caliber! Please, for the love of Christ...go to a place where you can actually enjoy yourself! If I can at least have the satisfaction of knowing that your night didn't suck, because my post stopped you from going here...my craptastic experience will at least have some meaning! Anyway, have fun!
