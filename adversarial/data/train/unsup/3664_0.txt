We booked this hotel via Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' deal so we didn't exactly select this hotel.  If you've never utilized this feature, you don't know which hotel you're booking until your price is accepted.  The nice thing is that you can set guidelines.  We specifically noted a 4-STAR hotel and w\/in this vicinity of the strip.  I would not rate this hotel 4 stars, maybe 3.5 but definitely not 4.\n\n4 NIGHTS = $99 per night (during a busy convention week - Wed to Sun)\nDaily Resort Fee = $9.50\n\nThe best perk of this hotel is their daily Happy Hour \/ Mixer event.  It is FREE and all guests are welcome to attend.  What's included: Appetizers, Beer, Wine, Water, and Soda.  The cheese platter & fruits were my favorites.  The second best perk is the Starbucks located inside the hotel.\n\nThe room was spacious, clean, and surprisingly looked much nicer than more expensive hotels on the strip. (ie. Paris, Luxor, Monte Carlo, etc.)\n\nThe location is convenient for those who want to stay very close to the strip but away from the hustle & bustle. However, the cabs were lacking.  You have a better shot flagging a cab at Bally's. (across the street)\n\nI wouldn't mind staying here again but it isn't at the top of my list.  Ideal hotel for business trips, not for leisure.
