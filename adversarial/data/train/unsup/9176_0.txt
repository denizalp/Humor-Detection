I'm so sad they closed down!! This place is always packed with people on a summer night, it used to be one of my go to spots last summer and I'd be here after dinner like 1-2 times a week. The location was such a good spot too. \n\nI've gotten their Hokkaido Milkshake Frappe many times and it is soooooo gooood. It's pretty much just milk blended with ice, but it's not your typical Canadian milk - you actually taste the difference, and it's exactly like the milk I've tried in Japan. I also love how the drink isn't too sweet. I'm going to miss this so much.\n\nNow onto what Tendou is actually known for - their matcha soft serve. The flavours definitely changed over time. It used to be very strong and slightly bitter matcha with bits of green tea leaves or something like that, and I loved it. Then it started to taste a little more diluted? bland? It was still good, but the quality changed. The colour got lighter and the bits of tea leaves disappeared. However, I do love their sesame soft serve, it's very delicious. I always get the swirl cause that's the best of both worlds haha. I've also tried their matcha daifuku and that is soooo yummmmy. I just love when dessert places aren't overly sweet.
