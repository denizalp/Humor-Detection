We paid for the all day buffet at rio and it was terrible.  We ended up leaving rio and headed to harrahs to try their buffet.  It was three times as good as rio but still not worth the money.  They had the basics like chicken wings, carved turkey, vegetables, etc.  Nothing that stood out though.  The dessert area was ok as well.  Not bad but again not worth 30 bucks and not nearly as good as the buffet at the paris.
