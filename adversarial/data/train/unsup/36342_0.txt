SS has a great, and I mean GREAT happy hour. You have to sit at the bar, which requires going early, or getting lucky. Even on a weekday. \n\nI enjoyed a great Mojito, LOVED their HH rolls, and can't even put into words how unique and tasty both the corn and shishito peppers are. The purple potato mash is good, if you can get passed the heavy cream flavor (tell yourself you're eating your veggies...)\n\nService was ok, despite one grumpy bartender, who still gave us quick and efficient service. \n\nCan't wait to go back. \n\n(Bill for two= $110, but we ate a lot. and by a lot I mean A LOT). \n\nSkip the El topo roll. Cheese on rice is just wrong.
