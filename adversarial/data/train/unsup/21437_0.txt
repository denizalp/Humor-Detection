My father purchased me a fine watch for my birthday and told me Macy's will size it for free. The watch was big on me so I took it in for my free adjustment. It was Memorial day, and no one was in the store, and I found the jewelry department where a woman was leaning against the glass, idly. I asked her if it was true they will adjust the watch free. She said it was true.\n\nShe put it on my wrist and told me she would need to remove several links. I was delighted to see she was going to make the adjustment right then and there. The first try, and she had to go back, remove another link.\n\nWhen she came back the second time, the watch was still too big!!!\n\nThis is when she tells me if she removed another link the watch would be too small. So I said if that is the case I will get my dad's receipt and return the watch. But no! She tells me, if the links have been removed you can no longer return the watch. I begged her to try to remove one more link, I was thinking if it was too small it is the same as being too big---a useless watch. \n\nI heard much huffing and puffing from behind the counter as she removed the next link.\n\nIn fact, the watch fit perfectly after the last adjustment. When I thanked her, she snorted!!!!!!!!!
