Just noticed they had opened in the old captains galley location yesterday. Went there for lunch today. Short review here.  Good service, best chicken livers I've ever had , best mashed potatoes I've ever had. Great iced tea.  According to my co worker great seafood also. And HUGE portions. Overall the best family style restaurant I've ever been to.
