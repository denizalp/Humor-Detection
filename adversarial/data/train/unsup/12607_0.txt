HELLO new neighborhood watering hole!  \n\nThis place is legit!  Moving to the new hood in Dormont means finding a new go to bar.  I need a my hood bar to have a good selection of beer (I accept Yuengling and hopefully a rotating seasonal list) and good bar food.  Good bar food doesn't have to be good.  I mean, it has to be good, but it doesn't have be gourmet poutine, if you know what I'm sayin'?  \n\nCain's totally surprised me because they have a mega beer list, with lots of drafts on tap, and this particular night Southern Tier Pumking was in the hizzouse!  Their menu is HUGE too!  Tons of faves like wings and burgers but the intriguing \"Codfather,\" which I will take part in at some point!  I was in the mood for a Rachel, because well, why not... it's my name!  \n\nThe Rachel was awesome, with a good amount of turkey, but not overwhelming and lots of coleslaw, which is totally how I like it!  The rye was fresh and toasted and it all came together perfectly.  But the fries, the fries win my seal of approval!  They were crisp and seasoned correctly, which is a winning fry in my opinion.  \n\nI'll see you soon Cains, and will be working my way through your extensive draft list and food menu on the reg!
