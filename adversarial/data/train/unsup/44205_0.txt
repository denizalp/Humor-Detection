If  i can give this a location a ZERO I would. My 4 year old daughter had to use the restroom and the employees refused to give us the they. We had every intention on purchasing an icecream. After asking SEVERAL TIMES FOR THE KEY THEY SAID ONLY FOR BUYING CUSTOMERS. So guess what!? My 4 year old baby went ALL OVER on herself. They really had no sympathy! The only they had to say was sorry to many teenagers take advantage of the restroom. Ummmm really? So WHAT IS this 4 YEAR OLD BABY GONNA DO TO YOUR RESTROOM!
