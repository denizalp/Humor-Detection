So nasty THERE WAS BLOOD ON MY STEAK BOWL!!!\n\nI was so disgusted and the customer service is terrible they stood around talking for 5 minutes before helping me and the cashier was clearly intoxicated and had a strong liquor smell on her breath.\n\nMY VISIT WAS HORRENDOUS I WILL NEVER GO THIS CHIPOTLE EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!
