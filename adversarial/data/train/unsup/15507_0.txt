Sam Bell: Master mechanic, environmental buff ... and fearless dancer.\n\nI randomly met Sam at a party. He runs the Lusty Wrench and I knew I'd bring my car to him when the need arose. I just did and it was the most positive experience I've had servicing a car.\n\nThe office is a perfect mess. I like it in the same way that I like a really old dive-y restaurant or bar that's been around for decades. Looks can be deceiving, though; Sam is a very sophisticated and up-to-date mechanic that specializes in hybrids.\n\nHe was able to explain his diagnoses to me in a way that anyone could understand.  If you're looking for an extremely trustworthy, fairly priced, and cool guy to take your car to, look no further.
