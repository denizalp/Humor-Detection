This quaint little diner\/cafe is located in the Cuyahoga Falls Square.  It's a tight space and is very packed on the weekend.  It's standing room only which means a very long wait.  Yes we waited almost over an hour after we ordered to get our breakfast food. But you may ask why the 4 rating then?  The food was good,  especially the chicken fried steak.  The pancakes were really fluffy.  The bacon had a funny taste in my opinion.  I also rated it a 4 because the servers were nice. The breakfast cost a little more than a Denny's or other breakfast spot.  Overall, I would go back based on the food.
