Stopped here for dinner with a bunch of people and was very pleased with the food and atmosphere. We ate in the covered outdoor area which overlooked the pools and grounds. I like that the corn tortilla chips came with a trio of salsas including verde, chipotle and regular. All delicious. They had a several different types of ceviche with white fish and shrimp combos served on a large chip. My baja ceviche which had onion, shrimp, white fish, avocado and tomatoes. Very good but a bit saltier than I would I have liked. Others in the group enjoyed the shrimp and scallops and brisket tacos as well. \nFor a drink, I ordered a classic mojito... very refreshing and minty.\n\nCheck in for a free corn tamale!
