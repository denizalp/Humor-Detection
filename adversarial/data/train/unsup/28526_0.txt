This casual restaurant offers super fast service for cheap. To order, you fill in a form selecting your soup base, type of noodle, toppings, and any add-ons. There is a wide variety to choose from, such as imitation crab meat, fish balls, beef, corn, and greens.\n\nSo far, I've tried Deer Garden's laksa soup base and chicken broth soup base. The laksa is heavier, while the chicken broth is lighter, but both were delicious. I also love how their noodle dishes are served piping hot! The portions are also massive, so it's worth the price paid.\n\nThe restaurant's noodle dishes also come with a drink of choice; I always opt for the classic Hong Kong style milk tea.\n\nThis is a great place for a fast lunch or dinner, and the place is also quite clean. They don't accept credit card yet, but diners can pay with debit or cash. I'll be back again!
