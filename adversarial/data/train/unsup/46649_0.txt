I had SUCH high hopes for Fatburger.  It was 4:30 in the morning and a nice big burger was just what the doctor ordered.  \n\nFirst, this place was a MESS.  There was so much garbage on the floor, there was no way we would eat there.  I ordered the Fatburger and fries and we took it back to our room.  I definitely enjoyed the fries because I LOVE steak fries.  My burger was a disappointment.  It was super charred on the edges and the cheese was not melted at all.  The bun tasted a little stale too.  I may give Fatburger another chance if I'm ever around one...but that's only because my friend told me they have awesome chili cheese fries...
