Came here twice!  This bar is pretty awesome if I do say so myself.  The location in at the eastern end of China town.  The parking situation is kind of shitty because its always crowded in that mini mall.  When you walk in you will see a smoking fountain and a security guard checking ID's.  The feel and look inside the bar is pretty old school.  They have old shows playing on the TV's like I love Lucy, and Nick at Night.  The music is swing music and the DJ is usually posted by the restroom entrances.  \n\nThe drinks are awesome.  The Navy Grog came out and it was o fire which was awesome.  It tastes like a margarita, and has a pretty good kick once you finish it... lol.  Also the Mango Batida was the show stopper.... \n\nThe back has this skeleton that talks on certain times... 11pm it starts going off about some pirate stuff and its eyes are glowing super red and moves its head.  \n\nThe only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because some of the bartenders get tunnel vision or jus flat out ignore people... or to be more specific me.  I literally was waiting for a drink for 5 minutes while people hat just came were getting drinks before me.  After a while you start to wonder; do I look cheap, is it because I'm black, do I smell .. etc.  \n\nOther than the long drink wait sometimes this place is awesome
