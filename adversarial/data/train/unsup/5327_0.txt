Whoa, not wow. \n\nThis place has done a complete 180 in a mere 2 months. I'm not sure what I was more upset about - the bug on the wall next to me, the terrible food experience or the bad service. \n\nThe waitress who greeted us and then took our check was not the same woman taking our orders and bringing food. The latter forgot most of what we ordered, including 2 rolls, 3 orders of nigiri and a bottle of sake. It felt like she was wanting us to leave, so we did. \n\nThe bug on the wall - I understand, it happens - but nobody seemed to care, which was sad and disturbing. He just crawled right up there, and watched us eat or disappointing meal. Clearly I afraid of humans or interaction - which tells me they've been around for a while. Gross. \n\nThe meal (after all, that's what brought us here.) The nigiri was sad, there texture wasn't that of freshness, and while some of the rice was a solid brick in your mouth, others fell apart when you selected your nigiri. The fish felt dry - like it had been left out and refrigerated. The shrimp lover roll is when I realized that this wasn't good. The shrimp tempura was like a squishy garden hose. Clearly not freshly fried, but done so either earlier that day or the day before. Guitar was hot and cold at the same time - which takes talent!...but not the good kind. We tried the shrimp shumai and immediately regretted it, as the lard-like texture flopped around in our mouths. Most scary of all was the chicken teriyaki - it was a solid chunk of ligament cartilaged and holding strong. Gross. \n\nThe tea was good, and plentiful. The coconut Michu delightful as usual. One star for those two items. \n\nUnfortunately we will not be back. Quite sad.
