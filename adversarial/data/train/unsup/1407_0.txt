Well, this old,  dated decor needs an overhaul, but the food is good, usually served quickly and accurately, and the dining room is almost always clean. The employees are usually okay, nothing stellar. However, trying to make a left out of the parking lot is ALWAYS challenging. Make a right, zip up a side street, and turn around. Or pray for a break in traffic.
