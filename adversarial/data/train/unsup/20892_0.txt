If you've ever had a falafel in the Annex in Toronto, you know what a good falafel is and what it's supposed to be. The falafel here was a tasteless mess. Truly awful. All the 5 star reviews are obviously from people who never go into the city.\nOn another note: the restaurant was not clean when I was in there. I saw a lot of flies and food crumbs all over the dining area floor.
