I love this gym! I love the fact I can always get some sort of cardio machine at peak hours after work. There are plenty of weights and equipment. I like the fact that it is busy but not crowded, nothing like LA Fitness.. Plenty of great classes, heather's core class is fantastic. The tanning bed could be a little updated but I get great color from it. Locker rooms are very clean and large. Over all a fantastic gym, especially be they offer a month to month membership for $40. The only negative thing I can say is that when you first sign up they try to make you believe you have to pay this sign up fee.. And pretend to give you 100 bucks off. I got mine down to 80 but my first month was free because I was referred. But the location is what sold me!
