I love this place!  It's in our neighborhood and we can walk there.  We always eat in the restaurant, so I can't comment on the delivery process.  My guess is that some of the issues related to delivery boil down to a language barrier.  My experience eating there has been excellent.  The food is very good, the waitstaff is friendly, and the prices are very low for what you get.  The expanded menu has given my wife and me a lot more options than when it first opened.  And the food is authentic- we know because we visited China.  If you want generic Chinese food that's not authentic, they probably will have it here.  I wouldn't know because I never order it at Orient House.
