Been here twice and I've been pleased with the food and service both times. Flavor is exceptional and flavorful. Ordered rack of lamb... You pretty much get the whole lamb! Big portion, but delicious!! The fried octopus was to die for!!! I ordered the ravioli last I went and it was spot on! Our waiter was friendly, quick, and attentive! \n\nI didn't give it 5 stars only because I do believe they were closing up and we see the last group in our section and I could tell one of the other server was getting annoyed we were still there. But other than that, this place is great!!
