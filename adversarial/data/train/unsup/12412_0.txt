While I'm no longer a member (just because I wanted to try some other fitness programs) I had to come back and thank the Raw Fitness family for everything they did to help me reach my goals. Their trainers and staff were the absolute best! The gyms, especially Gramercy, were amazingly well kept, clean, modern. I love their fitness challenges and their Fit 42 program was hard core, people were coming out left and right with results and that's when you know it's legit. \n\nThe trainers are so positive and push you to the max, they really do make you feel like family and they're not afraid to call you out when your slackin. I had the best time working out - early mornings (who has fun at 5am???) and into the night. They offer nutritional programs as well and it's not a hassle to get advice on food, supplements, exercising techniques- whatever you need to know to get where you want to be. I love that the owner and trainers all have a story of where they came from, they know what it's like to struggle and work for your goals, ya feel me? And they're your biggest fan. Great vibes all day everyday. Definitely a great place to start if you're looking to lose weight, get buff, start eating right, doesn't matter.
