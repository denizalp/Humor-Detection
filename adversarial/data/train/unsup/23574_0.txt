I really love this place.  I should be a southern girl.  I could eat chicken salad everyday.  I've had a few of their different flavors and they all have been good.  Some are more smooth, like a spread than others.  I usually get one scoop with the side and I love the little treat for dessert.  The first time I had the curry and my husband had the spicy thai.  He loves, loves, loves the spicy thai.  It is really good, but I love the curry.  I have also had the southern, southwest, buffalo (this one is more like a spread) and the popper.  I have loved them all.  The sides are also very good.  I love the broccoli slaw, the black eye peas quinoa side is also great and the loaded potato salad is super yummy.  The usual treat is the banana pudding, but now, during the fall holidays they are offering a choice of banana or pumpkin.  The place is always clean and the service is very friendly.  I enjoy coming here and having a yummy break.
