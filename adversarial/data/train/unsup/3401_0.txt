Where do I begin?  Although I was warned, it was already to late to change my hotel.  We arrived at check in around 7Pm...the line was INSANELY LONG! and there seemed to be NO A\/C in the casino!!  HELLO THIS IS VEGAS PEOPLE!!  It took us about ONE HOUR to check in....this is what happens when you have 75 people in line an FOUR people behind the desk!!  As my poor husband left the line to use the mens room (after waiting forever) a total STRANGER started looking thru my shopping bag and harassed  me for the booze!!!. WTH this is the clientele you are dealing with here! WHO DOES THAT??? \n\nTo find our room you needed a Map!!  Was like a maze!  Thru the casino, pass this, up that, to the elevators!  The Elevators...UGH!  Would it kill you to put some A\/C in these ELEVATORS???  When we FINALLY made it to our room EXHAUSTED, I was presently surprised with the decor and cleanliness.  THANK GOD!  \n\nOn the plus side the rooms were CHEAP!  We booked on a Monday  and arrived on Friday.  For two nights with my rewards card it cost us $117.00\n\nWe also had dinner at Hash House and it was DELISH!  I highly recommend the pancakes.  The food portions are HUGE, more then enough to share.  They do charge you to share  a plate though.  \n\nI heard they are tearing the Hotel....and for your sake this  is a good thing!
