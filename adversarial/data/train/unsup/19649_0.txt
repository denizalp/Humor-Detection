\"Start spreading the news\nI'm leaving today\nI want to be a part of it\nNew York, New York...\"\n\nLocated farther south of the Las Vegas Blvd strip, this casino\/resort brings visitors and stayers to experience on how it lives in the greatest city in the United States right her in Vegas! It's called, \"New York New York.\" New York New York Hotel & Casino brings tons of endless casino games, vendors and resort stay at your comfort zone every 365 days a year! The atmosphere is much lively active and ongoing as I welcomed there. The concept is much like living in an actual NYC Manhattan both inside and outside filled with early 20th Century vibes.\n\nThe employees here are doing a fine job for making the customers like me a remarkable service despite the busiest environment. No cons.\n\nInside, every casino games were fully operational and active, so I can explore and play one of my favorite games, the slot machines. Blackjack to Roulette are also so much fun to play too which I have no problems about the game play plans. The shopping vendors inside New York New York has endless to shop! I sometimes headed to the Hershey's chocolate store for the first time, and it was a fun place to shop their delicious chocolate. Finally, the sports watch area is kinda alright for me which it reminds me like the New York Stock Exchange's interior room. I'm sure this area needs a bit of expansion in the near future.\n\nI haven't got a chance to stay inside New York New York, so I'll try it out in the near future.\n\nParking at New York New York can be challenging to park. You can park at their parking garage if it's available. Alternatively, you can walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nTo conclude, New York New York is a good, well active casino\/resort that I've ever visited right here in Las Vegas. A well visit. My rating: 4 solid stars.
