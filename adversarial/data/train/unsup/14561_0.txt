Went here for dinner with a few friends before Buzzcation a few weeks ago. I love this place!\nYou go upstairs & there is an AMAZING patio! The service was super friendly, too.\nI had the spaghetti and meatballs and you can bet I ate every last bite of those balls. The dish itself wasn't so huge that I was stuffed and didn't have to have a box of leftovers in my car to stink it up. It was juuuuuuuust right.\nAnd talk about a small world! The GM's wife owns The Herb Box, one of my favorites!\nI don't know much about the drinks there, but I do know the food & staff were stellar. I'll be back. (Don't say it like Arnold because he cheated on his awesome wife with a freaking housekeeper. What a loser!)
