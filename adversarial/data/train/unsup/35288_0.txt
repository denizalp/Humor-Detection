Had no idea what this place was about. A friend of mine told me check it out, and I'm glad I did. Great dinning area, clean and has TV's too! Blue Berry Cole Slaw was tasty! But the Fresh Apple Slices with Toffee Dip was pretty impressive! Any place that has bags while you wait is definitely a place you want to consider! Thanks Hector!
