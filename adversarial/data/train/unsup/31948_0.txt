Terribly disappointing. Our food was lukewarm and that bothers me. spanakopita was soggy and barely warm. Ribeye steak sandwich was tasteless. The bread on the sandwich was tough. Beware, before your meal arrives, they bring you leftover challah bread that is stale, not warm and no butter. I didn't waste time on that garbage. Husband had a hot roast beef sandwich. Roast beef was tough. Service is slow. Checkout is ridiculous. Same person that is Running the register also has to pack all desserts that are ordered to go.
