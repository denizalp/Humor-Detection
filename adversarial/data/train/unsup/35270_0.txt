I've been coming to this place for awhile now and it really never dissapoints.\n\nI've tried several things off the menu and eveything has been consistently delicious. The staff is always so nice and welcoming which is great.\n\nBut in all seriousness, you must try the chicken curry. I was really used to just getting a shawarma wrap but one day one of the employees let me sample some of the curry and dizzamn, it's AMAZING. It's a great little spot, can't recommend this place enough.
