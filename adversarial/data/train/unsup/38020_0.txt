I went to Elite Optical to get my eyes checked and get some glasses so I could see again.  The first impression with the staff on the phone was great.  As we worked through scheduling me for my first appointment, London (sp) was very helpful and friendly.  When I got there, I filled out a piece of paper and they took me right back to see Dr. Miner.  I was in\/out of Elite Optical in 25 minutes.  They got my glasses within 5 days and text me to notify me they were available.\n\nI will absolutely be recommending them to anybody who needs their eyes checked or new glasses.
