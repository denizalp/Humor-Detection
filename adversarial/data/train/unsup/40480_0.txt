After a long break and lots of doctor changes at this place I went in for my 8month olds 6month immunizations and had a very likable experience. We were greeted by the nurse as usual put into our room all the weight and measurements done. As we were waiting to see the doctor before the immunizations were administered a ray of sunshine named Jenny the PA walked into the room. She did a thorough check up on my daughter and answered all of my questions putting my mind at ease to give my child her immunizations which I get queazy about.  She gave me a few pointers about the fevers some children get after immunizations and really went above and beyond to give me all the information I needed to care for my child after and she even had my daughter laughing and smiling.  (She also gave me a sample of formula for my daughter to help her with her reflux.) thanks doctor Jenny! (Or Jenny the PA!) we really appreciate the care bright futures pediatrics gives us!
