All you get is to spend a lot of money on an observation pod that rotates for a half hour and gives you a splendid view of the city.  You can get military and senior discounts, and there's typically also a Groupon to help lessen the cost (by a fraction).\n\nThere's a cheesy announcer on screen that tells bad jokes and lets you know how far you've gone and how high up you are.  You get spectacular views of the city and a half hour's worth of time to relax and see the sights.  If you get the booze package, you get in a booze pod, and if you don't, you don't.  \n\nFor what it is - a one foot per second rotation around a wheel that goes up to 550 feet above the Strip - it's worth it.  If you go in expecting more than that, well then I don't know what to tell you.  You go high in the air and look around.  That's it.
