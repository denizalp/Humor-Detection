DO NOT GO HERE. Extremely unprofessional. Gave me and my friend their word to come at 3pm for our bridal and maid of honour manicures, we showed up on time and they said they didn't know about our appointments. \nCouldn't give a $5 discount for their mistake, was not apologetic, and incredibly rude.  The staff contradicts herself in her explanations. Very frustrating and unnecessary.  She even spoke on the phone with their owner ON SPEAKER phone. Talked about us in front of us assuming we don't understand the language. \nHorrible service. Do not waste ur time here.
