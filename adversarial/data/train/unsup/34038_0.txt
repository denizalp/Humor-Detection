Decent pizza, the sauce is kinda sweat which isn't my favorite but the toppings are fresh. The bad part about this place is the service.  I ordered a pizza on a Monday night and had to wait an hour and a half for it, and that was to pick it up. It's also a little pricey if you don't have any coupons.
