Got a discount for the buffet from purchasing firstly at the tix4tonight stands. Instead of paying $25, we paid $11.99 and it includes unlimited wine and beer. Food was pretty good but they are doing some construction, so the salad and dessert bar where smashed against eachother. But overall, it was okay if your on a budget.
