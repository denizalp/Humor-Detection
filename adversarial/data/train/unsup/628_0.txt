I have to tell you lately we've been going to Postino's Highland and there is the most amazing bartender slash server Derek that is so personable and definitely easy to remember. His service is always so knowledgeable and friendly. He is definitely the reason why we come into this Postino's. We have frequent other Postino's but by far his service is superior of all. The bruschetta board is amazing and the meat and cheese board is to die for. Thank you Derek for all your amazing service we hope to see you soon. Chris Birkett and Sarah squared. :-)
