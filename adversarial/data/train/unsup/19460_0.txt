Very good authentic Mexican restaurant to eat at. The two main guys working here are very friendly and they go out of their way to make you feel at home and welcomed. I had the bean and cheese burrito which included fresh, homemade beans and delicious cheese. My boyfriend got the carne asada burrito which was piled high and to the brim of the tortilla.\n\nThe atmosphere is small but clean, I had passed by this place many times on my way to Paradise Video and I had always wondered if this place was any good. While we were eating even a worker from Taco Bell from across the way came in and ate! A very nice family owns this small shop but damn with all the hype about the daughters, I was expecting a crossbreed between Salma Hayek and Eva Longoria. Calm down people, very pretty girl but damn she's not that hot. Let's concentrate on that delicious enchilada sauce.
