Whoa whoa wait, what??\n\nI rarely EVER give one star. \n\nBut, you know...I'm on Yelp to be honest and to help you make informed decisions. So here ya go. \n\nYou know when you're traveling and you gotta pee, bad, so you stop at a gas station and they hand you a key...on a long wooden board, with a chain on it. Immediately you think, uh oh. Not good. \n\nYeah. \n\nDirty, sticky, trashy , sweaty, cramped. \n\nThat's Primanti Bros (at least this location). \n\nAfter climbing the stairs to the second floor and trying not to touch the railing (I think it should be tested by the health department) we sat for approx 18 minutes. We cleaned our own table. Piles of cups and wrappers. \nThe table was dirty and no one offered to wipe it. There is supposed to be table service, people. \n\nWe were patient because the few (very few) people working were working hard. Way understaffed. \n\nPeople came in after us, got drinks. \nWe got,  \"Be right with you.\"\n5 more minutes. \nAnother group came in after us. \nThey got drinks.\nWe got ignored. \n\nThe staff is not rude, they are highly understaffed.\nAnd it's dirty. Did I mention that already?? Sorry. Not sorry. \n\nWe left. \nWent across street to Stacked. \n\nThat's it.
