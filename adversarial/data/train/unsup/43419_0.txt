We came here for happy hour on a weekday. Service is subpar (it took almost 20-30 minutes to get a server's attention), then they never checked back on us. I say 'they' because noone was actually assigned to us and they acted like they could care less. Good beer & draft selection, typical bar food\/apps. If it wasn't for the really open atmosphere and roof top, I'd otherwise pass on Il Tetto and go elsewhere.
