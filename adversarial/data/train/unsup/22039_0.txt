Ladies, if you like to have your pick of portly married men that have not seen the inside of a gym in 5 years...this is the spot for you. Totally chill local bar. \nFull of married men escaping the wrath of married life with kids; making it an awesome place for women who aren't interested in \"mingling\" (like me). \nA perfect refuge to drink with regulars who are there for the beer and nachos.\nThe mix match of furniture including sofas, arm chairs and easily movable tables gives it a cozy basement kinda feel. \nThere's a robust and comprehensive selection of local and not so local craft beer, that changes regularly, which will excite any beer drinker (not me). \nBonus: Due to the extreme male\/female ratio (30:1), the women's washroom is always super clean available!
