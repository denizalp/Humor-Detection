Gosh...delicious, different, amazing. The Carne Asada fries were flavors I've never experienced together. My spicy hot dog loaded with cheese, grilled onions and garlic mayo was another flavor train I've never conducted. This place has a heart, it's made to order, and worth every penny. You won't leave hungry.
