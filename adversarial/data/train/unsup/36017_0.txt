I've had chronic lower back pain for a couple of years.  I went to chiropractic treatments occassionally with another chiropractor.  I felt OK after each treatment but the pain came back in a day or two.  A colleague referred me to Leo Quan at the Source Centre.  I went there and have been a patient since then.\n\nRecently I broke my knee in April.  Due to limited mobility, I fell hard on wet tile & also injured my back in May.  Went to hospital for x-ray by ambulance.  The doctor told me no broken bones.  However I could neither sit up nor walk.  It was excruciating painful when I had to sit up to eat in bed with lots of pillows behind me.  I was bedridden.\nSo I called Leo & asked him for house visits.  He was very helpful & came twice a week to work on my back.  At the beginning, I needed Leo & my husband to help me move from the bed to the chiropractic table while me yelling, \"ouch, ouch...all the way.\"  Leo used spinal networking technique to release blockage so my back could heal by itself.  He also gave me simple exercises to strengthen the back muscles.  He constantly asked my progress and gave me lots of encouragements when I felt frustrated and helpless.  He also used some manipulations to stretch my spine and gua sha to improve blood circulation.   Slowly I was able to sit and gradually walk with a walker.   Without Leo's help,  I would not be able to sit and walk  in 1 and 1\/2 months.  Now I am able to walk with crutches and go back to work.\n\nI highly recommend Leo Quan at Source Centre for Health & Wellness for your chiropractic care.
