Went in the other day for a couple drinks for my best friend and I--we like to try different coffee joints around the valley. A co-worker brought some in to work and told me I had to try it so I went. Jesus--so good. Solid good coffee. Not bitter, very smooth, and amazing flavors. I tried a couple of the cookies too and those were also very delicious. I got the Horchata with 2%. Fantastic. Really can't get over it. Small little hole in the wall that needs a street-side location--for real! My bestie and I will be coming back again and again!!
