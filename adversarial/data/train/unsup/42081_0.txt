After three visits, I can finally say that both the food and service are top notch. I've only had the wings and fried macaroni bites, but I've enjoyed them every time. The wings were large and cooked well. The flavours I've tried were honey garlic, BBQ and honey mustard. It's a small, clean spot with a few tables for dining in. I recommend it if you're in the mood for wings.
