I was craving Korean food so drove myself way across town b\/c so many people recommended the food.  I have to say, I was sorely disappointed!\n\nI ordered the dolsot bibimbap which is sizzling hot stone bowl filled with rice and topped with a nice medley of vegetables.  The key is to mix in the hot sauce and quickly mix everything together while the bowl still sizzles.  This was a major disappointment because there was just SO MUCH rice and so little veggies and the veggies that they did use were very uninspired.  They could have used some traditional korean greens but instead it was just the plain stuff...  I can easily make it better at home.\n\nAlso, the banchan was bad as well.   The marinated garlic stems were horrible and tasted way old...  so did the kimchi..\n\nIt's not worth the drive but if I'm in the neighborhood maybe I'll try it again one day.  I'm used to the great Korean food in LA so my standards could be too high, but I really think this place could put a little more effort into their food.
