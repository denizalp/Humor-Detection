Although I have been craving some Indian food for the greater part of the last year, it's taken me this long to get around to getting some. The largest reason is the fact that I have two young kids who are rarely adventurous enough to try things outside of chicken fingers and mac and cheese. Once the Indian bug had struck me one too many times, hubby and I decided to leave it up to yelp on where we could score some sweet buffet action...reason being that the kids could pick and choose what they wanted.\n\nWe've passed India Oven numerous times since it's in the neighborhood but this was the first time going in. When we arrived there was one other couple seated. It was a little early for dinner so it's understandable. As soon and they left and it was just us in the restaurant, the attentiveness of the servers was a little too much. I do appreciate the endless basket of naan and the tandoori chicken, thank you, but I don't need to be asked if everything is okay every 5 minutes or so. The staff was super friendly though, so this was only mildly annoying. Once others arrived, the attention shifted to them. Thank you...\n\nThe chicken tikka masala was on point...I was very happy with that. This was my first time trying lamb vindaloo, and that was good too. The paneer masala was good but the sauce was thinner than the chicken tikka. I tried some other things, all were decent. The buffet is separated into vegetarian, non-vegetarian, and salad & dessert. The vegetarian options were plentiful and the kids found a couple things they liked.\n\nPrice wise is where I knock the two stars off. Although the adult buffet is reasonable at $8.95 for dinner, the kids buffet was $6.95. I knew what it was going into it, but there is no way my five year old eats close to that amount. She had some rice, naan, and some cheese balls...that's about it. Chances are if we come back it will be on a date night.
