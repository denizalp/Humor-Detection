Hmm...rarely do I return and reduce my rating....never actually. But, this time, I have no choice. The sushi was still good (again, for the area and what we have available to us) and we tried some of our friend's hibachi and the steak was really good - hence the reason I'll still give three stars. This time, I ordered my beloved strawberry citrus-tini martini. While the drink itself was the same, the rim didn't have the same amazing blue sugar. And....there was some sort of hair or something of some sort in my drink...that I discovered AFTER drinking some of the drink. I'm still grossed out by it. Can I, will I return? I'm not so sure.
