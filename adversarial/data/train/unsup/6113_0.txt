I will literally be to the point as I'm using qwerty right now, no keyboard.\n\n1.  Walls are thin\n2. I can hear my neighbor fart, have sex, and listen to their ENTIRE personal conversation without yelling. Disgusting\n3. TV next door are loud and magnified. You will not sleep. Trust me.\n4,  too too many children\n5, again, too too many children\n6.  Too \"ghetto\" and trashy place. Never again. I was afraid for my life! \n7.  All rooms are smoky smelly! \n8.  Staff socialize too much ignoring customers.\n9,  old CRT tv\n10.  Def ancient feel to this whole establishment\n11.  Trust me on this please, YOU WILL NOT sleep! \n\nOh yeah\n\n12. Parking is very weird!\n13. No fridge just a cooler box that never gets colder than 60F. What the heck?\n14. SLOW Internet that crawls! Seriously\n15. They charge $7 convenience fee a day for their SLOW dial up speed Internet, pool usage that's overcrowded (I never used it - full of children).\n\n\nCheckout is a very slow process by the way ...... ONE person to check you out while the line piles up. Good luck if your flight scheduled early!
