I'll give it three stars for the food only. Service was awful!!! Also, I believe the AC was not working because it's hotter than hell in there. Our sever walked by our table (once) asking if everything was ok, and my reply in one sentence was \"yes can we get some napkins?\" And he just kept walking. I'm pretty sure I could of said no and he still would have not stopped which tells me he didn't really care. He took our water glasses and brought them back with no straws. He brought us food but gave us no utensils. Our whole meal we needed napkins, straws, and I had to flag him down for a drink. My tacos were amazing and the salsa was great. That would be why I come back, thanks to the chefs!! Can I tip them instead?
