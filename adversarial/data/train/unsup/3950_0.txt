Piestewa Peak (formerly known as Squaw Peak) is one of my favorite hikes in the Valley! It is similar in difficulty to Camelback Mountain but doesn't get as crowded! It is moderate\/difficult, 1.2 miles in length, and a 1,200 feet elevation change. Don't let the 1.2 miles fool you - it is pretty steep! But once you get to the top, you'll have 360 degree views of the Valley. Yes, please! Water, decent parking, and restrooms are available at the base of the trail. Leashed dogs are allowed in the park area and on some of the trails but they are not allowed on the summit trail. We'll see you soon, Piestewa Peak!
