Love this place, I come here all the time for one item in particular: their curry beef brisket with roti. To be honest I haven't had much else on the menu because I love it so much! The roti is crisp but soft and the brisket melts in your mouth while the curry is so flavourful. \n\nI believe the place is family owned, and so the setting is small and intimate, but very clean and bright. Prices are good for the portions and quality, $10 or less per plate.
