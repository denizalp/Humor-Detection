I actually really liked this hotel. I got a standard room with two beds and it was a decent size with a nice bathroom and quiet inside! The only two negative things I have to say are:\n1.  the walk from the parking lot is very far. \n2. The maid people try to clean the rooms WAY too early and are a bit intrusive. We were down for EDC weekend, and got there Thursday. My friend and I had stayed up until 6 am and had just fallen asleep around 7 am when someone tries to barge in the door (good thing I locked the top latch) after this person realized the latch was on they kept pushing! I thought it was my friend until he says from the other bed, \"I think someone is trying to come in the room\" yeah I got annoyed\/freaked out, I checked the time: 8 am! Really?! Then 5 minutes later they come back and open the door AGAIN, and start knocking super loud as it's open. I yelled, \"we are trying to sleep!!\" And they slammed the door shut. Really??? Not cool. Other than that it was fine I would stay again.
