Came here on a Wednesday night, May 9, 2012.\n\nI had been wanting to visit this bar for over a year, but two things held me back.  One, I heard they don't make the handcrafted cocktails on weekends (and apparently busy nights which include Mondays as well?).  Second, I had no one to enjoy a drink with a weekday\/night.\n\nBut I was finally able to convince a friend and his group to rendevous here.  The excitement had been built up to a euphoric level... only to be flattened by a cold (male) bartender.\n\nPlease, before any professional bartenders or sympathizers argue that one can't always be greeting patrons with a smiling face, and enthusiastic welcome... shut the fuck up.  You're in the hospitality business, and it's your job.  If you wanna be called a professional, act like it.  And I felt extra jipped because I always tip well on drinks (or at least a respectable dollar tip per drink for shitty service, which is what I got that night).\n\nMy Vegas-local friend told me that that's the way things are everywhere in Vegas, cause tourists don't bother leaving tip oftentimes, so the bartenders don't see the payout as especially rewarding for such a difficult thing as a smile.\n\nTo be honest, the cocktails were quite interesting.  There was one that used strawberry jam, and it was very tasty.  I wish I could remember the names, but the bartender seemed too busy to bother again.\n\nHey, it's a sleek-lookin place, with a soothing lavender ambiance.  It's right in middle of Cosmo, which to me is the hottest hotel in Vegas right now, so the people watching can be great.  The handcrafted cocktails were what I was looking for.  But, as with my complaint with Scarpetta, I came to Vegas to have a good time...  not to feel like some asshole demanding special treatment, and putting the bartender out.  Cosmo, you were a night of fail.
