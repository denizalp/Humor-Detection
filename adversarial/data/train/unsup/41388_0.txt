My favorite sushi place!! I'm very picky about my Japanese food due to the fact that I'm half Japanese. I love their mini spicy chirashi because it's only $12.95 and it big enough to share with my husband. When I first saw it I was skeptical and thought that the bowl was just full of rice with a little bit of fish on top. NOPE it's the other way around! Full of fish with a little bit of rice on the bottom. We've had a couple of rolls as well and they have also been delicious. Next time I will be trying their ramen!
