Fry's offers very good sale prices, if you can find the items in the store. \n\nIf you need to return an item, be prepared to face heavy scrutiny.  While looking at their customers with extreme suspicion, they will check the manual or packing list to make sure each and every piece is present, which is understandable, but after the employee checks the contents, they must call a supervisor, who proceeds to rummage through the contents of the box again.  Only then can your refund or exchange be approved.\n\nFry's has a price match guarantee stating that they will match any competitor's price, online or local.  I approached an associate and gave him both Fry's and Amazon's stock numbers for the items.  He informed me that Amazon is an authorized competitor, but that shipping and handling would be added to the price.  As the item was priced at $69.99 ($10 cheaper than Fry's), Amazon offers free shipping, so I agreed to wait while the gentleman looked up my claim.  About 5 minutes after he began researching, he called a manager, who then spent several more minutes navigating Amazon's site.  After a total of about 10 minutes, the associate I had originally spoken to approached me with a printout showing a shipping charge of about $6.  He offered me a discount of just over $3.  It appears that the manager looked up the item, and chose one of Amazon's third-party sellers in order to generate a shipping charge.  After sales tax, and the fact that they only partially honored their policy, the Fry's price was actually more expensive than Amazon.  I politely refused, explained why, left the store, then ordered the item from Amazon on my phone while sitting in the Fry's lot.\n\nIn summary, while they often offer very good sales prices, Fry's \"subsidizes\" them with questionable policy adherence and sketchy, almost uncomfortable customer service.  Proceed with caution.
