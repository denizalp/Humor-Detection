I'm a new mom who wanted to have a gender reveal party. I yelped a couple of places and since I've been to nothing bundt cakes before, and found that they did gender reveal cakes I decided to go in. I came across the rudest person in NC (mind you I moved from CA recently). She looks at me with an annoying stare and tells me \"we don't do those\". I explained that I've seen reviews that say they do, but she continues to say \"nope, we don't\" ... As I'm walking away disappointed and upset, another lady comes running out and says \"we do have them but they are just with a frosting color, depending on the gender\". In my head I was thinking, that's exactly what I wanted. Why the other person was not aware of this service, I don't know, all I know is that I will never go to this bakery for a piece of bundt cake. They lost my service that day! I'm sorry, but I just can't with rude people, that don't even know what kind of business they have.
