I've been here a couple of times, and each time I find that the customer service is a little less desirable than the time before it. The employees always seem a tad bit annoyed and not really interested in helping. I also find the service a little too slow. The smoothies are delicious, albeit a tad bit expensive. The store interior is quite cute.
