This 4\/5 is specifically for the awesome Pulled Pork Nachos and for our friendly waitress. Other parts were less impressive. \n\nMy friends and I visited on a Saturday just after 3p during Happy Hour. The place was basically empty except for a few people at the bar. \n\nMy friend Ms. S and I decided to share the Pulled Pork Nachos while Mr. E went for the Smoked Wings with Fries (both on the HH Menu). The Nachos were awesome because they were totally loaded with some great cheese sauce and the flavor of the BBQ Pork was sweet and delicious! While I didn't get to try the wings, I did try the fries - they had nice seasoning, but the fries themselves were just fine. \n\nI really wanted to try the ribs, but I certainly didn't want an entire half rack let alone all the sides that came with it. I happened to notice that the children's menu had a two rib meal. I asked the waitress if I could order off the kids menu and she said no. So I asked if I could \"order for my son\" (my six month old). She checked with the management and got the go-ahead! However, the ribs were brought out by a woman from the kitchen who seemed extremely upset by the fact that I'd ordered from the kids menu. She looked at my nursing son and said, \"This is for him?\"  I thought she was being funny, so I laughed and said, \"He's a big eater!\" (which happens to be very true). She rolled her eyes in the most aggressive way possible and sarcastically said, \"I bet.\" and walked away. I just thought it was sad that they let me order and then had to be judgy and mean about it. If it was that big of a problem, they could've just told me no. Also, the ribs weren't very good. Next time I would definitely skip these and try something else. \n\nMs. S and I also shared the brownie Bread Pudding, which I found pretty disappointing. For my tastes it wasn't as rich or as sweet as I wanted it to be. \n\nDespite some problems, I would return for HH, get the Nachos again and try something new!
