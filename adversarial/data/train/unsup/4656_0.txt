I wanted some food delivered this evening.  And not pizza; I'm tired of pizza.\n\nI decided to see if I could find Asian food for delivery.  Extra points if I could order online.\n\nI went to Yelp to look for a place that A) had at least a three star rating 2) would deliver and III) allowed online ordering with credit card payment.\n\nThe first choice (best rating, closest to me) said they didn't deliver to my address.  My second choice made a new (to me) use of the Internet.  Found the place with Yelp, but when I went to place an order I got handed off to a site called Eat24.  What they did was take the order, with pull down menus for all the options (like, what kind of rice would you like?) and took the credit card information (and presumably validated it) and then passed the order on to the restaurant.\n\nQuickie review follows.\nThe Good:\n  Ordering through Eat24 was painless once I enabled Javascript.\n  It got delivered--I didn't have to go out on a cold and rainy night.\n  It was if not hot, at least warm.\n  There was plenty.  Enough for two people, or in my case, lunch tomorrow.\n  The veggies weren't overcooked.\n  The pot stickers were good.\n  It smelled good enough to get my cat's attention.\n\nThe Bad:\n  Delivery took a bit over an hour.\n  It was expensive (at least compared to pizza).  Counting tax, delivery\n    fee, driver tip and a few extras (more water cress, more pork in the \n    garlic pork) it was over $30.\n  It was bland.  The hot sour soup was improved when I added some Apple Cider\n    vinegar.  If I had some white pepper, I'd have added it too.  The brown\n    garlic gravy had no detectable garlic flavor.\n\nThe indifferent:\n  It came with a little packet that contained pouches of hot mustard and soy\n    sauce, a napkin, plastic knife and spoon and a fortune cookie.\n\nI think I'm still in the market for some other place.  I'd consider Lucky Kitchen again if they were a bit more inexpensive, but my reaction to the whole deal was \"blah\", and I'd want more than that for $30.
