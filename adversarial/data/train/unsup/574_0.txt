I am still a firm believer in service and the customer is always right if you want them to come back.  This was our first time trying this place.\n\nMy co-workers and I ordered lunch for take out today at 10:45 am.  15 min. Before they opened.  We place 4 orders.  All of which were lunch specials.  For some reason they charged one of us the entree price $14 vs. $9 for the lunch special also never asked if it was a lunch or entree order. \n\nWhen we tried to explain how it was obviously for lunch the hostess (very nice and polite) took our issue to the manager who REFUSED to give is the lunch rate since the extra tamale had already been boxed up.\n\nCompletely illogical and unnecessary response.  We work for CVS and this is the closest take out to our Az head quarters.  \n\nThree of us really enjoyed our lunches (chicken mole bowls and the green chili enchiladas...the charro beans are ok). Our poor friend who paid $14 for a take out lunch was unimpressed as well she should be w\/ $14 dry tamales with beans on top.\n\nWe will not be going back and will be sure to spread the word through CVS of this experience.\n\nTake Away: you never know who you are serving, customer service is still important. It may impact your business 10 fold.\n\nDisappointed and Irritated!
