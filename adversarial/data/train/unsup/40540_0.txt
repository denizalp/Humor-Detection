The atmosphere is nice but the food was just ok\n\nCarpaccio was good but too much cheese on it\n\nCrab cake was tasty and we like the sauce\n\nCalamari was very light and it's our favorite\n\nRib eye was too fatty. I could only eat half of my steak. The other half was just fat. I though I was the \"lucky\" one but my cousin's rib eye too were very fatty. \n\nThe prime rib dinner was good but it's not as good as Lawry's\n\nCreamed corn, the kid like it but I don't\n\nAsparagus should have grilled a little longer...\n\nFor the price like that, I would rather go to Hanks steakhouse
