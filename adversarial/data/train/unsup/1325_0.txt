Raising Canes who?! Chick-fil-A who?! Living in Las Vegas, we have been so lucky to have many out of town chains come our way. PDQ has hit the jackpot with their chicken tenders! Talk about winner winner chicken dinner! \n\n\"People dedicated to quality\" couldn't be more true. You can see it in their customer service and you can taste it in their food. A simple concept that is often hard to come by these days with other places. \n\nFood:\n- Chicken tenders: Super tender and juicy with just the right amount of seasoning and breading. \n\n- Fries: FRESH CUT fries! I liked it! I am actually very picky about fries. (Shh...not a fan of in & out fries!)\n\n- Sauces: They really hook you up here! It is unlimited, so indecisive people just try 'em all. I really like the creamy garlic and sweet sriracha. The buffalo, bleu buffalo, and honey bbq weren't too bad. I have yet to try the honey mustard, ranch, and chipotle bbq sauces.\n\nI love that they are big community supporters. On my first visit, there was a pink t-shirt and milk shake promo for breast cancer awareness month. For Veterans day, they are honoring free tenders or sandwich for vets \/ active military. \n\nFair prices, unlimited sauces, desserts, seasonal shakes, and fresh tasting fast food will keep me coming back! \n\nIf lady luck is on my side, I hope we get a PDQ in Henderson soon!
