I've been looking for a Thai restaurant to replace the legends in Portland and this is the closest replacement I've found. Overall I was pretty impressed in the food. Their version of spicy wasn't very spicy but they had bowls of dried pepper powder to help me adjust the temperature to my liking. I will be visiting again.
