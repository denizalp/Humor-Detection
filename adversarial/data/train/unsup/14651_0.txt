If you go to get wild, which is the only reason to go, be sure to get the puke insurance.  That way, if\/when you puke on the bar, they won't kick you out!  If you think I am joking, go there and see for yourself.  \n\nIf you get the puke insurance, ask the bartender to make you a glass of ass juice.  That way, you will get the most out of your experience and the insurance won't go to waste.
