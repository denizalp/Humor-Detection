One of my all time favourite places in the city. A great restaurant for a special occasion dinner or those looking to try dim sum for the first time. \n\nEverything from their service to ambience is top notch. \n\nI'm a simple guy but the har gow is mind blowing and a must have...just look at how good it looks in the picture! Do yourself a favour and make resos for this place quick.
