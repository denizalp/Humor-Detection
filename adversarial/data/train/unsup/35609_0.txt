HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  I got a Groupon as a gift for the ion soak and hot stone foot massage.  When I called to make an appointment, they offered an upgrade service for $16 or so for a back massage for 30minutes.  I said I'd let them know when I got there.  No pressure from the guy on the phone.   I did agree to the upcharge for the add'l massage time when I arrived.  I was put on a relaxing chair and my feet were immersed in a wooden bucket.  Never having had an ion soak before, I didn't know what to expect. It was relaxing.   The lady started rubbing my head and face, neck and shoulders.. this amazing treatment just went on and on.  My feet were soaked, rubbed, and stoned, and the massage was heaven.  The girl 'Rose' spoke no English, but she did know enough to ask if the pressure was ok.  I'm tellin ya - I would go back every day if I could.. Not ONE thing I can criticize.. simply amazing.
