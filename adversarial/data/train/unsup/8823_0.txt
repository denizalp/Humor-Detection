Horrible, horrible phone call just now with Operations Manager \"Dan\".  After calling two times this morning at 7:46am and getting no answer, I tried again at 10:48am and spoke to Dan, who appeared to get defensive after I told him I'd been calling the gym but got no answer. He then commented on my out of town number, accused me of being a telemarketer, and asked why I wanted to know about day passes and gym amenities.  After I told him I was in town on travel and looking for a gym, he continued to accuse me of being a telemarketer, and finally reluctantly answered my questions. His treatment made me feel profiled and the encounter, disillusioned, about visiting the gym. I'm glad I called first and will NEVER patronize or recommend.
