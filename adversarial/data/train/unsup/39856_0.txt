We loved the old place, Il Nido, but this is a fantastic transition. The place is small so reservation is a must. They are new so still working out some kinks. \n\nWe split 3 things. Beet salad, the cheese ravioli and the lamb chops. All 3 were amazing. \n\nThe big negative I had here was the service. It took FOREVER. I think they have a small staff and a small kitchen, however you would also think with a small number of tables you would have a lot of attention. Not the case. So if you do go, plan on at least a 2 hour dinner.\n\nThe food is amazing, just be prepared to wait.
