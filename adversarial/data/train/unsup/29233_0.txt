Fantastic product and service!!  Be sure to try the spicy chicken wrap--you better because this beauty is huge and delicious down to the last bite!!\n\nI can only wish that we had a Pita Jungle back home- Chicago- so many imposters that do not live up to the quality offered here at the Pita Jungle here in Scottsdale!!  \n\nNext time you are in the area- local or visitor, be sure to pop on over and try this place out--Many great fresh and yummy options to choose from--wraps, salads, etc.\n\nThanks again and we look forward to seeing you again, soon!!!
