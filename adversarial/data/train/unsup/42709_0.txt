My boyfriend and I went out for dinner there yesterday night while enjoying a nice night out together, and after our terrible experience with the place we had chosen for lunch, The Cheesecake Factory was a relief. Our service was exceptional, Laura waited on us and she couldn't have done a better job. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and let us take our time and choose what we wanted. Everything was absolutely delicious from the Georgia Peach I ordered from the bar menu to the S'mores Cheesecake I had for dessert. Keep it up CCF always a good choice and we will definitely be back!\n\nYummy - Orange chicken leftovers!!
