Tamarind is an OK place to eat in strip mall in Pittsburgh. The waiter did not seem to understand us, and we had trouble understanding him. We had the tandoor variety appetizer that was spiced so hot that it really hurt. Then I had the chicken tikka and my partner had the lamb vindaloo. The vindaloo was hot, the tikka was perfect. I like that they have Indian beers--I was pleased to have a Kingfisher. Tamarind was just OK.
