After research on the Internet about facial treatment that I wanted I gave Neos a call. Jana ( client relations rep) was most helpful & informative with great follow up.   She recommended a Laser Peel to get the best results. My other option was VI Peel. I opted for the VI Peel. Jana got me scheduled at the day & time I needed. Unfortunately the tech assigned to the peel ( I believe filling in for someone) didn't complete the peel as designed. So I had zero results.  Both Brian (owner) & Jana stepped in to get me scheduled for a treatment (Artic Laser Peel) to make up for my disappointment. They both seemed genuinely concerned that I would be happy with my results.  I waited a month to say this ... I am happy with the results!!! Im going to have a second Laser Peel when my work schedule permits. I can honestly say the single reason I will go back to Neos is Jana.  She has great customer skills, informative, empathic, sets reasonable expectations, and a desire the client gets their desired results!
