Note: this review is solely for the value of the deal, not for the quality of buffets [see separate entries]\n\nUmmm hmm.  So for $45 not including tax, you get to go hog-wild with eating up to 6 buffets in 24-hours within these Vegas buffets: http:\/\/www.caesars.com\/total\/las-vegas\/buffet-of-buffets.\n\nMay the best (wo)man win.  \n(B\/c life should always be about competitive eating).
