I'm not really a buffet person, but everyone says you have to go to a buffet in Vegas. I'm a foodie; buffets completely turn me off. Despite my reservations, this was my third trip to the strip and I decided to give it a shot. \n\nWe were lucky enough to visit the buffet during Mothers Day weekend, so we had the holiday dinner option for about $50\/person.  The dinner had some additional items that could have been special for the holiday, such as beef Wellington, snow and king crab legs, prime rib, etc. so keep that in mind as you read my review. \n\nThe waitstaff were extremely hospitable. You don't have to get your own drinks here, they bring them for you. My refills were done before the liquid hit the bottom of the cup. I asked for coffee with my dessert and he brought me an entire pot. Unlimited alcoholic drink options were available for an additional $5 but honestly I wanted to save my calories for the expansive dessert table. \n\nThe only item I was not impressed with was the paella. There was bits of sand in the mussels. However, the rest of my meal was epic. I won't gross you out with the details of my pig-out session, but the seafood was especially good and nothing ran out or emptied. The dessert table was phenomenal. The creme brûlée was just as good as a quality establishment.  \n\nI had similar dishes at the buffet at The Mirage and was unimpressed. See my review of that one, if you like. If I could choose any buffet on the strip, it would be Bellagio.
