OMB is a great place to have some tasty beers and hang out with some friends.  The atmosphere is cool.  It's a wide open modern building with hardwood floors.  I tried their Mecktoberfest brew yesterday and it was delicious!  And I'm always a fan of the Copper as well.  The only downfall to this place for me is they don't serve any kind of snacks.  The hubby and I met with our university alumni group early in the evening but we didn't have a chance to eat beforehand.  I was starving by time we were finishing up our drinks and ready to leave, not to mention having beers on an empty stomach did a number on me.  We will definitely be back for more, but I'll make sure to eat first.
