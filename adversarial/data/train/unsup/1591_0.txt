This is a coffee shop and a bar and there are also video poker machines. This place is open 24\/7 and it is good and they have a drive through, that is also a plus one star. It has a nice patio, WiFi is free. I'm a fan of their music selection and a big selection of coffee and tea. Sandwiches and salads are good as well. \n But if you are non smoker this place just might put you off.... Smoking is allowed inside and there is a cigarette smoke that is ever-present .... \nOverall,this is not the best place to get a drink or coffee, simply because there are so many better places. But if you absolutely have to, heck give a try... ;)
