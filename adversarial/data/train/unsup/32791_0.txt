I took my rabbit Mia for the first time to get her nails trimmed, it took around 5 minutes which I was surprised because my rabbit doesn't like to be held, so I left it up to the pros and they said she did well which I was happy about. She can now hop more comfortably. They were also very kind and knowledgeable about all the questions I had. I will definitely be back again.
