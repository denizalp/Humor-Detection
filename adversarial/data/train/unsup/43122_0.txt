Took our dog Sydney to the Westbrook on the recommendation of a friend and I could not be happier. The doctor took his time with our dog and really made her feel comfortable. He was super knowledgable and answered every question we had. We will be bringing all of our animals here from now on. I will recommend this place to anyone I know with a pet.
