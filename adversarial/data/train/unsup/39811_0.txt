This place is the real deal for BBQ!\n\nMy buddy and I headed down there last week on a Thursday for lunch.  Fortunately we were in line by 10:45 and only had about 10 people ahead of us.  Cars streamed into the parking lot soon afterwards and the line became pretty long.\n\nWe decided to try as many different things as possible and share or orders.  The lean brisket, fatty brisket, pulled pork and sausage were all amazing.  Even though the meat was so good and didn't need any sauce their house sauce was delicious and I put a little bit on each bite.\n\nThe side dishes were just OK.  Grits, beans, cole slaw and potato salad and a few slices of white bread rounded out the meal.\n\nThe owner and other employyees were very friendly and I'll definitely come back another time.
