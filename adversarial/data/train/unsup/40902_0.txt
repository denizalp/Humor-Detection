Have had two not so great experiences here. The first was with a substitute veterinarian who was more busy selling me unneeded veterinarian services to actually treat my cat. They even did a blood test without my permission and then expected me to pay for it! Now I decided to come back when the cat didn't get better so that they could redeem themselves and the actual vet, didn't seem to want to hear it. They refused to give me a refund on the blood test. Not great business practices and they didn't even seem to care about it!
