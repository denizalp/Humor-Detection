I have been to Roadhouse places all over the country, and this was not one of the better ones sadly, especially since it's the new one close to me. Service was okay, but they didn't bring us any hot rolls until we asked when dinner came. They hand tons of staff standing around not doing much lots of the time. \n\nAs for the food I had my usual pork chop dinner, and the chops were well done and very salty, as was the peppercorn sauce that comes with it. Thankfully I like salt, but it was over the top. My wife like her Chicken salad, but it didn't look like anything special. I was shocked the the maybe 3+oz of wine my wife ordered was $8.99. Across the parking lot from this location is Total Wine and More, and I could have got a whole bottle of the same Kendal Jackson for $5.99. Talk about markup! \n\nMost locations I've been to are active, and lively. This one is quite, and slower. There were no birthday call-outs, no line dances, no activity at all. It is a new site, so maybe they'll get better as time goes on.
