Easily one of the coolest addresses in Montreal. It was home to Jello Bar for many years and now to this super badass spot. It's all things cool: hip decor, specially the lighting. Strong drinks, hip-hop, ultra friendly staff.. loved it. \n\nI definitely have to go back for food. Spotted the waiter carrying this delish-looking tartare.... oh la!
