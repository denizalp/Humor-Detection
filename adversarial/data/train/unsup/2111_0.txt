Most Excellent Customer Service.\n\nAs soon as I drove up, the owner Joel walked up and asked me what he could do for me?  He said he could have the oil change done in less than 30 minutes (It was only 20 minutes!!). It was such a beautiful day outside, so no need to sit in the lobby office, but I did go in and accept a complimentary bottled water.\n\nThe location is kind of hidden, so if you look on the NW corner of East Flamingo and Pecos, its right by the Welfare office, Planet Fitness and a Sonic. So happy I found them, very pleased with the customer service and friendliness of the crew.\n\nFor a V8 5.7 liter engine..I paid $72. They check coolant, brake fluid, tire air pressure, air filter,  windshield wiper fluid and Mobile One Synthetic Oil. Great deal all around! And I over heard that they only charge $9.99 for a Smog.\n\nThank you Joel.\nSee you next time!
