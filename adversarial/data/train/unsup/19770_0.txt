Played the Saguaro course last week.  The course was in great shape and the weather was perfect!  The fairways are tight and if you're not hitting them straight, you'll lose a lot of golf balls.  There are no water hazards on the Saguaro course....one of the few courses I've played that doesn't have any.  Here are some pics from my day of golf:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/kYlUfS1ncd64gWCWRmLG0w?select=GBqsZUSQa265-STAUxadpA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/kYlUfS1ncd64gWCWRmLG0w?select=fz7kBUFJ7U5iz0fXnHWwWQ\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/kYlUfS1ncd64gWCWRmLG0w?select=17hoOUnMwTdXhSZWMJgscQ\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/kYlUfS1ncd64gWCWRmLG0w?select=aolhiqTWAHDPbCRyOgEwSA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/kYlUfS1ncd64gWCWRmLG0w?select=HM36COq5094qMz38ZcPAmA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/kYlUfS1ncd64gWCWRmLG0w?select=0Vzjj2NFA9B6ie_WriCJzQ\n\nLiving up to it's name, there are a lot of Saguaro Cacti on the golf course.  Some of the larger ones near the tee boxes are full of stray golf balls that were shanked into the side of them.  Check out these bad boys, can you see all of the golf balls?
