After my experience with another eatery that serves waffles on South Highland, I wanted to give this place a shot for comparison.  While the waffles aren't extraordinary here, I prefer them to Oh Yeah's.  Oh Yeah has more batter and add-in options, but the Waffle Shop's are thicker and (in my opinion) tastier.\n\nI enjoyed the Bananas Foster waffles, though that name is a bit misleadng--the bananas here raw, and not cooked like real Bananas foster. The brown sugar sauce is delicious.  \n\nThe servers were very friendly when I was there, though maybe not the most efficient.  But this was just with little stuff, like not remembering to ask another diner if he wanted cream with his coffee until a few minutes after she had poured him a mug.  Even though one of the employees approached me to ask if I wanted to be on the talk show (no diners had yet volunteered), he didn't pressure me after I said no thanks.  A couple of people wandered into the shop lost and needing directions, and the employees were nice enough to step out the door and point them the right way.  \n\nThis isn't a gourmet experience, but it's a charming one with its quirks.  I'm glad they added daytime hours on Saturday and Sunday because I can barely keep my eyes open late at night nowadays.
