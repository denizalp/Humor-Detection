I came here with a my wife and a few friends from Toronto and this was a place they recommended for desserts.\n\nThere was a nice selection of desserts and everything that we ordered was very good and definitely worth a try.  The desserts we ordered was the perfect shade of sweet and I would definitely come back here the next time I'm craving dessert and visiting the area.  \n\nThe place was very clean.  The service that we received was pleasant and all the staff there was very professional.
