My heart (and stomach) is wavering: who has the better chicken in town? Romados or Coco Rico?\n\nRomados' chicken is a bit smoky and has different layers of flavor (tangy. spicy) I'm literally biting and chewing on all the bones. Fries are delicious with the spicy sauce...And do they serve them by the bucket or something?\n\nCoco Rico's chicken is a different specie. Bigger, juicy, and meat falls off the bone. It's less flavorful in terms of spices but it's so tasty. The potatoes melt in your mouth.\n\nFinish off with a Portuguese egg tart :)\n\nRomado's is better... No Coco Rico is.... No Romados... No Coco Rico... You get the picture!
