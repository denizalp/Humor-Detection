Best experience I've ever had at a salon! I came in for an updo for a marine ball I was attending and ended up getting my makeup done there as well. My stylist was Salvador and he did an unbelievable job and was so quick. After the great experience I had, my boyfrjend ended up getting his haircut done there and said it was the best one he has ever gotten. Everyone at the salon was extremely personable. 10\/10
