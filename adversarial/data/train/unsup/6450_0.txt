New Owners and the place is wonderful!  Yeah!  My very picky daughter had her nails done here and was completely satisfied with how they looked and so was I.  They speak English here and don't ramble Chinese in front of English speaking customers and I really appreciate that.  Also, the price is the price.  They didn't pull the bait and switch.  Do you want this? Do you want that? But forget to say, \"if you do it will cost you an extra whatever amount.\"  If they ask you here if you want something extra, they tell you how much it will cost so you know if it is worth the extra dollars for that service.  Nice!
