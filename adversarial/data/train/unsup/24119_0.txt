Ew. Everyone and everything. Every single time I go here it reminds me to stay the F outta Scottsdale. \n\nI must stress that it's not 6's fault. Its just  that every single miserable person inside 6 kind of sucks. Everyone always looks so unhappy and hateful. Bitches are clocking you left and right. The bottle service chicks always act so bothered to pour you a drink. The dudes look kind of like chicks.\n\nActually the doormen are always really nice here. I'm surprised at how professional and courtesous they are. The bartenders are pretty on point too.\n\nOh.. and I always see at least one person I know - and HATE here. Which is kind of awesome. Maybe I like to hate too.\n\nGood thing I'm getting too old for this place. Play nice kiddies because mommy ain't coming back.
