I love Yelp for showing me great local spots that I might not otherwise check out. This was one of those!\n\nStownut is both a donut shop AND a diner...so of course we ate breakfast AND ordered donuts. \n\nI order Katie's Kitchen Sink - hash browns topped with  split biscuit, 2 eggs and sausage gravy. AH- MAZING. Hubs ordered just some basic eggs with home fries...these are bigger cubes of seasoned Potatoes- and they were really good.\n\nWe for a couple maple donuts to go - even though they had some \"out there\" options like Oreo, Snickers and Froot Loops. So good. My card smelled like love the whole way home.\n\nA) Go for a meal. Yum. B) Dont be distracted by the major chain donut place in the parking lot. Just. Keep. Driving. Trust me. I never lie about donuts.
