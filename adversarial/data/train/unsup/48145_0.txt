Time to buy a used vehicle for the wife. Found what we wanted to look at on their website. Price was good and it was certified pre-owned.  Went to dealership and meet Bill Kopta.  Test drove a 2016 Honda CRV EX-L loaded with navigation, 16000 miles. Wife liked it but wanted to try another type of SUV 1st. The offered us a deal and we told them we would think about it and were going to test drive a BMW SUV.  Couldn't work with BMW (had two prior's BMW's)They even offered lower on our BMW 328i trade in and over a $1000 more for a 2015 standard SUV with more miles.  Back we go to Arrowhead the next day. Meet with Biill again and made offer which they accepted. Paper work with Walter Mundt, finance Mgr. was GREAT. He explained everything in detail.  Since we had Honda's before we knew we would be keeping this one and got the extended 8 yr\/120,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty. Got home and noticed two small dents and 5 small scratches on the rear door and bumper. Called Walter and guess what NO PROBLEM. Vehicle went in, got loaner and in two days damage repaired FREE. What more Customer Service could I ask for?
