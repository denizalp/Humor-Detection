Updating my review based on the owner's rude and sarcastic private message regarding my previous one. I leave negative reviews only if I need to (check my stats). For me food is always the top priority, and that's why I still gave 4 stars despite the time wasted at this place. If you are going to run a fast casual place where people order food from a front counter by yourself, please have a buzzer or something to call you. It's not like you have an open kitchen either. How are customers supposed to order and pay for their bills when you are preparing food in the kitchen in the back? Or perhaps you can let them pay first as they order? It would have been nice if you thought about how to improve service rather than being so defensive and rude to someone who enjoyed your food and shared that experience with others.
