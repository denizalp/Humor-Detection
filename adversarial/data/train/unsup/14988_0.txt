I steer clear of the burger wars.  I'll let people with more skin in the game argue over whether In & Out, Five Guys, Habit, or some other fast-casual chain ultimately comes out on top.\n\nI'll say this, though: Shake Shack is freakin' delicious.\n\nFirst of all, I'm embarrassed that it took me until 2015 to finally eat at Shake Shack.  I dropped by their Las Vegas location (in front of New York New York) for an early lunch.  There was a short line but it moved quickly.\n\nI had a Shackburger (with added pickle and onions), a small side of crinkle cut fries, and a \"Shack Attack\" concrete (chocolate custard with fudge sauce and chocolate truffle cookie dough).\n\nThe food was ready for pick-up within 5 minutes, and in my belly in something like 3 milliseconds.  It was that good.  The burger was juicy, the fries were crispy, and the concrete was decadent.  I left Shake Shack feeling very, very happy.\n\nPrices are some of the best on the Strip.  No up-charges to speak of.  I can't think of anyplace else on the Strip where you can get this caliber of a burger for $5.\n\nI'm pretty much obsessed with Shake Shack now.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll skip so-called \"fine dining\" and eat all my meals here instead.  And I'll Instagram the results in obnoxious detail (natch).\n\nBetter yet: Shake Shack could open up a San Diego location.  That would be nice......
