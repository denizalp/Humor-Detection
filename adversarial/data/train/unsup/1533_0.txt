Came here for the first time yesterday because I heard they had great cocktails, atmosphere, music and people were great! Cocktails sucked! I ordered the same cocktails 3 times and they were always all different! I would only come back if they fire their current bar manager and have someone with bar \/ customer service experience who can execute a great cocktail and teach others to do the same! All employees seemed clueless!
