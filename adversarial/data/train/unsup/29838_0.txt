This was the MOST MISERABLE EXPERIENCE AT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT EVER!!! It literally took them 15 minutes just to take our order!! They kept repeating it back wrong, completely adding in things that we never even mentioned!!! Then they were missing some our food when we received our bags. They also never gave us the dip for my French DIP & Swiss sandwich!!!! Do not go here, unless you enjoy terrible service & not receiving the food you paid for!!
