Definitely one of the nicer hotels I've stayed at. Pet friendly is always a plus. $200\/night was kind of a stretch, but the staff was always helpful and quick with anything I needed. Someone's window did get smashed out of their car while I was there, it wasn't me, but it easily could've been. Scary. Breakfast was a normal continental breakfast, nothing fancy, but the coffee was good. Great location, right off the 101, so very easy to get anywhere quickly. 10\/10, do recommend.
