\"Woah!\" That's the first thing I said when I stepped into the brand new mega, big box, home decor superstore, \"At Home\", here in Henderson.  It's like Costco, Lowes & Ikea rolled into one. Or Homegoods on steroids!\n\nBackground:\nBased in Texas, the company acquires old stores that goes out of business and repurposes them. Hence the former Kmart\/Sears Outlet, now, At Home. \n\nOne-Stop-Shop for indoor and outdoor home furnishings, decor and seasonal goods. \n\nAffordable and reasonable retail prices. \n\nI'm gonna put out there they have the largest selection I've seen in rugs, wall art and pillows.\n\nFIVE STARS because they had the perfect blingy, sparkly, furry, girly glam stuff for my dressing \/makeup room that I'm still designing. \n\nScored:\n-7ft wardrobe mirror edged with cracked metallic silver for 80 bucks!\n\n-$5 & 6 Boho chic throw rugs! \n\n-Beveled glass top for $40\n\nall were really nice quality! I'm soo a fan!\n\nEmployees friendly and helpful. \nWarehouse is clean, organized, good signage.\nMock kitchen, bedroom & living room displays. \nNice wide aisles. \nLove the super wide shopping carts!\n\n---\/\/--If someone in regional,district or corporate is reading this, please supply the cashiers with wireless scan guns or get longer cords for them! They're having a difficult time with scanning larger, heavier merchandise that they can't reach!\n\nTIPS:\nGrab a store map to find your way quicker \nWear your comfy shoes. \nAllow 2 hours of shopping time. \nBring the car with the bigger trunk!
