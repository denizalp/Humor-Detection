Expectations Anihilated.  It had been a while since I visited, when it went under the name of Honba.  Still a nice place, less Japanese looking and more in line with a nice mainstream restaurant.  The hostess offered me the choice of menu or AYCE.  I looked at both, because I find it hard to trust AYCE.  \n\nInspecting the AYCE menu, I noticed something strange--Sashimi?  On an AYCE menu?  I thought the point of AYCE was to load you up on carbs so the restaurant saves on the cost of protein!\n\nI was onto their game.  I knew the sushi would likely be thinner on the fish than I like, so for each piece of sushi, I ordered a piece of sashimi to make a legal sized morsel.\n\nThen I noticed they had Tuna Maki, so expecting the heinous \"white tuna\", I asked the server.  He confirmed it was Red Tuna (the primo or \"ichiban\" stuff).\n\nSo I went with the AYCE, ordering about the standard amount I have for a light meal.  MISTAKE!  The Salmon sashimi slices that arrived were the size of a Chevy!  The Tuna Maki that is about the diameter of a pencil at other places was as thick as your thumb!  And the Red Dragon Rolls?  HUGE!\n\nThis is a place that, for a couple of bucks more, gives you a serious feed of sushi.  Great quality, upscale environment.  And no need to travel to Richmond Hill.
