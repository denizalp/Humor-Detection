Unfortunately, Vegas isn't known for its dim sum, but this place could be the exception. Located in Gold Coast. I know, I know, it's not the fanciest property you've ever seen, but it's definitely worth a visit. \n\nFirst off, the food was good but the service was hit & miss. Stood at the front for a few minutes before being acknowledged even though there were 3 staff members standing there talking amongst each other (seemingly busy but who knows). \nAnywho, once seated the service was only a little better. A few times the carts passed without stopping lol. Kind of awkward having to flag them down every time you want something, especially with this style of dinner service. \n\nOn to the food. Great options, yet they didn't have everything I was looking for. Started off with a hot pot of tea and the Chinese broccoli. Cooked perfectly, as was the brisket stew rice noodle (amazingly tender). Then we ordered the roasted duck, pan fried dumplings and s&p shrimp which were pretty good. The fried rice was on the sweet side, I'm not sure I'd order that again. The har gow, meh. Overall, the Chinese broccoli, brisket stew and pan fried dumplings were my favorite. I'll probably stick to those next time and sample some of the pork buns too. \n\n*Extra points for ambiance and staying open late. Don't forget to check the hours before you go.
