First time at this location! La diperie is a great place to go if you love ice cream and chocolate. As with the other locations, they serve soft serve vanilla ice cream only, but they have like 30 different dipping options and a bunch of topping options as well! \nThe dipping options has the white\/milk\/dark chocolate based flavors and has some pretty interesting ones! (E.g. lavender, lemonade, maple fudge) and the more basic ones (e.g. mint, sea salt, salted caramel etc). If you can't make up your mind, because there are so many options, they usually allow you to taste the dipping first before making your choice which is super nice. \nThe combination can be as original and creative as you like it to be, or it can be more on the safe side (like me!) \nThis location I find is a bit better than the one on Pine ave because there's actually a terrasse out back where you can sit down and enjoy your ice cream while chatting with your friends. So that's a nice little plus. There's even a sink there to wash our sticky ice cream smeared hands! \nLove la diperie!
