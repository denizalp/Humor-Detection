This is, by far, the most obnoxious restaurant in Montreal. \nThe stellar reviews here are mostly coming from out-of-towners but for local Montrealers, Buona Notte is a bit of parody of itself and the whole \"St.Laurent Street\" scene. See, back in the late 1980s, that area of St. Laurent between Sherbrooke and Pine was where all the most exclusive restos and clubs were, filled to the hilt with the beautiful people, aspiring actresses, models and high-end escorts, places like Business, Mediterraneo or DiSalvio's. Most of them are long-gone now and only Buona Notte still hangs on. Come Formula 1 weekend, you can only book a table at Buona Notte if you agree to the $5000 \"bottling fee\"  and its filled with F1 jet-set types and the aforementioned models and escorts-types hoping to make a break. The reek of desperation and posturing and posing is enough to make you lose your meal.\n\nThis has a good-looks-and-money entrance policy. If you don't make the cut, you're not getting in and even if you do have a reservation, they'll place you at one of the worse-off tables in the back near the kitchen and no where near the front. I came here once on a date years ago and I remember the waitresses in skimpy super-tight dresses, the wall of signed plates by the likes of Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran-fame or Jerry Lewis. As for the food, it was awful, bland and over-priced beyond belief. When you come to Buona Notte, you're not coming here for the food. You're coming here to see and to be seen and that really irritates an avowed leftist and anarchist like myself.
