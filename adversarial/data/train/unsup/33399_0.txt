It seems the previous reviews were expecting a fine chinese dining experience.  I like buffets, but I don't expect them to be great.  I like being able to try many different items.  For these reasons, I enjoyed my meal at the Pacific Buffet.  The sushi items were better than any buffet I have been to.  I enjoyed the cream cheese wontons, the sweat and sour soup, the fried pork, and the shrimp dishes.  The deserts were dry and flavorless.  I didn't know I had to pay for my drink, but the tab still only came out to be $8 and change for lunch.  I did not leave room for the mongolian wok.  Will try it next time.\n\nIf you come with reasonable expectations, you will enjoy.
