How does New Mexico taste, you ask?  Spicy!! is the answer.  In a good way.  This food truck came to my work and I was excited to try it!  The only offerings on the menu were red pork taco, red pork burrito, and frito pie.  I went with the red pork burrito.  It came out piping hot and served with thick chips and a medium-hot red salsa.  I'm pretty sure the only thing inside my burrito was red sauce and chunks of pork (not shredded pork like I was expecting!), but I could be wrong... either way, I enjoyed it and it was very filling.  I could not even finish the whole thing and it left my mouth slightly burning, so I liked it!\n\nThe side chips and salsa were also good, although I prefer the thinner chips and these were quite thick.  The good thing is they seemed to be made in-house fresh that day and not purchased from a store.\n\nIf this food truck came back, I would eat here again!  I would like to try their chili fries.
