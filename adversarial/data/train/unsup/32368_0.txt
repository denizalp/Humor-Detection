First time going. We got seated immediately, server was nice but a little over eager initially. I ordered chicken fingers and my boyfriend ordered the \"signature\" burger. Chicken fingers were blah - nothing special, just normal run of the mill chicken fingers except they were $13.  BF said the burger was horrible especially since it was supposed to be their signature burger: it was bland, tough and not fresh like it had been frozen or sat out for a while.  Main saving grace was the pink Moscato, beer, cinnamon bacon and spicy pickles (both of which are small appetizers).  If I go back it will be for drinks and dessert only.
