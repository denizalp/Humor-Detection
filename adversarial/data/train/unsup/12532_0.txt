I got so sick eating here. I broke out in hives for 6 months. Worst time of my life. \n\nVisited urgent care multiple times. Took 6 months to 1 year for me to get better.\n\n------\n\nHi Eric,\n\nI sent you a personal reply to you inbox, please check it. My friends got sick too. We were a party of six at your counter last summer.
