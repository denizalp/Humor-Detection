For what this place is, it's great. I'm not terribly into pricey cocktails or expensive renditions of  something I love, so I'm pretty biased. Our server here was good, but he called me something like sweetie or babe when I first got there and it was annoying. Bad joke. My tacos were tasty, though the portions were small. I also had a really good mixed drink, something with cucumber or mint? It was summer at the time, so it made sense! Pretty meh about this place and wouldn't make another special trip back.
