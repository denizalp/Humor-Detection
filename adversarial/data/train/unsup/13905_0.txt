I too get the monthly notifications that I have \"exceeded my data\" and I should upgrade.  I've done research... just IGNORE the email.  Not only are they just a gimmick to get you to fear them and hope you upgrade, NO ONE HAS A CAP ON THEIR SERVICE.  No one has ever been dropped as a customer just because they use their internet.  Like I said, I get these emails monthly.... If I look at the emails from a year ago, my data cap was higher.  It cracks me up that Cox implies an imaginary data cap that seems to decrease over the years, not increase.  Yet I've been paying the same price since I signed up.\n\nAnother funny thing, the number of gigs they say I use, is not accurate at all.  I installed a program that tracks how much data is sent around in the house and it doesn't come close to what they say we use.  One month we had a flood in our house and we were in a hotel for 3 weeks.  No one entered the house in those three weeks, let alone use the internet.  We still got an email notification stated we've gone over on our data... They claimed I used 350GB, according to the program I use to track my data, 5GB were transferred that month. What a scam!\n\nThe days cannot go fast enough to have google fiber come here.  That will put my headache to rest.
