Went there as a filler lunch... it was ok, nothing spectacular .... it seemed to be an enhanced lunch with more entries... it was like $25 which was high for what you got... they advertised Alaskan crab legs...but nowhere to be found....will not be back... prefer Wicked spoon, Wynn (of course) then Aria next. Have not been to Caesars yet... too spendy...
