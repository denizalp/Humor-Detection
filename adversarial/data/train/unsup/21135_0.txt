I've been a member of Lifetime for a few months and their facilities are hands down the best. You can read the other reviews for how awesome tha facility is but I'm going to speak to some of the interesting events that take place in the men's locker room and I am not joking at all......\n\nApparently the men's locker room gets rather friendly after hours and when I say after hours I state that loosely as in 10-11pm.   On two occasions.....I repeat.....two occasions I had the same 55 year old man pull up to a sink next to me and blow dry his junk.  I'm not exagerrating and my friend was at the sink to his left.   He was sandwiched between us butt naked stretching his stick and blow drying his junk dry.   I ran out of the gym in fear.   A few weeks later the SAME MAN did it again except this time I was by myself.   \n\nAnother time, 2 young men in their 30's were slapping each other in behinds with towels NAKED and chasing each other around the gym.  They almost knocked me over.....Thankfully I am not homophobic but come on, there's a time and place for everything......and apparently Lifetime is where it's at.   CAUTION - BEWARE
