A quick weekend trip into Vegas for a friends birthday weekend.\nMy guy had his card from California and getting his med's here was not a problem.\nA few forms and he was set !\nThe Grove is close to the airport, just off the route to the strip. Beautiful new building inside and out.\nHe said great selection, bud and edibles.\nA little pricier than LA dispensaries but hey, it's Vegas Baby\nService and quick, friendly and easy. \nWhile he was inside, I relaxed in a very comfortable waiting room.\n\nWe will visit again  :)
