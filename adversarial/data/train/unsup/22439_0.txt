CHANGED the FISH!!! Why did I just leave unsatisfied?? They changed the freshwater fish and it IS NOT thin & mild anymore it is like a thick catfish strip and the batter was off. I confirmed with our server this was the 1st day of \"new fish\"...wow all the way from Cali and my dinner was horrible. I mean they already changed to the \"batter\/seasoned\" fries...really they should offer plain fries but OK fine. \n\nWhy oh why would they change their staple product CATFISH??\n\nAfter 20 years, I am not happy to say the least, especially when I have been eating grilled fish and decided to venture off this is what I get...DAMN, DAMN, DAMN!!!!!
