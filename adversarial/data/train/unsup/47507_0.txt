Movers were quite nice and on time. I would've given them more stars but for the fact that, although they started out really fast, toward the end they moved at a snail's pace. One guy outside the whole time -- doing what I don't know -- the other bringing stuff in the new house. Cleaning out the old house, they both worked, and at a rapid pace. When you're paying $100 an hour I think we have a right to expect them not to drag their feet to run the bill up. But, this is Vegas, after all. \n\nThey broke a lot of stuff as well: glassware, a box spring mattress, etc. I wish I would've known about this stuff before I tipped them.\n\nWill I use them again? I don't think so. I know Vegas has a lot of flaky businesses, I've been here 10 years. But I think I'll look for someone that takes better care of my stuff.
