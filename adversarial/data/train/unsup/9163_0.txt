Facilities and grounds were gorgeous. The only reason why this review is getting three stars and not five is because the grounds staff were incredibly rude. As we were quietly whispering one staff member scolded us like we were school children and proceeded to stand over us for 5 mins thereafter; literally perching behind us. As he left, another staff member approached, told us to be quiet and we were not even talking. Based on their treatment, we are reluctant to go back again. We paid to relax and their treatment had the opposite effect. We are in our late thirties for goodness sakes, we do not need to be talked down and belittled by young hipsters with mustaches.
