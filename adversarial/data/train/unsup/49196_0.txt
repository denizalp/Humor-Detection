This is another new sweet spot in Vegas! It used to be where Very Berry Cafe was at. But fyi, not the same owner. This place is definitely an upgrade. Their honey toast box and their non-coffee latte! \n\nI love how cute and perfectly toast their nutella box is! It is definitely instagram and snap worthy! Ask for extra condense on the side and drizzle it up. You'll be in heaven! \n\nOther than that, give the blueberry latte a try! Their whip cream is homemade and bomb! Presentation for these drinks are also instagram worthy!
