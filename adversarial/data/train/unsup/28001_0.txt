Awesome customer service! I have to shout out Tuesday and Dorothea for being very awesome and understanding. I put on a shirt I recently purchased and it ripped on me. They were able to return it for me an order me a new shirt online because they did not have my size in the store. I want to think Tuesday for helping me feel at ease and comfortable after freaking out because my favorite shirt ripped. & I want to thank Dorothea for always being so lovely to me when I'm in the store. Will always continue to shop at this location
