THE OLDEST GAY BAR IN LAS VEGAS ( since 1976)  --- and rumored to have the oldest patrons.\n\nCome visit beautiful downtown!!!!  So this is it.....the gay bar you hear all the rumors about.\n\n\"Only old dude's hang out there.\"\n\n\"They lock the door and have orgies  late at night.\"\n\n\"If you wait in the bathroom for more than 3 minutes you'll totally score!\"\n\nOld dude's, late night orgies, and easy bathroom action.   In the 70's those were the things that kept the night life hoppin'.  So why complain now?\n\nI have yet to witness any of these things happen at Snick's Place. (that doesn't mean they don't) It certainly adds to it's mystique though....I keep going hoping that something I've heard about would happen, but, alas it's like waiting for Sasqwatch or Nessie.\n\nBut what you will get is the friendliest bartenders in town, who are pretty heavy handed when it comes to the mixed drinks....WHOOO BABY!!!  Which is probably why they have pics of pink elephants on the walls......OH, and a really hot collage in the form of the bar's name (SNICK'S) made out of pics of dirty man meat.  \n\nIt is the definition of \"DIVE BAR\" and absolutely lovely.
