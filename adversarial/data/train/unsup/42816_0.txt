LOVE LOVE LOVE this salon!!!! I have long hair so getting my hair trimmed can give me anxiety! This of course was before Adam became my stylist.  He is amazing! Always listens to exactly what I want, doesn't take off too much or over texturize my hair. You can tell he, as well as all the stylists at this location have a passion for the industry. I would highly recommend making an appointment and seeing for yourself.
