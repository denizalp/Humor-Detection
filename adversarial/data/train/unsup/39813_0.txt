I came here with co-workers. Didn't realize it was a buffet, but didn't mind that. I chose to not eat the buffet, because nothing was labeled and having food allergies, I could not tell what was what or what the ingredients were. The restaurant is somewhat tight, so be prepared to have to squeeze through people or dodge them if you're coming in around lunch time.\n\nAll I ended up ordering was edamame. They were kind of luke warm. Service was good, so thank you for the friendliness.
