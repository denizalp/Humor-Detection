When I was a kid my mom took all 6 of us here (ten years ago). Because of that fact I choose this place as an adult. It was AWEFUL! My appointment was at 8:30 am, I was on time. I sat in the waiting room until 9 am. When I asked when I would be seen they seemed to think I was already seen! I waited 30 mins in the lobby. Not cool!
