My friend and I were driving towards the theatre last night with little time and empty stomachs. In a desert of greasy fast-food, Artisano appeared an oasis. Boy were we wrong...\n\nI am a huge fan of the American (now Canadian- hooray!) chain, Panera. And upon first glance they are comparable. The atmosphere is much the same and the service style is identical. But where Panera scores, Artisano misses...miserably. \n\nWe both ordered sandwiches which came with a choice of side. The choice of chips and apples were underwhelming, leaving us to both choose the pasta salad. It was nothing to write home about and sadly the best part of the meal. \n\nThe sandwiches on the board sound delicious- DO NOT BE DECEIVED! Though delish for the first bites, it quickly becomes a soggy mess that gums up on the roof of your mouth. Appetizing. I now understand how dogs must feel about peanut butter. My friend had ordered the chicken, roasted vegetable and goat cheese panini. After much searching, we were left dumbfounded as to where the chicken was. After sending it back, the bread was burnt. Though they were apologetic about the mistakes, it seems a rookie mistake that even a newly opened business shouldn't have made. \n\nThough it is an alternative to the haven of the Golden Arches, that doesn't mean its a good one. I would have rather hit up a Subway or Quiznos and grabbed a coffee to go elsewhere. If I were to go back (and thats a big IF) I would bypass the sandwiches entirely and give the pastas\/pizzas a try. Maybe with time, the kitchen staff will learn that less is more in the sauce department, making the food a little more edible.
