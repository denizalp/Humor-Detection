First time there, really really really dark. It's like a basement. Paint balls are too expensive, no chairs in the staging area, and the staging area is extremely small. They gave one team caution tape as markers to indicate the teams. The problem was it was almost pitch black, no one could tell who was who. The staff was okay, only the owner was nice. There is almost no place to put your belongings except for a tiny locker which you have to pay one dollar for to open each time. no food to purchase what so ever. The place is really just meh.
