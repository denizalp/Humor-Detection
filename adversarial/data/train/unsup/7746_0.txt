Please do not waste your time on the food in this place. It was horribly under-seasoned..tasted like honestly, NOTHING. Sorry.. it was a taste of bleached flour and watery beans and un-flavorful rice..and yes I know that is my fault for giving a place like this a chance... knowing it could not possibly be good. \n\nSERVE GOOD FOOD! you are serving very, very, very, very.. basic.. BASIC ingredients. These are recipes that do not have to suck. The roots of most of the dishes go back so far that there is no reason for the food to suck as bad as it does.\n\nService was whatever. \n\nYou know when you walk into a place and a small tin of chips and salsa.. that tasted like nothing..is $6.. that it's probably gonna be a fail. My bad. Please re-consider.
