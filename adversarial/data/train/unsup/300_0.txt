We had heard the place was remarkable. \n\nThe place was packed.  Recovering from a bachelor's party from the night before (don't let your mind wander - it was playing Super Mario Bros. in Mount Charleston until our eyes bled), we needed a place to sober up, but we only had an hour before we had to head off to work.\n\nWhen we walked in, we told our hostess this time constraint.\n\nHer reply?  \"Oh, that shouldn't be a problem.\"\n\nSo what our hostess didn't tell us, after seating 4 additional smaller parties, that there was a boisterous wedding brunch on the other side of the restaurant and that our table would be greeted after the (one of two) servers was finished taking their order.\n\nSo they failed to communicate, but we'll have to deal.  After all, we had heard the place was remarkable.\n\nAfter 23 minutes without a \"Hello,\" and a waiter serving all four of those parties sat after us, the five of us started to get up - it's not a dine and ditch if you don't receive anything.  Only then did a waiter (casually chatting with a cook) dashed madly to our table looking suddenly concerned.\n\nWe rattled our requests off, and 40 minutes later we got our food.  I do remember the food being above par (after all, we had heard the place was remarkable), but the service left such a bad taste in our mouth, I will not step foot in the location again.\n\nSmall cups and no refills didn't help.\n\nShort-staffed?  Sure.  But we would liked the heads-up on that one before we sat down under a time crunch.\n\nAfter all, we had heard the place was remarkable.  Stay away.
