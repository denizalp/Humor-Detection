Came here again for a business dinner. We ordered the \"Daughter\" all in one menu (#3), which is Beef, Chicken and Pork, all marinated. \nIt came with romaine salad first, and then a bunch of banchan dishes on the side. We also had 2 Jinro Soju (they only have 1 choice).\n\nFood was solid and the service from Eunice was very good. She had great timing, handling other tables, but coming back right on time to do all of our cooking for us, from starting a meat, to turning it over, to serving it to us. \n\nWe had a nice table against the back wall, so we could talk business without a lot of noise, and with Eunice's professional timing, not any interuptions, either. \n\nWe had plenty of food for 3 grown men, and with the Soju, the total was $105 before tip.
