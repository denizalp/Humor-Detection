Zikiz has yet to disappoint me. Consistency is key and they've got it. Friendly service and great food every single time. I love love love did I mention love their wraps. \n\nI get the spinach wrap with extra chicken instead of rice, lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, banana peppers, hummus and hot sauce. Holy crap I'm salivating just thinking about it. Their hummus and hot sauce are made in house and the flavors blend perfectly give it a try. They also have a citrus green tea which is pretty delicious. \n\nGive them a try, I have no idea why people aren't lining up for this place but it just makes the time between walking in and inhaling my wrap that much faster.
