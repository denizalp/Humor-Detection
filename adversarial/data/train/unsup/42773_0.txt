Been here for either breakfast or lunch 3 times now.  Each time we have been satisfied.  Good service, solid food (not great, but very solid and substantial), and fair prices.  They advertise with restaurant.com and if you use the voucher, it becomes even more affordable.  Yesterday, I had the gyros in pita bread for lunch with onion rings.  Very tasty and a nice big portion.
