I enjoyed my evening here. We stopped here first on our way to a play at the neighboring Don Bluth theater. The restaurant is pretty large and wasn't incredibility packed. I ordered the East End Amber beer and found it pretty tasty. My server recommended the Chicken Molé Tostadas. They are made up of beer brined chicken thighs braised in red molé sauce served over refried beans and topped with cheese curds and jalapeño crema. Yep - pretty amazing. Happy hour is 3-7pm and they have a discounted menu with limited items to choose from. Plus they knock off a buck on pints, well drinks and wines. A nice find for any beer lover in the Scottsdale area.
