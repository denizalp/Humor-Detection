Customer service is the worst I have experienced so far! \n\nOrdered a set of 4 chairs on April 23rd. The price was great, I didn't expect much, but I really needed the chairs. Shipping took a good while, but they finally made it. In a box with a hole in it. \n\nThat made me suspicious, but it looked good at first. I started to unpack and the hardware is missing. I have the legs, back and the seat, but no screws or bolts. \n\nI contact Furniture Creations next day, saying that I need the parts or otherwise I want to just return the item. They offer me to ship the hardware for free, really generous of them right, since they lost it or I can return the item, if I pay for the shipping and the restocking fee, which will leave me with %40 of the money I paid. \n\nObviously I tried to negotiate on the fees, since I'm the paying customer and the product was not delivered correctly, but that doesn't seem to really matter for the company. \n\nI agreed to get the parts, they said it's 2-3 weeks to get the parts delivered, but I'm waiting for over a month now and I don't have any shipping information or any type of update. All I'm hearing is a basic customer service template of saying don't bother just be happy with what you got. \n\nDO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY! STAY AWAY! \n\n0 STARS \n\nI will be writing my complaint to the Better Business Bureau!!!!
