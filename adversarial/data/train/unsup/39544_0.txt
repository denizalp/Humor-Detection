Just finished my lunch special of pad Thai. This is my first visit and most likely my last. I love Thai food and have been to many establishments around the valley. I had high hopes since this place had decent reviews.\n\nPrices were a little more than I usually pay, but I figure if it's good than it doesn't matter. \nI ordered a number 7 spice, it was so bland I had to add my own salt and chili sauce at home.  I ordered extra bean sprouts and was charged $2 which is overly priced and have never been charged extra at any time restaurant I been to. I didn't think much of it until I got home and there wasn't extra at all! \n\nThe curry puff was still frozen inside so it's obviously was not made fresh. The soup was okay, but also on the bland side. \nI'm disappointed in this visit. So sad because the decor and service was great hence the 2 stars.
