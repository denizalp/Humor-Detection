The truckload of food that Takashi pushes out for his $40 twelve course dinners make Restaurant Week look like Restaurant Weak.  Seriously... you would need to attach a garbage disposal to your stomach to make it through this bad boy.  Maybe if my car broke down up on Mount Charleston and I walked all the way here would it be possible?  So while value, ambition, friendly service, and remarkable design upgrades cannot be denied, my fault is with the execution and general flow of the menu.  Even for myself, I find it hard to believe I am complaining about too much food, but I am going there.   \n\nAs an example, course plate #4-#8 could easily go chicken teriyaki, huge sushi roll, 6 oysters, karaage (fried chicken) and then beef sukiyaki.  That's like a mixtape going from Mozart to Slipknot to Whitney Houston to last year's Grammy winning polka artist.  Why are oysters right in the dead center of the 12?  Who goes from fried meat to sukiyaki in real life?  \n\nSomething like this should be harmonious from beginning to end, but I just looked at it as battles within battles.  The menu vs my stomach capacity, the food vs the ever-growing takeout bag the servers kept loading up, my waistline vs my pants, my tastebuds' sanity vs \"holy shit, we're only on #5??\"  A server informed us that only one person had been able to plow through it all since they opened and that \"He was a Yelper\".  Nice job, Yelper.  Did you go to Home Depot or Lowe's for that attachment? ;)\n\nIf you're still going to do this, these are the battles between course choices:\n\n#3: Soba Salad vs Tofu Salad vs Potato Salad: My wife's Soba Salad won.  The dressing mixed with the cold noodles and crisp greens were excellent.  You also get a choice of salad topping (grilled salmon, chicken or salmon skin).  We both went with grilled salmon although perhaps the salmon skin might have come off like a luxurious crouton and been the way to go.  Don't load up on potato!  Trust me.  \n\n#6: Oysters vs Snow Crab: It was a TKO by the oysters.   Even though the crab was nicely presented on a chilled plate, it could never be a match of 6 large raw oysters on a wooden boat.  This would retail for at least $18 elsewhere.  I will be back for this the next time dining a la carte.  \n \n#7: Tempura vs Karaage: We barely touched either of these due to fullness and what was still to come, but I'd go with the tempura which was a nice medley of veggies along with 2 pieces of shrimp.  Even though the karaage was dry and uninspiring, it lasted better in the fridge whereas tempura should be eaten immediately and was really bad a couple of days later.  \n\nAlready stuffed to the gills, it was at this point that we considered asking to return tomorrow to finish the rest.  Would it be OK if I just left my credit card overnight?  I saw that there was a foot spa in the same plaza.  Maybe we could come back in an hour?  That moment sounded as good a time as any to take up cigarette smoking.  \n\n#8: Beef Sukiyaki vs Diced Steak:  Bitch, please.  Not only did the steak not put up a fight, they didn't even walk into the ring.  Flawless victory!  The sukiyaki was classic.  It was rich and filled with noodles, vegetables and semi-fatty beef which made the broth even better.  We asked for a side of raw egg to dip the beef into, and that made those 6 combined bites we took before they whisked it away in takeout boxes even better.  This could have been a standalone entr√©e.  \n\n#9: Mini Doria vs 4 pc Baked Fantasy:  They should get rid of this course altogether.  The doria is a bowl of rice topped with a mix of ground beef, tomato sauce and cream.  No one in their right mind would want this after everything else.  Ditto for a gross hot sushi roll filled with cream cheese.  Lose, lose. \n \nServer: \"Anything else?\"\nMe: \"Lap band surgery.\"\n\n#10: 4 piece nigiri vs Salmon Bowl (more rice!) vs Hamburger:  Nigiri won.  It was the smallest portion of food!  Tony T was at another table and got the hamburger which was a FULL HAMBURGER, BUN AND ALL WITH FRIES.  Am I going crazy?  \n\nSome may avoid this spot because their AYCE is $80 per person, but with the exorbitant amount of food we walked out with, it'll be more about all you can't eat.  There were 5 more individual meals with the leftovers we had!  Portions should be halved, if not quartered, and everything needs to be rearranged by someone with sane eyes.   No one would complain about paying $40 for that.
