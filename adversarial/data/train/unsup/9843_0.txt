Oh lord. Why?\n\n\nI just went to this location to pick up some chicken for my boss and I to bbq.\n\nI saw the pre-rubbed chicken thigs + legs and thought, why not?\n\nOne thing : SALT.\n\nIt was so salty it was inedible. I had to throw up. I could feel my blood pressure spiking.\n\nIt was completely disgusting.\n\nNever again.\n\nOh, god.\n\n\nThe fries I got were okay though.\n\nAnd they had a special deal on the 710ml bottles of pop - 6 for 2 bucks.\n\nOnly reason I'm giving it 2 stars. \n\nNASTY FREAKING CHICKEN.
