I've used Red Carpet VIP twice now in the last 5 years.   They five top notch service when it comes to VIP hosted entry and bottle service, but they also can get access to awesome suites for a pretty sizable discount as well. We decided on a 2 bedroom suite at the Elara, which was amazing. We had 4 guys in our group which was perfect, but room could comfortably sleep 6. They ended up getting us a discount of about $300 per night! I then dealt with Jeremy for booking VIP hosted entry and bottle service at Intrigue. Everything went great and the price was right as well. We also had Sophia's Gentlemen's Club as part of the package. We were picked up at our hotel, but when we got there, they tried to charge us $40 each to get in. I immediately called Jeremy (well after business ours) and he called and took care of it all within 5 minutes. Can't say enough about these guys. I'll definitely book with Jeremy and Red Carpet VIP the next time I'm in Vegas!
