First time here, and I'm pleasantly surprised. Amazing customer service that's able to guide the causal coffee drinker. They're not afraid to ask you questions to ensure your drink is perfect. The atmosphere is cozy with a bit of hipster sprinkled throughout. Business suits, don't let the word hipster scare you, it's very fitting for that away-from-the-office meeting. More comfortable seating condusive to accomplishing your to-do list would have earned a fifth star.
