My boyfriend and I decided to check out the Peppermill for dinner after hearing good things. I had expected more of a fine steakhouse, but it looked like more of a diner to me. We weren't that hungry, so went to the Fireside lounge instead of the main restaurant. We sat at the bar and played video poker and they comped our drinks. \n\nThey have an extensive specialty drink list. got the frozen chocolate banana drink. OMG...so good!!  Well worth the $10 price, even better when it was free. \n\nWe ordered nachos with some of the ingredients only in half and it came out correctly. \n\nDefinitely an old school Vegas place and the decor fits that. Everything looked clean and the service was good.
