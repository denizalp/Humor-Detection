Disaster...I opted for the horse back riding as part of our activity for the afternoon during a work event.  To be clear, I have never been on a horse and had no idea how to control the  horse.  The workers did not give any good instruction, it was about 2 minutes of showing to pull - left, right, woah.  Then they set us off on a trail that was hilly...with a group of 25 people and horses and all ranges of experience.  I admit that I did not have a clue...but that being said, it would have been a better situation if they spent time for instruction and let you practice controls before sending you out the range.  I got thrown off...yes.  Scary stuff.  Not pleasant, and never again.  The good thing was that they did send someone to pick me up and drive me back, but I would have walked back if I had to.
