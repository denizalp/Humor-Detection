My husband and I recently had dinner here. We are local and are always looking for new restaurants. We had a fantastic experience. The lemon chicken was amazing! We were particularly impressed with our service. Our waitress, Myya was delightful. Friendly, knowledgeable, and very attentive. We enjoyed the ambiance and the decor as well. We will definitely come back soon.
