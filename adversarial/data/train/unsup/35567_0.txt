This I feel is the best darn school in the state, neigh, the country. (Ok I may have gone a bit overboard. I'm excited)\n\nMy daughter has been in and out of public schools for years....until we found Legacy Traditional in north chandler\n\nThis school is amazing. It's very personal with small classes so kids can get one on one attention. The teachers are damn near the most perfect people I have ever come to know. So sweet. And friendly. And communicative too!  \n\nYes they have a uniform policy! I'm a firm believer of it! No room for bullying. Or wandering eyes if your kids happen to be older. \n\nThe school is absolutely gorgeous and not just because it's brand new. But because everyone cares! \n\nAll in all I think it's just fabulous all the way around. And you're probably thinking....she must work there. No I don't actually. I am a parent of a once troubled kid who has finally found a school to call home! And who actually wakes up excited to go to school! \n\nHighly highly recommend and if I could give this place a million stars, I would!
