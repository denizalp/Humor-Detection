Staying at Excalibur one trip, I really, really wanted to eat here, but we never got the chance. So this review is not about the food, but about after hours at Dick's.  It's 1am and our last night in Vegas, we walked back to our hotel after many, many drinks. We're walking by they had the restaurant lights down and the multi-colored lights on with music playing!\n\nWe decided to walk in and see what was going on. A nightclub. We walked into a night club. I hadn't been to a Vegas nightclub in a years, and I was iffy about staying, but we did. I think I was mostly sold on the drinks. They were big and less expensive than the casino bars. \n\nThe dance floor was small and cramped, they had left a table or two out, so we had a place to sit next to the dance floor, but having people bump into your chair wasn't fun. The sound system wasn't great and the DJ needed some work on his music selection and song transfer. \n\nWe stayed long enough to finish our drinks and went to the blackjack table instead. \nI won't come back for their idea of a \"club\", but I still want to try their food.
