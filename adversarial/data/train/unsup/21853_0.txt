I now know why there are no photos of the interior of Golden Mint Coffee & Tea Company. All the photos I saw are taken from a distance... a far far distance.... \n\nYes I got in trouble when I tried to take my first photo inside, and the barista told me No Photographs allowed! \n\nI really want to take a photo of that Elektra Belle Epoque Espresso Machine .... it is so pretty and the barista did a great job making my Cappuccino. The milk forth is really heavy though...just like whip cream. \n\nGolden Mint also carries chocolate, sweets, coffee beans and loose leave tea........ \n\nThe window seats overlooking Yonge Street are great for people watching. \n\nGolden Mint is a great choice if you are tired of hanging out at Starbucks or Second Cup up the street. However, there is no WIFI so people are all just meeting up, chatting to each other or like me chilling out over a cup of coffee!
