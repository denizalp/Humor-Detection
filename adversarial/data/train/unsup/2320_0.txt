What a WASTE of good money on a complete freak. He was better on TV. Maybe he got stage fright and did worse on stage in front of many live audiences.\n\nWe were waiting for some crazy shit stunts or something like...he turning to a dove or something. And all that happened in the end was some kind of fire sound? I can't even remember. \n\nYou know that feeling when someone is one stage making a complete fool of him\/herself and you just feel SO embarrass for him\/her that you just have to look away or walk away? I think that was my feeling. He and his sidekicks were just so silly and making fools of themselves I had to close my eyes since walking away would mean i had to go through so many other people. \n\nThe acts that followed him and or before him all had no sequence, did not connect to any story line. They were all so random and almost like fillers for his lack of talent or show.  I mean how much can he levitate on stage before we walk out? So we are just being distracted by the other fillers especially the two clowns who btw, need to be fired for not being funny.  \n\nVery bad show for kids. Some bad language, crude jokes, just obscene and not a good show at all. Cancel this from vegas please.\n\nYes, if u have the tickets, don't even bother. You won't miss anything good. Go enjoy drinks and pull some slots.
