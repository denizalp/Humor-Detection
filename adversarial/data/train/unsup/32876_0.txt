Worst experience I've ever had with the company. Caught one of the workers looking through our items in our bathroom. The other worker left for 20 minutes with the van, not sure why. Then when they came back and did such a bad job that our carpet was actually dirty or when they left. It appeared clean until I vacuumed it and realized it was worse. It stayed wet for four days so they obviously did not have a properly functioning vacuum. It was pushing out water and detergent but not sucking it back up. In fact one of the worker said that it was broken but that he fixed it midway through the job. I think he was lying. But he did leave a clog in my driveway of hair and debris collected probably throughout the day. It was totally disgusting. When I talked to try to get my money back or have them at least try to clean the carpet again they told me I had to talk to their manager. I called for their manager five other times and sent three. I was ignored every time. I finally went to the Better Business Bureau. They helped. This company is crooked, they just want quick and easy jobs. The work that they do is putting detergent on your carpet and cleaning the top layer so it appears clean. But it actually damages your carpet over time, and certainly does not clean it. I finally went to another company. And now my carpet is mostly restored, but not fully restored from the damage caused by Sears carpet \"cleaning.\"\nThere are a few other companies I could recommend, but the one that we've had good experiences with were Zero Rez, and Suds. Suds is probably the best but cost a little bit more. But they'll actually come back and redo your carpet if you don't like the job they've done. They even let us borrow the fan over a weekend. Super cool guys. Exact opposite experience that I had with Sears.\n\nPlease pardon any AutoCorrect's or Siri typos.
