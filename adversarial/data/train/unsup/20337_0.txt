Thought I better write this review before I totally forget!\n\nYes, when you land here, you are reminded you are in Sin City with all the slot machines to play with and everything!!! So cool, huh? No not really if you lose:(((\n\nAnyway down to specifics, when we got off the plane it seemed like a forever walk to find the car rental place. It was like we were lost walking back & forth if you look at the signs. When we finally got to the bus shuttle lane outside we were on the right track at least.\n\nThe car rental place is another story which you can catch on one of my reviews. Make sure you check Yelp reviews before deciding which rental car company you want to go with.  We returned the car pretty early in the morning and had to catch the shuttle back to the main airport.  it wasn't very long wait at all & security checkpoint was so quick bc no one was there!!!\n\nWe got to our Southwest gate no problem with all the slot machines all around but we weren't at all tempted to play as we aren't gamblers really. Our flight was on time and got us there on time back to Sacramento.\n\nWould we come back?  Probably so.  I do remember Southwest airlines got us to Vegas in record time like a half hour early but we ended up at the car rental place waiting for 30 minutes so it all balances out...
