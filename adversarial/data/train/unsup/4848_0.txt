Some people know Jini as \"JJ\" but I call him the \"Doctor\"!  Since the first time I sat in that chair, the condition and style of my hair has improved dramatically.  I am a daily wash-n-go kinda girl who needs great cuts that look good even days after leaving the salon.  Dr. JJ has great bedside manners as he always takes the time to explain how to maintain and style healthy hair.\nI'm also a color fanatic who has had my share of mishaps.  Ever since being introduced to Rebecca, I have never been more satisfied with having fun with color, as well as her care in covering the greys!  On top of that, we have the best chats.\nThe partnership of JJ & Rebecca is the perfect ensemble and a gift to anyone who wants the best hair artisans in town!
