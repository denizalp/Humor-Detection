I've used VIP taxi for about a year because its the only company in the area that the Taxi Magic app assigns. \nI've had terrible service from them. The cabbies are often dirty and at best smell of heavy smoke, but I can deal with that. Their biggest problem is that they can't get an address straight. They only pick me up from 2 places, my work and home, and they have yet to go to the correct address. Even when I call the dispatch before hand to make sure they have step by step directions.  The worst was today. I have a flight this am and called last night for a 5:30 am pickup. By 545 I see that no cab had been dispatched so I called them. Their response: we can't find a cab in your area, we'll call you when we do. Even when I reminded them of my flight they had nothing to say.  I'm done. Never again.
