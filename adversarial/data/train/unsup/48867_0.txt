Lovely setting - inside or outside with a view of the pool. Awesome menu - Lobster Benedict, lox and onions on a bagel I think, fresh and tasty stir fry (vegan menu). Smoothies. I eat breakfast here regardless of where I am staying. And although the breakfast selection is awesome I now have the lobster benedict every time it  is so good although I substitute english muffins and request no meat. It's expensive - but I would rather spend $40 on breakfast here and scrimp on lunch or dinner.
