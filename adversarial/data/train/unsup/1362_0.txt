11\/11\/11  I called at 1706 hrs today to see if I could get a massage around 1900 hrs.  I  was placed on hold three different times for a total of 6 minutes.  I hung up and called back, I was asked to hold again, and told the girl who answered (I didn't get her name, as they all answer the phone WAY too fast and you can never understand them).  I told her I had already been on hold three times and she said \"I'm so sorry,\" and put me on hold again.  I eventually hung up.  One of your therapists, who are sorely underpaid, missed out on a great tip this evening.\n\nSuggestion, stop hiring teeny boppers and Generation X'ers that don't give a crap about anything but themselves.  It's eery quiet in the lobby, and those girls behind the counter NEVER want to engage in any light conversation with clients unless it's work related.  I'm guessing that the owner's husband still listens to everyone's conversations in the office lobby area via live video feed from home, thereby making it very uncomfortable for those who work there.  It''s getting to the point that I dislike the front counter service so much that I am thinking of cancelling my membership and going to a different provider, one of your competitors not too far away.  I am posting this on Yelp as well.
