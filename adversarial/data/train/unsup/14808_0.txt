Another popular and raved about sandwich joint I've heard so much about. And after seeing my gf's always post pictures of their sandwiches I had to try it out. But couldn't soak up the whole experience since I had a protein bar an hour before and was trying to avoid eating heavy since were going to go clubbing afterwards. Yes a very girly thing but hey, got to fit in my dress! just tried a few bites here and there. Went both friday and saturday and wanted to go back again. Something about the packaging reminded me of willy wonka's golden ticket that are hidden in the chocolate hahah. Can never get enough. Please come to LA Earl!\n\n_The original, roasted beef, cheddar and horseradish sauce was pretty good. I loved the horseradish sauce! It really made the sandwich stand out. Although a little too much meat for me. \n_The Full Montagu, roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce was one big juicy bite. Although it seemed a little too cheesy. I think either swiss or cheddar would be good but having both was a bit too rich for me. But I'm sure most like a whole lot of cheese. Luckily the small amout of lettuce and tomato helped a bit.\n_Chipotle Chicken avocado, grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce and chipotle sauce was my favorite. The chipotle sauce was great and not too overdrenched. Every bite was better and just melts in your mouth. \n_Baja Chicken salad, romaine, grilled chicken, cheddar, cilantro, avocado, tomatoes, roasted corn, black beans, tortilla strips, and red wine vinaigrette was refreshing. The salad was a bit small of a portion but not bad. Nothing amazing. But good to share with a friend and half a sandwich. \n\nI would definitely come back and this time make sure not to eat any protein bars beforehand haha. And wear a more loose dress. Can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches!
