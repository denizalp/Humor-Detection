So, a friend from Ohio told me that the beef here was pretty good, and I made the dreadful mistake of actually believing him. \n\nDespite it being a Saturday night, we were seated without any wait time, which should have told me something :\/\n\nMy friend is born and raised in Ohio, whereas I am from California. In any case, we were discussing just how awesome California is when our server arrived at our table to take our orders. He overhears our discussion of California and proceeds to chime in: \"I don't like California. Too many Spanish people.\" Hmmm...\n\nBIGOT MUCH???\n\nAnyway, I ordered a prime rib, cooked MEDIUM (pink on the inside). These ethnocentric oafs must have thought I was an idiot Asian who has never eaten steak, because they ended up bringing me an OUTSIDE CUT, cooked MEDIUM WELL. EPIC FAIL.\n\nMy dining experience here was appalling on all levels, and I am in utter disgust over the quality of their food, their blatant disregard for the customer, and more importantly, the ethnocentrism. THIS PLACE SUCKS. Avoid like the plague.
