First one I walked into. My friend gave me a gummy  to try that she got from a store near her in east LV. So I figured I come in and see what this place had. She paid $24. It's about the same price here, maybe a few bucks more.\n\nYou get a number and show your ID in front. Guy was friendly. Then you walk pass a security guard. The inside staff can't be bothered to answer your questions if you are a newbie and just don't know anything. The selection seemed pretty small but maybe this is what they are like. I tried to ask some questions but the two well dressed ladies either both didn't hear me or pretended not to hear. The worst of customer service practices. They did tell me I could not take any pictures since I figured I would snap some and ask my friends what they were later on.\n\nSince they were so uppity, I just did a quick walk through and left. Their attitudes stink more than the weed one lights up in this place.\n\nI get it that all the shops have high demand in town but I am sure green still means $ in other shops around town.
