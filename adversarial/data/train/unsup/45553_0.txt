Tried a couple of their specialty dishes on a weeknight.  Restaurant was half full.  Surprisingly lots of non-Chinese customers.  Food seems pretty authentic.\nLamb soup was very warming and tasted great on a cold night.  Loved the lamb skewers and croaker fish skewers.  Lamb skewers were very tender and high quality.  \nThe lamb rack was a pretty good portion for $14 and came with some delicious dry spice on the side.  We also had their signature chicken flat noodle dish.  Every table had ordered this dish.  Tasted ok but surprisingly lots of chicken and potatoes but very little noodle.\nThe house fried rice was amazing.  A huge portion for $9.  Came with shrimp, lots of egg in the rice and some raisins(?).\nOverall, our first time at the restaurant but would definitely visit again.  Reasonable prices and good portions.\nNext time we will order some of the lamb burger, boiled dumplings and soup noodle.\nService was efficient.  Would be nice if some of the wait staff spoke better English.  We had some issues asking for information on menu and .  dishes
