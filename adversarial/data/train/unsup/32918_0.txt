My friend and I drove an hour to eat here for dinner. We received our appetizer and drinks after our food which was very upsetting. The food was great as always but the service definitely needs a little bit of help. I have worked in the restaurant business and usually when an appetizer is brought out after the food it's completely taken off the bill. Sad to say I don't know if I'll be back again
