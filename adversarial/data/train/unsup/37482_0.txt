I've read the reviews so knew pretty much what I was in for. Kind of like going on a roller coaster for the first time but knowing what to expect because you spent months talking to your friends about it.\n\nI thought the experience was pretty cool, perhaps ghoulishly cool.  We parked around the corner, and once we were on the street we walked right past it.  There isn't a sign or anything but because of all the pictures on yelp I recognized it just as I passed it.  We walked in, and right into what could be an art exhibit.  Or a garage sale, depending on your point of view.  Even the bathrooms are loaded with stuff.  Other restaurants that use pieces of Americana as decor are mere imitators of this place.  The Zenith is the real McCoy. \n\nNow about the food:  I was there on a Saturday, and had the wheat berry salad.  It was large, and filled me up.  It tasted good and I was pleased with it.  I will be back to try other items.
