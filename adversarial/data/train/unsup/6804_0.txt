Decent hotel located right in downtown Charlotte. Nice outdoor pool area right in the lobby. There's also a parking garage attached so no worries there. \nThere's free coffee in the lobby here. The business center is plush and nice.\nThe rooms were decent. Nice size and spacious. Clean as well. \nNot too far from shopping.
