This by far is probably one of the other places I have worked out at and sweat is dripping all over me. Forget fancy gyms and studio, if you want down and dirty, this is for you. The workouts are never the same, the owners Dallas and Braden will push you beyond belief and the music is kick ass. I also like fact that you can go at your own pace. When I feel myself comparing my pace to the others, the owners remind me that my only competition is myself and to do better than before. Try a class or personal session,trust me you won't be sorry!
