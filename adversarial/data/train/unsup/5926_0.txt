I hate to be one of the one star reviewers on here but I was horrified to find what I found in my food. \nI ordered a Caprese wrap with NO PROTEIN only to find what looks to be either a crane fly or some other bug in my wrap. I immediately lost my appetite and called the contact phone number to let them know what happened. \nI was offered a replacement wrap but I informed them I wouldn't be eating there any further and would just like my money back, which they agreed to give me.
