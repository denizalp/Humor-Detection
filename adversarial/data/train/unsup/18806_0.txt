Having some time to kill decided to pop in here since I have not been here. Dollar Trees are always fun and this one is no different. I ended up picking up a few essentials for the bathroom while I was here. The store is located in the back corner of the shopping center. It is a nice little store and again very busy, but the employees are pleasant and even thank the guests for waiting. \n\nThe store itself is laid out as most Dollar Trees are but this store is a little larger than most. The shelves for the most part were stocked full. Just a few here and there places where the stock was low. Light bulbs were in need of restock, so they must be very popular here. We did not need lightbulbs this trip. When I paid the checking out process went well and smooth aside from the long line. Again the line moved smooth and if you one sometimes cannot rush perfection.
