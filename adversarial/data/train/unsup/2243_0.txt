The time has come. Today. I wish there was a half star. This shit is getting serious. \n\nAlright, Bar Cento. I'm about to lay it all out for you. Plainly. \n\nIf it wasn't for your food (and beer) you'd be getting 2 stars. Yep. That's right. TWO stars. Maybe, just MAYBE ..... 2.5 stars. \n\nWhy? Because your servers are .... to be quite frank.... bitchy. And unapologetic. And they don't listen. And they try to push you aside and ignore you when you ask for a beer in the nicest way possible. And look you directly in the eye and say, \"I gotta go!\" and make those arm\/hand gestures that suggest you move-out-of-their-way-right-now. And, well, I'm sure there are other things I could mention but I was a little loopy from previous cocktails at a finer establishment so -- I don't remember every downfall of last nights experience. \n\nAll complaints and whining aside, the pizza and pomme frites are to die for. The beer list is beautiful. The ambiance is stellar. I love sitting in a booth with pillows. Like, seriously love it. \n\nWait --- back to the pizza. I need to talk about it some more. I ordered the Sunnyside. Hellz yeah! It was good. Really frickin' good. Maybe even amongst the best in Cleveland. Like maybe even top 3. \n\nOh yeah, and those pomme frites? Wayyyyyy good. Best ever maybe. \n\nSo, Bar Cento? Are you listening? Hire some nicer, more attentive servers or something. Huh? And then I'll come back and give you some more stars. K? Thanks.
