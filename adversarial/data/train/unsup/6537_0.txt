Much ado about??\n\nMy husband and I had the innovation menu.\nThe menu's philosophy is all about showmanship more than substance.\n\nThe Osetra caviar lacked taste and was overwhelmed by the cauliflower.\n\nThe octopus dish is presented under a dome which is then filled with smoke in a liquid nitrogen type of effect which adds strictly nothing to the taste, so what's the purpose?\n\nThe chef then comes out with a cart on which there is a block of ice and some Salmon pieces. He introduced himself saying: \"This is my last day, I'm leaving tomorrow\"! We neither asked nor cared the least bit about it, but what an introduction ... and it really makes you feel \"good\" about the place all together!! He then tells you that he will cook the salmon on the ice and that he would like you to taste the salmon before, so that you can enjoy the \"change in texture resulting from the cooking\". For this purpose he hands you one minuscule piece of salmon for you to taste. The piece is a cube, the side of which is about the size of your small finger nail. Way too small to chew on and get a sense of the \"pre-cooking\" texture might be. The chef then puts the salmon on ice for about 5 seconds and turns it around 3 times, he then serves the salmon. Given that the \"pre-cooked\" bite was too small, there is no way to sense whether the texture has changed or not. What I did notice however, was that the inside of the salmon was cold. Which means that the salmon piece had just been taken out of the fridge and was still very cold! We don't eat food straight out of the fridge at home: the cold anesthetizes taste and spoils the whole experience.\n\nI can understand how some people are impressed by the fact that the \"executive\" chef comes to the table. I like to be impressed by what's in the plate and how it tastes ...\n\nThe line caught sea bass was the only outstanding course of the meal. The fish is cooked right, moist, firm and tasty and well complemented by the spaghetti squash.\n\nThe seared foie-gras is a square less than an inch wide served with an infusion of red cabbage which completely dominates the subtle taste of the verbena it is paired with. When my husband cut his foie-gras piece in half, the whole piece disintegrated because there was a piece of the nerve smack in the middle of it. Not exactly what you're looking for.\n\nThe artichoke and black truffle soup was minuscule with one so thin slice of truffle, you again had nothing to chew on (which is one of the purposes of eating black truffle). The parmesan slice was the size and thinness of a small postage stamp. The truffle brioche was very good.\n\nThe peanut butter crusted quail breast simply doesn't work because it makes no sense. The whole point of a pink quail (or pigeon for that purpose) breast is to have the soft, juicy and (not too) but still flavorful meat melt and explode in your mouth. In this course everything is utterly dominated by the taste of the peanuts. You don't even know what else you're eating. If I want to taste peanuts I make myself a whole wheat toast and spread it with chunky peanut butter. The quail is completely waste here.\n\nThe piece of Wagyu is so small it is impossible to get it \"blue\" as I requested.\n\nAfter we paid the bill no one asked whether we needed a cab or not. So we go down to the entrance level where our cab dropped us off when we came in. Hence we na√Øvely thought that was the place to catch a cab. We got very rudely told by the person at that location that \"no ! no ! this is for limos , not for taxis\". When we expressed our surprise he told us, just as rudely, \"taxis are over there\", pointing his finger without being more specific about what \"over there\" might mean. So we walk in the indicated direction , realize that we need to walk through the casino , wade our ways there for about five minutes, find the exit that says \"taxis\" and are very \"happy\" to see that about 20 other people are waiting for a cab in front of us. 10 minutes later it's our turn!!  A very \"classy\" end to a very disappointing evening in a place which thinks so highly of itself!!
