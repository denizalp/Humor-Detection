This is a non meat eaters dream and a charming addition to the historic district. So far for my visits. I've tried the red potato garbanzo burger, the chili guac fries, goat cheese marmalade quesadilla, veggie scramble, and the jackfruit sliders. The food is fresh, creative, delicious and satisfying. The staff is extremely sweet and seem passionate about the restaurant. It's worth a visit for breakfast (any time of the day) lunch, dinner, or for happy hour!
