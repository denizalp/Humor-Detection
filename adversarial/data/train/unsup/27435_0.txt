Wow...wow wow wow (again..in the words of Mr. Ramsay.) Really great bbq guys. We were super impressed with this spot. The service was awesome and quick and the meats were authentically bbq and slow cooked as bbq should be. Sides tasted homemade and authentic as well. I know...I used authentic twice but this place deserves that word!!! Bomb a$$ bbq!! Looking forward to catering this for the family get together in the future.
