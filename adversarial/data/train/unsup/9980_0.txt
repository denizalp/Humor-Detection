What were we thinking?\n\nWe thought this is a good place to stay since it's in the middle of the strip.  Not a very family friendly place even though the lagoon type pool online may be inviting.  Only a small section of the pool, where the lame slides were, are for families.  The lagoon area was blocked off for 21 and older.  The kids were bored out of their mind.  I got a nice golden tan out of it, though.\n\nWe asked for non-smoking rooms and it reeked of smoke and fragrance spray to mask it...gagged me.  We asked for another room and it was a little better.  We paid $179 a night per room in advance thinking that it will reserve 3 rooms, all with 2 doubles.  We still got one with a king.  My friend said we were jipped for paying that much per room.  Live and learn.  \n\nThe remodel was nothing exciting.  Slapped on some paint, change the bedsheets, and add a flat panel tv...voila!   Our room had the laminated floor and the rest had the dirty and stained carpets...eww.  The bathrooms were not too bad.\n\nWith hordes of people, expect to line up for everything...yes, everything!  The buffet was not that great (review coming up).  \n\nIt is centrally located and the view of the Bellagio's fountain from our window for the two stars.\n\nWe tried to accomodate everyone's budget...we will not stay here again even if we have to go off the strip, that's for sure!
