My boyfriend and I went to Las Vegas for a \"romantic getaway\" this week. We asked for a guide to restaurants in Las Vegas because I was craving Italian. We found Valentino's and it was recommended that we make a reservation for the \"Fine Dining\" section of the restaurant. \n\nWe get to the restaurant, and they walk us past the bar, past a group of tables, and into a back room. It seemed like we left one restaurant and walked into a completely different one. Our host pulled my chair out before I sat down and laid my napkin in my lap for me. (1 star) Shortly after, we were greeted by our waiter who offered us a choice of several different waters, indluding tap hahaha. He also brought us the wine menu, and we chose a glass of Merlot, which he was so efficient in bringing us, along with the dinner menu. \n\nThe menu in this restaurant is absolutely amazing. Very expensive of course, but the food was incredible, and worth the price. I ordered a crab, scallop, and lemon olive oil Risotto and my boyfriend ordered a well done steak. His steak was so tender, he cut it with a butter knife, and my risotto was perfectly seasoned. \n\nI give the other stars because our waiter, Thomas, who knew each dish on the menu like the back of his hand, made any effort to see to it that we had the best time :)\n\nIf you havent eaten here yet and care about the quality of food and service, I highly recommend eating at this restaurant. If you have eaten here, but not in the \"fine dining\" section, and care about the quality of food and service,  I also recommend it. If not, I'm sure a nice double cheeseburger from McDonalds will do.
