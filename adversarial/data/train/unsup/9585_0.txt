Why is it so hard to find pizzerias that will sell by the slice?!\n\nA small, simple place covered in Boston memorabilia and staffed by friendly folks churns out the largest foldable $2.14-a-slice cheese pizza I've seen in a while. \nAnd, bonus? It's delish. Top with a shake or ten of the oregano and red pepper at the table, tear in, and enjoy!\n\nOr take it to go: they have the perfect small boxes to take your single simple slice home to eat in the comforting blue glow of your television.
