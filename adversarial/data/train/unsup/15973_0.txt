Yellowtail sashimi is my favorite and I order it at every sushi place I enter.  Kabuki served the worst plate of yellowtail sashimi I have ever put in my mouth.  I don't know if the TOMATO they served on the plate with it changed the flavor or what?  It was really bad.  I actually sent it back.  I had a Lotus on Fire Roll that I would rate 2\/5 \n\nMy cousin had miso soup, salad, and a dangerous cup of tea--so hot she couldn't hold the cup with out burning her hands let alone take a sip. \n\nI always sit at the sushi bar when I eat sushi but I was with my cousin who doesn't eat sushi and we wanted a table so we could chat.  Otherwise, I would always sit at the sushi bar.  There were only a few tables during what seemed like a quiet and slow lunch hour.  The service was terrible.  I had to look for the waitress to get a refill.  When she dropped off the food she never came back.  Since I hated the sashimi I was watching for her so I could send it back.  After sending it back she still put it on the bill.  What a terrible experience and awful service.\n\nSave your time and money.  Go somewhere else.
