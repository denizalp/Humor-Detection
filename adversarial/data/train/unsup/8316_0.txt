I love Filipino food, I mean it's the food I grew up eating. So on days where I need to get my Filipino fix, I search for places like this. I actually remember always going to Nanay Gloria as a kid, however, this spot in particular didn't hit the spot like it used to. \n\nLAYOUT:\nNanay Gloria is laid out similar to a Chipotle, except it's self serve, you pay after you've eaten, and buffet style. However, you can buy per entr√©. They offer a variation of Filipino food such as; salmon head sinigang, menudo, longanisa, tocino, mungo, kare-kare, and so many others. Then, there's a spot for suman (sweet sticky rice), balut (developing duck embyro), there's a shelf of Filipino treats, and a cooler of drinks! \n\nFOOD:\nThe food is yummy! It's authentic and made truly from the Lolas and Lolos in the kitchen. The only thing that I don't really ever like from any Filipino restaurants is the RICE. Rice is an absolute must when it comes in Filipino cuisine, but unfortunately the rice is usually a miss. It's just separated because it has been cooked for too little or it's cooked too much. But other than that, the food hits home.
