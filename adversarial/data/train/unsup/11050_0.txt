This place is horrible... horrible horrible horrible by far the worst restaurant I have ever eaten at and we eat out a lot. Truly a bad place.... ick is all I can think . We didn't even finish our food.\nEverything was dry , the tortilla crumbled, the meat was tasteless , raw onion piled on and overpowering. Disgusting I could eat better anywhere ...
