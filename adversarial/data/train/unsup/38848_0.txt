I'm from New Orleans and just moved to Cleveland,it was recommended to my husband and myself to try this restaurant since we are from there. I was never so disappointed by the food!!! This is not Louisiana cooking. The red beans was nothing more than kidney beans in water, the gumbo is not gumbo and the spicy dish was just hot sauce over something related to chicken. Never again.  Do not go.
