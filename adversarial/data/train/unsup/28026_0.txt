We had dinner at JJ's Red Hots last night and were not disappointed.  It was our first visit to the restaurant.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They offer a good variety of hot dogs and sausage.  We enjoyed the \"JJ's Redhot,\" \"Dirty Jerz,\" and \"Charheel\" hotdogs.  They have a bit of whimsey in naming their hotdogs to match specific U S states.\nThe restaurant is exceptionally clean with a health rating of 101.  Plus, the design of the restaurant is quite comfortable and pays homage to The Drum restaurant that occupied the space many years ago.\n\nWe look forward to returning to JJ's and trying their other hot dogs.
