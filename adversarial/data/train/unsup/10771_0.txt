I was pretty excited that this location opened since it's super close to my work and I'd never been to a Cracker Barrel before. A few coworkers and I came in for lunch with only a 15-20 min wait before we got seated. I love that they have a little gift shop to browse around in while waiting for a table.\n\nFood wise I had the lunch special of a country salad with grilled chicken and calm chowder soup. The salad was pretty standard, but a good overall taste. The soup was good also and you can't beat a price of $5.99 for both. \n\nI'd definitely come back again. It's a nice little spot for some classic southern\/American food at very realizable prices.
