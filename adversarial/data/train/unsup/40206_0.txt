This place is a great place to walk if you are into plants, flowers, or manicured grounds. The Montreal Botanical Garden (French: Jardin botanique de Montr√©al) is a large botanical garden in Montreal, Quebec, Canada comprising 185 acres of thematic gardens and greenhouses.\n\nThere is a Japanese, Chinese Garden. First Nations Garden which is populated with Canadian plants; the maple, birch, and pine trees shade its paths. It has several totem poles and exhibits demonstrating traditional Native American artwork and construction methods.  The Alpine Garden has several paths winding over a rocky outcrop which is covered with tiny, delicate alpine plants.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone in search of a nice peaceful place to stroll, even if you are not into flowers or plants.
