Lounge hopping in Las Vegas can get expensive if you're visiting the swanky spots on the strip. But after a long hectic week, a date night was in order. I needed a fabulous drink, serene ambiance and classy service. I found all that and more at the Four Seasons Hotel.\n\nAfter we valet parked at the porte-cochere the gorgeous doors are swung opened by several attendants smiling and welcoming you in.  I just stepped into luxury. \n\nThe lounge is quickly found as you enter pass a modern art structure and we sauntered off to the outdoor cozy patio where we found round glass fire pits, twinkling lights on trees and the soft sound of a waterfall in the background.  A hidden peaceful oasis!\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/four-seasons-hotel-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=NaKNsdj8X-qxEiRRdfx_6w#gIMdhR6LqhXjOcvCtDb17A\n\nSince it was a chilly night we virtually had the entire space to ourselves. Spanish music was playing in the background and a friendly server came out to greet us. She brought us some menus hosting a list of appetizers and specialty drinks.  \n\nIt was our last stop of the night so warm coffee drinks were sure to hit the spot. Lots of sweet treats on the menu to choose from. Pumpkin cheesecake, S'mores, Fondue, Cronuts...mmm all yummy choices.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/four-seasons-hotel-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=NaKNsdj8X-qxEiRRdfx_6w#aO9GGQb7FtMxOoNlbSVi6w\n\nWe chose the Cronuts and the S'mores coffee drink. Perfect choice.  Cronuts were warm and chewy and the coffee liquor drink had whipped cream and sprinkled crushed graham crackers.  Perfect way to end our evening.  Next time I'll be sure to get a room and book a spa appointment.  I'm coming back!
