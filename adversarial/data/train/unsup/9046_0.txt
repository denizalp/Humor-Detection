This January trip was a bit daunting and my mom had asked that I pick up a headboard for her from Costco the morning I was leaving. Since I was having breakfast with a girlfriend close by, I decided I would check out this Costco instead of having to brave the one closer to Sun City again. \n\nI arrived here close to opening time on a Sunday morning, easily found parking and didn't have to do any navigation through the Sun City crowd. Due to the largeness of the item I had to purchase, my friend met me here after breakfast and helped me lug the headboard onto the cart and waited with it while I brought the car to the front of the store. Luckily, a really nice worker loaded it in with no hassels. \n\nThis Costco location would have been a life saver for me when I worked in the area some almost 8+ years ago. I don't think they have a gas station but I didn't look down the other end of the parking lot. All I know is that I was able to get what I needed and able to get out in a jiffy.
