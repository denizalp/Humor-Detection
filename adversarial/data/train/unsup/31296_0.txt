If you're looking for a cheap, quick bite on the strip, this is a place you would hit up. \n\nMy friends and I were looking to have a snack during our 1.5+ hour wait for Bacchanal Buffet and La Creperie was perfect: simple and easy to share. We ordered two Roasted Chicken ($11.00) which consisted of rotisserie chicken, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus, basil pesto & shaved grana padano. \n\nOverall verdict: pretty good. \n\nThe crepe batter itself was a little sweeter than I would've liked it, the tomatoes had a weird texture to them and the basil pesto could have used a little more \"umph\", but overall, not bad for a snack. \n\nIt was a definite plus that there were plenty of seating arrangements around and that water cups were free of charge. Yay! \n\nKeep quality expectations low, price expectations high, and you'll be fine in the City of Sin.
