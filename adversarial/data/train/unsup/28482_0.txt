We moved here a year ago and have not had the opportunity or time to find a primary doctor.  This place is by far the next best thing to a primary care provider you have a long endearing relationship with that you have trusted.  We have visited this location a handful of times for urgent care,  our little guys were struck by strep, my husband had an eye infection and I had the flu all within the last year.  The staff, from front desk, to Nurse and the PA Kevin Kon were all very professional, knowledgeable and took very good care of us.  Not only all of that we were in and out within an hours time.  It's nice to have an option that is close to as going to your family doctor within your own neighborhood, it's pretty much priceless.
