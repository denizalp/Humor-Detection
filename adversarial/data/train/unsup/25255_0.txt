We went here Friday night at 6 to grab a bite before catching the Laval Rocket game. The place was busy but they found us a table that had to be free by 8. Large drink selection and very creative burgers. The fries were good but make sure the vinegar cap is on tight, mine came right off and my fries got a good swim.\nThe waitress was friendly and did offer to replace the fries.\nThe place has a cool decor and many big tvs and cool music memorabilia. Make sure you get a reservation because starting at 6:20 the place had a constant lineup.
