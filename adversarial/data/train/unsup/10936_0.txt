Spicy crispy chicken is one classic dish that we order almost every single time from Ichiban. I'd say to be careful of the this dish if you can't handle spicy food but if you're looking for a dish to wow your palette, then this is the one to try! \n\nI ordered some beef noodle soup and that came out in a giant bowl full of beef and noodles. The dumplings we ordered as appetizers was also equally as delicious. Overall, Ichiban really has some authentic Sichuan Chinese food. There's bond to be something on the menu that you'll like!
