Mucho lacklustre. No refried beans and they use mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce which was kind of weird. I did really like the edamame and sweet potato medley, also kind of weird but it worked well with the other flavours and textures. The best part of Mucho Burrito has GOT to be the hot sauces. They have a large variety of DIY hot sauce choices including habenero, jalape√±o, scotch bonnet and chipotle! I wish they would offer these options to incorporate IN your burrito as opposed to just an after thought. They're really good and if you're not using them on your burrito you are straight up doing yourself a disservice.
