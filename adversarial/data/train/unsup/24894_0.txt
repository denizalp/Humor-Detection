I really, really wish I would've read these reviews before I booked with them. I bought a deal on Colorado's Best Deals (a Groupon-like website), and then when I called in to book my stay, they pretty much up-sold me into staying for 4 nights for \"free,\" as long as I listened to a 90 minute time share presentation.\n\nWhat other people say here is 100% true. When you get to Vegas, they'll be no strip for you. Nope, rather a shuttle ride to the \"fine\" Plaza (I'll review this he*l hole more later) in downtown Las Vegas.\n\nIt was one of the most horrifying hotel stays I've ever had. The room was tiny, had stains all over the walls and carpet and smelled horrible. The sink clogged (and smelled rotten), the staff was rude (except for the Poker Dealer -- he was great), and they have a $12 \"resort\" fee to cover your 2 bottles of water and a tiny, stinky fitness room.\n\nThe timeshare presentation itself wasn't so bad. The company, RSL Resorts, I believe, were right in the hotel, so all we had to do was take the elevator down to floor 3. The salesman was horrible (just a bad salesman), which made telling them no that much easier.\n\nIn any case, I guess the old mantra \"you get what you pay for\" is true. You pay \"free\" through Casablanca Express, expect to get that kind of quality. My suggestion: AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS!)
