***CLUB ONLY - review***\n\nTight would be the best word to describe this place.  VIP is literally on top of the main bar.  I was surprised that the dance floor was so large, compared to the rest of the club.  I spent most of the night on the dance floor due to the lack of seating in VIP.\n\nThankfully, the DJ was playing some very passable selections.  Nothing of note, but decent enough to keep the dance floor packed and my robot in motion.  There were tons of cougars on the prowl on Friday night.  Apparently, a cougar convention had just finished up earlier that day at the Hilton and they all migrated to Lavo for appetite satiation.  \n\nWas I someone's prey?  I was locked-in on, but I was elusive enough to escape their grasps.  I slid my way to a walkway that overlooked the dance floor and kept my eyes peeled for predators.\n\nI don't think I'd visit Lavo again.  It's got nothing to do with the cougars and everything to do with the size.  It's just too small.  Besides, I still have a major crush on Tao.\n\nWhat was that...
