Enjoyed my stay here. I liked the fact that it is smaller and quieter, but still within very close walking distance to the larger hotels. The bridge is great to get to Bellagio with very minimal time spent outside (108 degs!), and we went all the way to Caesars through the mall. Genius idea to connect everything.\n\nThe deluxe suite was decently spacious for 4 people. I luckily got to sleep in the bed, which was luxurious enough (not too squishy, firm enough for back support, soft and cozy). The friends who slept on the pull out sofa said the mattress was super squishy, and they probably had aches after the weekend. We had to call for many items: sheets and blankets for the pull out bed, more bath towels, hot water kettle (which they didn't have, gave us a pot instead), and more toilet paper. The house cleaning light is a smart idea, and we turned it on after a couple of days after our room became more... lived in. We had the a\/c on at 72 but it was still freezing. If we turned it off, it became stuffy and unbearable.\n\nThe bathroom had spacious counter space, and actual square footage inside where we could all stand in there to brush our teeth at the same time (we have a cute selfie LOL). No complaints about the shower, and I wish I had some bubble bath or salts to use in the soaking tub! We only used it to soak our trashed feet after the clubs ;)\n\nWe grabbed a quick dinner to go from the downstairs Market Cafe one night, and our chicken sandwich and fries took 30 minutes to come out. Their take out presentation was very nice though, but seriously, it wasn't even busy. Another day, we chilled at the pool for a few hours, and the food there is the same in the Market Cafe. Pricey but not unexpected, just meh. The pool is a bit small, and the water warm and murky.\n\nOverall, the rooms are nice. It's nice to go home to quiet after a night out.
