There is a 1 year contract the staff fail to tell you from the beginning of your membership. Staff is unfriendly and rude.\nGym is always overcrowded and you never get a full workout. Little kids running around you. Teens hanging out at the machines talking.... I don't like machines but I can't use free weights because they are always being used and\/or scattered in the most random places. \nThe tv on 80% of their cardios don't work even after reported it for weeks. Nothing gets fixed. \nMy sister-in-law had a personal trainer and I guess he was somehow pocketing her monthly payments cuz when he quit she had to wait for another personal trainer to be assigned to her. After a week she was asked to fill out paperwork to start deducting money for the personal trainer. She asked the staff why they needed the info again if she was already paying and they were already deducting money for the personal trainer.... Turns out the guy was getting paid off the books on his own now had my sis-in-law's bank account info. \nShe had to deal with a huge mess at her bank to close it and get a new one. What kind of people are they hiring?\nThis place is a joke.
