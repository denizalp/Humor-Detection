Damn, Gordon Ramsay! \n\nOh my god, these tasted so good. There were people sitting everywhere when we walked in. Luckily, we were able to get a table within the first few minutes of sitting down. A minute after we ordered, there was a line starting to develop.\n\nI ordered the regular fish and chips with the tartar sauce. From the moment I bit into that fish, it was a euphoric moment for me. The fish was perfectly crispy, crunchy, and moist. I hate that word, but that was what the fish was, moist.\n\nIt's a pretty large portion so I recommend sharing it if you want it as like a snack before dinner sort of thing. As a full meal, hopefully you'll finish it.
