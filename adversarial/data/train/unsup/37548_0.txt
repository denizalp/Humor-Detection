I had a great experience here!!! Had a complete eye exam for glasses and contacts and I have an astigmatism so it was $159. The guy at the desk was so nice and friendly and so was Dr. Kettleson-Smith. She is the sweetest thing ever and she's very knowledgeable. Great doctor. I briefly looked and the glasses but even at 50% of lenses I thought they were a bit prices. I found a place who does a complete pair for $95 and I ordered my contacts online at lens.com because they were WAY cheaper. But other than that, I would go back for another eye exam any day!!!!
