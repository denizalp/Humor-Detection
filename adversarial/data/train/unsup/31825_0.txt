Dorothy 6 is worth the drive to Homestead. Though the menu is heavy on \"comfort food\" (meatloaf, pierogies, crab cakes), the food is definitely closer to fine dining than bar food. Sophisticated tastes and beautifully plated. We've been there twice - once when it first opened and a second time this past weekend, and were pleasantly surprised both times. The draft beer list is extensive and quirky enough to be fun. Take a chance - keep this place open - SO much better than dining in one of the chain restaurants at the Waterfront!
