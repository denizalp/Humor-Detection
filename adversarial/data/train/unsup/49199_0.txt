The first time, I've eaten here I was impressed on the price and the selection of food. This was at a time when I didn't go to LV buffets a lot so, I had nothing to compare this too. Now my opinion has changed since the last few times I've been to \"Station Buffets\". Over crowded with people and food is not prepared right. I'm passing on the \"station buffets\" because it doesn't matter which casino you go to, they all serve the same crappy food in which, is disappointing because imagine going to GVR and seeing the same slop as Palace Station. If I ever have to wait over 30 minutes for their food again then I must be out of my mind.
