I personally enjoyed In and Out much more than Fatburger. Fatburger is your more greasy, down to earth, bar food type of burger. Nothing too special about it, although they do offer ginormous portions, and give you an option to add a fried egg.  I was not very fond of the wedge fries, got to sample the shoe strings and onion rings, both which taste better. The location is great if you are staying around the strip, about a 5 min walk from planet hollywood.
