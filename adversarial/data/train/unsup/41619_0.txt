Restaurant located inside the New York casino on the first floor.\n\nThe waitstaff seemed to be confused with one person taking our order but then other staff coming over to get our order when it was already placed. The service was on the slower side.\n\nFor an appetizer I had the fried pickles which was a small portion but it was good. For my lunch I had the bacon polenta breakfast bowl. I really enjoyed it. The polenta was excellent.\n\nThe prices were not bad for being on the strip.
