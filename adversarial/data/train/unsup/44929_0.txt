I went for lunch with a friend, since she had a gift card. The lunch specials were between $8-11. We both ordered the Dos X Fish Tacos. \n\nThe lunch was supposed to come with 2 tacos, rice & beans but instead we got 3 tacos which I assume is the dinner portion. After my inhalation of bottomless chips & salsa I could only eat one taco and half the rice & beans. The flavors were delicious and everything was hot.\n\nI was happy with the food, environment, and staff. I'll be back if I have another gift card, otherwise I like to hit up La Unica for my mexican!
