If youre trying to have good food on a budget, this is the place for you! This place is a pleasant surprise.  Just off the strip, well worth the short drive. The casino\/hotel offers free parking. We came on a Saturday of a Holliday weekend, there was a bit of a line to get in, but it moved fast. We were offered 2 for 4 dollar frozen margaritas in line, not strong but tasty. The food was great, I recommend the pesto chicken and the potato scallops. A well rounded hearty assortment.
