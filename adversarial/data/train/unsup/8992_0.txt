Loved this place.\n\nIt was more relaxed and less crowded than some of the other Vegas clubs, even with Lil Jon in charge of the music (seriously). OKKKKKKAY!  There's a dance floor, tables, and paid dancers, with the mix of people you'd expect. \n\nIt's no more overpriced than the other clubs in Vegas, and at least we didn't have to listen to electronica the entire time we were there.\n\nI must have fit in the common demographic, because the club was prestigious enough to make me notice but not stuffy enough to make you care.\n\nOne note:  the logo outside the club with the apple is incredibly lame and ridiculously cheezy, but it's a whole nother ball game inside.\n\nAs Lil Jon said: \"YEAAAAAAAAA\".
