Jason's Deli ... Good place for a salad and sandwich\n\n\nI have visited a few of the  Jason's Deli's around town, and have never had a bad expeirence. Every visit to any of Jason's Deli restaurants has always been a positive experience.\n\n\nI cannot seem to stop myself from ordering the fruit platter every time I visit Jason's. The fruit is always fresh and the fruit dip is delicious.   I always want to try something new but always  get caught up ordering the fruit platter. The sandwiches are always fresh and tasty.\n\nThe staff at Jason's Deli is friendly, accommodating,  and the service is always quick.  Jason's Deli has a large drink selection, and you get a complimentary soft-serve ice cream cone with your meal.  Can you think of a better way to finish a meal?\n\nIf you haven't visited Jason's Deli, you should stop by, you won't be disappointed.
