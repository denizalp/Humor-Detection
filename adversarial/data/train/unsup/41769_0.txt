I gave Sienna Mercato a 4 star rating not because the food is necessarily 4 star but it is a welcomed lunch destination for professionals.  The food is good, and may even be pretty good when compared to the price.  I always enjoy my meal there for a very reasonable price, making it a great place to go to lunch.
