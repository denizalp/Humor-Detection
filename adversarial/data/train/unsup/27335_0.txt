I can sum up my review in 3 phrases: horrible service, unfriendly staff, and mediocre food. Also, having gone to this place twice, I noticed that they seat non-Chinese or non-Vietnamese people in the back tables - clearly some discrimination there. It was more obviousto me the last time we dined here on Christmas day. I don't and would never ever recommend this place to anyone.
