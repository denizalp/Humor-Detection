I was holed up in one of the hotels across the street for two days. I ate all of my meals here. I was not disappointed in the least!\nThe fish tacos were possibly the best I have ever had. I could only take down two of the three in one sitting.\nThe other dish I tried was the carnitas lunch special which was amazing! Way too much food for one person but it tasted so good I didn't want to walk away. Felt great during and after each meal. My only negative takeaway was the chips and salsa. Nothing there to write home about but on the other hand, they are complimentary so who am i to complain?\n\nHighly recommended from a relatively picky\/ health food leaning diner.
