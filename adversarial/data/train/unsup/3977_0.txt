Compared to other celebrity restaurants, it was a little less expensive. In the MGM Grand hotel, but there are glass-like walls so you're not right on the casino floor. \n\nMac n' Cheese was quite delicious, cheesy, some gooey, crisp bits at the top. \n\nI had the chicken milanese, which was ridiculously large. I couldn't finish it. Still, it was quite refreshing after all the bread and pasta I was eating. Oh, wait. Mac n' cheese counts as pasta. See? I need to have it in every meal. \n\nSangria. Cool, refreshing. Light. With a little zing. Seltzer? Sparkles? I'd get another. More, please. \n\nAll in all, wait wasn't too long. And they take reservations. If you, in theory, don't want to wait. \n\nOur waiter was okay. Pretty attentive. But...occasionally I had to chase him down. It's all good though.
