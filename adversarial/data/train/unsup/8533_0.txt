Oh this place....where to start....\n\nRight now one of my bathrooms smells like stinky pot smoke form the neighbors, the guy below me seems to be having a domestic issue with his girl (on the regular), the handle literally came off my bathroom sink (fixed it myself though) and Godzilla above me is stomping around as usual. Oh, and the two dogs down the hall won't stop barking.\n\nThat is life at The Lennox.\n\nFor a new place, it is truly amazing how much stuff keeps breaking. And like other reviewers have mentioned, yes, a large chunk of the people who live here are less than desirable. I chose to pay this much for rent so that I didn't have to deal with drug dealers, potheads, and all sorts of other unsavory characters, and yet... \n\nI've seen one guy on my floor just drop trash when he's walking like there isn't a trash door. I can't even... And yes, the floors and elevators get super nasty every single day. I feel so bad for the woman who cleans them.\n\nI swear the windows must be single pane too cause you can hear every little thing outside from passing cars\/motorcycles, to the heavy equipment on the nearby construction site (they work early mornings even on weekends) to people talking outside.\n\nDon't be fooled by how nice the apartments look (or the obviously fake 5-stars on here) - cause yes, when you walk into your new apartment it will look very nice. And if you don't have neighbors or they are very quiet and respectable, then you might not even have much noise issues other than loud people in the hall and outside noise. But before you know it, you'll be counting down all those long months left on your lease and wishing you'd kept looking before being fooled by that nice kitchen and large master bath.\n\nOnly 11 more months...
