So far it's been a very bad experience and the hotel Manager Jonathan made it even worse.  We paid using points which doesn't seem to go over well here.  We booked a room with 2 double beds, but were told at check in that all they had available was a king bed.  We proceeded to our room and walked in the door and were floored by how bad it reeked of smoke.\n\nWe called the front desk and after wating 15 minutes, we asked for a Manager.  One of the rudest persons I've spoken to in the Service Industry (the Manager's name was 'Jonathan') told us that because we used points, we can't ask for a specific type of room.  He also told us that the smoking floor was the 19th floor and we were on the 11th, so it wasn't the hotel's fault if someone smoked in that room.  He basically told us to screw off and hung up.\n\nWe then tried to leave the hotel, but they couldn't or wouldn't reimburse the points we used so we are stuck here.  Nightmare.
