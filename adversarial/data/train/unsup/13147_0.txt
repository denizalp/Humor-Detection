After an everlasting debate and frustration with long hair, I decided to have it hacked off.  Usually I go to an Angles close to my house where I absolutely love and trust my stylist there.  I decided to go to the Ginger Group instead this time after my boyfriend told me how great the place was.  I was a little apprehensive in going as I had enough experiences of going to nice salons to only have the hair stylist destroy my hair.  However I booked the appointment over the phone with Jay.\n\nUnfortunately most salon and spas that are housed in the Calgary downtown district have gained the reputation of being unwelcome and snotty - even if they give great service.  The Ginger Group though manages to bash that reputation down welcoming customers with open arms.  With abstract art work and staff in casual clothing the place exudes an atmosphere that is down to earth.\n\nJay was charming and had excellent knowledge of hair.  Although she wasn't the most talkative, I felt no need to fill in the silence as Jay was extremely relaxing to be around where it wasn't awkward or stiff.\nIn the end, Jay did an absolutely fabulous job in taking off 10 inches of my hair to a medium length style, where i love my new hairdo.\n\nThe prices at the Ginger Group are quite reasonable where it ranges from 40$-60$ for women, depending on the expertise of the stylist.  Having had a great first-time experience at the Ginger Group, I would definitely visit it again on other occasions.
