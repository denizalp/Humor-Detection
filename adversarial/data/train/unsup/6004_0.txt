Large selection of flavors, somewhat friendly staff, cute shop. In addition to the bitesize namesake treats, they also offer ice cream\/gelato (labeled one thing, tasted like the other), and a variety of chocolates. I like that the spot was nicely decorated for the upcoming Halloween holiday.\n\nVast selection of macaron flavors made it hard to decide: ultimately opted for basil white chocolate (muddled but okay), Colombian coffee (lower end of average), lutchi (which seemed to mean lychee?), and rose petal (neither of which had any flavor at all), packed in their 4-piece gift box (which they didn't fit into).\n\nSalesperson who helped us was polite, until she got frustrated that their macarons don't easily fit in the provided boxes, at which point she passed us off to another employee- who also had difficulty and ultimately gave us cracked macs. Glad it wasn't really a gift... perhaps they should resize the cookies smaller or go with a different box, as this clearly wasn't a one-time issue.\n\nNOTE: They do not bake on-site, these treats are flown in. Filling consistency was off, probably due to being frozen. I'll stick to local bakeries that do it better. There's no reason to brag about your batter being \"made in France\" if the execution renders a lesser product.
