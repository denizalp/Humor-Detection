Came here for late lunch at 2:30. When I got here, the store was empty. Just myself. The booth was nice but the seat was uncomfortable because of the two separate piece wooden bench. \nThe side dishes were nice just like you would get in SOYO. I liked their Kimchi because it was fresh. Not too sour like other places.\nThe food came out in less than 5 min!! (Surprised but I like quick service especially when I'm not with anybody) I ordered Dol sot bi bim bap. The portion size was 1.5 times bigger than SOYO's Dol sot bi bim bap. This could be shared with two people unless you are a big eater like me. I liked their sweet Gochujang sauce but it was not as spicy as I expected. It was delicious! The food stayed super hot until I finished eating because of their hot pot (about 20 min.) \nThe waiter guy was very nice and attentive. I'll be back when SOYO is packed and I have to wait for a long time.
