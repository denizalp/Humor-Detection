3.5 star.\nNewly opened HK style restaurant in this area that's great for a quick bite and good for Asian style comfort food. Prices are 5-15$\/person on a average with food and drinks included depending on what time you go in. The portion sizes are also very generous. They do have a breakfast menu that's from 7:30-11:30am and afternoon tea menu from 2:30-5:30pm. Food is usually cheaper during those times. The place itself is very bright and not too loud. \n\nWhat I ordered:\nBeef rice noodle stir fry $8: it was very well done! One of the best ones I've had in a very long time. This dish tends to be quite oily so the noodles won't stick to the wok when it's cooked, but it wasn't very oily when I had this one. Seasoning and everything balanced out. The beef portion was quite generous as well. This came with soup of the day and a choice of tea or coffee as well.\n\nClub house sandwich $4.50: this is a well known sandwich every single Hong Kong style cafe would have. They substituted the bacon with some turkey ham to make it a healthier option. It was pretty good except it lacked a sauce. You just came have a sandwich without the sauce. Even if it's just plain mayo would be fine! \n\nOverall I think this place is definitely a go to if you're sick of dim sum or have a hangover. The ratings would definitely change overtime once I've tried more of there items on the menu.
