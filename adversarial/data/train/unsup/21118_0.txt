The Venetian is like the mini-Venice. Very pretty and graphic hotel.\n\nYou gotta admire the thought, the effort, the imagination, the design and the roominess in their suites. \n\nQuite painful to reserve it (chi-chiiiiing), but with 4 people, with an advanced booking, it's not a bad stay for an interesting weekend in LV.\n\nI didn't like the help-desk people, (no-smiles; stinky faces) and I hated the fact that the bella-suites (2 queens) didn't have fridges! THOUGHT#1: \"if you consider yourself a 4+ star hotel and have pretty high prices have a freaking fridge in the freaking suites\" !\n\nBack to the review. I loved their bathroom\/restrooms, I loved the view towards the small pool on the Venezia Lobby-floor. \n\nThe corridors are pretty fun to run, to jump and take pictures. There are some psychotic security guards, who see a girl (me), dressed up from head to toe, and checks for my key in case I was an \"intruder\" (logic=0, with some people). \n\nI loved their shoppe area, the fake sky is something to admire, once you step into that place, you lose your sense of time, regardless is 9:00am or 3:00am it's still blue and \"naturally\" fake.\n\nThe casino: uninspiring, the TAO; had better, restaurants: overpriced but good quality (refer to the specific upcoming reviews)\n\nThe Venezia Lobby- Pool area is quite relaxing. You would see some families with their noisy kids, THOUGHT #2: \"why would you come with your family to LV? Very puzzling to me\" Other than that it was the best chillaxing area.\n\nThe pool gets warm from the weather, there were some annoying people who thought that they owned the pool and they took over the place, but me and my friends managed to take back some parts of it. \n\nNot a bad choice to stay, but I'm considering on my second visit to LV the Palazzo instead.\n\nCiao
