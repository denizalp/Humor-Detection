It gets lit! great place to go for good music and vibes. Ratio was pretty off, a lot of guys and the girls were okay. The bartenders a quick and make decent drinks. Would recommend to other people but I would rather go somewhere new then to go back but if your in the area and it's 12 I would just go here. It pops off the last two hours of business. A lot of space so you won't get claustrophobic.
