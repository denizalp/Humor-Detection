Hmmm...where do I begin?? Firstly, my friend mentioned this place was good. She said the hush puppies were huge and to die for. Welp...we tried it while visiting Vegas. Thumbs down!! \n\nUpon entry, the place smelled of a boo-boo diaper, no exaggeration! Bad sign from the start. The place was rustic looking and seemed to have antique or very old furniture. Maybe that was the intended feel, I don't know. Menu options were fairly limited. I ordered seafood gumbo and crab legs appetizer. My friend ordered fried catfish and fries. \n\nA basket of hush puppies came. Booooo! Clearly by the picture I posted, they are not huge. They look like Jamaican festival bread and tasted like fake hot dog on-a-stick batter. The sweet butter didn't help. \"A\" for effort.\n\nOur food came. Gumbo was just okay. I've never cooked it and bet mine would taste comparable. That's not saying much. Crab legs were sweet; that is, the parts I could enjoy. I ate ONE hot leg of the bunch. The rest were ice cold at the bottom and lukewarm up the rest. I even asked my friend to touch them to make sure. Yep, I was right. \n\nI sent them back and requested a new batch. The waitress comes back and says, \"Try these and see if they're better.\" How about they were the same legs reboiled!! I broke a few to check for hot meat. Those same legs were broken. Lol! I said, \"They're the same legs but yes, they're warmer than the last.\" Obviously, she wasn't concerned with her level of integrity with that lie. Then again, maybe the cooks made her believe the legs were a new batch. Whatever! I was already beyond hungry, the legs still were partially cold and I ate them anyway. I don't like sending food back and I was ready to get the hell out of there. \n\nThe 2 stars is for effort. The owner or manager walked around and greeted people. That was nice. Staff was friendly and welcoming others as we left. As for my experience here...blahhh! I'll pass.
