Due to the many questions received I thought the best way to answer your messages was to do an update \n\nMembership for a couple is $247+ tax per month \n\n*Kids rule the place and employees are too afraid to ask cooperation from arrogant parents.\n\n*No additional barre or zumba classes added. Schedule show no major changes same as last year.\n\n* Yes I received a walk through of the weight training not that impressed with equipment or set up. \n\n*facilities show wear  and tear now but the place still makes for a nice retreat. I really enjoyed the sauna area unfortunately there is a new trend of mothers bringing in small children into the lounge area. Kids are left unattended and they act out running or pounding on the glass door leading to the sauna crying for their mom. There is no way to request assistance because of wired phone in that location does not work and there are no instructions how to reach front desk either.   It will be helpful to make sure phone in this location works and to have posted instructions in case of an emergency since cell phones don't always work in there. \n\n*Another trend I observed is women bringing in their cell phones into the sauna an sharing their conversations with other users. A no cellphone in sauna sign would be greatly appreciated.
