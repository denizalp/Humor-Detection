Wife and I tried this place out. \n\nService was top notch. Quickly got seated and was taken care of the whole time. \n\nMy issue with the place was the food. I ordered the works and my wife ordered the grilled cheese. The food is very very oily. Both my wife and I had a stomach ache after words.  They need to cut down on the oil and cheese and this place will be a 5 star spot for me.
