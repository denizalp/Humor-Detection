I had the best experience with Joel and Marcy Schroedel, owners of Budget Blinds of Chandler.  I love my blinds, they were made, delivered and installed in very little time.   ...don't bother to go to the \"big box\" stores... because you will spend more money.  Believe me, I did!  \nLiz Nelson, Chandler, AZ
