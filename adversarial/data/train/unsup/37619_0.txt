I've been coming here for years. Personally, I feel like they're slipping. They use mayo in their crab mix and their spicy tuna. Their fish doesn't seem as fresh as it used to be, and the owner just doesn't seem like a people person. The waitresses and chefs are very kind but the owner tends to be impatient. Every time I eat here now I get a weird itch in my throat and I can't tell if it's all the mayo they use or their fish. Sadly disappointed.
