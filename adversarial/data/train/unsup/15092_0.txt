The decor and service kind of outshined the food at Giada's. I love a beautifully decorated dining room and applaud outstanding service. Giada's nailed them both! The food was good, but something inside me wanted a little more. Not in portion size, but in flavor. As a Food Network junkie who has dined at Bobby Flay's, Emeril's, Paula Deen's, and Guy Fieri's restaurants, Miss Giada needs to kick it up a notch and she'll be golden!\n\nHere's what me and my fam bam ordered during brunch:\n\nPastry Assortment   A+ \nSalmon Cake Benedict   B\nStrawberry Polenta Waffle   A-\nSardinian Gnocchi al Pomodoro   C+\nChicken Meatballs A++\n\nOn the way out, there's a cool photo booth - and it's free. Another nice touch by Giada and a smart marketing tool to capture emails of her patrons.
