Have to agree with all the other yelpers.  A little gem at the Shell station. Think it was a Shell, was so focused on going inside. I love falafel so had to try this place. The falafel sandwich in my opinion was just delicious. Not like your typical Greek version which I also adore. Plenty of other things on the menu too. Complimentary lentil soup to try while they make your lunch. Also delicious. Needed coffee too, so got that while I waited. Fresh and hot. Win win for me today.
