Have been here several times in the past year or two. Food is standard bar fare and service for us has been good. This particular visit I had the Chile Burger with poblano chilies. Was just OK, bland. Wifey had the Caesar Salad and says is was good. Location is convenient, otherwise I'd never come here.
