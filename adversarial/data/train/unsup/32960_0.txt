This is a good establishment with everything you would expect from a subway. Usually get your order right but there's the occasional mistake here and there. Don't do what I did, I ordered my sub and went to the cash register and the \"sandwich artist\" started adding more stuff so always watch them. They've got pretty much everything for the subs (at least that I have seen). Relatively fast and usually don't have long lines. They have a soda machine with a good variety of drinks, a bathroom too. Pretty clean and a modern design too with plenty of space. I like this subway and would come too it again.
