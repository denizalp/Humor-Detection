So I went here for a featured event. That need to be stated, because it is integral for my conclusion. \n\nAs I walked in I felt a good vibe over this place. They have indeed taken a name that screams of some kind of brandishing, but I do not know exactly what. The personnel was nice and quickly showed me where I belonged. This nice approach and courteous behavior stayed with me and my party the whole time. \nThere was pretzel balls and melted cheese on the table. I am no fan of pretzels and cheese, as many other are, but this fakery of cheese product deserves a mention. It was really tasty, surprisingly so. The pretzel balls was all right, but became a weapon of carboliciousness when paired with this mystical melted cheese product (I say cheese product, because there is no was actual cheese can melt in this fashion).  \n\nThen a basic salad, before I had the Sweetpotato Tortellini. It was a small serving of filled pasta that came to my table, but it was worth it. Quite delishious, even if surprisingly sweet. i would eat this again, but not if I was really hungry. But since I started with lots of pretzel balls - it was very adequate. \n\nDinner warounded of with a Salted Caramel Pudding, and a super lemony Gin and Tonic. The SCP was ok, tasty but as pudding always become blase after a while. It is a delishious dessert that saturates the need for sweets quickly. The lemony Gin and Tonic was refreshing, I am not sure how they made it so lemony (because just adding lime or lemon wouldn't add a subtle sweetness). \n\nSo the food was nice, and tasty even if I wasn't blown away by it. What I was blown away by was the service. Our server had many people, and yet was very attentive and super nice. Also working for uncertain tips since it was a featured event. That makes his effort worth much more in my eyes. i would go back, for the food.. but even more for the service. Very nice.
