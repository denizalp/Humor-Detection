I just canceled my service contract. They provided an inexpensive thermostat in place of the higher quality one they billed me for. Their \"customer service\" person didn't get why I was making such a \"big deal\" about it ( um, it is a big deal--it's fraud), and dismissed my comments about issues I had with their tech. Altho I called for service before their cut-off time, I was made to wait for service until the following morning.\n\nI emailed stating my concern and received a voice mail from Tom with mumbo-jumbo double-talk that boiled down to everything-is-fine-no-problem-it had-to-do-with the description of the unit which was actually a wifi unit and I paid for a manuaI blah blah. It was a denial that there was any issue.  I sent another email acknowledging his call and saying my issue wasn't resolved and then received a phone message with the offer to replace the unit.  I was ok with the resolution offered but asked, as long as they were coming back, to upgrade to an offer I had from them for a wifi unit for only $30 more (an option I wasn't initially offered but ferreted out on my own).  This was agreed to, and the resolution was delivered with an insult (\"I dont understand why you are making a big deal of this\") leading me to wonder if billing for an expensive item and providing a cheap one were their usual business practice. There was never any apology: maybe \"So sorry, our tech should have offered you a discount since he acknowledged that he did provide a different unit than you were billed for.\"  Instead I got the attitude of \"uh oh customer noticed we'll have to fix it\".  I requested a refund for the price difference in the 2 units ($88) and await a response.  I don't care to speak with anyone from this company and don't want their technician in my home. Tonya, you are the reason I cancelled my agreement.
