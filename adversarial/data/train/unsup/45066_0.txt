It's the second time that my buddy and I went to this place... First time it was for happy hour on a Thursday night sometime in January and back a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night to watch the game in the bar section.  Food is ok, but nothing fantastic for the price and the bar section is crammed against a wall and I don't feel it gets the space and love that it should get.\n\nNot going back anytime soon.\n\n===\nAdditional comment:\n\nI'll give it another shot in a warmer month.  I don't think that this is going to help much for the bar section when trying to watch a game, but I promise to try it!
