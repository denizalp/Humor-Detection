I came here for lunch with some family back in mid-May and I really liked this restaurant. The staff were very nice and the restaurant was very nice inside. The food was also very, very tasty and I genuinely enjoyed my meal. It's a bit pricey for lunch, but the whole area might be pricey in general (I'm not too sure, was just stopping by). Despite that, I would definitely stop in again if I'm in the area.
