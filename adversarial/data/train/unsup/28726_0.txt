What can i say that hasn't already been said. its amazing. go here. don't be put off by the dive bar atmosphere. i love that i can go in here during the day and see families eating with their kids and at night its an entirely different crowd. I'm not such a fan of their veggie dog, it taste very strongly of fennel which is a flavor i don't personally like, but many other people i know say its their favorite so i will not begrudge happy dog a star for that. great people watching, big beer list, great food! it can be overwhelming to pick out what you want, but they always have a \"suggestive wieners\" list if you're feeling stumped. don't miss this cleveland institution.
