Get out and enjoy the day on this trail! \n\nWe drove east on Lake Mead Parkway until right before you enter the park area. There is a parking right off of the parkway for an easy access point to the trail.  The parking lot is paved with a restroom as well.  There is a warning sign to not hike from June through September.  Since there isn't much shade I would have to agree to avoid during the hot months.  \n\nWe took our bikes out for some exercise.  We saw many others biking and walking.  The River Mountains Loop Trail has beautiful views to take in while on your journey. It has fun up and downhill paths with off shoot dirt paths for hikers. \n\nI certainly enjoyed this trail.  It's a great motivation to getting off the couch.  Enjoy!
