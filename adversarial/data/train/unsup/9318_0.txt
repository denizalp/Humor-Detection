I like it.  The food was mostly very good, the service was good in a hurried sort of way and the prices are reasonable.\n\nWe ate on a weekday evening and the place was bustling.\n\nIn the valley of the sun, Z's Greek at 40th and Indian School continues to be the standard bearer for this sort of cuisine and Phoenicia does not measure up, but they are solid enough that I would return.\n\nI would add something clever and Greek or Middle Eastern here but I've got nothing right now so you're out of luck.\n\nIf you like, send me a compliment with something good and I will add it to the review and credit you...
