My go to Thai food place in Vegas. It's a low key spot off strip in an Asian strip mall with other Asian restaurants. You get a lot of value and better than any Thai food on the strip. They don't skimp on the flavors and ingredients. The pork Larb and the fried shrimp curry was our favorite stand out dish last night. They are also well known for the amazing wine list, especially Rieslings, which pairs perfectly with Thai food.
