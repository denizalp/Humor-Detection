Came in last May for a consultation and was pregnant by June! Dr. Fisch doesn't waste time! We did a medicated IUI cycle and it worked on the first try! I just gave birth to my beautiful baby girl last week at 39 years old! I can't thank Dr. Fisch, Milissa and the rest of his staff enough! I highly recommend his practice!
