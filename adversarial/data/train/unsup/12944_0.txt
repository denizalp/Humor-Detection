I have used competent plumbers before, and I have used relative inexpensive plumbers before, but Gabe (who IS Copperline Plumbling) is the first one is 20 years who is both.  The work he did for me was routine, but nonetheless I can see that he does a lot of the \"little\" things right, such as:\n\n1.  He will not do work that does not meet at least current standards -- in my case this meant bringing obsolete cutoff connections up to code.\n2.  Patiently explained what he needed to do to my wife and how much it would cost BEFORE he did it.\n3.  Warned about a possible adverse consequence of a certain repair and got my ok before proceding.\n\nPlumbers are never cheap, but my bill was $204 and that covered almost two hours of work and the parts (I estimated about $60 worth).  Gabe did not charge me for travel time either.\n\nI hate to give this good review because he will now become busier and I'll have to stand in line when I need something, but you can't help wanting to root for this guy.
