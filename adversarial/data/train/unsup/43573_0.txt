Apparently this is a staple dive-type bar in Montreal. It's not totally my scene, but my cousin has taken me here a few times and it seems like a good intimate bar to start getting sloppy after midnight. It seems like the crowd is kinda cool and hipster, and it's not expensive so a good place for a few drink. I can't remember what the music was really like but it seemed to be a good place to dance and have fun with friends.
