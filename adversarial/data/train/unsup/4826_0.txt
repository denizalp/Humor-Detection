Bianca came to my hotel room to do my hair and make-up for my wedding and did an amazing job. She arrived right on time and was friendly, pleasant and did great work. The whole process took about 2 hours for an up-do and standard make-up (no airbrush). Everything turned out beautiful! I would definitely use them again.
