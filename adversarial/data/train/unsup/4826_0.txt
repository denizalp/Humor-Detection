Good burger. I got the double cheese burger. Was really satisfied with the size of the patty itself, very filling and good value for the price.\n\nTaste wise, nice char on the burger, great flavour. The cheddar is thick, hand cut from a block and is very prominent. \n\nWas not overly happy with how the burger tasted as a whole, was very, meh. No bold flavours or anything to stand out, bbq was way too light,'didn't get any of it. \n\nOverall was happy to try it and nothing wrong with it but don't think I'll be a repeat customer.
