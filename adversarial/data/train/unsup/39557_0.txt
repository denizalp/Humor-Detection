I was very pleasantly surprised by this place and would definitely come back again! The mussels were amazing, and I easily had the best porter I've ever had. It's a little cramped so probably not the greatest for large groups, but it's great for small get togethers. The staff, most importantly, were attentive, friendly, and awesome all around.
