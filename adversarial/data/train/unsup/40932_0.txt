Roots cafe is a quaint little caf√© and southend. One thing I didn't know you order at the counter and they bring you your food. We went yesterday for brunch, it was very busy, lucky enough we got there at the right time. We didn't have to wait for a table but upon leaving people were waiting. I had the egg tacos, they were delicious but didn't really fill me up. Friends got the quinoa bowl, eggs and bacon and chicken and biscuits, they all enjoy their food. We really enjoyed this place, would definitely go back.
