I've seen this show at least 3X and it has definitely evolved since it opened in 2003.  I was fortunate to attend the premiere and the biggest difference is the amount of comedy they've added to the show over the years.  \n\nIt used to be more serious about the sexual\/sensual part of it. Anyone remember the 2 guys and the cages act they used to have?  But I honestly laughed out loud more at last week's show than at some of the comedy shows in town.  \n\nThis is my 2nd favorite Cirque show with \"O\" being #1.
