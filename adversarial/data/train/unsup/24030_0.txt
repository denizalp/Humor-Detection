I would like to mention we did not actually try a gym class. I called and the customer manger and she was pleasant and answered all my questions. However, signing up for this gym was like signing up for a timeshare. They bring you in at 7:30pm, tell you about the gym, and offer you prices that are only available that day. They force you to download the application and immediately send you a bunch of emails. The sign up experience itself was enough for us to not even want to try this gym. This gym is pretty expensive and incentivizes you to sign a 12-18month contract. It's pretty frustrating that the only time it is somewhat affordable is when it high pressure to sign and you have not even attended one class. As far as the gym goes, We noticed there was really no cardio equipment. The target audience appears to be individuals that are overweight  looking to make a change. We are in pretty good shape and work out often so I don't think we are their target audience
