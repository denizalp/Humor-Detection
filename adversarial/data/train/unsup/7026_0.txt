Sandra's customer service to me was outstanding on the selling of the furniture!!! And Javier and his workers were outstanding in the delivery of the furniture!!! First Sandra, she answered all of my many questions. Then I had her talk and answer my wife's (who was in Pa.) questions over the phone. Yes, the price was higher than I wanted to pay for patio furniture, but with the Arizona weather I didn't want to be buying furniture every two or three years.\nThey are so confident about their products that all their furniture is displayed outside to show their customers how well it keeps in the Arizona weather. So after an hour or so of discussion and looking at all the selections, I decided on the furniture. But since my stairwells in my house are narrow, Sandra suggested I measure the width before I finalize the purchase.\nReturning later that day with the measurements, I met Javier. Javier said if my measurements are correct, the couch and chair will not fit through the stairwells (the furniture is for our bedroom balcony which is on the fourth level of our home). To make sure of the measurements, Javier and I jumped in his car and went to my place so he could be sure that my numbers were correct. Unfortunately, my measurements were correct.\nSo the deal is off????? Wrong!! Javier comes up with the idea of renting a crane to place the frame of the couch and the chair on the roof of my building. Then he and his workers would lower the furniture down from the roof to the balcony. After imagining all the things that could wrong, I agreed to the plan.\nWell it worked to perfection!!!!!! No incidents or damage to property or bodies. The furniture looks absolutely fantastic on our balcony!!!!!\nSandra and Javier were excellent in handling everything that was needed to satisfy my purchase and delivery. You can't ask for better Unique Patio Creations. Thanks Guys!!!!!
