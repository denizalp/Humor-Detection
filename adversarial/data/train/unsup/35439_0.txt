I have been to this place countless times, and I love it! If I am ordering food I typically call ahead. Some of my favorites are the eggplant parm and antipasto salad, but really you can't go wrong. I love this place as an Italian grocery. The quality of the pasta, sauces, oil, etc is fantastic. I meat and cheese available at the deli counter is exquisite. The staff is always friendly and often hilarious!
