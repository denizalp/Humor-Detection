Great place for oysters.\n\nThe Pan Roast was really good - it's a bisque soup with lobster, shrimp and stuff.  It comes with a scoop of rice.  You can ask for it to be spicy for those that can handle the heat.\n\nThere is limited seating, like less than 20 seats, so if you hate waiting in lines it is best to come at off times.\n\nSomewhat pricy, but you are getting seafood.\n\nThis place is perpendicular to the craps tables.
