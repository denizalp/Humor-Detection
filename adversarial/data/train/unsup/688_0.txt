I used to dislike XS because it was too crowded + really bad guy\/girl ratio + long lines. But my more recent trip was so much fun and enjoyable that it led me to see XS in a new light. \n\nIf you have an even ratio of girls to guys, get in touch with a promotor and get yourself on a guestlist. Not only is the entrance free, but the wait time is much less. Ladies can get drink tickets that they can use for a certain period of time. \n\nIf you have a party of all girls, you definitely can get inside much faster. You could possibly get a free table!! It happened to me once, but we ended up sharing it with another group. I think it depends on the day and how busy it is. \n\nThe DJ's are great. Music is usually house with a mixture of top 40 \/ hip hop. It's a pretty big club with nice decor + an outdoor area.
