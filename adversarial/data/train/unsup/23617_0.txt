Pollo Campero has delicious grilled chicken!\n\nOn my first visit, my husband and I ordered grilled chicken, plantains, sweet corn salad and empanadas. The chicken pieces were decent sized and full of flavor. I don't know what type of spices they use but the taste is fresh and citrus-y. \n\nOn our second visit we ordered an 8 piece combo that included mostly grilled with a couple of fried. We also had plantains and beans. The fried chicken was juicy but no where near as flavorful as the grilled. \n\nThe first two visits were dine in visits and every visit after has been to-go. \nFrom our visits we have determined we will only order grilled chicken and to only order it to-go.  There have also been a few issues with trying to place our order as there is sometimes a language barrier; however, someone usually appears quickly to recover the situation.\n\n\n\nEnjoy... the grilled chicken!
