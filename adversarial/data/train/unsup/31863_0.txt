Great place to come to grab a cheap, quick dinner!  \n\nThe pizza is definately one of the better pies in Charlotte (nothing can compete with the NYC I grew up on!)  They use extremely fresh ingredients and have a wide variety of toppings\/speciality pies.  I always get the ancient grain crust, which is definately one of the better grain crusts I have had.  The honey they offer to dip the crust in is a must!!\n\nThe wait time for dinner can get a little long during peak hours, so don't come hungry, but it's worth grabbing a beer and waiting for!
