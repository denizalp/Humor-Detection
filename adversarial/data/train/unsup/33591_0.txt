Yum! We went to a few brunch places and this was definitely the best. The food is delicious and everything goes together. The sun dried tomato pasta was my great and the cheesecake was to die for. I would probably pay the $22 just for the cheesecake, it was that good. \n\nThis place is pretty expensive and mimosas are not included.
