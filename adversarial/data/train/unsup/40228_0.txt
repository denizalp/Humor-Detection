We hired these guys to tear out the carpet and tile and install a laminate wood floor in the house. The 2 guys they sent to do the job were very polite and professional. They moved all the furniture and did a fantastic job on the floor. When they finished they moved all the furniture back and set up all the electronics that they disconnected to do the job. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking to replace their flooring.
