When we 1st walked in thru the patio area, we were looking for a host stand. We peeked around the bar, saw a host stand and were seated immediately. This was a Saturday night at 6 but the place was pretty empty. We were promptly greeted by our server, I forgot her name, and drinks came out right away. We had the chips and salsa, street corn dip and a variety of tacos. The green chili chicken, bbq adobo and pineapple pork were all very tasty. You can have them on soft flour or corn or hard shell. The sweet corn ceaser and totrtilla soup were both a hit with our group as well. Service was fantastic and the restaurant is so cute. I'll definitely go back!\n\nUpdate! I went in yesterday and Levi was our server. He was training someone and they were fantastic! The sangria was tasty and we tried the guacamole, which was creamy and delicious. I did a salad that was awesome. Quinoa, seeds, papaya and we added steak. It was with the best vinaigrette I think Ive ever had. Coconut! Amazeballs. Plantain taco was also great. All 5 of us really loved everything. This place is highly recommended.
