It was a fun, interactive time.  If you aren't into being a part of the show, this may not be for you.  I, on the other hand, enjoyed my dances with Paulie Walnuts and Uncle Jr.  Also, my enjoyment was enhanced since I was also a fan of the series.  If you aren't a fan of this HBO show, then don't bother. \n\nI would suggest getting tickets through Tix 4 Tonight, as they are about half price.  Was the show worth $75?  Umm, no.  So, I'm glad I only paid $40.\n\nOh, yes.  And they say words like \"fuck\", \"cocksucker\", and \"shit\" a lot.  If you are offended by this kind of language, then this show is not for you.  Then again, if you are reading this review, then you already know me and are used to the potty talk.
