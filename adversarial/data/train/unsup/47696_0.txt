I have since visited this location twice after my initial review. I should mention I was contacted by the GM through a private message from my initial review. I accepted the offer to revisit this location in hopes they could earn my business again.\n\nBoth times it was my wife and I and we sat at the bar. Shanda the bartender was there both times and she was great! Tentative and made sure we enjoyed ourselves! Actually remembered us from the first visit. These two visits were a drastic improvement from before. Granted initially it was a group of 6 and this time 2 people. We will continue to go back until something further happens.
