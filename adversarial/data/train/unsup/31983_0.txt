Pop quiz- What\/Where is a reliable food chain known for comfort food and good service? \nAnswer- Not at Chili's in Mesa, Arizona\nSo we are having a family gathering (from all over the nation) and we decide to go to Chili's and it starts well, the server was humorous and polite. It took some time to order, but hey, that happens everywhere. It's when the drinks come out and lo and behold, people actually drink them.... at that point they probably should bring out refills or another beer\/bar drink. Does it happen? Nope. If a customer has to get up wave down any server, ask for refills, and then they bring more chips?!? What is that? Fast forward to getting our food, which by the way by the time they got the last dish out some at the table were done. Others wouldn't touch it. 3 steaks were not cooked per request, soup was cold, and yeah... a big hair in the salad. \nOk, so at this point, I'm done. Had enough, time to go. Oh no, not without a big epic fail to top the night off. Tried to use The kiosk to pay, but it was not letting the transaction go thru, so that had to go the old way, give em your card. \nAt this point the manager was involved and things kept getting more tense. She did knock off some of all are bills but in my view, it wasn't enough. Even if they paid me to make everything cool, it wouldn't happen. I asked for the managers card and she didn't have one because she's new. Fine. Give me you bosses card and write your name down. She did. Then she tried to explain to me the troubles and hardships of the crew there at Chili's like (at this point I cut her off and let her know that as far as customers goes, don't expect sympathy or condolences for job poorly done that did nothing but ruin a close knit families experience and evening) I will call the DM and speak my mind. \n\nWorst. Chili's. Ever.
