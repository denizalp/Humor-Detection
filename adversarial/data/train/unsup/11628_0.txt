If I could sum up Place Milton in one word it would be this: reliable. No matter the day of the week or the weather outside, this institution in the heart of the McGill Ghetto will deliver a homemade and satisfying breakfast, over and over and over again. \n\nThe eggs are always yolky, the potatoes perfectly hashed, and the sausages butterflied. Its consistency and familiarity haven't changed in the decade I've lived in this city, and even if I take a year between visits, it feels as though time hasn't passed. It's basically a breakfast black hole. \n\nGreat little patio in the back too.
