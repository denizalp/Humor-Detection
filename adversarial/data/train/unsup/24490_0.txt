We traveled from NY and really know our food. We did not expect a lot but got a lot of nothing. They don't cook anything there! The cauliflower app was frozen, no flavor at all. French fries frozen, marinara sauce from jar as well as tsatsiki sauce. Baklava they don't make there, dolma they don't make there, I was dumb founded! Terrible!
