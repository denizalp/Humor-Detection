Healthy food at a mall food court?!? You got it.\n\nThis is the same Pita Jungle that you know and love, just with a reduced menu. Mostly the soups\/salads and pita sandwiches... and a few appetizers. You know, stuff you can eat at the mall.\n\nFood was served quickly and at the proper temperature, even during the busy lunch rush.
