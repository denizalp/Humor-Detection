Called before arriving to see what their holiday hours were. Was told they closed at 5pm.  Arrived at 3:45pm and was turned away because they decided to close earlier I asked, \"When was this decided? I just called 20 minutes ago.\"  Was told they just changed it and sent their techs home. ( BTW there were techs there working on other clients) I felt this was very unprofessional and will not return to this establishment.
