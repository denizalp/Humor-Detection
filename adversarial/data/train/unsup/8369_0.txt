Oh, Frankie's. The joy you bring to me with TIKI TIME!\n\nThe atmosphere at Frankie's is one of my favorite in Vegas. Dive bar enough but not gross in the way that I hate walking into the Double Down. It's OK to set your purse down at Frankie's - not so much at DD. The decorations are totally authentic and make me feel like I'm in the Enchanted Tiki Room in Disneyland. \n\nThe drink menu is AWESOME because they rate the drinks via SKULLS. Here is how I would breakdown the skull menu. One skill = something your little sister could drink. Two skulls = order it for mom. Three skulls = week night. Four skulls = looking for trouble. Five skulls = your wife just walked out on you and you are looking to forget about it. \n\nOnly once have I ordered a 5-skull (the Zombie) and it was so strong (disgusting with alcohol) that we downed it. That was a mistake but made for a great karaoke-night at Dino's down the road. My recommendation would be the Lapu Lapu. VERY delicious and refreshing with a kick of rum to get you going.\n\nMy only complaint would be the smokey atmosphere. Although it doesn't bother me as much (Tiki Time makes up for it), I know this is a big issue with some of my friends. \n\nP.S....Drinks are some of  the most reasonable you will find in Vegas. $8 gets you to Tiki Time.
