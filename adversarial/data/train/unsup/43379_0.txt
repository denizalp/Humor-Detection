Expensive. $95 for 3 people at brunch 9am-3pm. No child prices. Selection was ok.I have had better. Eggs benedict wasnt very good, cold. Not enough meat selection. Desserts were tasty. Expected more choices for the pricing. Not too crowded for transition to dinner (215-300). Glad we tried it to see what it was all about. We got full,but will try another buffet next time.
