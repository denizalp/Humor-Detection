I love Cassandra! she is very talented and takes pride in her work. She is really funny and we have developed a good friendship. I go to her for different hairstyles and she always nails it. Plus, my hair is growing!! When I first went to her, my hair was falling out. She was able to stop the breakage. With her recommendations, My hair is now past my shoulders. It's only been 6 months.. She's the bomb!!
