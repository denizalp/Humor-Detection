The real deal! lucky fish sushi & grill has it all, a clean beautiful place, great service and awesome sushi at affordable prices.\n  As I drove trough the neighborhood I saw this place and remembered that I had read a review on yelp by Tony T. and decided to try it for myself. Went inside and was greeted with the usual Irrashaimase shout, (close the door!) I sat at the bar and asked the chef James to make me something spicy and salty but not sweet. I also told him not to surprise me since I didn't want to end up with the surprise roll on the picture that everyone have talked about, you know....the one that looks like....well, check the pic.  I ended up with the jay roll which it was just the flavor I was hoping for, I also tried the Mexican roll just to see what it would taste and look like, It was real good but just didn't see anything mexican in it besides being spicy,\n   I was by myself and having a small conversation with James the chef about sushi and other topics like Japanese culture and customs, it turned out that we had a lot in common , we both liked sushi but neither one of us was Japanese, but don't get me wrong, that didn't stop him from making killer rolls! ....My point is, the chef does not have to be from the land of the rising sun to make authentic sushi here in the land of the scorching sun.  The service in itself made my experience more enjoyable and memorable which is one of the main reasons I will be going back.\n   As I was leaving the restaurant they shouted something again....don't know what they were saying but I have something to say.......stop yelling at me!!!!!! \n Lucky fish not so lucky, it ended up on my sushi roll...lucky me!
