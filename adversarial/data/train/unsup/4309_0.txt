A four-star average with nearly 4K reviews brought me to Gangnam- you can't deny, that's impressive. The massive menu has preset meals and a la carte options to get your meat on, along with various apps and sides.  \n\nWe shared the Las Vegas package for two (wonton, edamame, salad, soup, and bibimbap with Korean chicken, spicy chicken, beef toro, shrimp garlic, and broccoli cheese fondue, $45), and added on the flat iron garlic- meal came with the usual banchan and was more than enough for two of us. I didn't have room for dessert and took an entire meal worth of food home. Favorites were the toro, shrimp, and filet, but the bulgogi bibimbap was really great too. Their sides are surprisingly well done, this is not a spot that focuses on the meats and forgets the rest. \n\nStaff were attentive and frequently checked on us. Location looks tiny from the outside but inside was spacious and tables are huge. I appreciate that they changed out our grill without needing to ask. Good spot for group meals!\n\nTIP: check in on Yelp for a free macaron ice cream cookie sandwich for dessert!
