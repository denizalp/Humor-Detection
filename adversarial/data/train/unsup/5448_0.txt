I went on a Thursday night and order food for take out. The restaurant was very busy and a little too hectic for a nice sit down dinner so I would probably stick to take out.\n\nThe food was decent but not mind blowing.\n\nWhat we ate:\n- chicken tikka masala (4\/5): developed tastes and fresh. \n- Daal makhani (3\/5): good flavor a little to creamy for my liking\n- garlic naan (1\/5): overkill on the garlic!\n- pea pulao rice (3\/5): pretty fresh but a little overwhelming with the curry dishes\n\nI would give this place one more shot just because my fellow Yelpers seem to love it!
