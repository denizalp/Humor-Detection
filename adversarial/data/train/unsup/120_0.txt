Apparently, the way to get in is to get bottle service... seems like every time I try to go clubbing I learn something new. I will teach you the things I've learned from previous Vegas trips:\n\n1) Dress nice. Duh, figured this out in college. Who knew?\n2) Wear single colored LEATHER shoes. Single colored sneakers don't count (again, college)\n3) Spend the money for entry fee. (The cheap clubs are NOT where the women are at)\n4) Don't be ugly. (See previous Vegas review about Tai club)\n5) Get there early before 9. (again, see previous review)\n6) Have a larger gaggle of sexy girls with you - for the guy:girl ratio. \n7) and now, get bottle service.\n\nIn an attempt truly do the \"Vegas club scene\", I joined my friends in getting nicely dressed, complete with beautiful ladies in our group and was willing to pay the 50 dollar cover charge to get in.\n\nI figured that was covering most of the things I'd learned.\n\nWe stood in line for almost 2 hours, taking pictures, chatting, taking pictures, drinking the bottles that were filled with alcohol, waiting, taking pictures.. repeat ad nauseum.\n\nI'll say this. I FARKING HATE WAITING. Why couldn't they at least have waitresses taht serve you while you're in line? a bar within walking distance?! JEEZ. \n\nThe interior of the club was cool. I liked the waterfall, the lights were nice, the patio let in cool air, the A\/C was strong and the furnishings were really swank. Service was decent, go-go dancers were smokin' hot and there was a performance by \"this-is-how-we-do-it\" Montell Jordan (c: \n\nNice.\n\nHowever, if only they would have stopped repeating the same fucking music all night. We were there for 4 hours or so and heard quite a few songs more than 2-3 times. There has been probably 40 years of dance music that they could choose from, and they choose repeat the same songs? \n\nWTF?
