I have to say, top to bottom, the food was excellent. It is really just a shame it was tainted by the service. The staff were indecisive and aloof. Something as simple as requesting a table on the patio warranted \"maybe, maybe not\". \nI sadly cannot recommend this restaurant. The classic hipster \"we are doing you a favor\" bullshit that has become all too common these days. This probably isnt the time or place but I think we are long overdue for a renaissance, when pretentiousness meant actual service.....not good food served with a side of attitude.\n\n\nOh and for good measure, when I tried to order a cappuccino they said \"we don't do that\"
