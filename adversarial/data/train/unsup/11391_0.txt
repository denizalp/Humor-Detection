My worst experience at any car dealership ever.\n\nHonda recall for my car's airbag so I schedule 7:30 am appointment Tue\/25 Apr:\n- 7:10 am I drop it off with Roger at Honda Servicing, take their Shuttle home.\n- 10 am Roger calls (and wakes) me saying my car is ready and I ask him for the Shuttle ride back to Honda\n- 10:30 am no Shuttle yet so I call Roger back, he calls for a different Shuttle vehicle\n- 10:50 am the other Shuttle drops me at Honda, Roger has me sign paperwork and wait on my car to come around.\n- 11 am my car finally comes around so I can finally leave.\n\nWhy wake me up at 10 am and then when I finally get there at 10:50 have me wait some more before I can finally leave with my car?  As if waiting on their crap Shuttle service wasn't hassle enough (I was even considering paying\/taking a Lyft\/Uber to get back to Honda).
