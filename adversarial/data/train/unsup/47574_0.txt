Dec 22nd, I had to ship packages out to my family across the globe, never thought they did international shipping but they do!\n\nIt was confusing but the sweet helpful lady I had made my worries melt away. She helped me fill out the paperwork & slip. Her confidence made it much easier on me (nerves were getting to me).\n\nI wanted to make sure they got the package before I typed up a review. It arrived today, 3 days sooner than I expected!!  Two weeks to send a 5lb. package to a different country? I was floored it made it there without trouble. Cost me under $60 to ship to Western Europe but hearing from my family made me smile this morning.\n\nGreat service. Better than driving to the nearest Post office down by where we USED to live (Russell RD & Buffalo). Saved me time & money.\n\nI'll be back next year (probably earlier so it makes it by xmas)!
