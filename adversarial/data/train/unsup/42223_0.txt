The food, drinks and service are great.  The one thing holding this place back is that it's way too loud.  They had a dj playing best of the 80s crap at ear ringing volume.\n\nServers  could barely hear our order, conversation was a shouting match.  The couple next to us left because of it.  A table next to us moved and had all of their food shifted to a table near the front because they couldn't take it.  The food here is fantastic but would rather opt for take out than to return.  It's that ridiculous.\n\nCrazy fun fact:  We went to see a metal band play across the street at Coalition after.  We both agreed that the metal show wasn't as loud as the stupid dj at dinner.  There's your reference point.  It's louder than being at a metal show.\n\nWhat a shame.
