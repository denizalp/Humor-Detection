I used them for my built in BBQ grille and could not be happier. Ramiz my salesman is very special and really gets the job done. Now for the best part, we also bought two sets of fireplace gas logs. I wanted the remote operated ones and he advised me against it. But I ordered anyway ! What do you know 4 months later they quit working. At my choice the gladly exchanged for the non remote logs. Ramiz is the best.
