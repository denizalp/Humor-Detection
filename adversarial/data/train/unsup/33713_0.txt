It has been a pleasure to shop at Pierres St Denis for the past year. I run an international jewelry business and am often looking for materials last-minute. Thanks to the \"member\" program, I get 30% off all purchases. This means that pearls & even sterling silver are sold at a better price than I what I can find on the internet. I am very pleased that this store sells in bulk with good discounts, not just to people having a bead hobby. Thanks June at Pierres St Denis! Anna, www.paper-anniversary.com
