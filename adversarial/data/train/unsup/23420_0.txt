After fleeing for our lives from another 24 hour laundromat nearby, we were thankful to find this other 24 hour laundromat to dry our clothes. We took our wet clothes and ran from the other place. Pretty quiet only one other person doing laundry and some guy who was sleeping hidden by the washers against the wall. (he never bothered us)\n\nA little messy with some clothes left behind and some dryer sheets on the floor but again the staff is only here until 2pm so I guess it's up to the public to clean up after themselves, imagine that. Big flat screen tv, games, vending machine full of \"good\" junk food, and College Times to tide you over. There is also free wifi and places to sit with tables so you can bring your laptop. No experience with the wash and fold service since we came after 11pm but the dryers worked great. My new 24 hour laundromat.
