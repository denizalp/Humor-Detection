My boyfriend purchased a Groupon for this place, I believe it was for 2 races, 2 people for $35. We stopped by on Christmas to use our Groupon. We were greeted by the lady behind the counter who had us sign a wavier then kept apologizing for the wait time. We had to wait about 30 minutes before we were able to race. They offer a rental for Go Pro for $20 and you get to keep the 4gb micro sd card. The headsocks were $2 and we weren't informed that we could keep it so we threw it back into a bin after we were done. But after looking through reviews, you get to keep the headsock. Not a big deal but it would have been nice if the lady told us that. It was our first time going to any indoor go kart and we had a blast. Wouldn't mind coming back in the future if we were in the area. Be sure to look for their Living Social\/ Groupon deal, it's about half of what you'll pay if you just showed up.
