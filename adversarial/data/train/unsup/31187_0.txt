The hotel itself is beautiful. I was shocked when I walked in and there was a pond with a waterfall and a stream running through the first floor. You can eat along side the water also. It kind of looks like a tropical resort and your forget that you're in Pittsburgh. The complimentary breakfast is ok but it's definitely a lot better than breakfast\nAt other hotels. The free happy hour definitely makes up for it as they have beer, wine, and liquor. The room is pretty good also. The only issue I had was the drain plug in the shower wouldn't stay up so the tub would fill up with water. However a quick phone call to the front desk fixed the problem. They sent someone up and they got it fixed quick. It's definitely been a pleasure staying at this hotel.
