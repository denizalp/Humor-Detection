This review is for the \"cafe\" portion. \nPretty cool spot for super cheap $2.00\/cup french press coffee. \nI love the deck they built, which overlooks the bay. I stopped by for a leisurely morning coffee with my bf on Sunday morning and had a lovely time. \nThey are just starting to offer classes on paddle board yoga, kayak etc - I can't wait to sign up for the moonlight paddle series!
