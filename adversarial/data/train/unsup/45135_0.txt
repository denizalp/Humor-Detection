Dr Crum delivered my first baby last week. I had an amazing experience with Dr Crum and entire staff of Paradise Valley OB\/GYN. I would not have asked for anything better than this. With few complications in my pregnancy ,Dr Crum always gave the best advice for me and my baby. Following her instructions, My D-Day was absolute easy. Overall staff in Paradise valley OB\/GYN has been amazing throughout. Starting from wonderful lady at reception to the ultrasound practitioner, Everyone is very professional and they know their job well. \nThanks everyone for the wonderful experience.
