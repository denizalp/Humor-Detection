No.  I wouldn't recommend this place at all.  My minivan was rear ended by a drunk drive on the freeway and the workmanship was bad. We had to keep sending it back but they wouldn't fix the issue. We finally gave up.\n\nIts bad when you get your car back with panels not lined up correctly inside and BIRD POOP on your seat!  Where was quality control?\n\nWe brought the car back for the front drivers door not closing right and they never fixed it. \n\nThey did fix some other issues but it seemed very selective and the bigger issues were never corrected.  I told them to check the transmission because of the accident and they said it was fine. Guess what we had to have the dealer replace one year later?  \n\nThe worse part is their location. If you live on the West side of town, go somewhere else. You will save lots of time and money not having to bring your car back over and over and over...\n\nThe van should have been totaled. I know it would have been at another shop.\n\nRE: The owners comment about my mistaking them for another shop, no I did not.
