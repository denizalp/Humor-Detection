My sister got a great groupon deal for this place so we when to try it out. It came out pretty good. They got lots of different flavors of poutine. Which I think we tried four of their flavors, and I found that the garlic parmesan, buffalo chicken and the kimchi one pretty good. The Okonos was okay, but it wasn't our favorite. Any how some people may like it. It all depends on what you like. Overall, this place has great option for people who want to try anything but the classic poutine. So I do recommend this place.
