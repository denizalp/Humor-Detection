This was probably the worst I've ever experienced in a restaurant. I took my children to Motorino in King City for lunch today. I ordered the special, eggplant risotto w\/ burrata. I took my first bite and thought the risotto had a tangy taste to it. I then tried the burrata on top. It was so sour that I discreetly spit it out. I thought perhaps it was my taste buds and asked my son to taste it. He immediately said, \"OMG that's disgusting\" and spit it out. I then called the waiter over and let him know that the meal was horrible and that the burrata was bad. He apologized and removed my plate. They asked if they could get me something else? I asked for a pasta dish to go because my kids were almost finished with their meals by the time I got someone's attention to take my food back. The waiter had come back and said, \"The kitchen said the burrata was sour.\"  I then was handed the bill from our original waitress and she said, \"We comped your pasta.\" I looked at the bill and there were still three entrees on the bill. I said, \"Excuse me? I thought you said you comped my pasta? It's still on the bill.\" She said, \"We comped the sour pasta, that's for your substitute.\" I looked at her and said, \"What?? So you comped your own mistake? What exactly did you do for me? That's ridiculous.\" She said, \"Well I'm just doing what the manager told me to do. \"I said, \"I'd like to speak to the manager.\" She said that she would go get him however she went to the next table, opened a bottle of wine, poured it into a carafe then poured it into the glasses. She then proceeded to stay and chat w\/ the men for a bit. My kids and I sat and waited until she went back to the kitchen where we waited some more while she found the mgr. Another waiter then approached our table and said, \"We made a mistake, this is your new bill.\" I looked at him and asked, \"Are you the manager?\" He said, \"I'm the manager right now.\" I said, \"Where is the manager?\" He said, \"He's too busy right now.\" I couldn't believe it. The manager is responsible for everything that goes on in this restaurant. When you serve people bad food, no matter what you are doing in the back of the house, you show your face and apologize to the customer. I said, \"You served me sour food, then charged me for the mistake and now you tell me the manager is too busy to speak with me?\" I got up from the table and said, \"Go get the manager NOW.\" I walked back to the kitchen area because I didn't want to make a scene at the table and by this point I knew my temper would be coming out. Finally the manager came out and I told him he's disrespectful with poor customer service. He said to me, \"I was dealing with something in the back that was more important.\" More important?? I said, \"Let me tell you something from someone who has worked with customers for years as a Nordstrom Store manager and buyer. No matter what you are dealing with in the back is not as important as a paying customer up front. Without the paying customers, you won't have a back to deal with. Understand? It's your responsibility to speak with customers when something goes wrong under your watch.\" After his excuses he offered to make it right. He offered to comp our lunch and for me to bring my entire family back for dinner. I told him that was nice but that I'd think about the offer of dinner. I knew I'd never be back. He walked me to the front of the restaurant where my kids were standing. I have an 18 and 15 yr old son and my 18yr old said, \"You're waiter is an a-hole.\"  I looked at him surprised because he hates confrontation and would usually wait for me in the car. The manager and I were standing there and I said, What happened?\" He said, \"When you went to talk to the manager the waiter came over to me and said, \"Is your mother always this crazy?\" I looked at the manager and said, \"You've got to be kidding me. Who goes over to someone's children and bashes their mother? The customer service is absolutely awful!\" I turned to the manager and said, \"Go get that waiter. He will apologize to my children and to me. This is unbelievable. It just keeps getting worse.\" He went to get him and as the waiter walked across the restaurant, before he even got to me he was saying, \"I apologize for what I said.\" He was practically shouting it as he walked off the dining floor and it was just rude, inconsiderate and very unapologetic. He's one of those guys that can be charming when things are going his way but the second someone calls him out on his crap he turns into a jerk. I actually told him to \"Shut up\". I don't think i've ever told a stranger to shut up but I couldn't believe this guy. He said, \"Please don't talk to me that way\" in his patronizing voice. I said, \"You say negative things about one's mother to her children and you don't want ME to talk to YOU that way? You're rude.\" He said, \"Thank you, have a nice day, hopefully you find somewhere else to eat\" as I walked out the door. Never again. Sour food, terrible service.
