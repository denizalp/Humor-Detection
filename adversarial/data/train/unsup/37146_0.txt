One of my favorite coffee shops. Really friendly staff and good coffee. After a short period of time they recognized me, and would ask me if I wanted my \"regular\" order. In short good old-fashioned service! I moved from the area, and miss the place. Pay them a visit. I don't think you will be disappointed.
