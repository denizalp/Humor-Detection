I just went here to direct beauty supply few days ago....my first time making a purchased here it was during the noon hours ( busy & crowded) they had some ladies there doing some samples on how to do your nails with the orly Fx. Which was a nice thing. \nShe got to show me how to apply the gel and the basic simple designs with your nails. I have no clue how to apply gel on just what she show me what I needed to have so I got the base & the primer later I found out I needed the top coat. I went back to direct beauty & purchased the top coat and couple other things. I knew what I wanted to get but to locate in that store I have no idea where anything was. I ask a taller Spanish lady (don't know if she was the owner) she said it was over here, over there, on the next isle if you've been there they got stuff everywhere  (a total mess) it took me awhile until another younger Spanish girl came in and she help me out.  that lady couldn't help me out one bit. Finally I'm ready to make my purchased It was less then $25 so the young girl says she have to charge me $2.00 fee so I have to buy couple more items so they don't charged that fee. lastly, for what reason is  for them to write you DL# never ever I had to do that any stores in Las Vegas unless your going to a Loan center. I'm mean seriously!!! I just comply with procedures coz I needed my items. If anyone reading my reviews bring enough cash before going there.
