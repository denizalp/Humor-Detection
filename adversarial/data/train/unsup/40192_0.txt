We went at 3 pm on a Tuesday, so there was nobody in the cafe which was disappointing because I heard that the waitresses sing and dance. But there were not enough people in the restaurant so I guess they didn't do anything. \n\nI had the chocolate angel cake and it tasted kind of plain and had a consistency of mousse. My friend had the original lunar cheesecake and it tasted more cream cheesy than the normal cheesecake. The lunar cheesecake had the consistency of jello.\n\nOverall I think the cafe was a disappointment.
