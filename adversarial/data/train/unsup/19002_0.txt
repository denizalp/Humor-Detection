I love Burgatory.   This is the third one I've been to and they are all great.   I sat at the bar and the service was fast and friendly.  I love the build your own burger concept and I've never been disappointed.   Anything with horseradish makes me happy and I got all sorts of horseradish stuff on my burger.  I was in heaven, which I guess is one step above purgatory so maybe they should change the name?\n\nIn any event, I'm a fan and wish I could transplant Burgatory to NYC.
