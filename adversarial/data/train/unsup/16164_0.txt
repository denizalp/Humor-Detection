Some places deserve more than 5 stars and this is one of them.  A few months ago I stopped in and tried the Hard Hat breakfast sandwich ($8.00).  With eggs, roast beef, sharp cheddar, onion, & a jalapeno spread, this is a perfect sandwich.  Great flavor combinations!  I have since been back and brought my husband along to have this sandwich a few more times.  For me, it was difficult to order anything else because I enjoyed this one so much.  With a bounty juice drink, I felt like I had a great breakfast.  \n\nI still wanted to return either for lunch or dinner sometime and try a couple of the grilled cheeses, which sounded amazing as well.  Earlier this week we finally made it and tried the Appiccicoso (Gooey) and the Rusty Pig, both $8.50.  The Gooey has mozzarella, pesto, pepperoni, salami, capicola, & roasted tomatoes on ciabatta, and the Rusty Pig has mozzarella, balsamic vinaigrette, roasted tomatoes, fresh basil, and applewood smoked bacon on sourdough bread.  \n\nFor both the flavors were so fresh and delicious.  I can tell quality is the priority here, and I also liked the fact that the bread is thin and doesn't overwhelm the sandwich.  The ingredients really shine.  We also tried a cookie that was fantastic and now every time I go in I look for another one.  \n\nThe service is friendly and fast, and they have several options to pick up your order.  You can come in of course, or call and pick it up, and they will even take it to you in your car out front.  Just call ahead.  We also visited with the owner about potential catering orders.  They do it all.    Fantastic place!  Best grilled cheeses I have ever had!
