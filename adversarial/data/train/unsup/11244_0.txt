Warning: This place is not good for groups.\nThe service seems to crumble like 3-day-old cow patties when you foist 14 rowdy diners  on them all at once.  \n\nThe pho broth was A-OK for me but heavy on the MSG as evidenced by my massive dehydration the next morning. I really should come back here and have a moment alone with the bowl for a better assessment.\n\nThus concludes Phobruary. \n\nTotal: 5 \n(That's five reviews of pho places where I ate pho in the month of February.)\nI think that means I came in 2nd place. Yippee!
