The food is good but the service we had the last time we were there was horrible.  Our waitress kept disappearing, we had to flag down a manager to order wine and beg to have our order taken.  At one point we looked around and there was no wait staff on the floor at all - like they were having a secret meeting in the middle of the dinner rush.  After we finished our meal we asked for dessert menus and again had to beg someone to take our order.  We finally said something to the manager and then our waitress came to our table and argued with us.  It left a horrible impression after what could have been a good night out.  \nI hear the owners are opening another restaurant.  I hope they get better staff at the new one or it will not last long.  I hesitate to spend my money at a restaurant that doesn't appear to want to serve me.
