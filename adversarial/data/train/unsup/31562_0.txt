I consider myself a BBQ snob having grown up in Kansas majority of my life, to say the least I was quite spoiled. Been in AZ for 8 years now and have always been in search of a solid BBQ joint. My search manifested nothing of my praise until now. Little Miss BBQ does it right with freshly smoked juicy tender meat, fall off the bone ribs, and great sauce (KC is all about the sauce.) The line can be cray, waited an hour and a half to get a giant plate, but it was damn worth it. Great job guys!
