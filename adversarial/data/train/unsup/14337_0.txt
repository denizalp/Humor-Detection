Scotiabank is the sponser to Buskerfest Toronto as all proceeds go towards Epilepsy Toronto.\n\nThere are magnificent Buskers in this street event situated very close to St. Lawrence Market. From what I remember, the Buskers were performing as volunteers (or the ones I've talked to were at least volunteering) and are doing this out of their own time for a charitable cause. Buskers that you will see are the buskers that stand as still as a statue covered with paint, acrobatic acts from gymnasts, men on tall stilts, beautiful balloon costumes, people who eat fire while riding unicycles, large dragon costumes that make you feel like you're an actor in a scary movie, etc. It's literally watching a show that is well thought out by people who want to perform their talents on the street. Best of all, you pay what you think you can afford or want to donate as opposed to the shows that have a strict fee.\n \nI came here once and I was actually volunteering for Epilepsy Toronto during that year, yes I was one of those people that kept bugging you for spare change and the person that asked if you wanted to buy stuff or donate for entry admission every single second, but I mean, like most other volunteers, we're hoping it goes to a good cause and Buskerfest was the event I had the most fun in! I vowed to come every year, but something always came up during that time. Parking isn't too bad, or maybe we were just lucky and found parking spots. \n\nDefinitely a fun and enjoyable spot for the whole family that runs at the end of August! Come for a fun filled afternoon!
