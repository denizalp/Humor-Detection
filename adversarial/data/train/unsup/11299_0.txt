The front desk girls at the higley and southern location are ALWAYS HUGE FUCKING ASSHOLES I will never go here again and I will make sure to tell every human I come into contact with to never go there either. They all act like it is an inconvenience to help patients, hello that's your job! Maybe fucking smile and take the stick out of your ass. Dr. Coury is great though love him. If I was him I would fire them all, or at least give them some training in customer service. everyone at the country club location is much nicer!
