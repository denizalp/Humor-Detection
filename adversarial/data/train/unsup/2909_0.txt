Jazzed up sandwiches that are satisfying and delicious! Located in the heart of King West, just east of King Street W and Portland Street (not too far away from Lee, Wvrst, Portland Variety, etc), we visited on a Thursday evening and it looks like this is a pretty popular spot. Ordering is as follows: you grab a menu, figure out what you want, order at the front, and then grab a table. This location seats about 15 to 18 ish people (approximately), so there's a reasonable amount of seating, but not too much. They'll call you up once your order is ready.\n\nWe ordered the day's special, which was the Big Mac Fried Chicken Sandwich and the parmesan chicken sandwich. Both were on soft and chewy buns, with generous sauces, and contained very well-seasoned meats. I'm a lover of all things fried, so the Big Mac Fried Chicken Sandwich was a favourite of mine. Very flavourful, and super crispy. The sandwiches themselves were a decent size - not overly large, but big enough that you won't be hungry after.\n\nThis spot is very casual with a rustic, yet diner-esque vibe. Great spot to grab a quick and laid-back meal. With drinks, for two people, we paid around $26.00.
