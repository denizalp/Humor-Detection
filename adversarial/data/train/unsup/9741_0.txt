My wife got a coffee and asked for sugar.  The barista stared her down, begged her to reconsider, glared at her, then slammed sugar down on the counter with a snarl of combined contempt and disgust.\n\nIt's certainly not all bad, I'm for fair trade coffee, and their passion for the product comes through in each delicious cup.  If you like your coffee black, I don't think you'll find a better cup of joe in the city.  The raw brick interior is stark but attractive.  But the pretension from the staff, high price tags, and minimalism of this shop drained the heat from the coffee and left me cold.
