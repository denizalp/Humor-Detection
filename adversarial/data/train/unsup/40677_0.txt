Somehow I always find myself coming back here for the blackened salmon on jasmine rice, with ginger salsa dressing. Although the rice tends to be a little overcooked. Also, the chicken bites with a multitude of various sauce options, are simply delicious! All in all, a fun atmosphere and reasonably priced for any special occassion or just a random night out any day of the week.
