Wish I had more time to taste all of their beers \nWent on a busy Sat where the deck was packed with people and dogs and a great live band\nTried the Saison and it was good, malty\/spicy\/bready\nThoroughly enjoyed just wish I could have had more but this was stop #5 on our brewery tours and I could not drink that much\/only serving pints!!!\nWish they could have done the flights\/samplers but apparently they 86 those when there are events\/crowds
