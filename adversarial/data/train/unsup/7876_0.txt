I remember Thrifty ice cream in the front of Ralph's grocery store back in the 70s in California. Across from the registers. It was a nice treat at the end of shopping. I was kind of excited to re-live those memories. \n\nThis place was such a disappointment . I am not sure why we didn't just turn around and walk out the door before ordering. I think that it was because we were looking at the board listing all of the flavors, not really paying attention to much else. I noticed that some of the flavor names were on strips made of paper (obviously hand made), and they all had different flavors of 'sherbert'. NO. It is SHERBET. But, I can let that one go. Sort of...\n\nHowever, once we did stop and notice...this place is FILTHY. Even the register is gross. Seriously?! This place looks as though the owners have just given up. They just don't care, and it shows. Every part of this store was filthy. The girl behind the counter did turn down her music when we walked in to place our order. That was nice at least. Yet she showed no happiness at being there. No smile, she just waited until we decided what to order, and then gave us our total at the end. \n\nAs I was waiting, that is when I took it all in and saw the disgusting ice\/frost surrounding the cooler...all of which had ice cream splattered all over it. I wonder what the ice cream scoops looked like!!! Better to not think of that. Well, we took our ice cream outside just to get out of there, and realized the flavors are so mild it is almost like a waste of calories. The Butter Pecan was an odd shade of orange, and the mint chip was very bland. We couldn't even force ourselves to eat more than half before we gave up. We just kept thinking of the filth inside. NEVER again will we come here. And Thrifty Ice Cream just does not have enough flavor for us. We left extremely disappointed.
