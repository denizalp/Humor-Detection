Nathan was wonderful to work with! We went with a VA loan and a short sale for our first house-- not an easy combination to say the least. Nathan was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful through the whole process. He knew all the right questions to ask, knew the area and its surroundings, and went out many weekends with us (kids in tow sometimes) to help ensure we picked the perfect home for us. We are in love with our new home and couldn't have done it without his help!
