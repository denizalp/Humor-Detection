Excellent first visit!\nThis hot and new business instantly became a bookmark after reading other Yelp reviews that mentioned the cinnamon roll.  I love cinnamon anything, but put it in a roll and I have to check it out.  \nWalking in, you are greeted with a view of the glass cases that show off the lovely pastries offered here, including the cinnamon rolls.  One of the chefs was making a crépe so the smells wafting through the air were delicious.  A friendly staff member took our order and we grabbed seats at a table for two.  Seating was almost all taken with customers enjoying their food.  One couple informed us that they are regulars, the husband from France and his wife from Brazil, I think.  She told us that her husband loves this place and that it's authentic French food, so we knew that this stamp of approval was a sign of good things to come.\nSure enough, our order of the cinnamon roll, apple turnover, the nutella with strawberries and banana crépe, and the La Chevrotine galette with bacon, mushrooms, and goat cheese arrived and everything was beautiful not to mention delectable!  Breizh means \"Brittany\" and if this is the cuisine from that area of France, I want to go.  For now, just come to Cafe Breizh and try their cuisine for yourselves.  Friendly service and fabulous food await.
