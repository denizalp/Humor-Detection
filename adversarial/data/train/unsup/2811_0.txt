Was here for a corporate Christmas party and saw the Yelp reviews before we left and was already kind of knowing I was not going to love this.\n\nWe had cocktailing on the upper floor, need to take an elevator up. The passed canopies were all impossible to eat one handed and incredibly messy. This is a bad design on their part of executing a proper cocktail menu. It should be easy, clean bites. \n\nYou can't take alcohol from one level to the next, so cocktail hour ended and we all left behind perfectly full glasses of alcohol--waste of money right there.\n\nThe bathrooms upstairs were incredibly odd but this is before I knew of the totally stupid bathroom situation downstairs.\n\nThe acoustics on the main level were so awful. No one could hear anyone who was presenting, so all speeches were a totally write off. Service was prompt and friendly, but one server reeked of body odour, which was a turn off.  \n\nFood was terrible. Bland and boring. Poor presentation. I don't think Aria should be hosting parties because they simply cannot execute.  Even the bread was bad.\n\nBathrooms are in the public hallway and you need a code to get in, quite a trek from the restaurant and a bit odd to walk around in party clothes in a public ACC hallway ...\n\nWouldn't go back.
