This the most romantic place for foodies in Scottsdale. The service is five stars; the folks who work there love this place. Our server, Tommy McMahon, was amazing. Every recommendation was perfect. The goat cheese is the best I've ever had and the jam and bread really brings out the flavor.  Don't miss the smoked burrata; it is truly an interesting and delicious twist. Black kale salad is phenomenal. My husband had the rib eye and was in love. It came with a roasted garlic spread we could not get enough of. Each dish is thoughtful and done with creativity and care. If you love food this is a place you should not miss, it has everything, the ambience, service and culinary excitement!
