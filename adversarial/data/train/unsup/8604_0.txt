This place made me as happy as that old lady in the Scooter Store commercials. You know the one, who started spinning around in circles when her wheelchair is replaced with the scooter? Yeah, that happy!\n\nA small group of us went here for brunch\/lunch on Saturday. Having been to the Scottsdale location before, I had an idea of what was on the menu. However, what puts this Culinary Dropout stand out is an awesome patio. We started with the crusty bread and olive oil (with a balsamic vinegar syrup) and the 12-hour roasted tomatoes. Both we excellent, and super inexpensive. We also had their bacon bloody mary (of course) which was divine (of course). My meal was the biscuits and gravy with two sunny-side-up eggs and home fries. The gravy was so good, I could have sucked it up through a straw. So good! We all agreed this would be a perfect spot for a first date. If any of us were actually going out on dates.\n\nWe're planning on riding our bikes back here soon. As an added bonus, an oyster bar is slated to open in the complex within the next month. We peaked in the windows, and it looks like another great spot for a first date (with the added benefit of eating oysters, so I might have a chance to get some!!)
