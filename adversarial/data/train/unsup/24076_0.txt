I need to get out more, lol. I pass this place daily.. After the gym, on the way home from target. I literally live around the corner but just finally stopped by.\n\nI had plans on coming here forever, but I put it on the back burner. Finally I was looking up wing night on a Monday and BB Tavern showed up. How perfect.\n\nWe stopped in around 8. There were a few tables thank fully. Wings were 50 cent from 7-10. They were great sized wings and had awesome mix of sauces. You order them by 5. We each ordered 5 knowing taking leftovers was not allowed. Surpringsly, 5 wings each and sharing  fries was enough to fill us both. I ordered Bourbon Bbq which tasted like basic BBQ with a little kick to it. My bf ordered golden BBQ which was like honey mustard based BBQ. \n\nService was friendly and helpful. The main reason for the 5 star is that this place seemed so chill! Low lights, brick walls, cool food prices, nice staff. It had a cool vibe to it.\n\nWe will be back for sure, maybe even this week. (Ha) they had a great menu.. Yummy sandwiches, apps, burgers, wraps ect.\n\nBy the way, they have one of the best ranch dressings ive ever tasted!
