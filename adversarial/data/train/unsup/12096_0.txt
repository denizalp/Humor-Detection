*This review is for their boarding\/ kennel service only.* \n\nI am so picky, my dog is my best friend(don't tell the bf!).  After searching for a kennel for almost 3 months before a week long vacation(first one in 3 years) my bf and I found UAH for our two large pit bulls. We had difficulty finding a kennel that would take our dogs since they are pit bulls and had spacious enough kennels that both could be in the same one. One place was going to charge extra because of their breed and we would have had to pay extra for two kennels and two extra play times for each dogs, geeez $$$$.\n\nThis was the only reasonably priced, well staffed, clean, and highly managed kennel we found period.  All of the staff have always been happy, friendly and honest each time we go there. They have indoor and indoor\/outdoor kennels which is nice for summer\/winter. They allow two dogs in one kennel and will separate them if needed.  The kennels are nicely sized and the dogs can not see the dogs next to them(some of the others had glass walls separating them- my dog would go crazy seeing another dog next to him that he couldn't play with). They have happy hour(kong with peanut butter), TLC (extra play time) and free baths for your dogs if they are there longer than 4 days I believe. They also take them out three times a day which is more than some of the others we looked at.\n\nWe have taken our dogs there three or four times now and never have had a problem. The dogs always come home happy AND healthy. It's nice also to know they are at a hospital so if something should ever happen, or as our dogs get older and need medication, this place can handle it all and we don't have to switch to somewhere else.\n\nThey give you a report card for the \"campers\" on how they did while you were away which is cute.  I really can't say enough, but we have had a great experience and will keep bringing our dogs here for our boarding needs.
