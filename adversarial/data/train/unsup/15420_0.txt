Good location, good rooms, good views, good linens and beds.  Linens and beds are very important!  The rooms are clean and housekeeping is responsive if you need them.  The bathrooms are nice, not on the same level as Bellagio, but nice just the same.  \nThe pool area is amazing!  LOVE the pool area!  As long as I find the one that isn't FILLED WITH CHILDREN WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT AT HOME, that is.  And there is such an area at the MGM pool complex.  Yay!\nFood options are good, lots to choose from, something for everyone.  Check in and check out, no problems there.\nCasino is huge, not bad, good cocktail service, bad video poker pay tables.  We don't do a lot of gambling here, for the above referenced bad vp and the crowd, eh, not our kind of gang.  Little bit of the fanny pack wearing, matching shirt crowd going on here.\nCrazy Horse Paris - great show!  Check my other reviews for that one!\nPeople have complained about the green glow in their rooms at night, but it doesn't bother me at all.\nThey could lose the Rainforest Cafe, as far as I'm concerned, all it does is bring families with small children, WHO DO NOT BELONG ON THE VEGAS STRIP.\nThe lions are pretty cool, but again, the area is crowded with small ones.\nI do love the location, the rooms, the linens and the pool area.  Also, the valets are great about putting you in a town car for naughty night-time activities, if you ask!
