4 of us tried out Lucky Foo for the first time last night. Gotta say, the atmosphere is classy & fun. We sat on the patio outside and the service was good. The table wasn't clean when we got there, but the host & hostess went right out and cleaned it up for us. The waitress came along and raves about a few items on the menu to include specialty made cocktails and plates. She wasn't exaggerating, the food was great! We had the charred shashito peppers, the appetizer wonton chips-fantastic! Then we rolled into Lucky Rice-so freaking delicious and sushi rolls- pretty good, but pricy. I still like my all you can eat sushi place, but this was a close second. The price is what earned the 4\/5 star review. $14 for a rainbow roll? Come on! I can get just as good all you can eat sushi for $22. Anyways, I would go back for the apps and lucky rice!
