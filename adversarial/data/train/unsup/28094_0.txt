Just joined.  Super friendly staff and coaches.  They make you feel welcome as a new guy.  All the teachers have amazing pedigrees.  The gym is huge with great equipment.  The prices are reasonable and the owners (really cool guys) will usually work with you. There is no high pressure salesmanship here.
