Having lived in the NY & NJ area for 30 years I've become spoiled with good Chinese food. Last night my girlfriend and I decided to try this place in Gilbert. The menu was extensive and the prices looked great. We were shocked when I went to pick it up as to the large portions . The General Chicken was soft and not over cooked and the potstickers were hot and tasty. \nDefinitely the best Chinese Food I've tasted since I've been here. I can't wait to order again!!!
