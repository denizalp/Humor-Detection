Tried this place as it was convenient to our next stop, so glad I found this little spot. I came in a group of 4 and we all 4 thoroughly had a great time.  \n\nFor drinks, pretty basic, green tea and soda etc, we ended up just getting waters.\nThe setting was pretty simple, basic, and more like quick dine in spot, nothing too too fancy. \nOur server Sue though, was on spot from the moment my foot set in the door, she was the sweetest. We were greeted and kindly welcomed. \n\nNow, the food, was BOMB.COM, Nagoya has probably the best, tastiest and freshest sushi I've EVER had. I had their jalape√±o bombs (deep fried, stuffed with cream cheese and tuna), tootsie roll (avocado, cream cheese and shrimp tempura) and the super man burrito (crab, tuna, salmon, avocado wrapped with soy paper). Let me tell you it was all very delicious. The super man burrito was a bit small but perfect if you plan on trying trying other dishes. \n\n-1 star because the pricing was a little too high even off the happy hour menu... The quality was great and worth it but if pairing the price to the aesthetics, the setting and the quantity to the food, it's still a bit on the high tide, will that stop me from surfing by?! Not at all!
