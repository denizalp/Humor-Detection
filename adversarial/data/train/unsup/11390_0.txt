My husband and I just had the best dinner in a long time here.  \n\nThe service was top notch.   Our host and server Derrick (I'm awful with names but I *think* that was he said his name was) was informative, attentive and extremely friendly.  He didn't even flinch when I took one look at the uber-busy dining room and asked if we could sit outside instead (I shy away from crowded places) and he went out of his way to take great care of us tonight.  He gave us great service, and I am very critical about service standards.  (I mystery shopped for several years, it's to be expected from me...lol!)\n\nThe food was wonderful and because we were both new to the dish of Pho, Derrick was very informative, instructing us on the proper way to season our soups and how it's eaten.\n\nThe spring rolls were very good, I got the seared tuna roll and my husband got the vegetarian Buddha roll.  \n\nAnd the ginger creme brulee we split for dessert was delicious!   The ginger flavor was really intriguing and the sugar crust was perfect.\n\nDinner with my husband made it extra special! :-)\n\nThe one and only drawback to this place is the stucktastic parking situation.  They really need to move to a bigger place where they'll have more parking.  It is hard to even get a spot here.  \n\nSo, other than having to park across the street and walk over, we had a wonderful dinner and I highly recommend this place for a nice dinner. \n\n\n\nNote to self:  I'll have to check it out for lunch sometime!
