I'd been seeing Jeremy, one of Skullz' stylists, when he worked down the road. My hair was growing out after a particularly bad cut (OK, so I shaved my head), and I really needed a new, cute style to make me feel pretty again. I read about Jeremy in the Daily Kent Stater and went to him blind,  without any recommendations except the Stater review. I told him my story & begged him to fix me --- and fix me he did.\n\nI gave Jeremy total free reign over my hair and he gave me one of the cutest styles I've ever had. It was a little extreme, don't get me wrong -- reddish and dark black, a little spiky in the back with blunt bangs in front -- but it was exactly what I needed to get my self-esteem back in place following my brutal shaving experience and the Spock-like look it'd grown into.\n\nI now live in D.C. and usually wait until I'm back in Kent to get my hair cut (I alternate between Jeremy at Skullz and Denise at M.C. Hair Consultants in the Falls) because I've yet to find anyone in this big, snazzy city who can match up. Jeremy can do everything, seriously. He can give you a spiky rainbow-colored punk look or he can give you a gorgeous updo. He does the hair of conservative little old ladies and girls who you'd never take home to mom. He's just plain talented, no matter what you're looking for.\n\nI went to Angelique once, too, the owners & while she definitely didn't give me the style I wanted, it did look great. I have friends who go to her and love her, so I think it's all about relationship-building there. That said, I will get my hair cut by Jeremy for as long as humanly possible. He's a rockstar, & he makes me feel like one!
