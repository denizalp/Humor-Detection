OMG...... Let's start with the desserts first. Heaven!!!! Warm peanut butter cup is to die for and a must try. The salted caramel is amazing as well and full of flavor and worth the awards. We indulged and had be chocolate cake as well and it was rich and good but a little dry for a molten. Let's pause on all that for a minute. \nOk going back to the food. We had the butchers plate which had some great choices on the charcuterie and then followed it up with dinner. For the table of three we had the fried chicken and biscuit, the sweet potato tortellini and the short rib stew. All three were good and well flavored. I could have taken a little more spice but it was seasoned well. Drinks special we had the polish and the old fashioned and both were on points \nOverall a great pick for dtown Phoenix with good service and a great fun atmosphere. Highly recommend
