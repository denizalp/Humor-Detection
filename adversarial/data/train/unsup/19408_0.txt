\"DAMNNNNNN GOOOOOD! DAMNNNNNNN GOOOOOD! DAMMMMMMMMMMMMM GEWD!\"\n\nThose three words are the celebratory chants of a Rollin Smoke Barbeque meal. Alright so maybe the chef will encourage you to shout it when you leave, but it takes little convincing, trust me!\n\nMy knowledge of barbeque is limited, but I mean I own a Traeger Grill, does that count for anything? No? I didn't think so either... but while my Traeger makes deliciously smoked clean meats it doesn't compare to the smokey glistening glory of RSB. Their ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ is what makes Vegas or America in general really freaking awesome. I mean sure we're in the top 10 for most obese countries, but hey at least we do it right, RIGHT? \n\nThe special is $25 and includes EVERYTHING on the menu, except drinks ($2), you gotta buy that, BUT... its pretty much all you can drink too. Don't pass on the Outlaw Burger,  the beef ribs, or the nachos, but do pass on the pulled pork. Don't wear a belt, its useless, no belt will make look skinny after the massacre. You can of course also just order ala carte.\n\nTake the booth with the pig, it will give you extra encouragement when you savage through his four legged cousins. \n\nCONVENTION PEOPLE... COME HERE!\n\nHow was my review? DAMNNNNNNN GEWDDDDDDDDDD right? Thanks!
