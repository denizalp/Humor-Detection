New owners New Menu Blah blah \n\nI used a restaurant.com coupon and wish I hadn't. \n\nDumpy, bad service, worst food. \n\n3 kids and myself for dinner during the week, \n\nI had the steak, a nice rib eye ...BARF \nIT WAS ABOUT 1\/4 INCH THICK, GREY IN COLOR, NO SEASONING, AND 2 GRILL MARKS (SERIOUSLY 2) IT TASTED LIKE IT WAS BOILED. \n\nI SENT IT BACK (VERY UNUSUAL OF ME) \n\nI went with the ribs, which were Gray and boiled tasting too but the sauce was good and I was done! \n\nShe sucked at refilling water, it spilled everywhere when she did and she never mentioned any kind of discount or anything. \n\n2 kids want wings, which were on special for $0.35 each IF you buy drinks @ 1.75 each. (waitress proceeds to tell me this is CHEAPER then buying the wing plate. \n\n1.75x 2 = 3.50 \n12 @ 0.35 = 4.20 \ntotal 7.70 for 12 wings and 2 kids hopped up on Dr Pepper. \n\nI ordered the 5.50 for 12 wings. and 2 waters. \n\nPS Wings were good. \n\nKid #2 got fish... it was greasy and chewy, she didn't even eat all. \n\nThe salads we OK the dressings were OK. \n\nDon't bother unless it is the bar your are after, at least the bar girl was cute.
