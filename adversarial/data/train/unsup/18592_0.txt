One of my favorites in Charlotte!  This is my go-to place when I want a guaranteed delicious meal.  I love sharing the cheese and fruit plate or yummy hummus as an appetizer, or having any of their delicious salads to myself.  My favorite main course is the basil pesto penne with chicken--never disappoints!  Other favorites are the seafood crepes and pizzas.  This is also a great place for brunch.  Think french toast, delicious omelets, and eggs benedict.  I've also enjoyed (way too) many desserts.  You could easily come for the coffee and bakery treat alone.  \n\nThey often have live jazz music which makes the atmosphere even more fun.  This is a perfect date night spot and also great to get a group of friends together.  I'd recommend Cafe Monte to everyone!
