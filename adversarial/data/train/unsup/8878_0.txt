Table 34 delivers great service, food and ambiance!\n\nWe stopped in to try this hidden gem off of Warm Springs.  You can't see it from the road but it sits behind Starbucks.  There is plenty of parking for their dining patrons. The dining area is nicely decorated to create an enjoyable experience.  \n\nWe were there early enough to partake in their happy hour at the bar.  There are also a few tables near the bar area where you can take advantage of the special deals.  We started off with their House prepared chips with truffle aioli.  Warning~  Their aioli is very addictive!  I wanted to spread it on everything.  They also give you a generous amount of their chips!\n\nMy husband tried the Cider Glazed Pork Ribs w\/Cajun Fries.  These literally fell off the bone.  Very tender with a nice glaze.  My Kobe beef sliders were awesome.   They came with caramelized onions, swiss and thousand island.  Each bite just melted in your mouth.  The sweet potato tots that I ordered with the sliders complimented each other wonderfully!  Again, a generous amount of the sweet potato tots are provided from the HH menu.  \n\nWe had amazing service from Adrienne at the bar.  She was funny, entertaining and attentive.  You could tell some of her regulars loved to stop in just to see her.  She is definitely an asset.\n\nWe certainly enjoyed our happy hour experience here.  I hope to be back to try their full menu!
