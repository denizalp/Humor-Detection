Very good coffee - Counter Coffee beans, can't go wrong there.  Extremely friendly service, very welcoming.  Had a great breakfast sandwich - fried egg, sausage, on ciabatta bread.  Everything else looked great as well.  Good atmosphere in there as well, nice place to hang out and enjoy your food and coffee.
