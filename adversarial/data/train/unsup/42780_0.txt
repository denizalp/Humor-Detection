Don't come to this restaurant.  First time trying this place and let me tell you don't waste your time. We order porridge and the porridge was so water down and has no flavor. And I have plenty of porridge in my lifetime. My daughter order soy sauce chicken with rice and the waiter said rice didn't come with it. So I order a bowl of rice. While we were waiting and browsing thru the menu again, there's was an order of chicken and rice dish. Don't know why the waiter said there was none, maybe he wanted to charge us more. But anyway when the chicken dish came, it's was so dry. There was no moisture in the meat. I told the waiter and he took it back. When he came back, I thought we would have gotten a new order. But no!! All they did was drizzle more soy sauce to the chicken!! Chicken is still dry as shit! On top of that the rice they charge us had a funky smell. Couldn't eat it.  Sorry to say this is the first and last time I will dine here!!  I should have read the review before coming
