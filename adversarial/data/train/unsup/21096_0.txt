Is it possible that the \"Nighthawks\" is inspired by Fameux? Maybe, most maybe not. In any case I'm giving four stars for the poutine (my favorite is la québécoise), the corner location (great for people watching), the old school feel, value for money and the friendly service. Ok, the other items on their menu aren't superb, but it's not the kind of restaurant that you go for some kind of unique gastronomic experience. Know that when you walk in, you'll see a lot of choices; not all of them good, not all of them are made with the finest ingredients (if any?), but most of them will probably satisfy your hunger and some will actually be surprisingly good (like the foie de boeuf). Personally I do hope places like Fameux will always be around. The Plateau will be so dull otherwise!
