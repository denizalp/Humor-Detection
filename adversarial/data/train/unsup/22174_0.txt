If I could give zero stars I would! What a pretentious establishment!  They had empty seats and saved them for \"important people\" this is a whole bunch of crap!I would not recommend yhus establishment to my worst enemy! \nHorrible service!\nHorrible mojitos, my dog could make a better drink!\nThis place sucks!\nMike at the door fkat out told me he had important people coming. I stood there like a stooge bought 2 over priced drinks along with my entire party..watched them smoke over priced crappie cigars from their shop...the while time 4 tables sat empty.  Finally we were sick of spending our hard earned money at this s... h...! Don't waste your money!
