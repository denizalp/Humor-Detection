Fantastic food and the only boiled NY bagels\nCanters, finally in Vegas again. The food is fantastic with large portions, enough for 2 people.\nAnd the are the only restaurant that has the original boiled bagels and bialy's in Vegas.\nWe can't stop going there. The Tivali village\nPlace is a hundred times better than the one by the HIgh Roller because they have a kitchen.\nWe originally thought that the bagel cafe was great, Canters beats them by 100 percent.\nWe just don't leave empty because they have a wide selection of old style cakes and cookies. So\nWhen we leave we are packet with extras to eat home.
