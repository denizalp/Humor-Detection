First time here and it was very good, they definitely have a unique variety of flavors.  This is not your ordinary hot dog stand.  I tried their version of the Chicago dog and it was great.  Also had the chili cheese fries.  Next time I'm going to try something a little more adventurous like the angry kimchi fries.
