Finally went to this place after reading some good reviews and I am glad to say its one of the nicer, cooler bars I have been too. The dress code is kept strict so none of this baller rubbish.\n\nThe interior reminds me of walking into a show house with ornate furnishings and drapes and generally lots of fabric. The club has a central dance area, where there is not a bar on the side then there are booths for reservations. There are four bars in total, so getting served is never a problem.\n\nGot their quite late but there was not much of a queue. The security was polite and smiling, and kept everything in order.\n\nOnce inside about 11.30pm it was already pretty busy so again I was surprised at their not being much of a queue considering what i read below about them.\n\nNow I went on a Friday night, this is predominately an East Asian crowd and as is usual with Asian crowds in England, you got half the crowd which trying too hard (not smiling, posing etc...) and the other half that don't give a shit and are having a blast. So basically a mixture of pretentiousness and generally cool folk.\n\nWhere this club gets bonus points is the service, its quick, friendly, $3.50 vodka shots before 12am. My thanks goes out to Chris one of the workers there who helped me in a sticky situation.\n\nSo where does it lose the one start?? Well music, its not great. I think there is such thing as too much genres and I think anything from the 70s needs to be left for the pubs. I think at one stage it got really old school but personally I think there is enough good music in the last decade to run a 4 hour set easy.\n\nI would go here again but probably on a Saturday to see the difference in crowd and vibe.
