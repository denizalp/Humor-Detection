This place is ridiculous. Long story short, they cannot be trusted with your money (or with anything else, for that matter).\n\nI went to buy a car from them on a Saturday an urgent basis, and was assured that the car would most likely be there by Monday (Tuesday at the latest). They had a specific car for me -- they had me sign paperwork for a car with a specific VIN. And then, on Monday I learned that not only would the car not be there, the car was \"lost in transit\" somewhere and that they had (without so much as consulting me) switched me without my permission to another car (albeit of the same model and trim) from elsewhere. Now they say they can \"guarantee\" the car on Tuesday. I don't buy it. This is, at best, a breach of trust (and a breach of contract at worst). Why was I never consulted about this? Why was I only told about this after the fact?\n\nAfter speaking with the salesperson from whom I'd bought the car as well as her manager, I found out that they were simply content to point out that I'd signed the papers to buy the car -- no effort to try to make things right, no effort to do anything to understand why I had no trust in them anymore. I have since filed a formal complaint against them with Kia USA. Thanks to Century III Kia's buffoonery, I will never be buying a car from Kia again -- and I will urge friends and family to take a similar course of action.
