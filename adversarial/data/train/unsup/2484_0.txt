Cheap, decent pizza? 2am and stomach growling? LITTLE NIPPER'S. \n\nThere really isn't much more to say. Little Nipper's has been there for me every time and the staff is both speedy and courteous. Last week, I walked from East Carson to Craig (partially barefoot, because I made the idiotic decision to wear 5-in heels) and seeing the dimly lit 'OPEN' sign at 2:27am was salvation. I am forever yours, Little Nippers.
