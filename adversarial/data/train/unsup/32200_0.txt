Get down here before August 1 for their grand opening special $11.95 for lunch $15.95 dinner, for all you can eat sushi or Korean BBQ, if u want both add an extra $5. The Sushi and Korean BBQ are both decent not extraordinary, but it is nice to be able get both at the same time for AYCE. I would consider the meat slightly better than Sura with more meat selections and better priced.
