So i'm going to start out by saying I know we are in a recession and money is tight but this was the worst mini golf course that I have ever seen. I loved that when we walked in all the arcade games were shut off and didn't work....probably because our round of mini golf only costed $12 for the 2 of us. We proceeded to the course which was a total joke. The turf was totally beat up, the staging and props looked condemned, and at one point I smelt something that resembled a dead body or animal. At one point I bet this was a nice place but the ponds that went thru the course were all dried up and not working and everything was a mess! It wasn't enjoyable and we were very disappointed, Spend the extra couple dollars and go to crackerjax or castle n coasters.
