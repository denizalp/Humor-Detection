So this place has some of the best fish and chips that I've had in Vegas  (for real)....and it's really too bad because we've called in orders multiple times to come pick up and it was always all good anyways I just tried to call in 2 orders of fish and chips and was told  they don't do to go orders over the phone( really?! Because most TO GO orders are over the phone) That's just ridiculous .....  I don't know what these business are thinking making rules like this but there's plenty of bars with fried fish late night
