The bowling itself is fun. Cosmic bowling was set to good music and I had a fun evening. The lane was remodeled recently enough, but the place could be run so much better. \n\nI showed up at 9:15pm on a Friday night and there were about 15 customers standing in the lobby doing nothing. Cosmic bowling does not start till 9:30pm, but why a business would want potentially paying customers standing around not allowed to buy anything is mind boggling. If you don't want to turn on the lanes till 9:30pm that is fine but at least start processing payments so people can set up and get drinks and order food, etc... \n\nAt 9:30pm a lady started accepting everyone's money - $15 for an hour for one person including shoes. You then proceeded to another employee who assigned lanes and handed out the shoes. \n\nBy the time I left after 2 and a half games, the place was full. To start out there were only 5 separate groups however, but we were all placed on adjacent lanes. If you have 42 lanes, why would you bunch 5 parties up at lanes 1-5. Put them at 1, 3, 5, etc so everyone can be efficient about getting started since there is only one control device for every two lanes so only one party can enter names at one time. \n\nNice enough place and I would go back if I wanted a lower key bowling experience than the new downtown places offer, but don't show up early.
