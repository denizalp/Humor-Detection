If you ever need to fill up on protein, come to Jun's.  We ate dinner here recently and I ordered the Jun's Special with bulgogi, kalbi, chicken, mandoo, meat chun, brown rice, and salad.  All of that for $13.95 (no substitues) and it was so much food that I couldn't finish it in one sitting.  I could have done without the meat chun, which is thinly sliced beef fried in egg batter:  I just didn't like the taste.  Everything else, though, was very flavorful.  I've been to the other Jun's location on Eastern Ave. in Henderson and have always been a fan of their kalbi.  A third location is coming soon to the corner of Tropicana and Hualapai to please the Jun's fans on that side of town.   Good food and good service and it's near our house=Korean BBQ happiness.
