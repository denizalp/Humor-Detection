I have looked high and low for a shop to feel comfortable in and had called several places and just did not have a good feeling then we called here and when we did call I got a good vibe this place from the first phone call to entering to leaving has been the best tattooing experience I have had of any shops I have visited. Everyone was fantastic and nice and the place is spacious and clean. Megan did my wife and my tattoos all in one day, she answered all our questions and offers ideas, she really took her time, was patient, courteous and made sure we were satisfied. I highly recommend coming here meeting all the artist, I am definitely coming back to get more work done. My wife has dealt with the owners outside of the shop and they have always been nice and polite and great to talk to.
