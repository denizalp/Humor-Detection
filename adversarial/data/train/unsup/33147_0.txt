Arrived an hour after opening at 9:15am for a massage and was told they were not taking any more appointments until 12:30. Arrived at 12:15 and got in cue with 60 others. It was announced at 12:45 no other appointments were being taken because only ten therapists showed up. We got in under the cut. Waiting now 45 minutes and figured out why a long wait....7 students I'm the waiting lounge! Receptionist said they were trying something\"new.\" I say go back to the way it was!
