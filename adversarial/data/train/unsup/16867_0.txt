Convenient appointment making via website and friendly reminders via email and text to help me plan a mother daughter nail outing. \n\nI treated my mom to a little pampering and I'm glad to find this nail salon. We arrived a little early for our appointment and they took us right away. The salon is huge and it was bustling on a Saturday afternoon. The nail techs made the extra effort to seat my mom and I next to each other. \n\nI was helped my Cindy and my mom had Thuy. They brought us water and made color suggestions for us. We had a great time chatting and I was happy with the end results on our manicures. \n\nI look forward to making this salon my regular place going forward.
