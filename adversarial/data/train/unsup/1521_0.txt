Mmmm! I came here during the first Friday event downtown, and I ordered the grilled cheese Mac and rib sandwich, which was Mac and cheese with pulled pork over sweet BBQ sauce and it was as delicious as it sounds. It's cooked to order so there's a bit of a wait. The lady asked me if I wanted a combo for three more dollars which included either a cup of soup or tots, and a soda. I chose the tomato basil soup. It's difficult to eat soup at the festival without a table and walking around, so I regretted getting the tots. The soup would have been great with the sandwich but I ate it after my sandwich and it wasn't that great to me. It was tomatoe-y and reminded me of prego, but had it been with my sandwich, I'm sure it would have been amazing.
