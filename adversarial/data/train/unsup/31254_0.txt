This was another successful \"Foodies and Fellowship - November Edition,\" event organized by a good friend of mine here in Charlotte (FYI -  every other month my friend invites a group of Charlotte locals (transplants) to a evening out for dinner at a random restaurant in the Queen City; an unique way to fellowship and try out a different\/new restaurant).\n\nBack to the review: Don't judge a book by its cover or in this case don't judge a restaurant by it's exterior design - which can be said for Beef 'N Bottle. This restaurants old fashion and traditional building holds inside one of the best tasting steaks I have eaten in a long time.  I can see why it is a Charlottes award winning steak restaurant. \n\nI ordered the NY Strip, medium cooked, along with a side of cheese broccoli. The meal comes with a salad; only the slices of veggie comes on a platter for you to choose from.\n\nThe restaurant was slightly dark and tight, which added to the ambiance.\n\nOur waiter was energetic and did an excellent job breaking down the menu. \n\nI enjoyed myself.
