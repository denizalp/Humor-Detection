Choose this pizza shop base on Yelp review, it turns out very disappointing! Two pizza for $37.45 are not cheap at at. I would expecting good service, better quality of food. The service is alright, but I need to complain about the food quality. In one single slice of pizza, I found a piece of plastic and a huge onion skin which is not acceptable! I was gonna ignore it, but not even until I finish this piece, found an onion skin that is not chewable. This is totally unbelievable and more than I can take. I called back to complain, they didn't have a manager there can gave an explain and told me to call back. They did offer me to go back there so that they can offer me another fresh pizza. Come on, if I want eat in the shop I would eat there at the first time instead of order a pickup. They were just keeping saying there is nothing they can do over the phone. They should figure out a way to improve their food quality and service not just say sorry. I hope they could learn something from this.
