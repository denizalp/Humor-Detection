Scary rental. Ditto on upsell. Want to add our gas? Only 3.29 gal compared to 3.89 on street. I had to remind salesperson I get charged a full tank. Oh yeah. 4 times tried to upsell SUV over standard car. Came down in price but I kept saying no. He kept saying I would have to wait for my car but SUV was ready now.  Ended up going down to pick up my car and ended up with a small SUV. Only car they had. Will they try and add extra? I wouldn't be surprised. Should have checked Yelp first or followed my instincts and walked over to Budget or Avis.
