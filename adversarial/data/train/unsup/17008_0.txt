The Biggest Mystery after the Caramilk Secret, 'how does the Bata Shoe Museum remain in business?'\n\nJust to give you a bit of a background, I love history and museums. Did you know we have a Ceramics and Textile Museums in Toronto? Or have you ever been to the Toronto Archives? I have and I recommend them all! \n\nHowever unless you have a foot and shoe fetish, I cannot say that you will walk out of this place with any more knowledgeable in footwear than a proper visit to ROM. \n\nTheir exhibits are more like extended presentations, with a shoe behind a glass from some period in time with a few short notes next to it, mostly kept  in the basement level and on the second floor.  Along the odd extra exhibit here and there but again... they need to have a powwow with some PR people and pronto, to try to get some awareness out. \n\nAll three times I have been here have been either though some special or free through Nuit Blanche and all have left me, well, unimpressed.\n\nFor example the two highlights I have of this museum were last year during Nuit Blanche.\n\n1-) because it was, oh so **warm** after a cold long, long walk through most of the city. So my troop of 8 friends flopped on the room with the seating against the wall just at the bottom of the stairs to the left. I think that is a presentation room for films. And...\n\n2-) As we were leaving, someone decided to get naked and streak out of the museum, running at full speed. I even got a shot or two! That was different.\n\nWhat was I saying? Oh, yeah, shoe museum. *Y*a*w*n*. \n\nIf they just spiced it up with some more exhibits, or history, more shoes, exhibits or something! Otherwise this so-called museum is just sucking up space in what otherwise is a very transited intersection.  Which is a shame. Bata, are you listening?\n\nWhatever you do don't pay full price.
