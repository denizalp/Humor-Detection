UPDATED: This place has improved. They are now more responsive and helpful. I appreciate that.\n\nNot interested in helping you.  I had a valuable shipment of art work refused by this place because it came by freight.  They didn't even call me. They are not responsive. They are not customer focused. There are better choices.  If you need something valuable delivered don't send it here
