The food is awesome and the customer service is great too. I went to pick some lunch up for myself and a friend around 11:00am and there was only one car in front of me in the drive thru. The ladies who helped me were very kind and didn't miss or forget anything. I ordered a two piece fried chicken with yucca fries and the empanada trio with rice. Everything was super tasty. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll definitely return for more!
