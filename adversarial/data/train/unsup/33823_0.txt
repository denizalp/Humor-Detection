We love all the Cosmo restaurants, however apparently we saved the best for last.  The whole experience was wonderful.  The room, and overall atmosphere is very nice.  The service was top notch.  We especially liked how the whole table was taken to the fish bar, and the fresh catches were explained.\n\nThe Milos special, the signature appetizer was great.  We also had 2 types of fish to share for the table.  Both a little different, both melted in our mouth.  \n\nCan't recommend Milos highly enough.  Food, service and atmosphere were all fabulous.
