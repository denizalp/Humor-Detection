Romance!!! This place is with a doubt the place for a special night out. The food is divine to say the least. We had the filet (the best Ive ever had) & seafood risotto entrees- fantastic both in their own rights. Do not miss out on the rum cake dessert. We enjoyed champagne, a pinot noir, and one of the specialty cocktails. The ambiance is second to none.... the candles, the fire, the lanterns, the flowers and music... I could go on and on... Special thanks to our server Noah - so warm, welcoming and attentive.... the whole staff is superb!!
