Oh Culver's how I love you!  I don't know if you know this but we have a special connection; your first location is in my hometown.  Even though I've moved away, I've not forgotten you.  Our reunion this weekend was bittersweet; the delicious chicken tenders and french fries...if only I'd had a chocolate custard ice cream cone...oh well, it will give me an excuse to stop in the next time that I'm home. \n\nI hope that you know how special you are; after all, you're the only fast-food restaurant that can make me forget that I've read Fast Food Nation and Omnivore's Dilemma...a pretty significant accomplishment.
