When I ordered my airline tickets online it said do you need to rent a car? Get this deal through American Airlines. Signed up to rent car Monday at 8:30 a.m. and return Saturday at 2:30 p.m. Total cost with all taxes and fees turned into 388.00. Thought it was still pricey but needed the car. Upon arrival we were greeted by Barbara. She was very friendly and she asked if we want to upgrade the car. The total for the car alone was 352.00 Then she told us our insurance wasn't accepted by Budget. The insurance was going to cost 351.88, 12 cents less than the car rental. Plus all the idiotic fees and taxes brought our total to 988.00.Hell no! So she backed out the upgrade and brought it down to 785.00. Then we were told that we needed to bring the gas receipt with us showing we went to a gas station within 5 miles or else we would be paying 9.98 a gallon for gas. I said we'll fill it up. She was trying to charge us for flat rate for refilling the fuel.  She proceeds to tell me there are only 2 gas stations within the 5 miles required, \"and they are hard to find they aren't off the freeway. They are hidden down the roads\" guess what...found 2 real close and several others too. My husband and I were literally in sticker shock. He looks at me and reluctantly signs for it. We talked about it later and decided to return the car today...so we kept it for less than 1.5 days. The guy checking in the car says, there is a clause you signed that says you have to keep car for 4 days or we will charge you more. He charges us 467.00 for less than 1.5 days. My husband got mad and told him he ripped us off. Husband said the contract said they could charge you more not they would. He smiles and says he adjusted the bill to 267.00 however I have one long receipt saying it was charge 467.00 and I different receipt saying the total rental was 267.00. But it doesn't show 267.00 was charged. I will be monitoring my bill very closely. These people are rip off artists. For 3.5 days off site of the airport I'm renting from Enterprise for 114.00. Oh and buy the way, called our insurance company and budget lied about the insurance. Never Ever Ever Again, Budget...Never.
