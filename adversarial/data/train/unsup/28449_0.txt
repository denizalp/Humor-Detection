We came here to celebrate a co-worker's birthday. We're a mixed group from all over (Texas, Florida, Maryland, and California). The exterior of the place looks a little odd....... you have to walk down a few flights of stairs to get to the restaurant. But it sure is a lot cooler than down there!!!!! Kind of a unique looking restaurant. \n\nI'm a natice Northern Cal girl, born and raised in San Francisco....I have fresh seafood at my fingertips on a daily basis. So I was a little skeptical about a seafood place in Phoenix, AZ.\n\nI ordered the New england clam chowder and it was pretty good. Not too salty!!!! I also had the fried shrimp dish. It was prepared just right.  Overall, everyone orderered seafood dishes and enjoyed them. \n\nThe Snicker's cheesecake was wonderful.\n\nService was good.........a little slow. Apparantly, the server has to manually compute the tabs if you ask for a split check.  Menu is a little pricey, but worth it for \"Fresh\" seafood.
