I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about Oddseoul. Okay, maybe they do. Toronto Life said it best when they described the owners, the Han brothers, as having captured \"Ossington's Korean past and hipster present...\".\n\nAnytime I eat something amazing, I have an emotional reaction which stays with me. I call it JOY. \n\nOddseoul was pure joy. Brace yourself because it's about to get real yummy.\n\nMy chef buddy and I caught up over some drinks, drank some more with his likeminded peeps, and then we all got hungry and headed to Ossington. Oddseoul is sexy. How so? It just is. It's a long, dark but inviting restaurant cranking out awesome music. There's a bar upfront and semi-cramped high-top seating, but that's just cause they want y'all to get real close. And they're serving food into the wee hours. A culinary delight compared to usual late night dirrrtyy eats like street meat, Burrito Boys, Choochootrain or Rol San. Only the truest Torontonians will grin at the last two. So we piled in and feasted:\n\nSaba - my least favourite of the night. Still delicious but Hapa's saba still takes the win.\nDeep fried prawns. Yum! Crispy, tart, and sweet.\nThe special. It's a hot dog. Course it's MORE than a hot dog. Geem\/Keem (aka nori aka dried laver aka seaweed), green onions, hickory sticks and some sort of sauce. This thing was RIDICULOUSLY good. RIDICULOUS.\n\nMy favourite dish from Oddseoul is also the highlight of my trip to Toronto. Meet The Loosey. She's only $5. I would describe this as a Korean mother's take on a Big Mac:\n\nToasted sesame bread (perfectly toasted, nice crunch and good chew)\nBeef patty with those familiar amazing korean-bbq flavours\nSome sort of sauce, ketchup, pickles \nA fried egg\n\nI loved it. Ate it all in four bites and didn't want to share it. I want one now. Help me?\n\nNow I realize I said \"some sort of sauce\" twice, but that's because I don't know what it was. If they come back and tell me it's just mayo, I may as well pack it in and go home. Whatever it was, it was delicious. They may have been the same, they may not have been. I was in no frame of mind to tell, and like I said, it was dark. I could barely see my friends. But their smiles showed through. That is what I call JOY.
