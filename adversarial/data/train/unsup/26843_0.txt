Great staff, food and drinks. Man, they are not shy on how they pour their drinks. My friends are regulars there and every time I go there it feels like a Cheer's kinda bar- where everyone knows your name. I happened to be there during the time my Giants were playing the Diamondbacks, and the owner put the games on both screens right in front of me at the bar.  So nice.  I love the place and can't wait to check out karaoke one night.
