Omg this place was better than my wildest dreams!! I finally got to try bone marrow and damn was it good!! Our server was great, she was knowledgeable and able to make great suggestions, we even had a slight snafu with the food and it was handled beautifully by both the server and the manager (who we didn't ask for but did come over anyway, which is great customer service). I also had the hush puppies which come served over Crows Dairy goat cheese with a tomato  cucumber salad on top. My favorite savory item was the fried chicken skins just a bit sweet and hot, totally amazing, I could eat them all day!! The canned biscuit donut is simply divine! I love it! Was really tempted to order another since I ate it first, before my dinner.
