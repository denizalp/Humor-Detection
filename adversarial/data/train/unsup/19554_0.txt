Anerexic chicken!\n\nSo we've been wanting to come here for ages because of the smoke and the awesome smell it produced. Located on Sahara next to the Chevron gas station, the Plaza has plenty of parking. Interior is a cute cafe style setup with booths and 7 individual tables that seat 2 people. There is a subway style counter top where you pick your sides. Buy it's not about the sides here, it's called Nevada chicken cafe, so it's all about the pollo, right?!\n\nNOPE!!!\n\nIt's all about the sauces. \n\n1. Dry chicken.\n2. SKINNY Chicken\n3. Dry chicken.\n4. Very skinny chicken. \n\nLololol..\n\nFor years and years we thought this would be the spot to beat. So so so disappointed. El pollo Loco has juicier fatter, in fact Popeys  (next door) has healthier chicken than here.  Like I did mention though, the sauces are good. Garlic ranch and the salsa flavors to be exact. Mama Belle and my wife agreed, without them it would be a total loss. \n\nWHY AM I STILL HUNGRY!!!?? \n\nAs for customer service, the staff seems friendly. Saying seems because the only person who spoke to us was the cashier. 2 employees were eating at customer designated tables, which they shouldnt. SMILE PEOPLE!!!! Shoots, at least pretend your happy you have a job! But that is not my business. Pretty clean inside the cafe. The smell is amazing but very VERY deceiving. \n\nOverall, the smell was a lure. It's up to you to make this call. We tried and failed. We're off to get something else to fulfill our snack appetite.
