The wife and I sat at the bar. The bartender (blond hair) was a not very friendly since we didn't order any liquor. Her attitude could have been better. I had a burger and the wife had the small beef tacos. Both were great tasting. The wife asked if the tacos were available with flour and was told No, a better response would have been \" no I am sorry we only offer corn\" ---- maybe she needs more customer service training AND FOR GOD SAKES -Smile
