Um... no, and no.\n\nFor $40 you can definitely get a better buffet elsewhere. We got the discounted price of $28.99 and it was still not worth it.\n\nOysters, dried up. Clams and mussels, sandy. Prime rib, tasteless. Sushi, thrown around. Desserts, sad. '\n\nThis is coming from someone who LOVES buffets. I'm happy at Hometown Buffets. So no and no. Never again.
