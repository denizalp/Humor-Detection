This buffet is located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. The overall ambience is nice and feels upscale. Like most buffets there are a variety of sections such as salad, meat, seafood, and dessert.\n\nI think they prioritized quantity over quality, as most of the food was nothing special. However, the highlights for me were the prime rib and dessert bar. You can ask to get the prime rib grilled, and there is rosemary sauce too.\n\nIt cost $52 per person, before tip, at dinner on a weekend. That's equivalent to 6.5 Chipotle burritos. I would take the 6 burritos over a single buffet entry any day.\n\nFood: 4\/5\nValue: 2\/5
