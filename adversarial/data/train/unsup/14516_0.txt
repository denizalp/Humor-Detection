Ok. so I understand that this is vegas pool party. I've been to several. But the dress code is too retarded. I showed up in a t-shirt and cargo pants. I was first told that the cargo pants would not be allowed since they violated the dress code policy.  I was informed that I needed \"pool shorts\" I went  back to my car to change my shorts. I made my way back to the rehab line but apparently my shorts were STILL not acceptable since they were made out of \"nylon?!? A separate security gaurd was called for a second opinion. This new security gaurd said \"I've let worse in\" but my shorts were still not acceptable. \n\nI went back into the casino, found a shop, and was able to purchase a different pair of shorts....for $60! Keep in mind that I had already pre-purchased my tickets for my girl and i.\n\n Once I got back in line I was told that I could not walk into the pool party because I was holding my original shorts in my hands (wtf!!)...I had folded them up in my hands because I did not want to walk back to my car to leave them!!! Which was not a shirt distance. The security gaurd said I could check the shorts for a fee..I told him to just toss them. He accepted them as a \"donation.\" My girlfriend and I were then finally allowed to go in to the next round of security checks.  My hat and wallet were thoroughly checked for contraband and weapons.  Unfortunately my girlfriend was in possession of her very dangerous pocket makeup mirror  which she could check for a fee or toss...she decided to donate her mirror to the betterment of humanty. . \n\nWe went into the pool party and to our surprise  we saw guys in cargo shorts!!! One guy was actually  dressed in a \"Where's Waldo\" outfit with a Hoodie and sweatpants!!! Other guys were wearing dress shorts!!! Really!!  My crew dropped a good amount of $$ today but I don't think we'll be coming back.
