No bueno. $30 for 2 quesadillas w steak and 2 horchatas. Had to pay for the refill on the large cup which is basically a medium. Hot sauce they have, not the original green and red sauce, but something else had no flavor. Staff was nice and friendly, but could get better quality food for that price at Tacos Mexico! Won't be back.
