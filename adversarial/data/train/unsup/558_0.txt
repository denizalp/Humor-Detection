This 21 and up beach club is a welcome paradise from the chaotic kiddie fest at the MB beach outside. I only wish I had looked at the closing hours so I could have spent more time here!\n\nMy boyfriend and I arrived about 30 minutes from closing time, so when we got to the door, the bouncer told us we had to check with someone else inside to see if they would let us in. The inside bouncer told us that normally they would turn us away, and normally they would have charged my boyfriend to get in, but it was 30 minutes until closing and there were only 4 other people in the club, so they let us in!\n\nI loved the infinity pool, which has jets so if you decide to take your top off, you won't feel completely exposed. There was a cold water dispenser, which is a must if you are out in the hot sun all day drinking alcohol. We had such a fun time until a drunk older couple decided to join us in the infinity pool and make out while floating into our personal space. That being said, the people watching is extraordinary :P
