Need car insurance? Home owners? Renter's?  Other stuff?  Want to work with someone that not only will give you all the deets, but also with a sense of humor?  \n\nHere's a little secret:  insurance is not exactly exciting or fun. So if you can get a quality product AND a good laugh, I'd say your day just got a little better.\n\nI highly recommend Phil Berry as your agent.  Bonus! He has an awesome assistant Sandy! \n\nThey are knowledgeable about the products, answer questions quickly, call you back if you call them and, more often than not, they'll make you laugh.\n\nIf you're sick of the 800 number routine, poor service, or your deflated 2-dimensional agent, give Phil's American Family agency a chance.
