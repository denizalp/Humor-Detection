I normally don't post reviews but felt I should after seeing such negative reviews. My car wouldn't start so I called Progressive roadside assistance and requested a flat bed tow truck. Immediately after hanging up with Progressive I receive a text message and a phone call letting me know that the estimated time for arrival was 60 minutes. Since I had nothing to do I decided to look up this tow company and after reading all the negative reviews I began to worry. I only saw two recent positive reviews so I held on to hope. After about 40 minutes I see on the app that tow truck is on its way. The tow truck shows up in about 15 minutes and manages to jump my car. I decide that I still want it towed because I noticed the check engine light is on. The driver is very friendly and courteous and takes my car and me to the mechanic shop. I would say this was a great experience in a bad situation. I would definitely recommend their services. They made a bad situation better by being on time, providing updates and having a very friendly driver.
