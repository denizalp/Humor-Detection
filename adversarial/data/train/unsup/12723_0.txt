The Pumphouse has incredible ambience as it easily wrests somewhere between theatre and historical site. The beautiful red brick building, acoustics, and large stages enable intimate but feasible setting for plays, shows, and the like.\n\nMy only complaint is the comfortability (or lack thereof) of the seating. The chairs are not conducive to sitting for a three hour show. Most shows include intermissions. I suggest you make good use of said intermission and stretch your legs!!\n\nAlso, the Pumphouse is tucked away off the beaten path meaning that no eateries are in the area. Do not expect to stop at a restaurant before the theatre if you only want to park once. No restaurants are theatre-adjacent.
