After a few more emails back and forth with furniture creations trying to work it over on us by saying  that amazon requested them to give us their return info but we would have to pay to ship it back and they would issue a 20% refund on the table.  So, we would end up paying more for a damaged table then if we were to keep it.  It would cost almost the 20% their offering us as a refund to ship it back.  I DONT THINK SO!!!!  WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT?  So we contacted amazon cause they are receiving every email that is sent back and forth between us and they said that the email sent to us did not reflect what Amazon sent to furniture creations.  Amazon is in the process of refunding us the money since furniture creations wont cooperate with us and they are also removing them from being a seller on the amazon website.  If that doesn't speak volumes about how bad this company is, than I don't know what does.  PLEASE AVOID THIS COMPANY!  DONT LET YOURSELF GET IN OUR SITUATION.
