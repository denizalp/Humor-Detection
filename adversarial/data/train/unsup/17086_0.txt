Synopsis: We tried Z's recently, and wound up walking out and driving down to the Desert Ridge area, where we should have gone in the first place. \n\nWe tried Z's on a whim, because we saw the good reviews. Seating was quick (there was only one other table, and they were mid meal). \nWater was brought (eventually...5-10 minutes later) by a tow-headed boy about 14 years old, with the creepiest awkward grin I've ever seen on a person. (Sorry, dude) ...and we were left to sit.\n10 minutes later, someone came to take our appetizer order, then zoomed off to the kitchen without even asking if we were ready to order our entree, too (we were, since we'd been there 15-20 minutes, and we'd each settled on something in the first 5...). \n10 minutes later, a party of 4 came in and took the table behind us - and \"Z\" came over to chat with them...while our waters were very empty, we still waited for our appetizer to come out, and we waited for someone to take our order.\nWhen the appetizer came out, there were 4 pieces, when the menu said 6. \n\nThis was when we got up, told them why we were leaving, then left. \nWe were there about 45 minutes, and were served 1 glass of water (mostly ice), and 2\/3 of the (overpriced) appetizer we ordered. \nI don't think I've *ever* had such terrible service. Ever. \n\nI wouldn't recommend it, unless you know \"Z\" personally - the table behind us (all old \"republican-y\" looking folks in their 60s) got absolutely *fabulous* service, while we (in our 40s) sat right next to them, completely ignored.
