I played the storied Papago Golf Course for the first time in March. After hearing positive things about the track from family members I was slightly disappointed. \nI appreciate that it is a Municipal course (that has been around since the Eisenhower administration) which in turn keeps the rates very modest but it was a little bit dumpy in my opinion.  The fairways were in pretty bad shape and the facilities were definitely dated. \nThat being said; the greens were in awsome shape and they sold us an entire 12-pack of suds and threw it into a large water bucket w\/ ice.\nFast greens and cold beers managed to salvage an enjoyable round.
