I have put my anger aside. I was kicked out of here on an unfortunate night. Normally I let things roll right off. Happy Dog is a really cool, old school bar. The Elvis lamp is awesome. The pinball machines are worth going for alone. They have Willoughby Peanut Butter Cup Porter which is a great, easy drinking 5.5% ABV dark beverage. And they have that awesome picture of the smiling dog that I love so much hanging up by the staircase to the bathroom!
