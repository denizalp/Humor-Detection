I've been here several times....I don't want to come here but it's so close to where I live. Pretty much every aspect of this place is pathetic and I'm pretty easy to please. The tipping point was how cheap they are with the toppings, it's laughable and now I'll be driving to burrito boyz or if I'm lazy I'll go next door to Falafel world (where they actually know how to run a business and appreciate regular customers). If you go, enjoy your thimble of guacamole!
