Come one, come all to ye Heritage Tavern, where paupers & princes alike dine as kings! You say that the foie gras dish at your local watering hole isn't rich enough for you? Then we will add pork belly & tuna and you will be satisfied, says the Heritage Tavern. You complain that your cocktail only has a dash of bitters? Please come to the Heritage Tavern for a drink composed almost entirely of bitters. \nMore shaved truffles! More candied bacon!! More Wagyu!!! More everything!!!!\nHuzzah to the purveyors at the Heritage Tavern for their wacky refinement & delicious excess!
