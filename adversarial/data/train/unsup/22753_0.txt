The only reason I'm leaving any stars is because I have to.\n\nMy husband and I walked passed this store this past Sunday, as we did, a young lady told me she had a free gift for me, I politely told her no thank you.  She kept trying to get me to take it, I wouldn't.  We finally got away from her but could still here her talking at me.  \n\nIn order to leave, we had to walk back by.  We were walking on the opposite side of her store and she starts in on me again, this time taunting me.  I admit, after I was away from her store and she was still going, I did flip her off, my bad.\n\nI do not go to the mall to have sales people try to get me to buy their products when I'm walking by their kiosk or store, in fact that makes me not want to have anything to do with them.\n\nI took a picture of the store, found them online, emailed them today, only to be told that they are not affiliated with that shop in that mall.  It is the same website that is listed in this Yelp listing and there is the very same image that I took Sunday in this listing.  \n\nThe signature line on their email has their address and phone number mind you.  I then pulled up the mall directory, with the name, directory location, same phone number and same address.  Hmmm....I think someone doesn't want to take responsibility.  I took a picture of the mall directory with the suite number, name, and address, sent that picture and the one of the store name. \n\nStill denies that it's them.
