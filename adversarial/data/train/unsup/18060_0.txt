My friend and I were famished after a day of dragging furniture across the length of my apartment, and something told me that tonight was as good a night as any to finally see what all the fuss was about Banjara. \n\nLuckily we arrived with the famine level of two people who had just emerged from a week camping in rural northern Ontario with nothing to eat but spittle bugs and mint leaves, because the amount of food we ordered was obscene. Three dishes to share ($8 each), naan and rice. The naan was clearly baked only moments before being plated, unlike at some Indian restaurants where it's too aerated\/porous and stale by the time it arrives at the table because it's been sitting around all night.\n\nI also ordered a plate of spicy Chana Masala and I was barely able to make it halfway through it because I was too busy DEVOURING the Paneer Makhani I had also ordered - \"cubes of homemade cottage cheese simmered in tomato and cream sauce\". AMAZING. Good god it was sinful. So good for dipping and rounding up rice. \n\nThe interior decor is velvety and full of crisp white linens. Your water glass will NEVER reach half empty - someone will always be nearby to top it up. I left feeling fully rotund and satisfied. Can't wait to go back!
