How could I be so blind and not notice that this restaurant is in Chandler!!!!! Not until my girlfriend told me about it, I would have driven by this place a million times and Never would have noticed it. \n\nShortly after our arrival, the owner came out of the kitchen to greet almost every single guest who came through the door. Everyone seems to like him and has known him for a while. I've also noticed that he was speaking Italian with the staffs. This is usually a good sign having REAL Italian (1st generation) making Italian food. As I was looking around, I saw sausages and meats that are possibly cured right then & there at the store. They even bake their own bread! They also sell spaghetti sauce and many other Italian seasonings. Just as I was envious of people in Scottsdale having their authentic Italian supermarkets\/restaurants, now it is in my neck of my wood. I feel so proud and happy!!!!!!\n\nFor main entree, I ordered my favorite Italian dish - Meatballs\/sausage and spaghetti with meat sauce. The meatballs are well seasoned\/marinated. Sausages have just the right amount of spiciest to it. It also came two pieces of garlic bread and guess what? It was also homemade!!!!! I also took a bite of my friend's dishes and they were all equally delicious. \n\nI embrace the friendliness of small businesses and how much the owner cares about the customers. Having been to so many chain restaurants, owners have lost touch with their customers and they simply left services on the hand of the servers. Not this restaurant!\n\nI will definitely come back here over and over and over again.
