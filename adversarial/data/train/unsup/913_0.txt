Oh Wicked Spoon, you are so wickedly delicious. \n\nWhy did I decide to stuff myself at Wicked Spoon before hitting the pool? Who knows... but I definitely don't regret any bite of it! \n\nLocated in the gorgeous Cosmopolitan, Wicked Spoon gets my vote on best buffet in Vegas! What sets Wicked Spoon apart is the quality and taste of their food. Not the widest selection offered but everything tasted fresh and gourmet. Yums! \n\nBest dessert section I've ever seen! Gelato! Cakes! Cookies! Scones! The list goes on. \n\nI wish I came for dinner instead of brunch.. that way, I could've stuffed my belly more! If you're looking for a buffet with good food, look no further!
