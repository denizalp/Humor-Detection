I've always received excellent service at this location, and this store is one of my favorite places to browse when I'm in the mall, being the food nerd that I am :). The kitchen selections are great and the outdoor furniture that I've bought from here is still looking good even after 2 years of being exposed to the desert climate and my general negligence haha. The option to have your receipt e-mailed to you is a nice perk, and I sometimes get coupons in the mail with my catalogs. Upgrade a star!
