Never going here and wasting my money, horrible service and treatment from the bouncers and management. \n\nMe and my friend went here around 8 PM on a Friday, it wasn't busy at all so we figured we would get something to eat but the bouncer had to check our ID's, so we gave them to him and he was suspicious saying they were fake and all that, we didn't mind that he was suspicious since that's his job but after he checked them through a card swiper he called management and this guy came as well acting all tough saying we weren't 21+ and that we're dumb for using fake ID's. Being angry we just said we would take our ID's and go somewhere else then and they said no that they would keep our ID's and the only way we would get them back is if the authorities came. The manager said he would call them and after standing around doing nothing we asked are they on their way and he simply said no if we want them we go get them. So not only did he contradict himself and act like a fool, he didn't do what he said he would... So we went and got Glendale Police. \n\nAfter they discussed things the officers talked to us saying the bar can refuse service to whoever and all and it was just a precaution, they gave us our ID's back! We understood but what made me angry is how foolish and aggressive they were behaving for no reason and I don't think they can take our ID's just like that. Didn't realize acting like an ass when we gave them no reason too is part of their job description. Hopefully no one has to deal with what we did but that's my 2 cents and this experience determined my choice of never going back.
