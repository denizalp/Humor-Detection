I've being coming with Mary for the last 6 months for my acne skin problem. I love they way Mary explains and how knowledgeable she is. \n\nLove her products and her suggestions; always trying to get a fresher and  beautiful skin. Consider microdermabrasion and peeling. They removed all my face spots and recover shine on my skin, it took some time but was worth it. \n\nQuite some time with you and don't think going elsewhere. \n\nEvery treatment takes time, the secret is Mary and patience. \n\nI can't wait for my next appointment, I highly recommend her.
