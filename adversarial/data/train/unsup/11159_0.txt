Several of us Yelpers gathered to watch the Cardinals beat the Eagles yesterday (Ok, there were a couple of Eagles fans in the group :-)).  Service was friendly but slow.  It didn't help that the waitress assignments changed for some of our group partway through the game.  The place was packed and everything was stretched to the limit.  Glassware became a problem and for a while beer came in room temperature glasses and mixed drinks were coming in whatever vessel could be found.  From what I saw and tasted of the food it was all OK except for the one salad I saw come out, some of it's components looked like what the rabbit had refused to eat.  I wouldn't drive across town to go there by myself but would if another gathering were to be called.
