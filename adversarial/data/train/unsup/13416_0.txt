At the very least, there must be 200+ days in a year where heat bordering on oppressive is doing a dirty dance with the concrete jungle that is the Vegas Strip, and when that two or three o'clock hour has you wishing you hadn't left the pool - you're going to want ice cream. Good news friend: BLVD Creamery has very good ice cream. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nThere are few locations on the strip that I would ever refer to as being \"cute\" or \"quaint\", but BLVD somehow pulls off a bit of a homely or campy feel even though it's truly massive by ice cream shop standards. Different desserts line the walls and display cases, and abundant seating could really have you seated here for a longer period than you'd intended. \n\nService is fast, friendly, and knowledgeable, and I couldn't have been more pleased with my professional but also comfortable server. Samples can come frequently if you want them, and it's likely that you will given the breadth of flavors and other options. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nAlright... so it's expensive, as in, goodness me that's some pricey ice cream. I opted for two scoops in a cone, and I'll admit I was a bit surprised at how small the scoops were given some of the pictures I'd seen on Yelp. My total? $7.00. $7.00?! As in, the same amount that I'd need to get a tray full of ridiculous food at neighboring Shake Shack? Yes, Vegas is expensive, and the strip even moreso, but I'm having some real difficulty justifying a $7.00 price tag for two moderate scoops of ice cream in a cone. Time to look back on other reviews and compare that...\n\n...\n\nhmmm... alrighty then, you get away with it this time BLVD. Comparable portions in LA and NYC come out between $7.25 and $8.00 for Davey's and Sweet Rose, so maybe $7.00 in Vegas really isn't that unreasonable? Fair enough. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nOpting for S'mores and Cookies n' Cream, I had high expectations given I was combo'ing arguably my favorite classic and contemporary flavors, and while I certainly wasn't let down, this wasn't the best ice cream I've ever had. The S'mores went pretty light on the graham cracker and frankly just tasted like chocolate ice cream with marshmallows, and while I absolutely loved the fact that the cookies n' cream had cookie dough in it as well as the classic oreos, the flavor wasn't up to the sky high standard that places like Salt & Straw (Portland) and Davey's (New York) have set. Good, but not what I would call elite. Single Star Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nIt's the best ice cream in town, so how could I possibly say no here? BLVD deserves four stars. Star Granted.
