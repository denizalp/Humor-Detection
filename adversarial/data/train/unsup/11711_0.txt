Came here for a wedding after party this weekend.\nIt's kind of a western bar,which is not my sort of thing,but I was there to support the grooms :)\nThis place is located in a business park behind Deja Vu adult store.\nI will do as much justice as one possibly can as a \"non-gay bar patronizing straight girl.\"\nI didn't drink since I had to be a DD, nor did I eat (not sure what they serve there.)\nI know one main wome'ns room was OOS, but I heard there was a backup (didn't need to use.)\nI believe there is a cover, but I was not charged.\nThey have drink specials, like spend $15, get $25 worth, though not sure how often that's run.\nWhen I checked in through yelp There was a bogo special.\nWith the wedding party, we had an area reserved, so the fact that you CAN reserve areas is cool. There is also a big dance area\/stage for bands and events (which I typically don't see in bars) that had a gameshow going on hosted by awesome, beautiful drag queens. :D\nI had a pretty good time.\nStep outside your comfort zone :)
