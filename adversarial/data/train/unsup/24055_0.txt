Man, people are picky with the prices! I don't know what day you all went, but I went midweek and scored some good deals.\n\nI got a like new computer chair for $20 and a small file cabinet with no dings in it for $10. I also purchased some smaller items for my bathrooms ranging from 99 cents to $3. All in all, I came away with some great stuff. \n\nThe showroom is very clean and spacious. There isn't a lot in there, but I am not looking to furnish my whole home at this time; just a few odd and ends needed.\n\nThe prices are comparable if not the similar to other used furniture stores in the Glendale\/Peoria\/Phoenix area.
