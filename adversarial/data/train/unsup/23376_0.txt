The relay went out on our heater, so we called Parker & Sons. After the Tech came and looked at the unit he told us the relay went out and said he would have to order one because he didn't have any with him at a cost of about $300.00. When he returned the next day to install it the price was now $720.00. We said fine just install it. We were tired of the problem and just wanted it fixed, plus we needed heat. One week later the heat went out again, we called the Tech back out . This time he said we had a leak in the line that for some reason just happened after he worked on it. This time it is going to be $1100.00 to fix. We have now paid $1820.00 for something they originally said would cost $300.00. I will never use Parker & Sons again. They say they will never send a Melvin to your house. But trust me, they sent one to mine.
