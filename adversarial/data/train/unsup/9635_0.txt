RUN TO COX its down the street.\n\ncentury link is dishonest and will cheat and lie to you. \n\nwent into the store to grab the 30 dollar promotion only to find out that it is actually 35 unless your sign up for auto pay when you signed up for the account.... with out ever seeing the bill. \n\nGOOD THING I DID NOT DO AUTOPAY!  my bill came out to be 162 when i only purchased 30 dollar internet. \n\nafter many calls and store visits i resolved this issue (i thought i did) by canceling service and with the 30 day guarantee i should not have to pay anything. 2 months later (not sure why it takes so long) i get the new revised bill with all my credits. and i see that i have a 17 dollar charge.. for a phone line which i never signed up for... \n\nJustina helped me and i suggest not talking to her. she doesn't know what modems are or how they work\nadditionally other employees are not allowed to help you unless you signed up through them so whats the point of having more than one employee if they are not allowed to help the customer. \n\ncentury link is slow, poor customer service and worst of all they lie and cheat the customer and billing is a nightmare, not to mention they offer gigabit internet but know nothing about it because it doesn't need a modem.\n\ni switched back to cox, its a little more expensive but i got the internet installed the next day and accurate billing with no taxes with in a week.
