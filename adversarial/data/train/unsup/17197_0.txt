Average sushi. The sashimi was watery which I suspect that it was not fresh but frozen. Their sushi and Cooked options were pretty good. Their renovation and upgrade of using iPad to order is no different than most sushi restaurants anyways. \n\nNot worth ayce when there are better sushi and non-frozen sashimi out there.
