Chipotle is one of those places that you can go for consistently good food.  It's fast food Mexican food, and you can watch as your food is being made.  I always get a rice bowl because you can fit so much more in a bowl than a tortilla (if you really want the tortilla, then you can always ask for it on the side).  The cilantro lime rice is delicious, especially with the hint of lime.  I'm a huge fan of the steak - it's quite tender and cooked medium rare \/ medium.  Chicken is also a good bet, as it is quite flavorful.  Whatever you get, it'll be delicious.  One caveat is that sometimes the line gets long, but that's what you get for coming to one of the most popular fast food places on campus.
