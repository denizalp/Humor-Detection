WOW!!! I see why this is the highest rated restaurant in 85260!!  I am super picky about pizza. I had Bianco, Grimaldis, pomo and on. None compare to this. MOST of those places that make brick oven pizza are too thin, the sauce bleeds thru in minutes and does not reheat well. This place has the best pizza of this kind I have had.  Not thin in the middle, amazing quality cheese!  Also got the meatball appetizer. 3 meatballs with marinana sauce, easily the best meatballs I have ever had. Not over seasoned or weird tasting.
