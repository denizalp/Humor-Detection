My first impression was, \"A hidden find off the strip.\"\n\nYou wouldn't be able to tell from the outside all the goods this little restaurant has to offer on the inside. They have a cute little patio where you enter, and inside the ambiance is cool, mellow, and has a lounge\/bar area. Little did we realize we were ordering plate after plate of Spanish tapas. The prices were very reasonable and the portions were typical of tapas entrees. We tried several, however, one thing that I crave and would definitely go back for were their stuffed dates. They were absolutely amazing. These little dates are wrapped in bacon, stuffed with smoked almonds and blue cheese, and all grilled under red wine. Sounds irresistible right? You'll see why yelpers rage about these little delectable bites. If you're planning on trying something off the tourist list while visiting Las Vegas, this is one you must try!\n\nThe lasting impression? \"Great place for small bites with a side of wine or a series of mini plates for a creative meal.\"
