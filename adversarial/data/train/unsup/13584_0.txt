I visited Homewood Cemetery the weekend before last to take a walk with a good friend.  Since I'd been to Schenley and Frick Parks that week, I was looking for a change of pace, and the idea of checking out this cemetery occurred to me.  My friend fortunately wasn't creeped out by the idea, so we headed over to check it out.\n\nHomewood Cemetery is surprisingly large, and is also hillier than one might expect.  I believe it connects to Frick Park via a path on the far side, but we just drove over and parked in the lot on the near side.  It also has a nice little chapel, though we didn't go inside on this visit.  Finally, as one might expect, it has a variety of gravestones.  One of my favorite sections was a group of gravestones engraved in Chinese.\n\nOn the day of our walk, the weather couldn't have been nicer.  We strolled along the winding paths among the gravestones, taking in the sights while talking.  Some of the more interesting ones included a pond with koi and some wild turkeys that broke the peace by gobbling loudly, startling us.  I've seen deer in a cemetery before, but these turkeys definitely took the cake for unexpected sights!\n\nWhile this is a lovely cemetery and certainly one of PGH's best, I prefer Allegheny Cemetery because it contains more large monuments and the graves of some famous denizens of PGH.  Having said that, Homewood Cemetery is a great place to escape the city for a bit and go for a walk, esp. if you're looking for something a bit different than the usual parks.  Just don't be startled when a wild turkey gobbles at you from behind a gravestone!  4.5 stars.
