Ahhh, what a great place! I stopped by here in mid-May with my cousin and I would come in here all the time if I lived in Pittsburgh. The owners were incredibly nice and you could tell that this is good old-fashioned family owned business. The pizza was mouth-watering and I really loved my veal parm sub. I would highly recommend this place and I hope I can stop in again someday!
