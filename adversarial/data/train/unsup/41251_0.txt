Great feature of the Bellagio.  Its a huge water feature in front of the hotel.  There's multiple areas where you can watch it.  Busually before 8pm it goes off every 30 min, after 8pm it goes off every 15 min.  The shows depending on the song is about 2-4 min long.  They play a whole slew of different songs from oldies, to classical to pop.  Its beautiful to see the waters shooting with the beat of the songs.  I do wish that there were different colored lights instead of everything just being white.  But its a grand sight to see.
