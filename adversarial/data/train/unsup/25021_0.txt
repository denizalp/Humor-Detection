This is my second time here. I moved to Vegas about 8 months ago and have been to at least 1\/2 dozen salons. I almost gave up on having my nails done the way they were done in California. John, owner, did my nails here first time. And it was the first time in Vegas that my nails not only looked good, but lasted too. Today, I had a different technician, and he was awesome! Confident and knowledgeable. The decor of this salon is also nice. I'll be back here again! Thank you!
