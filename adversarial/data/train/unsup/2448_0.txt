I always say Las Vegas locals are so spoiled and lazy when it comes to good eats - there's always multiple locations of something in Downtown, on the Strip, in Henderson, on the Westside. Well call me spoiled, because I was so happy to see I wouldn't have to make the trek to Downtown to enjoy JinJu Chocolate. This location has the same tasty treats coupled with their helpful service staff. My go-to items are the matcha green tea chocolate bars, the pecan clusters, and sea salt caramels. My husband is a big fan of their unique cake flavors and browkies (brownie\/cookies). They do have rotating daily deals and gift sets if you're looking for something special. I can easily spend $20+ here, so if you're like me, get a stamp card.
