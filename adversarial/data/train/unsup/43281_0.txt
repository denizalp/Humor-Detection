Amazing!! Very well worth the wait. Make sure to make a reservation for anything you would like to order at least a day in advance because, most likely, it will be sold out. We got the cranberry tarts, raisin rolls, croissants, and of course, the Kuign Amann. All were amazing, some of the best pastries I have ever had!! The people are also very friendly as well, nice and attentive and don't be afraid to ask for something!!
