Had a business trip in AZ. a couples months back, ran into the mall to grab some clothes cause the airport lost my Luggage and i saw this sugar daddy cupcake store.. Im not going to lie.. These sugardaddy bakers at sugardaddy cupcakes, know how to make a cupcake!! Never had such an amazing pastry in my life!! I travel the country and see quite a few places that sell cupcakes and have tried a lot of them. \n\nSprinkles (a.k.a. Chew toys for dog) has nothing on Sugardaddy cupcakes. Just goes to show you, Oprah and Streisand have no taste and should just sit down and shut up!
