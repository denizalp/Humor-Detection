Sometimes you want to go to a unassuming neighborhood bar that is sort've like Cheers. Obvious there are regulars here, but you won't feel unwelcomed being a stranger. \n\nThere's graveyard food specials starting at 11pm for $5.99.  We got wings and fries. If you like really crispy wings you probably will like this place. I really liked the fries though since despite being steak fries, it has a really crispy exterior. Original stromboli has mozzarella, ham and pepperoni and is actually pretty damn good. It's pretty stuffed with fillings. I know a lot of people are about this other famous bar stromboli but I like this better since it's not as doughy and has sauce on the side. Yes, I would order these items again. \n\nBartenders here are friendly. A off the clock one chatted us up at the bar and Mario is a lovable asshat. He's my favorite. \n\nIf drinking and food aint enough, you can play pool, darts, A Golden Tee game and they have karaoke on Fridays. Our group played darts and listened to people kareoke-ing. Thankfully it was pretty good and not painfully bad singers this night. Hopefully they're regulars. \n\nIf you want a fun, low-key night out that isn't going to cost you a crazy amount, I say this is a good place to consider.
