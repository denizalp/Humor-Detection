SUUPER CUTE! And the coffee is excellent! I visited Braistas for the first time this morning with my mom. I ordered the \"All Day\" protein\/ coffee smoothie (Wow) and my mom ordered an iced caramel macchiato +the $2 green tea. Everything was phenomenal and the owner Aaron was super friendly and personable. The outside seating area has two tables and about 4 chairs per table. The menu is packed with variety and they offer a $1 off\/ item when you check in on yelp. AND he gave me a punch card. I'll definitely be stopping back here soon since it's right down the street from me. I've been looking for good coffee in Glendale and we finally have it! You definitely have to check out Braistas if you're in the mood for coffee and a quick bite!
