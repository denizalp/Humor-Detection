What can i say...I love this restaurant so much! Another birthday meal! The shrimp taquitos(14.50) are so delicious, I dream about them, heaven in my mouth.\nAnd, I love the habenero salsa that comes with the complimentary chips, its not as hot as you would think.\n\nBe sure to check in on yelp and receive a complimentary order of Chef Pacos famous Flan! And he even comes out to deliver to your table in person.\n\nMy friend ordered the chicken taquitos(7$) that were on the Happy Hour menu(4pm-6pm), and he said they were most delicious.\n\nAnd thank you 'Jesse' our bartender who was very attentive and friendly.\n\nHighly recommend as always.
