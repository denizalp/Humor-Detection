Ohhh my goodness!! Talk about a rollercoast treatment for you body! I wish I was good a remembering names because I would recommend the woman that work my body to death (in a good way)! I mainly went in because my shoulders were really tight, but decided to do a full body, 60 min massage. Her basic massage technique was good, she got the job done... But the excitement came when she jumped on my back with her knees on both sides of my spine and did a knee kneading technique i've never experienced before. Good thing she was small, and I'm a bigger guy, cause If i was sensitive to weight on my back, I would have told her to not do it. It was exciting, lots of bed rocking, lol! Anyway... I wanna go back just for my feet sometime.
