I love restaurants that take you away to a different food realm of fusion, Jatoba is exactly that with a twist on traditional Japanese dishes. Get seated in the indoor garden if you can- to really acquire the true dining experience. Unfortunately, it's fairly difficult to reserve a spot in the garden but our book club members were still content to be dining inside. \n\nI love the decor, elegant and sleek. There was so much to choose from on the menu. We decided to go with the tasting menu as suggested by some of the other yelp reviews. For the tasting menu -the items are selected by the chef so you have no idea what you're getting. It came out to around 56$ per person without tax and we sampled 6-7 items which was phenomenal considering the prices are steep for dishes alone. The menu included seasoned baked Brussel sprout leaves, smoked eel papaya mango salad, shrimp dim sum, wild salmon sashimi, a mushroom dish (I can't remember what it was called), sushi spread, sea bass, duck confit with fried rice (the only low point as not standing out as a creative dish). Since I didn't have a copy of the menu I don't have the exact names of the dishes-sorry :\/\n\nThe price of your meal will spike up if you buy cocktails or alcoholic beverages as they average around 16$ each. So I don't think I have to mention with 2 cocktails and the tasting menu -you're looking at an easy 100$+, but so worth it!
