Great location. Seems clean on the inside, but the employees are quite senseless. Half of them look like they just got done smoking a joint or taking a nap.. Careless to make a decent sandwich which, is every time I come in. So I have to say, today was my last visit. My sandwich was a joke and falling apart. I'd rather take the 10 min drive to port of subs
