My first visit here was to join the player's club (Can Club). What a clever name, what a great new sign-up bonus deal! New players can receive up to $200 back in slot play for losses up to $200. This is paid in 2 emails, the first a week later, the second a week after that. You then have 7 days to use the free play.\n\nI wanted to play at a bar since I'm not a big fan of the floor gaming areas. The Victory Bar has gaming and food, and wasn't busy when I showed up. Their beer selection is terrible by my standards. They do have Goose Island, which isn't comped for players. Say what? \nI had a Blue Moon draft instead. I also ordered chicken fingers, which at $7.99 were pretty good. They don't have happy hour. I assumed they did, which may explain why the bar was deserted. More players showed up after I was there a while. I found out they do have $1.50 PBR drafts, whoo hoo (sarcasm). Food orders are taken by a cocktail server, not the bartender. My second beverage was a Sam Adams bottle. I wasn't offered a 2nd beverage by the first bartender, it was another one who offered me the second. \n\nThe gift shop is a cozy little place, and I found a small gift item for 60% off. They have LV themed merch and the usual snacks & drinks. A recent remodel of the casino left the place looking fine enough, but I wasn't impressed enough to come back, unless a great promo presents itself again.
