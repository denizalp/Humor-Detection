my review is not gonna thrill you, but i hope to add a little assurance to any hint of doubt you may have of this place. \n\nyes, yes, yes. the gnocchi is legen-wait for it-dary. while some may find it's supreme softness (like a potato pillow, if you will) slightly off-putting--know this. i married into an italian family. one which grew up on real italian food. one which has visited their homeland quite a few times and been to numerous restaurants that serve \"authentic\" gnocchi. this is the real deal, and this is how it's s'posed to be. can you dig?! anyhoo, if you are lucky enough to get the gnocchi they make with butternut squash--do it! it's outstanding. oh yeah, and it has pancetta. which is like bacon. which is like food from the gods. \n\nthey have another special that my husband dreams about. it's the pistachio (?) encrusted lamb chops. or something like that. i had a nibble, and it's pretty much cooked to perfection. \n\ni love the coziness of the place, and i love how they change it up and make you practically swoon all week waiting for tuesday. if you get on their email list too, you get the scoop on what's going on at the restaurant as far as special menu and even gnocchi-making classes. seriously, how could you go wrong here?
