Great place.  Prices are the same or lower than other Marine dealers.  Fast service.  You can call one day and they usually have the part the next day if it isn't in stock..  Worked on my boat twice.  Big improvement over the prior occupants of the building.  Lots of good experience in the mechanic\/owners.
