What a really, really cool concept! I had only mildly been exposed to custard before, and had Italian Ice waaaaay back when I was just a little girl. But to put the two together! Oh, yes! The custard was so creamy, and I even had the LIght Vanilla! The passionfruit ice was great, and I also sampled the Mint Chip Cream Ice. I love this concept and will definitely come back.
