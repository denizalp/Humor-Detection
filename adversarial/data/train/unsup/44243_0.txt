Mediocre food. Not that impressive considering the price is jacked up for Friday and Saturday .  18 percent gratuity for a party of 8 or more mandatory. Why? If we had 2 tables then we could tip what we wanted. Seriously a $50.39 gratuity for a buffet to clean table of plates ? In fact table had empty plates for awhile. I would expect my dirty plate to be gone by the time I returned. I would not recommend this buffet as the price is too high for the low quality.
