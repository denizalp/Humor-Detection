What a cute place! Came here with the family and overall everyone was pleased. Kids loved their chicken nuggets and fries. Their Dad loves the grilled cheese he had (which was on a sweet pear cinnamon bread) and my tacos were pretty good. I wish there was more cheese and sauce on my tacos however. I was hoping to try the Bata Bing flatbread however but it was not on the menu. But overall this place was great.
