The deluxe was a very nice steakburger, even if it had too much lettuce. The Wisconsin pub burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had. It's cheeses and seasonings produced this salty, garlic flavor that I've never tasted in a burger before. It was phenomenal!\nThe crinkle fries were crispy and delicious, and the onion rings were well battered and fried. Further, the cheese curds had a fantastic, crunchy batter that was well spiced. \nFinally, the root beer (caffeine-free, I had the diet) was delicious, sweet and smooth :)
