Do not be surprised if a taxi does not show up and you have to call again. What happens is that the dispatcher would radio your location, but not many drivers answer radio calls. And then when you again the dispatcher would make up some lame excuse. \nin general, you will always come in contact with your rude\/ignorant drivers or pleasant\/social drivers. If you think about it... It's just like sales. \nUpside... They take credit cards. \nIf you're planning on working with this company... I wouldn't recommend it. If you can book $300+ a day... Then maybe you might fit in. working here is way too competitive
