Ok blowout,  lasted th evening pretty we'll, but stylist used a metal brush which will fry hair if you get regular blowouts. A true blowout specialist will use boar bristle and possibly finish a bit with ceramic or metal. She said that is all they are \"allowed to use\" and all staff has to use same. Also felt a little creepy about the constant canned overly enthusiastic greetings and comments from staff- energy in ther a bit tense too. Not sure if owner is like super controlling or what's going on- staff seemed almost scared.
