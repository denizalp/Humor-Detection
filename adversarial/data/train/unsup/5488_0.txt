Very cool place to sit at the bar and grab a few drinks.  All of the bartenders I've met have been great to chat with, and it seems like there are always a few regulars at the bar when I stop by.  The last time I was there my buddy and I sat at the bar and were immediately given vodka gummi bears for a going away party.  Don't mind if I do!  When you sit at the bar there is no reason for you to not feel welcome here.\n\nDrink prices are very reasonable.  For three rounds of drinks for two people, our bill came out to $21.  Not sure if it's always available, but they had $3 bottles of Lagunitas Lil Sumpin and $3 of Rogue on special.  If drinking isn't enough to keep you entertained, there's a jukebox, pool table, electronic dart board, and Deer Hunter.\n\nCheap drinks, good hospitality and games make this an easy choice to either start or end your night.  If your bartender is Mario, tell him T-Bone and Carl sent you.  It won't get you anything special, but he'll know who sent you.
