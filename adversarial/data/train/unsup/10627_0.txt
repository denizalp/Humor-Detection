Yes, I went. Yes, I brought my baby brother. Yes, we both had a blast. \n\nThe choreography is (for the most part) pretty awful, but lets be honest, that's not what you're there for. And, it's nice to see that the choreographer who used to do all of the work for *NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys was able to find work when that sort of thing was no longer relevant. \n\nBut oh lord. The men were gorgeous, and the show was a lot of fun. My brother learned a lot of important lessons that he plans on applying to future relationships. Such as: the proper way to take off an undershirt, the proper way to gyrate on a bed, and how to swoosh the shit out of a cloak. \n\nWe didn't stay for the Flirt lounge interaction...but I'm sure it was lovely.
