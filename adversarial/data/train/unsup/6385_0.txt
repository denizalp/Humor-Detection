I've been to many other Cities (L.A, san Francisco, Sacramento, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Tucson) And I Love Phoenix Out of al of them. From the First Class Shopping, to the Desert Scenery. It's a Ahh Inspiring City. Its not as dirty as many other major cities, and the crime has gone down so Much. its not even on the top 100 list of dangerous cities. And the people are so nice, i go on hikes and bike rides around the city and (Im not exaggerating) Every person I pass says good morning. My only con is the traffic! Around rush Hour OMG! Its Busy. But other from that I love it here!
