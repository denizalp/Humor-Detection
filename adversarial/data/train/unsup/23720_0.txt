I found this to be a very convenient and pleasant place to stay in Vegas. Now, I'm no Vegas pro; I've only been a handful of times, and both other times I stayed in some of the cheaper, older casino hotels on the strip, which were not exactly pleasant. I was a little wary of staying off strip, but it turned out to be waaay more convenient. Since the casinos are so far apart as it is, staying 1 mile off doesn't make much difference at all. This was easy walking distance to the Wynn and the Venetian, the two places I needed to get to. We also drove from the hotel to the Venetian a few times and it took less than 5 minutes, the parking was free, and not once did we have to deal with the traffic of Las Vegas Blvd. \n\nWe got a 2 bedroom suite at a reasonable price. The room was clean and comfortable and included a full kitchen and very soft pillows. There was also complimentary breakfast downstairs in the mornings. If the strip isn't your thing, there are also a lot of chain restaurants and such in the immediate vicinity. For once I *gasp* did not bring my computer, so I can't comment on the internet situation. I had never stayed at a Residence Inn before, but after this experience I would certainly come again.
