On my way to work one day I had decided to detour myself around the Parkway East traffic.  I had also decided to do something nice for my coworkers.  That's how I ended up here at Pink Box Bakery Cafe.  I had done a quick search for a bakery to bring in a treat for everyone.\n\nThis place isn't hard to find in Squirrel Hill.  I mean it is a bright pink storefront.  If you can miss that, I guess you don't deserve to come here.  It is always nice walking into a bakery.  All those sweet smells that instantly make your stomach grumble in anticipation.  There are plenty of pre-made treats to be had in here, but I went straight to the cake display case and knew that all those cupcakes were coming with me.  ALL THE CUPCAKES!  (If you happened to be there that day, I apologize...somewhat, for taking all the cupcakes (but deep down inside, no, I'm not sorry))\n\nIt seemed a bit pricey at the time for the cupcakes, but once my coworkers and I took our first bites, they were worth every penny.  Half were white with white icing and candy shavings on them.  The other half were chocolate with chocolate icing and chocolate shavings on them.  Both topped with a half of a sandwich cookie.  Everyone raved over how good they were and that they weren't too sweet.  And this is what floored me, no one had any idea that Pink Box existed.  I had to keep telling them where it was.  I am sure now that they know where it is as they all seem to be under some kind of trance from the sugary goodness.
