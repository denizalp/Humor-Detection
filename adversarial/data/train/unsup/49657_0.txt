Looked for a place for breakfast and it was about a 10 minute walk from our hotel.  I had the \"Slut\" and my wife had the bacon sandwich.  The Slut was incredible, and with the baguettes it came with, was actually a nice little breakfast.  The bacon sandwich was also great.  The wait was about 10 minutes at about 8 am and the line moved pretty fast.  Everyone there seemed to really enjoy their breakfast...we'll be back tomorrow.
