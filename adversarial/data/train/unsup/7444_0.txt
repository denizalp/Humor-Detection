The girls working there are pretty annoying. They yell at each other and act as if they're in high school (they probably are). The \"customer service\" is non existent.  They act as if helping the customer is the most annoying thing in the world because it dares to cut into their gossiping time. Besides that, it's a fine store, what you'd expect;  stupid loud music, super cheap clothes that are quite cute actually, but probably made by 10 yr olds.
