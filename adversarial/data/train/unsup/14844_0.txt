OMG!!  This place is ridiculous in an awesome way!  \n\nWalking in, your first thought is \"wow, it is absolutely gorgeous inside!\"  Then you see the display of treats and you think, \"wow, I am about to indulge in a ton of delicious goodness!\"\n\nAnd they have taro boba smoothies, a favorite of mine!  \n\nOverall, the menu looks outstanding... and I had the pleasure of trying a handful of items from the display.  Each one was better than the last!\n\nAnd that taro smoothie with boba... one of the best I have ever had!  Love this place and will return whenever I come to town!\n\n*****FIVE STARS*****
