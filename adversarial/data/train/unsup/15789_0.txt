Buttery delicious hot chewy bagels, amazing sense of hot-off-the-fire history, funny friendly service (not like \"can I take your order madam\" friendly, but more like \"hey, sup. jokesjokesjokes\"). This place is a brightly-lit beacon in the dead of night, and wrapping your hands around a bagel right out of the fire-breathing oven at 3am in the dead of winter is true Montreal experience - only for the hearty and hale. Don't waste your time at the St Viateur cafes (these are fine, they are just beside the point.) Don't wait two days to eat your bagels back home then complain that they are stale. Just grab a half dozen of whatever is hot, get some cream cheese and go for a walk - and be thankful that your life contains such sweetness. ;)
