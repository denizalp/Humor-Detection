I came here with my family on a Friday night to celebrate my grandma's birthday.  We ordered a set meal for a party of 13 (and you have to order the set meal in advance so they can prepare).\n\nThe restaurant was accommodating because my family doesn't eat pork.  We had the \"pin pei\" duck as a starter and some of the notable dishes we had was the maggi lobster.  \n\nOverall, the food quality here is good. If I was to compare I feel like the food they make here is a tad above the average for Chinese food in the area.
