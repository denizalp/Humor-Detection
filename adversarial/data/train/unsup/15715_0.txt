NEVER GO THERE! I don't understand who can give 4 stars to this food. It's terrible. Service is horrible in all ways... Food is not fresh (slightly saying). Cashews, chicken and egg rolls tasted like they were stored for 6 months. More over, every meal is prepped with the same gravy, no matter if it was teriyaki or Brown gravy you ordered. Plus meats obviously weren't seasoned before cooking , just during cooking, it was tasteless. Plus for those money you can eat perfect meals at for e.g. \" House of Hukan\" in Fairlawn.
