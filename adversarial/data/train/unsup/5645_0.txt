Everything wrong with consumerism all in one place. It's four floors of M&M merchandise. FOUR FLOORS. You can watch a movie about the candy, you can get your picture taken with the candy, you can try samples of the candy, you can buy it in any color, and you can literally never run out of option to decorate your life with the candy. It's insane. I felt like it was one of those things people say you have to see in Las Vegas, but I feel my time could have been better spent somewhere else, far away from children and middle-aged women in fanny packs.
