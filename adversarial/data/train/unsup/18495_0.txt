This place is \"A-OK\" as the 3 star rating indicates.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it's a better alternative than, say, gnawing my own arm off.\n\nThe shoestring fries would be very tasty, but they were so covered in salt that I couldn't eat more than a couple.  It must've been a heavy-handed day in the kitchen based on everyone's otherwise rave reviews.\n\nI had chicken fingers and they were tasty.  The breading was good and they were cooked well.  The ranch was runny, but yummy.\n\nIt's expensive for what you get, but not highway robbery.  Also, the woman at the counter needs to relax a bit.  Honey, you're not running a Fortune 500 company.  It's the Chicken Shack.  Take a chill pill sister.
