This is a great property to stay at.  It's centrally located right next to the interstate.  The rooms are very modern and clean, a pleasure to be in.\n\nThe hotel area is somewhat seperate from the casino area, so you don't have to walk through the casino to get to your hotel room.\n\nWill be staying here again when in the Phoenix area for business!
