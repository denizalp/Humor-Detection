Go! Just... GO!!! This is one of the better shows in Vegas, and for good reason! The energy is running high, the performers are extremely talented, and the entire spectacle from beginning to end is non-stop entertainment. From crazy acrobatics, to classic MJ moves perfected, and everything in between, this is really a well-done act made possible by the creators of Cirque de Soleil. I wanted to jump out of my seat and start dancing on several occasions, I almost couldn't contain myself! The premium seating allows for the best experience--some performers really get up close and personal! However, the stadium isn't too, too big, so I don't think there's really a bad seat in the house. Even if you aren't an avid MJ fan, you'll most likely appreciate this performance as much as I did!
