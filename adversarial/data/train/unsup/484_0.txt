Love this little theater! Great shows great people great location! My boyfriend has starred in a few shows and they have all been amazing. If you love the performing arts, love China Town,  and love being away from the strip, this is the place for you. \n\nI love how close you can get to the stage! You can see EVERYTHING. Haha.(the first show I saw had male nudity so, you can only imagine)
