This place was a hot mess tonight. The food is a 3, but the service today was a 1. Our waitress was friendly and took our order quickly then we never saw her or anyone else for that matter. Our water never got refilled and our beer glasses sat there empty on the table. Our daughter's food was  brought out alone and then we saw that our food was ready but nobody could be bothered to bring it out until my daughter was almost done with her dinner.  To top it off, my husband was extremely disappointed in the green chile mac and cheese that was flavorless and had only about four tiny little pieces of bacon. We finally tracked down a different waitress  for our check because ours was busy chit chatting with a nearby table and had to sit there waiting again, couldn't wait to leave.
