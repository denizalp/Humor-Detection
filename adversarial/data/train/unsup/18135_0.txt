Good if you like a metal fastener in your pizza without a legitimate apology.  We ordered a large pizza and in one of the bites came across the small metal ring.  We called, got a lame apology along with a statement that it didn't come from their restaurant.  We were told to email a picture, which we did.  They apparently don't have Internet and the manager told us he would look at photo at home and call the next day.  That was almost a week ago, guess they aren't into making things right by the customer.
