Best gyros around, great salads, this location has really friendly staff. It's a big convenience that they have a fast drive through. This makes it a great alternative to the nasty McDonalds- type fast food chains. Prices are low, wide variety of food. Totally recommended if you want the convenience of fast food but a great selection of unique dishes for about the same price of a conventional burger joint.
