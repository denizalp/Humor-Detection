Piercing is serious business Jerry T. piercing guns are barbaric and hurt crazy bad compared to a needle. lol.  yes pin cushion needs an open mind that if you want to take the gun its your right. but also consider the fact you are going to a piercing place. i don't think a respectable piercer would use a gun, just on the basis its violent, and holy shit it hurts.\nto argue with him as why they dont almost begs for the elitist response you got. so take some responsibility for the exchange. \n\nMegan D. I'm glad your a physician, but lets face it. 99% of the customers are not. and it's the stores policy. so regardless you lose.\n\non to the review.\n\n\nOK...so I'm new to Yelping or this would have been done along time ago.\nHalo is the best place to get pierced, they are no nonsense and take the shit serious. they are professional. this is not a tattoo shop piercing. \n\n95% of my piercings and stretching were done at Halo; both ears at 10g and the following stretchings till 7\/16s when i stopped, the stretchings of my septum (8g) and lebret (10g), my tongue and the following stretchings of it (8g). always top notch service. ALWAYS. Glenn and Kelsey are the best. I'm not sure on the new staff its been awhile since i have been there for service. but the new staff have been adequate for my questions. I'm not a noob. so i don't need to be reminded to not lean on the glass. lol.\n\ntop notch jewelery. being sterile is super important, that's why they put the gloves on. when you buy jewelery its already sterile. it would be time consuming if they did it in the opposite order. waiting for the autoclave to sterilize your jewelery you just purchased. lol get real. that would suck.\n\n\n\nLove ya!! thanks for always a great experiance.
