The hubby took me here with a few of our friends. It was so much more then what I expected. I mean they have such a wide variety of classic arcade games it will bring you down memory lane.  \n\nIf your out with friends or on a date night this place is well worth checking out. It's a large space with the games all lined up next to each-other. Not to mention the 25cent popcorn machine I honestly thought it would be stale but it's surprising good. \n\nIf your looking for a fun night and want to do something completely random the Pinball Hall of Fame won't disappoint you!
