This was a great find thanks to the other wonderful Yelp reviews!\nThe service we received was astounding. The server was very friendly, prompt and was extremely efficient. He had answers to all of our questions and had great suggestions on different menu items to try. The wife and I were both very pleased with both of our dishes and would easily rate them top 2 of any Chinese style restaurant food we've ever had. She had the Hong Kong Chow Mein, I had the Orange Peel Beef, both had wonderful flavor and the meat was very tender. The Chow Mein sauce was thick and flavorful, vegetables were cooked perfectly. The Orange beef had a great flavor with not too much orange. \nThey had some lunch specials so that was nice on the wallet. Typical plate pricing was around $18, lunch specials were 12ish making this place a great spot to stop. Definitely keeping this place as a 'go-to' next time we're in town and can't decide where to eat!
