I have read so many rave reviews on the veggie burger I passed up the French Dip and gave it a go. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Was it an off day? The patty was covered in a sweet soy sauce that overpowered the burger. It was so sweet in fact I sent it back (I hate doing that). The new burger she brought (minus said sauce) was not impressive either. There was a serious consistency issue, it crumbled with every bite. A good veggie burger should stay formed while eating.. Another drawback is that it is 12 bucks, way to pricey for what you get. I'll happily pay 16 for the French Dip, it's well worth it.\n\nOur server was excellent and all the other options I have tried there have been great earning 4 stars. Word to the wise, if you like syrupy veggie patties that fall apart go with the veggie burger, otherwise be a carnivore and destroy the French Dip. Like I wish I would have today.
