It was quite a relief to find out that my favorite menuderia had not disappeared, but rather just moved to another location. The menudo rojo is still the best I've had in the Valley and for that alone the drive to this newer location is worth it. I also tried their pastor and asada tacos - quite decent, and more generously filled than those in most taquerias. The service is friendly and the restaurant itself is roomier than it was in its previous incarnation. Also, parking is not an issue, unlike in its previous location along McDowell.
