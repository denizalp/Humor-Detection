I normally absolutely LOVE this place. I have spent lot of money gambling and eating here. But coming in tonight, having spent money on food and a little on gambling, with the intention of spending more on gambling, and being told \"You can't say the F-word,\" as in F-U-C-K, after coming in for YEARS and spending money, broke my heart. Sorry guys, I'm an adult. You've lost my money now.
