We came to Dragon Boat Fusion for a fam jam dim sum session over Easter long weekend.  With almost 30 in our group, some of us had to arrive early before doors opened to secure a few tables due to no reservations policy before 11am.\n\nI straggled in late, around 9:30am so my relatives recounted their harrowing tales of dashing in with the rest of the early risers to get enough tables to accomodate everyone.  My cousin lost the lens cap for his camera and I think someone else almost lost an eye.\n\nWe ordered using the check off menus and food arrived shortly after.  It's hard to impress me, especially at dim sum time.  But the first bite of the BBQ pork bun with a delicate toasted topping had me hooked.  As the rest of the dishes arrived, I was won over by the selection, presentation and generous size portions of each dish.\n\nThings got a bit hairy near the end when our server brought us our bill even though we told her we were still missing a few items from our order.  As she insisted that everything had arrived, our missing items turned up at our table.  Glad we could package that up before we left the restaurant.  No harm done but they were clearly trying to rush out the door as the massive hoard of hunger people wating for tables had now pushed their way well into the dining room.\n\nBest dim sum meal I've had in a long time and the price - $2.80\/dish before 11am was nothing to sneeze at either.  Wasn't a fan of the service at the end of our meal and probably wouldn't want to brave the lineups\/crowds on a weekend but food was good enough that I'd make the drive up to Richmond Hill on a weekday.  \n\nFell asleep in the car on the way home due to dim sum induced coma.
