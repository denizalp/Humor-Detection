New Location For An Old Favorite!\n\nREI is one of my favorite outdoor suppliers for quality products at reasonable prices. I used to go to the Tempe location they closed to make this bigger newer and nicer location which is also more conveniently located off the I-10 freeway next to World Market.\n\nIt seems most of the same friendly staff from the old store is now at the new store. The layout is much more friendly and easy to navigate and it seems the selection has increased in several areas as well. The bigger store make the shopping experience even better here.\n\nWhether it's rock climbing, kayaking, camping, bicycling or any other outdoor sport REI usually has you covered for at least the basics. They have a much larger online inventory that you can also pickup at the store with ease.\n\nThey also have a good selection of hiking shoes and boots with experience outdoor staff to make good recommendations. \n\nI would just like them to provide a little bit larger in store rock climbing selection. They always have a rather small selection compared to some more intense rock climbing shops. \n\nThey have the most liberal return policy I have ever heard of and pretty much do anything to make you happy which I feel some people like the football returning the camping stove be bought 10 years prior after he ran it over with his car.... That's getting carried away....\n\nThey have a good bike selection too!\n\nAll in all though this is one of the best outdoor suppliers I have seen in the USA.
