Wish I could get out my cockroach infested, broken garbage disposal, broken AC apartment lease!!!! Can't WAIT till November and I'm getting out of this place. No matter how many time they \"fix\" the problem, it breaks (or comes back) after a couple weeks. It's hell here. And they treat you like you're dumb. I brought in a picture of a HUGGGGGE COCKROACH (not the usual, yes I said usual, kind in my house) and the dumb lady said \"oh that's just a water bug) \n\nSure, I'll bring the water bug next time and place it right on your desk :) \n\nAttached is the picture of said water bug. \n\nIt's a mother f*cking cockroach that FLEW!
