Ew.  This place gives me the creeps.  I think of vomit, STD's, Jersey Shore wannabee white trash, and cougars when I think of this place.  I can always tell who is going to Whisky River when I'm walking through the Epicentre.  It's always the people already so drunk they're tripping over themselves acting like they're in designer clothes but really wearing the clearance rack from Wet Seal (2 sizes too small).  And can you really be VIP in a place that has a mechanical bull? C'mon.  I know it's the south, but how redneck can you get?
