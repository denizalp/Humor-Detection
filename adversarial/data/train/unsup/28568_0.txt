This place is absolutely amazing! The music, the atmosphere, the service, everything was 5 star. It was happy hour, so we got buy one get one for free. We ordered Ray of light and nights in white satin, both were incredibly delicious. The pasta was cooked just right. Plus, they can make pretty much everything vegetarian. We will be back!
