OUTSTANDING!! We waited in line for lunch for 55 minutes. Not one complaint all the people around us are so friendly and the staff was even more friendly. We even got a tour of their kitchen and how they smoke all the meat.The beef brisket was to die for. This was our first visit and we will definitely come back every time we visit Phoenix
