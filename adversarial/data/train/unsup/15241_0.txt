I was treated really bad by THE OWNER of the store. Goes to show you how she really values her business. I would bring my dogs in regularly and buy lots of merchandise  when 1 instance came up and I cancelled because I changed my mind on grooming them (there is 3 altogether) before we went to The Grand Canyon. I just wanted to deshed (with no bath) my beagle but she wanted to charge me for a ($30) bath and a ($20+) deshed treatment! And when I declined she (Carrie Little) had the audacity to tell me if I ever want to come back I need to pay a $20 fee! No thanks, I'll take my family, friends and fur babies elsewhere!
