Can't comment on the range and associated packages, only the peeps and service.\n\nFound this place on pure dumb luck, while on my way to \"another\" gun shop, as my wife spotted it in transit.\n\nSo I pulled over and what a little gem!!! Super helpful sales staff, friendly and totally competent as well.\n\nWent looking for some spare mags and ammo and was not disappointed at all. Got my 5.56, spare clips and consequently, picked up a couple of \"supplemental\" items ;-) as well as some small gifts for my sons-in-law!!!\n\nAmmo price was about half of what I'd pay here in Cali and while the selection could have been a wee bit better, I'm totally stoked nonetheless...\n\nMy new \"go to\" shop when I'm in town, without a doubt. And next time.... I'll try the \"full auto\" experience, lol.
