Just a little backstory here. My friend gets a free meal for his birthday...basically a $60 per person credit, so we've been coming here every year to celebrate and eat. 2013 was pretty good, but 2014 was not good, with both of us a little disappointed in our meal. Fast forward to this year....we reluctantly made the reservation. \n\nObviously, they have made some changes because this was an excellent meal. I had the Lobster Bisque and Short Ribs, while my friend went with a salad and Lamb Chop. The lobster bisque was so much better than before, with lots of lobster and excellent flavor. The short ribs were cooked to perfection and full of flavor. Definitely the best short ribs I've had since Kerry Simon's restaurant back in 2006. My friend raved about his lamb chop as well.\n\nOur meal total came out at $128, so basically all this great food for $8. I left a healthy tip in my appreciation. Whoever is running the kitchen and cooking should be very proud because the menu had some nice additions, and the food is pretty good.
