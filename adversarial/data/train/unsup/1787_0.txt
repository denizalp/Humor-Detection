I had a good time at this buffet, but mainly because I was tipsy off of unlimited mimosas!\nLunch price is about $25 with about $13 for unlimited mimosas\/bloody mary's\/etc.. Everything was decent, nothing special. They did have prime rib, which was good. It's definitely lacking in the variety\/creativity factor when comparing to other buffets. \nWe stayed until around 3 or 4 and they finally brought out the crab legs and shrimp!! No oysters though.\nAll in all, a satisfying meal that still got me super stuffed!
