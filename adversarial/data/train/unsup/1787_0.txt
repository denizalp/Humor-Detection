This is one of the worst McDonald's of all time, no joke. The ice cream machine is ALWAYS broken, it's always dirty, and the service is so slow this can hardly be considered \"fast food.\" On the bright side, students receive a 10% discount with a student ID. On another hand however, when my boyfriend (a college student) showed his ID to buy our dinner they scolded him and said \"only  use your ID to buy your food not hers\" despite the fact that I'm a college student as well... extremely rude. \n\nThis time I went to McDonald's I was not caught in a long line, and they LUCKILY got my order completely correct (a true rarity). The last time I came here I waited a whopping 25 minutes for my order to come out, and when I asked for something to make up for my wait, perhaps a drink or a small fry, I was stared at blankly by the cashier.
