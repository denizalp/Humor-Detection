Day of visit - Friday \nTime: Noonish\n\nI can start off saying that the restaurant appeared clean on our visit and the servers were friendly. There were 2 in our party, and maybe 3 other tables in the whole restaurant. \n\nI ordered the 'mile high burger' medium rare with fries and soup of the day, New England clam chowder. My son ate the soup and he said it was very good and tasted homemade. As for the burger, well I will allow that for a thin, probably pre-made frozen hamburger patty or even fresh, when it's thin, it makes it hard to get medium rare done right. So it was medium, no pink. Okay, that's fine. It came with saut√©ed onions, mushrooms and provolone cheese. Now it was good, but the burger itself aside from the toppings really had no flavor. I think what my tastebuds would have liked is some garlic maybe, but hey - I'm used to my own cooking. The fries were good, thick steak fries, hot and fresh. Some might say well fries are fries, but we all know we've had wtf bad fries. \n\nMy son had the old stand by biscuits and gravy. That was good, and it too tasted homemade with big chunks of sausage. \n\nOur drinks were refilled promptly and service was good.\n\nI don't know that we'd go back as a 'we need to go to this place!' again visit, not out of the way it's something you can't miss type thing, but then again I'm not putting it on the list of places I'd suggest to stay away from, you know? \n\nOn an end note -- the cheesecakes - the mammoth cheesecakes they have in the deli\/display cases where you pay the bill are entrancing. If you are susceptible to cheesecake powers, don't look at them. Leave someone with more self control to settle the tab while you run for the car.
