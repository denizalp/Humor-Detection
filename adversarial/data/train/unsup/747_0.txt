Very crowded at lunch time and about a 15 minute wait in the queue before getting to the front and working my way down the line. If you've been to any one of those assembly line places like Subway or Blaze or Chipotle, then you're already familiar with the basic format here at Yafo. Start with a base, add veggies, add extras, done.\n\nBut with that said, you've probably never had these sort of goodies before. I had the hummus bowl as my base, which is a massive portion (like a full cup's worth) of hummus, then added fresh tomatoes and fresh cucumber and a chickpea salad and some stewed cabbage and stewed onions and then a big scoop of feta cheese, then had it topped with pulled rotisserie chicken. And then a side (which they call a mezze) of the roasted Brussels Sprouts.\n\nIt was AMAZING. So many flavors, so many textures, so much deliciousness in every single bite. Just all full of wow.\n\nTotally will be back to Yafo. Wow!
