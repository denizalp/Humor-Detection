Last night, after wasting 15 minutes of our lives at Bachi Burger,  my friend insisted we try this place out, since it's in the area and we've driven by it alot.\n\nEven though the place was quite busy, we were greeted immediately within seconds of going thru the door(literally!). I've got to say that for a fast food place, I was very impressed with the service recieved here. Everyone was rediculously nice and friendly.\n\nAfter reading the reviews, I had somewhat lowered expectations. Alot of the reviews compare Freddy's to Steak N Shake, which is fair to a certain degree. Living near South Point, I've been to SNS many times, and Freddy's burgers are definately a notch better. The burgers I had last night had a lot more flavor than the burgers I get at SNS, but than again, you will pay a bit more here too. The prices aren't as bad as I had heard, but for 3.19 for a single patty and 4.29 for a double, they aren't exactly cheap either.\n\nStill, though, I really like this place. The great customer service really goes a long way with me. I will definately be back.\n\n\n4 stars.
