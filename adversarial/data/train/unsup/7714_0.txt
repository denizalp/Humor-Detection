I'm big on fitness and nutrition. As such, I believe in buying the best food that is available. During my stay in the Phoenix\/Scottsdale area, I found this grocery store across the street from my hotel.\nThe first thing I noticed as I was perusing the store was the wide variety of wine and hard liquor in stock. They have a small lounge with sliding glass doors you where you can take your time and pick your drink for the night. You get your pick from mid-range to pricier bottles.\nThey also have a kosher section, which is a plus for me because I keep kosher (most of the time). \nI picked up some fruit: mangoes and pineapples. Whenever I am out of town, I eat out a lot, so I need some healthy food to round out my diet. I also got two gallons of water, because I will not drink the tap from the hotel.\nI found no problems with the service nor the crowd here. Friendly, efficient, and of good stock.
