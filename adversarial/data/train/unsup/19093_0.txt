You're never gonna find a buffet like this in your hometown... \n\nLots of amazing dishes are served here- The crab legs are outstanding. The chicken wellington was delicious. The pasta tastes fresh. The roasted turkey was juicy. The shrimp was endless. ALL of the deserts and cakes I tried were great. \n\nThe sushi sucked, but then again I've never had good sushi at a buffet anywhere... i think you need to actually go to a sushi restaurant for good sushi. The Paella wasn't very tasty, either... the chicken and sausage in it were very dry. Also, as delicious as many of the items here are, i feel like it isn't enough selection for the insane price you pay- and left something to be desired. \n\nI still give it 4 stars for overall quality of their main dishes, but i feel like there is a 5 star buffet out there in Vegas i haven't tried yet.
