Oh, I am afraid even to write about Cook Out. I gained 20 pounds last year with their crackshakes...I mean milkshakes. My standard is the Oreo cookie shake, but every now and then, I'd mix it up with a cobbler shake or a crazy chocolate cherry kind of thing. You also can't go wrong with the peanut butter fudge option...and add bananas to the peanut butter fudge, and you have something spectacular...\n\nCook Out may not have the greatest service, and other than milkshakes and french fries, there is absolutely nothing for vegetarians...but it matters not. There is no better milkshake in the world...nowhere, ever. I'm not exaggerating.\n\nPerhaps it's not quite proper to call them milkshakes, as you can't really suck them through a straw. It's spoon-only.\n\nIf you haven't had Cook Out yet, you are missing a vital part of Charlotte culture. This little chain is only available in our region...we are truly favored by the gods.
