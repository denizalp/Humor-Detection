If you have a European car and are sick and tired of getting ripped off by the dealers, then it is time for you to come here and get all your services done quickly, efficently and for much less money.  As my mechanic explained to me, Lou is not interested in upselling you and will just get the job done.   I come here for oil changes, wheel alignment and any other service or maintenance checks for my car.  This place has just recently accomodated fine European cars.  They get you out the door as quickly as they can.  They are easy to talk to and I never feel like I am getting pillaged from head to toe with \"extra\" expenses.  So my secret is out and now it is up to you if you want to continue getting \"pillaged\" or you smarten up and come here and use the bucks you saved to eat at the other fine establishments of Etobicoke.
