This is a go-to breakfast spot for me in Parkdale. Why? Because it's cheap and delicious. I usually skip out on their bigger breakfasts and order a Sarah bagel (avocado, cheese and egg) when I'm on the fly because it's under $5.00. That's right, under $5.00 for breakfast. Can't really beat that. And the service is super friendly.
