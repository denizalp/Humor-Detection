I'd give it 3.75 stars. It's a nice friendly little diner located in a small shopping mall complex on the corner of East Trop and Pecos. It was a little hard to find upon my first drive through the parking lot. \n\nPlace has about 7 4-top tables and a counter area. I imagine it can get filled up quickly, although on a Thursday at 11:45am it wasn't too bad, just 4 tables in use.It's nothing super fancy, just a good old fashioned diner style place. Tables are all stainless steel topped, and everything was pretty clean, including the restroom.\n\nI ordered the Pile Up, which is hash browns, covered in sausage gravy, with bacon on top of that, and two eggs on top of that. Served with 2 halves a slice of toast. First the good....sausage gravy is homemade and I thought it was delicious! I would definitely come back for biscuits and this gravy anytime. The whole meal was very tasty.\nThe bad would be it was a little small, because I'm not a big eater and I finished this quickly and was still a touch hungry. $7.25 was the price. The bad and maybe what would really make this worth it is the toast. Very small slices, and just average bread. I don't know if they make it or its delivered, but I would recommend some larger slices or double up the amount. I do like my toast, and this was a little disappointing. \n\nOverall, I liked the place, and I saw a few items to go back and try, including Kalbi short ribs and eggs for $10.95 and the Seoul Burger. Its a nice mom and pop style place with friendly people who are always busy. They do breakfast, lunch, and dinner so that's a long day! I wish them great success.
