Warning - you may not want to eat here if you don't live in Vegas. The reason is because Ramen Sora is so freaking delicious, that when you have Ramen back home, you will be dissappointed that your local spot doesn't live up to the very high bar Ramen Sora has set.\n\nWe were passing thru Vegas on our way to Zion, and met up with a friend for dinner. He highly recommended this place, and it was obvious why. When we showed up, the place was packed and there was a 30 minute wait. \n\nWhen our table was ready, we were seated and we all ordered the Chashu Miso Ramen. When I took my first bite, I was transported to another world. The noodles had a great texture, and the broth had a very delicious and complex flavor. And the pork...Sweet baby Jesus it was out of this world. Moist, with a flavorful crust. Simply amazing.\n\nRamen Sora is reason enough for me to pass thru Vegas on my way to Zion in the future. In the meantime, I will try to find Ramen that is as amazing as this place closer to home.
