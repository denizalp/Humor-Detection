If you want a greasy but tasty snack pizza slice of your choice loaded with strips of chicken shawarma on top plus hot sauce and garlic sauce , then,  look no further . If the pizza slices are freshly out of the oven , then this combination is even more enjoyable. The pricing is amazingly cheap with really good fast service .
