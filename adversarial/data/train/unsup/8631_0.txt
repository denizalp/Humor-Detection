Starting out w\/ full disclosure, I am not a fan of NY style pizza so I was never going to love Slice of Vegas.....but in the end, I felt this pizza was only okay.....greasy, flimsy crust but there was a nice toppings ratio\n\nExtra props go to the poor staff who was forced to deal w\/ the masses of drunken Mandalay Bay beach \/ concert goers who were completely wasted by the time we showed up at 7pm\n\nThey took orders efficiently & served up the pizza choices quickly\n\nI also appreciated the fact there were many choices for toppings & you could choose or build your own.  They also had quite a number of good-looking side dishes ( such as spicy, roasted cauliflower ) and I imagine this would have been yummy on their cheese pizza..... alas, Sis doesn't like spicy & we wanted to get something Sis, Mr & I could all share\n\nSo we opted for the 4 Cheese w\/ Truffle Oil.  I liked the creamy ricotta & the truffle was pungent in smell but unfortunately not in taste\n\nSo all in all, this wasn't all that bad but I'd probably look elsewhere, in seeking pizza nirvana
