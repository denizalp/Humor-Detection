I hate writing bad reviews so I'm gonna touch on the positive before I touch on the negative.\n\nThe positives:\n\nThe restaurant is lovely, and nicely decorated.  We sat on the patio and it was also very pleasant out there too.  The cinnamon roll that my best friend got was delicious; soft, yeasty and just the right amount of frosting too; very well made.  The peach mimosas were fabulous, although at $7 each I thought they were too pricey.  The staff is gracious and accommodating, although perhaps not extremely attentive.\n\nThe negatives:\n\nSince we had others joining us we were coming in three stages and the waiter knew that, but after our last diner arrived we sat there for several minutes waiting for our waiter to show back up and take our orders, but he had vanished so we finally had to flag down a busboy and ask for our waiter to return.\n\nI ordered the pulled pork scramble for about $11 and it was sweet.  SWEET!  What the what??!  I picked at it trying to find a delicious, salty forkful of meaty pulled pork that *didn't* taste like it'd been slow roasted in pancake syrup and I couldn't find one edible bite.  I'm sorry, but sweet pork scrambled with eggs and cheese actually is a dismal combination.  \n\nThe unsalted, rosemary roasted breakfast potatoes that came with my pork and scrambled eggs somehow managed to lack any zip or zing too.  I ate one bite of the potatoes and gave up.   This was also served with two flour tortillas which were soft and warm, but otherwise nondescript.\n\nThere was nothing of note on my whole plate and the pork and eggs was practically inedible in my opinion.  I sent my food back with about 4 bites taken out of it and sadly, the waiter didn't even think to question why I was basically sending a full plate of food back to the kitchen  \n\nCoffee is $2.25 and about as nondescript as coffee can be.  I mean seriously, it tasted like .50 a cup coffee, except it wasn't, it was $2.25.  Oh well...\n\nSo in retrospect, I paid about $26 for a breakfast that consisted of about 5 bites of food from my own plate, a cup of coffee, a mimosa and a bite of my friend's cinnamon roll.\n\nYep, I won't be back.
