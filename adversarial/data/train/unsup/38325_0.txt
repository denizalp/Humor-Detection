Very Bad customer service, indifferent and rude!People were waiting to be checked in not knowing who was next. The majority of the sales associates were lacking any signs of motivation or urgency to take care of customers.\nWe were just waiting to purchase a car charger and the associate who finally checked us in said the next sales associate would be right with us.\n\nSteer clear of this store location. It's hard to even think they are paying these imbeciles $10.00 an hour or more...
