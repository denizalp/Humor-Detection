Horrible company!!!!!!! Paid them over 500 to put in new freon and fix a leak in the ac unit. They may have fixed the leak but they didn't change the filter which is part of the repair of the leak. The company that came months later to fix it when it broke again said it should have been common sense to replace the filter. I had to have it fixed by another company through my home warranty because this idiot didn't do his job correctly. Their technician was an idiot. He said we needed a new unit which is true but told me they had a special and I could get a new unit for 1500ish which I agreed to and then he speaks to a manager and they come back with a almost $7000 price. The guy never clarified that the $1500 was just a down payment. I understand the high cost of the unit but instead of trying to trick me or waste my time they need to be clear about things. If I could give no stars I would. Seems to me that there are a lot of bad reviews of this company so I don't know why they are still around.
