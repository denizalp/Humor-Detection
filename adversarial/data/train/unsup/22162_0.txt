I just walked out of the restaurant after being seated with my wife then waiting for about 10 minutes and never being greeted. We even asked the hostess to grab our server and still to no avail. We did however see another party be seated after us and be immediately greeted and served. This was after we notified the hostess we hadn't been served. \n\nBefore I left I asked to speak to the manager  I then waited up at the hostess stand for over 5 minutes before I walked out all together. \n\nI'm super disappointed. I've been coming here for months and the food is great coupled with usually pretty good service. This however was pathetic. It will be a while before I go back.
