Oof. Yeah. This is depressing. I hope there aren't any stores here that rely on...you know, people. And foot traffic. Because this mall is deader than your forgotten Tamagotchi. This place is only connected to the hotel through The Host. You've got no windows facing the streets, no big signs indicating this is actually a place people want to visit. What a retail fail. \n\nDespite this, there are several businesses in here and a food court. The only way I can imagine these places surviving is if they are like an online marketplace. People seek them out only if they have a specific need. Word-of-mouth being the key in survival. I mean, that's how I ended up here. There's a specialized dress shop here where the owner does alterations, makeup, and everything in between (Faces Makeup Studio & Bridal Boutique, definitely recommend). \n\nI imagine the food court shops have some sort of side hustle, like catering, because I'm not sure the lunch rush from surrounding businesses (if there is one at all), is enough to sustain such mediocre traffic. There's a nice little Thai booth that prides itself in being authentic (Thai 5 Cafe). Great iced tea, also in the catering business. \n\nShame, really. I'm not even sure if this place had a heyday. I can't imagine it. It's just so badly designed, not connected to any major pedestrian routes, and bland. For the businesses that have found a loyal customer base though, this place strangely works in their favour. Quiet and private (unintentionally), and I'm certain they're getting nice low rates for rent. \n\n(51\/100) - 2018
