This Subway is located just inside the Sam's Town Casino lobby. With super nice and friendly help. It was a Tuesday afternoon and not crowded so we were promptly waited on.\n\nHubby was in the mood for their meatball sub so I opted to share a foot long and ordered it on Italian bread toasted with provolone cheese. The sandwich artist asked if we would like that double meat and I politely accepted that offer for their $1.50. \n\nThe sandwich was tasty, hot and very fresh. The bread was ever so perfectly toasted the cheese was had that perfect string to it when biting into it and pulling back on the bread. The sauce was plentiful and seasoned just right to accent the meatballs to make it all marry together with the sprinkles of parmesan cheese.  \n\nThis Subway is on the smaller size but very clean with your usual self serve chips and drink station and actually the cigarette smoke was to a minimum. Nice!!\n\nWe'll be back for sure since we are staying at the RV resort here at the property.
