Hungry Howie's is to great pizza what Bud Light is to craft beer.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I rarely eat Hungry Howie's while I'm sober. In fact, as the beer in me increases, so too does the likelihood that I'll say \"Yes, I would like to forgo all the other great pizza joints in town for Hungry Howie's, because I'd like some Three Cheese Howie Bread.\"\n\nAnd therein lies the problem. One item on the menu reduces me to a quivering pile of jelly. For just a few dollars, I can innundate my stomach with something cheesy, garlicky and greasy, all in one bite. These are the best cheesy breadsticks in town, and like Pringles, once you pop, you can't stop. If they put toppings on this, this review would get four stars, and my belt would need four more notches. \n\nThe pizza? If you remember Little Caesar's from the 80's, where you'd get two pizzas covered by a thin piece of paper then you've had Howie's pizza. What sets it apart is the flavored crust, which is one of my favorite parts of the pie. If it was stuffed crust, this review would get five stars, and my shirt size would need five X's instead of two.\n\nThere's a ton of better pizza in Lakewood. But, there isn't a better cheesy breadstick, guaranteed. You should order Howies if you're drunk, have kids that like mediocre pizza, or don't have a ton of money.\n\nOtherwise? There's lots better out there.
