I bought a 6 visit laser hair removal package on groupon and wish i would have read the reviews first. this place is sketchy. equipment is old and outdated and after the 6 treatments i still have most of the hair on my underarms. very disappointed. was told i could come back for $50 a session. what a rip off. beware.
