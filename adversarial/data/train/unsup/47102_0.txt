So this will be my last time eating here... first they rush you to order which typically is okay but literally the menu items are not your everyday food and the menu changes everyday and they really don't give you much help when asking what is what I was initially able to look past that the first time... and my first time eating here it was very tasty...\nthen I came today for lunch... I asked for my meal vegetarian style to include tofu and I was informed all the soups and the spring roll that come with lunch have meat in them (great that tofu soup I had the other day was probably chicken based smh) I simply asked if I could substitute those two items for steamed rice (which to be honest seems more than fair) when I asked she said \"no substitutions I can bring out the soup and the spring roll just don't eat them but no substitutions\" \n\nHer downright rudeness about being unaccommodating was so ridiculous I almost left... but instead I decided to stay and write this review as I wait for my food. I just took a bite and I.T tastes okay but overall the customer service element is really lacking which is so disappointing as the food is good I guess that's why so many people put up with the poor customer service.
