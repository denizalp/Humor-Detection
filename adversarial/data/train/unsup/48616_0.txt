Coming back to this place reminded me of those good old party days when I'd used to come here after hitting the clubs. Down the stairs we go and into Burrito Boyz. \nThough this time rather than coming here in the weee morning hours, I decided to head out for lunch with a coworker. Lets just say it can get chaotic in here due to the office lunch rush! It kind of makes you wonder what's the capacity of this joint?\nWith the amount of orders backed up, I opted for their EXPRESS...Chicken and Steak express which had everything in it. At an approximate cost of $8 each, holding one of these burritos and walking back to the office is like walking with light-weights.\nAs heavy as it was, it tasted delish!.....overall great place.
