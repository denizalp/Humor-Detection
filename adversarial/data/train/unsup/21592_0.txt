I won't be back, I made a reservation for a table for five and I stressed table, because two of the people in the party had mobility issues and needed a table. \nWhen we were taken to our table it was a booth, and when I said I needed a table, I was told by the hostess that there was a table there. When I pointed out it was a booth and not a table I was asked, \"What's the difference?\"\nThen I asked for the manager, when he came he still tried to get is to sit at the booth and offered to bring a chair for me to sit in because I can't get in and out of booths, when I sat in the chair I was given the table in the booth hit the top of my shins. I told them this is not going to work and I wanted a table like I asked for in the beginning. \nAt this point I was lead to a table for four with an extra chair pushed in at the end when I pointed this out to the waitress she well this was the best they had at her station and there was a big round table at the other side, but then she wouldn't be our waitress. She said this in a flirty way that really made a little sick to my stomach, I told her that sounded good to me. Unfortunately the manager had all ready had the member of my party with the most trouble moving seated in one of the chairs, so by the end of dinner I could barely walk from having to keep my legs under my chair, again because we where never seated at a table for five. \n\nWhen I called back to tell the manager he had people that didn't know a table from a booth I was literally told,  \"Go F**k Yourself\"\n\nI know I have stepped foot in my last restaurant that is owned by this company.
