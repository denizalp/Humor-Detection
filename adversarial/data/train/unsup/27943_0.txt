When it was being revamped from Gordon Biersch, the first thing (and dumbest) was  remove the pretty outdoor fireplace.. Now the patio is bland and uninviting.  And they have a big ugly TV screen with football on.\n\nThe Mixx is a prefect name for this confused and identity crisis establishment.  Started out kinda fancy.  Now they added gaming, big screen TV, Tapas, breakfast, Tapas, Yeeesh!  Seems pretty desperate to keep re-inventing themselves every couple of months.\n\nToo confusing for me.\n\nNext week it will have a swim up bar. Ha Ha\n\nHow about just really good food and stop with the gimmicks.  Not my style.
