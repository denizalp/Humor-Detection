This nail salon was highly recommended by a close friend. The experience started off pleasant then immediately took a turn for the worse. The pedicure technicians were blatantly talking in a very disrespectful manner about their customers. I sat quietly hoping the situation would subside but instead, they continued to make fun of calluses on a customers foot right in front of her. She had no idea because she only spoke English. One technician started laughing and making faces as if this lady's foot smelt. Then they all began to make faces (about the smell no one else in the establishment could smell) and it was more like 3 kids having a good time by making fun of the customers that happen to give them a job in the 1st place. I don't think they realize that other \"americans\" also speak other languages and could in fact make out everything they were saying. They even started talking about another customer saying \"oh, she looks so serious\" then laughing together. It was clear to me this was normal behavior and putting down other people in another language is a daily occurrence here. How sad can some people be? It's not anyone else's fault other than your own that you chose to work in a place that you hate. It does not give you an excuse to disrespect people you do not even know. I'm so shocked by the unprofessionalism here, I will never return and I recommend no one return until a business ethics course is taken by each employee. I experienced this on (5-30-16) Memorial Day around 3 pm. If everyone knew what they were talking about, they wouldn't be in business at all!!!!!!!!
