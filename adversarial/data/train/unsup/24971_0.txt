10-28-16\n\nI called Thrifty Joes to inquire if they buy used cd's, they told me they did. They asked me what kind of music I had, and how many cd's I would be bringing to sell. When I arrived the gentleman opened the door for me (which was nice of him). He asked if I was the one he spoke to a little earlier on the phone. I told him yes. He then told me it would take about 45 minutes for him to go through my cd's. I told him no problem, I would just be hanging around the store. Nine minutes later he came back to me and said my cd's were a bit \"scratched\" and they really couldn't use any. I walked over to the counter where my approx 150 cd's were and proceeded to show him numerous cd's that were in near mint condition...\n\nHe had only looked a few! Obviously he did not go through my cd's! I had driven about 20 miles for a kid to not even do his due diligence as an employee. What a waste of time! \n\nTerrible customer service Thrifty!
