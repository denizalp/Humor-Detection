Be still my aspirationally-veggie heart! To sit in these big windows looking out on cobblestone Duluth and eat this perfect tart and impossibly vegan lemon custard meringue and drink the house-infused sweet cranberry green tea is just such an afternoon delight. \n\nThe owner is a total love, so enthusiastic about what she does you can't help but wish her everything good! And I love how quirky chill the place is decorated. Do twin organists ever duel it out on the matching old instruments? We can dream. \n\nI know spots on this strip are expensive so I hope she can draw in enough customers to rock the rent this big location must require. I feel like vegan kiddo birthday parties could do well here? Anyway we tried a bunch and will definitely pass by for more whenever I'm nearby! Go say hi!
