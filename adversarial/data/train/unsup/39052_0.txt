This place was wonderful! While the spa is off the strip it does not lack in quality at all. My friend and I both had facials and a massage and they were above our expectations. The facility was clean and beautiful. They provided robes and sandals while there and had a relaxing waiting area before and between services. Everyone was very professional and nice. I would definitely recommend!
