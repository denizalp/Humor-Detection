There is something about Gaucho that makes me drool.  Just standing outside you smell the amazing scent of  their grill and hunger takes over.  There is usually a line forming, but that's how good it is.  I'd wait an hour in line for the delicious good at Gaucho.  \n\nI ordered \"Pollo con Pan\" or their chicken sandwich with onions, peppers, and so much flavor that you cannot stop eating it till it's gone... Hence why I  don't have a picture :)  Their Rosemary Beef Sandwich is also amazing.  \n\nIf you're going to the Strip and crave something delicious, stop at Gaucho.  If you're not in the Strip, I suggest you go and try the amazing food at Gaucho... You can thank me later.
