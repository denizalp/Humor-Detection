State Street Brat is amazing! I only came here 1 time, when I visited my brother to see him graduate from UW Madison. I had the cheese curds, spotted cow beer and white brat. Really good especially the beer which is only sold in Wisconsin, so it is a must when visiting Madison or any other city or town in Wisconsin. My family and i came here for lunch which is a fun place to come in the afternoon because it is not overly crowded compared to later at dinner time or later.
