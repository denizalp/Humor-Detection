This cute shop tucked in a swarm of restaurants on Baldwin. It's like Bergo Designs meets the ingenuity and cuteness of Japan. Some of the stuff is extremely practical, like reuseable book covers with attached book mark, or a cool grass like stand for photos. \nThen there is the design stuff, like the evolution eraser. I also have this obsession with pens and tempted to buy the fancy $20 pens, but will save it for a trip to Japan. \n\nIt's a nice gift store for that person that has everything.
