Putting a pin in this one for a return review.  They were busy when I got here.  The bar is long and narrow.  A few tables line the wall, but I found all of them full.  The bar too was full.  There was a five foot section of wall that had a shelf of sorts on it.  I stood by the shelf.  It was...awkward.  A couple girls who also wanted seating also stood by the shelf.  \n\nWe pretended not to notice that we were all standing at a shelf while we sipped our cocktails.  \n\nI started with an Italian 75.  I love the French 75, so I figured...why not?  It's grappa, Prosecco, balsamic vinegar, and rosemary.  It was a good cocktail.  \n\nI started a tab and for my next round got a Nardini Reserva from the grappa menu at the bartender's suggestion.  I don't drink a ton of grappa.  It was good.  Stiff in the way that grappa can be, but good.  \n\nI ended up getting a seat at the end of the bar and found myself constantly sucking in my breath to make way for the bartenders serving the tables.  I seemed like I was...\"in the way\".  \n\nI had dinner scheduled next door at Piccolo Forno, and got a bottle of wine to take with me before paying my tab.  If you buy the bottle there, they don't charge you the corking fee at PF.  That's a nice benefit.\n\nBusy night, full house, weird seating, good drinks.  I'll try it again if only because it's an ultra convenient waiting area for Piccolo Forno, but also because I have a feeling my next experience will be better.
