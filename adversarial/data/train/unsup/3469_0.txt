Got a table and that gangster'd up the eve, but overall just meh. The terrace was the only thing open the night we went, and no one was dancing on the dance floor. What? Why? Dunno. This was fine, we partied at our table, but when we tried to invite some others in to help finish our bottle (uhhh it was 5 of us, all small girls - a bottle is a lot for us to finish, don't judge) the bouncers tried to tell us we weren't aloud. Um no, we paid a ridiculous amount for this table and if we want to invite people in, we damn well better be able to. \n\nWe had an awesome time because we will pretty much have an awesome time where ever we go, but again, bouncers are d-bags. If we hadn't have had a table we'd have been in and out and ready to move on with our eve!
