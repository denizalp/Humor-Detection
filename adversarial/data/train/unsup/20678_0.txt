Since Simon is gone Cafe 6 quickly replaced it. Cafe 6 looks like the same decor and only a change of menu. They have a cute menu with burgers, sammiches, fries, salads, and even some dessert which they call love handles. I decided to grab a couple different items and try everything I could with some coworkers. \nWe orders the U-Pick burger trio. First was burn your face off, second was the turkey snack, and last was the belly wash. The burn your face off was hot and tasty. The turkey looked funny with the taro bun, which is blueish purple, but was very tasty. The apple cranberry dressing was good. Lastly the belly wash was my favorite. Beef and BBQ sauce, what more can you ask for. We also order the BLTA stack. A BLT with avocado, total winner. It also came with a side of fries, we go the waffles fries. It also comes with their house made ketchup. Super yummy. Last but not least we ordered some wangs. We decided to get the sauce on the side. We decided to try the sweet Thai chili. They were very good. We could have just got them on there. It was a filling delicious meal. I'm really excited to try more items. For sure going to get the BLTA again, and maybe a side of wangs.
