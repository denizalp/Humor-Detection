TO get here, you have to go up some sketchy stairs and its right on your right as soon as you walk...don't walk down the hallway trying to find it (like i did)\n\nI came here super hungover post nak won for a hair cut cause I was ready to guido my hair again.\n\nI asked for the junior stylist (which said 7 dollars outside) and got a man..\n\nHe did a great job with my hair..even washed it after for me.\n\nBut in the end he did charge me 20 + tax..\n\nI can get the same haircut for waaaaaaaaaaaaaay cheaper in Scarborough..so I think I'm going to stick to that. Maybe if I'm in the same situation I might come back here...\n\nI'm always next door anyways...\n\n\n2.5 Stars rounded to 3\n\n11\/15
