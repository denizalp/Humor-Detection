Let's be serious... All Tropical Smoothie has to is keep the same products and be helpful to me... Keeping the store clean is good and I do like when they are appropriately staffed for a particularly busy time of day. Two locations around town even have employees who know my name and what I like.\n\nSo, why does this location always feel rushed and unfriendly?\n\nHere was my Quick Tip on my last stop in:\n\"Time to redeem a filled up card for a free Smoothies... Well, not \"free\"... She says \"that'll be 11 cents... For the Splenda.\"\n\nTo be clear, I showed her the punched card, she went to punch it again. When I showed her that it was completed, she implied that I was trying to trick her. She then said \"that will be 11 cents.\" I just looked at her inquisitively. She said \"For the Splenda, that'll be 11 cents\"\n\nI ran out to the car to get 11 pennies.\nWhat if I had been jogging?? \nWhat if I had 0 Dollars and 0 Cents and was hoping that a Tropical Smoothie, earned through my sustained, frequent visits, would cheer my broke ass up... NOPE.
