Lizy and her team were fantastic when my boyfriend and I bought our home. As a first time homebuyer, I needed all the help I could get. Lizy's team was extremely helpful throughout the loan process, great communication, everything was done on time, and the team was very easy to reach with any questions. \n\nI would 100% recommend Lizy and her team for anyone looking for a lender!
