This company is so professional! If you have junk that needs to go, The Pick-Up Junk Artist is excellent. After booking a time, they kept me advised by texts. On the day of pick up, three young men knocked on my door and INDIVIDUALLY introduced himself with a name and hand shake. They were all clean cut and in a Pick Up Junk Artist uniform. Junk was removed! Great job and money well spent.
