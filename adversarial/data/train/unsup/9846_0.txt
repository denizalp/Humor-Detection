I get my eyebrows tinted and waxed by Tanya here. I never thought I would actually get compliments on my eyebrows (they are notoriously thin and light naturally), but after Tanya's handiwork I got 3 compliments from different folks about my expertly groomed brows. I dock one star because none of her colleagues have been able to do as good a job, but go see Tanya, she's super friendly and helpful.
