MGM Grand, my secondary favorite Las Vegas casino and hotel in the Las Vegas Blvd strip. The MGM Grand Casino and Hotel delivers all the gambling games from slot machines to Texas Style Hold'em Poker, and every pro boxing & UFC MMA matches to musician concerts all year long! The casino atmosphere is remarkably suburb! The concept does looked like similar to Thunder Valley Casino and Resort in Lincoln, California with the expandable contemporary shopping mall feel on it.\n\nThe service is a mixed bag for me depending on the busiest environment inside MGM Grand. So far, I have no issues or complaints at all as I enjoyed playing slot machines during the whole night and requesting drinks for the server.\n\nI haven't gotta chance to stay at MGM Grand during the Las Vegas Labor Day weekend trip, so I'll deciding and planning to stay there in the future visits and reservations.\n\nIn the end, MGM Grand Casino and Hotel is the best place to stay and hang out in Las Vegas. Perfect for entertainment goers and stayers from local to international tourists from around the world. A well, worthy visit!
