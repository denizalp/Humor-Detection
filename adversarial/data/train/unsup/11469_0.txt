Big airport with long taxis into your gate if you're unlucky (which I was).  Surly TSA folks who don't like the human phlegm cavorting through their airport.  That's the bad.  The good?  People watching equals a 10+ for sure!  Warmer than Cincinnati in the winter (that was easy).  Fun to fly in at night as you can see Vegas' lights screaming at you in the middle of all that blackness from at least 100 miles out, and that's a once in a lifetime experience (or is it?)  \n\nSo very many droopy heads inside this airport though!  Looks like a lot of you flyers have a case of the Mondays!  Extraordinary numbers and degrees of those pesky hangovers are apparent at this airport.  Side note: I've never seen so many women, young and old, go through an airport in velvet pajama bottoms.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, just a Vegas anomaly I suppose....\n\nWhy in the name of God would I give Las Vegas International McCarron Airport 4 stars? Slot machines everywhere, at every terminal food court and even randomly placed in otherwise nondescript terminal walkways!  Screw USA Today and a Starbucks latte at 515 AM, let's hit some more slots, people!
