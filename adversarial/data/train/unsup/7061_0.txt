I first must start by giving kudos to the service at Tina's. \nIt is a very good cultural experience where you don't have to travel far and feel as if you are in another country, the bread \"teff\" is amazing, and all those awesome flavors make this experience amazing.\nI highly recomend their food and their service \"you will feel like a family member\".\nThank you.
