So, Mary is more a cookie monster than a donut devourer. However, recently my friend brought me here and all I can say is, \"WOWZA!\" While recently in the area my friend asks me if I wanted to go to the donut shop. I have been dieting, so of course I say yes right away. Ha! I figured I could go for a coffee. Well, that plan did not work out so well. That was a big mistake. I did get my coffee, more on that later. \n\nSo once I walked in I knew this was a place a person could get in serious trouble with. \"What would you like? The friendly counter staff asks me. Me- \"Ummmmmm, one of everything please?\" So we settled on a pecan something of another that probably had the name heaven in it for all I could remember after the sugar coma. We also shared a salted caramel (real caramel by the way like candy melted on top) and a cinnamon plain. Amazingly delish, all of them! And my Bestie assures me all of them are equally just as amazing. She specifically mentioned the Peanut Butter and Jelly donut as being very good.  \n\nBy the way, on the coffee. They have this Blueberry coffee and Vanilla Nut flavor that is very good. So, see I did get my coffee after all. \n\nThe best part? It is a local business, not a chain. Buy local. And these donuts are thousands of times better than every chain place in the valley, even the ones known to be on the better side. No names mentioned of course. \n\nGlad I live far away or I would be here every day. Enjoy a donut!
