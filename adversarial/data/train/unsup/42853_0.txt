I recently shopped on-line and did their store to car pick-up. Actually that may not be the name of it but basically they bring your purchases out from the STORE to your CAR. They even have special parking spaces for you to pull into for this experience.\n\nAt online checkout you choose the time you will arrive. My plans changed and I arrived about five hours early. I tapped the button in my email expecting an angry phone call or a \"this service is not available\" note.\n\nNeither happened. About five minutes later my order was hand delivered to my car. A little lazy of me? Uhuh. In my defense I did have both my dogs in my car. I'm sorry I was five hours early. Thank you for the amazing customer service.
