If I could give more stars to this company I would!!!\n\nI needed a new kitchen faucet to replace my old one that was older, outdated, and breaking off pieces of metal on the inside of it .\n\nI called Colburn yesterday 11\/20 and they said that they could come by in the morning. The lady who answered the phone was knowledgeable and answered all of my questions thoroughly.\n\nToday, 11\/21 John came by my house right at the estimated time. He was knowledgeable and efficient. Right away I noticed he had on shoe covers! As a family with kids we do not wear shoes in our house. So when John showed up already respecting the home we live in by wearing shoe covers I was really won over. \n\nThe whole thing took approximately 30 minutes. He answered all of my questions. And showed me how to operate my new faucet as well as gave me helpful advice to keep my other related appliances in tip top shape.\n\nAlso HUGE POINTS for leaving everything clean afterwards and no mess. I was really impressed that he left the area he was working on as clean as before he came in.\n\nI highly recommend John and Colburn Enterprises and will be calling them again in the future with any other plumbing \/ contracting needs I may have!
