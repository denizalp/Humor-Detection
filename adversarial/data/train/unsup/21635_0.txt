I was a lot like the other reviewers here, so excited for a non chain restaurant with good food.  Well, I was sorely mistaken.\n\nMy husband and I tried The Spot for the first time and while the food wasn't terrible, it was slightly disappointing.  I had the sliders and while the Hawaiian Sweet rolls they came on were soft, it didn't make sense and the flavor wasn't good.  \n\nWe decided that we were going to give them another shot as everyone has their \"bad days\".  This was the worst food I've had in a long time.  I got The Original Spot chicken sandwich- who ever cooked this sandwich has to be afraid of under cooking chicken because it was cooked to shit.  I have never had chicken so burnt and over cooked in my life, seriously.  My husband ordered the Chipotle Chicken sandwich and his chicken was also so extremely over cooked.  I've never seen my husband not want to eat something, as he is a guy and we all know guys don't have taste buds, but he passed on his food.  Seriously.\n\nUnfortunately, we will not be visiting The Spot again.  It's too bad, Gilbert truly needs great local restaurants.  It looks like we'll be exclusively visiting The Coffee Shop.
