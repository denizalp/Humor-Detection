ALWAYS my favorite!  I do not live in the Charlotte area anymore but when I visit I always go for a meal.  \nCashiers are always friendly\nOnce you order you are given a number and the food is brought to your table\nThe restaurant is ALWAYS clean\nA staff member is always checking on you to see if everything is OK or if you need a drink refill.\nI love their burgers and the fish is great too.
