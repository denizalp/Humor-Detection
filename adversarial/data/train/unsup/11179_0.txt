I've followed Fluff Ice from Foodie Fest to a pop-up appearance at Fat Choy, so the brand new Las Vegas storefront is a very exciting development. This frozen dessert brand offers consistency. I've never been served a less than perfect cup of Fluff Ice. The flavors are great and the texture is enjoyable.\n\nService was friendly and welcoming, even arriving shortly before closing on a Saturday night. I ordered a green tea and Thai tea combo, and also shared my husband's cup of mango and strawberry. It's so hard to choose a favorite flavor, as I was considering that I should have ordered taro and coconut. Squeeze bottles of sweetened condensed milk are provided on the counter, in case you are like my husband and believe that there's no such thing as too much condensed milk.\n\nI can't think of anything that needs improvement, so  Fluff Ice is a five star dessert experience. The price point is very fair. We don't live close but we will be back soon!
