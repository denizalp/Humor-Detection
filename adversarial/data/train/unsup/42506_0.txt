Been here 9-10 times.  Shout out to Michele who got my order perfectly.  \n\nUpbeat atmosphere, a little sparse.  It is noisy, but hip vibe.  Everything from your basic eggs, toast, bacon to exciting omelette combinations like swiss chard\/swiss to fig jam & goat cheese. I always order the Skinny Bitch which is a whole wheat tortilla, tomatoes, spinach, lowfat cheese & egg whites with a tasty fruit kebab.  My son ordered the apple dutch French toast.  Hoping someone with me will try the nutella\/banana pancakes sometime.\n\nFlavored iced teas & water carafes filled with cucumbers.  Great service on refills.
