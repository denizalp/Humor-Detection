Out of the several of these LCP's that I have visited this one is ok, the pizza was cooked well, ample ingredients, a good amount of sauce but you could tell it was put together too quickly, not uniform consistency with the ingredients like cheese and toppings, but for $5.54 it was hot, it was ready, and it was ok. Staff was friendly and they worked quick. \nOther locations take their time and get it right like Valle Verde in Henderson, but this Silverado location wasn't bad .
