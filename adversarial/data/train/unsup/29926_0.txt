The mariachi band really made our visit enjoyable.\nThe food was great, and so was my margarita. The enchilada sauce was spiced differently than what we expected, but who wants the same old thing every time? \nThe only thing that detracted from our experience was that our virgin daiquiri was a bit more expensive than we expected. It costs more than did my medium margarita! Overall, though, I am convinced that this will be our \"go to\" Mexican restaurant in the area.
