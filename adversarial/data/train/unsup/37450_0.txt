Scott is amazing!  First I love the send a picture for a quote he has through Yelp!  He got back to us pretty quickly with a great price for removing a Palo Verde in our front yard.  When he arrived we worked out a price to trim 3 additional trees and remove a pygmy palm.  His work was impeccable and did a great job taking down the tree.  You can't even tell there was a tree there anymore.  He cleaned up his work areas and even cleaned up some additional plants that had died previously.  I'll definitely bring him back when it's tree trimming time again.
