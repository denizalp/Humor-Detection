I saw a deal on Living Social for a membership. See link below.   (I think it expires in a few days...chop chop if you are interested).\n\nhttps:\/\/www.livingsocial.com\/deals\/1275742-sam-s-club-plus-membership-gift-card-food\n\nYou get a one year membership, 4 free items AND a $20 gift card on the spot, all for $45.00.  That simply cannot be beat!   \n\nWe came in at about 7pm tonight to redeem our certificate.  The lady helping us out at guest services was extremely friendly and helpful.  Total time up at the desk was only about 5 minutes or so.  Once we got out memberships, we decided to do some shopping.\n\nIt's reminded me of a \"boutique\" Costco kind of.  It had a lot of the same items but was just a little bit smaller.  We got some bottled water, salami, cheeses, pineapple, grapes etc.  The produce looked very fresh compared to the local grocery stores around town.  Prices were on par for other warehouse type places.\n\nWhy 5 stars?  The cashier and workers were very friendly, this place is only 5 minutes from my house (Costco is 20 minutes), prices are good AND its not crowded at all.  $45.00 for a year membership is worth it on its own....throw in the fact that you get the gift card and some free things (cookies, bread, roasted chicken and a spinach dip), this makes it a no brainer as far as value goes.  We will come here often and stock up on supplies!
