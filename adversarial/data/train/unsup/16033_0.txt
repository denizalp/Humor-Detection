I'm not huge with Irish pubs but every time I'm in Vegas, I would always pass Nine Fine Irishmen whenever I walk through New York New York. You just have to give it to NY NY for adding Nine Fine to their resort as it does fit in with their theme. \n\nWe had comp tickets to Ricky Martin at the Park Theater. So, I was thinking of a place to eat close by to Monte Carlo. This place fit the bill so the Pub it is. We were seated outside on the patio by the Brooklyn Bridge with live entertainment by our seats. Couldn't fault anything with that. \n\nOur drinks were super strong coming from their cocktail menu. I ordered the lamb stew while my friend had the Irish Nachos. Everything was on par to what you'd expect to have in Ireland. Good 'ol food made with love. I wish we made more room before we ate because we couldn't finish the huge servings. Some days they have live entertainment in and out of their restaurant. I'll be at NY NY in a few weeks so I'll try something different on their menu. Thank God this restaurant is part of Mlife just so I can earn some points.
