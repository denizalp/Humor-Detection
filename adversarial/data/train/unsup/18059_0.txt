What a stinking (but not literally) cute café.\n\nAdmittedly, I've driven by the Tower Press building a thousand times, but never went in. During Sparx City Hop, I finally stopped in for a tea after exploring the building from the Sparx blue line... and now I don't know why I didn't sooner. For starters, the café isn't exclusive to Tower Press residents and artists. Anyone can stop in. It definitely has an artsy vibe, which is totally enhanced by the residents and artists who pass through. They also have art and jewelry on display, and some cozy, colorful seating. Really good feng shui and vibes coming out of this shop.\n\nTo my surprise, they also have a small food menu! I came in expecting a small coffee menu, but ended up just craving lunch. I had a small chai tea latte to-go, but I will definitely come back here in the future for lunch, and maybe even to hang and get some work done. Artefino is a little off the beaten path of the regular coffee shops, and I love that. Don't be discouraged by parking...there's free parking in the back of the building!
