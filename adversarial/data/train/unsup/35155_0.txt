Food is meh, tables are dirty, service is below average and no ones in a hurry to help. If you have nowhere else to go come here.\n\nTook a star off for mishaps the last few times here: wrong change, wrong items served and a 55 minute wait during lunch with no explanation or as much as a single check-in from the waitress or management. Service is seriously lacking.
