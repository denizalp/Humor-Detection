The one, the only, the original...Honey Hut on State Road screams summer memories.  I remember going here as a kid with my grandparents, who lived right down the street.  The bee sign, ice cream sweetened with a dash of honey, and benches remind me of my childhood- you know that glorious phase in life before getting a real job, paying bills, and learning the world around you isn't as perfect as you thought it was as a kid.  Ice cream is a slice of nostalgia and shared memories with loved ones, both here and gone that make me both smile and yearn for times past.
