I dont consider myself a hunter, but I like to go to Sail to try on expensive Canada Goose jackets to impress the hot sales girls. I can't affort the jacket, but they don't know ;)\n\nIn addition,  the store is well organized and the staff is very friendly. When they have sales, they are usually pretty good prices. Some good winter jackets were up to 45% sale - which gets me going if you ask me.
