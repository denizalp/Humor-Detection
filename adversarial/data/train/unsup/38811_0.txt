After driving past this charming little place for a few years, my husband and I finally decided to check it out for our date night. Don't be put off by the name like I was- they do have light and healthy options but they can also throw down some amazing mac and cheese dishes and bacon is one of their staple ingredients. The scent of caramelized bacon was actually the first thing I smelled upon them j entering. Loved the interior that has a very modern look and a wall full of live plants (I'm a plant lover)...We started off with the lavender honey martini (I forgot the name) and it was heavenly. The perfect combination of flavors and was definitely not watered down, which was nice. My hubby ordered the iced green tea and went through three servings of it because it was so good. To start, we ordered the bacon and Brie crostini which came deliciously melted in a bed of caramelized sauce. We also had the g-ma mac and rosemary asparagus pasta, and both tasted great and the flavors were well rounded and tasted phenomenal! This will definitely be a regular part of our date night rotation.
