Going to clubs, I begin to wonder where girls pull their outfits from. I'm not talking about the tourist girls that wear fancy sundresses that seem a bit too formal and not enough, how do you say, \"rap video girl factor?\" I'm talking about the dresses, that if not glued in, your butt and boobs fall out of and are covered in appliques, ruching or 10 lbs of glitter and sequins. \n\nBack in the Bay Area (NorCal,) I'd see shops that would sell ghetto versions of the types of dresses that I'm talking about - but they'd always be in the \"urban\" cities or parts of the cities and they'd have bizarre policies about how you had to check your purse in at the front counter while you shopped and couldn't wear baggy clothes in and other shoplifting policies that wouldn't fly in more affluent areas. \n\nI was surprised when I stumbled upon this place. It had the types of outfits that could be worn to the club, without making them too ghetto (ie: no airbrushing) and without the metal detectors and purse policies thanks to it being pretty close to the GVR area (aka: not ghetto.) Their prices are good, they have a decent selection of clothes and what I buy here - fake lashes. They have the human hair ones for sale, which is what I buy and they're still less than $5 a pair. \n\nOne thing that needs expanded upon is their shoe selection. It's similar to Shiek's in styles available, yet they never have my size - yeti (11) and for my sister, every pair on display seems to be just about the only pair they have in that particular style so... she's out of luck as well. \n\nOverall, the place is decent, the items are adequate for the club scene and the shopping experience isn't ghetto like you'd expect from a store named \"Hottie's World.\"
