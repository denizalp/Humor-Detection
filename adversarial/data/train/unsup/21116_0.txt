Zipped thru the drive thru last week for some of those yummy Doritos tacos and one of the $1 watermelon (I think that's what it was) drinks. \n\nService was fast. Tacos had lots of shredded cheese which I haven't seen at Taco Bell's in YEARS! \n\nTattooed guy was all smiles as he quickly handed me all my artery clogging treats and sauces then I was on my way lickety split. \n\nThose tacos were so good. I stood in the kitchen and at all three of mine without ever sitting down, LOL!
