So you do have something to offer me, and this pleases me, you've offered me the greatest career I've ever had the pleasure of knowing, and a food culture I revel in - but you'll never be Milwaukee, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur.... In other words, you'll never be home. You'll never be immense, you can't take my breath away. You will never be enough for me...\n\nI've outgrown you. \n\nYou will never be as good as it gets, but I appreciate your subtlety.  Unfortunately you make me feel confined, like I need to breathe in so much more than your surrounding scenery. I'm ungrateful. Your beauty isn't enough, I've tasted better - your pull no longer controls me, it never did.  You cannot keep me.  \n\nLeaving you made me appreciate you, but that doesn't mean I want you back. I'm cruel. I only want you for now.  I want to use you up until I've gotten all I can, climb your ladder and from you catapult to higher highs.  \n\nI need the world, and there is nothing you can do to keep me, Madison - I'm not committed, I refuse to settle - I've dabbled in too much to ever be satisfied by a place I can never be lost within.  \n\nI lie in wait.
