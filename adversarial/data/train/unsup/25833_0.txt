Al Phillips Formalwear is truly top notch.  My husband did not want to invest in an expensive suit or tuxedo to attend our nephew's wedding in Las Vegas.  Instead we chose to rent a tux.  We came across the name of this company on the internet and thought we would give it a shot.\nOrdering online was fast and easy.  My husband knew his measurements and was able to choose exactly the type of tux he wanted.  What made their service so outstanding is that we provided the dates in which we would arrive at our hotel and when he would need to use the tuxedo. It was waiting at the hotel for him when we arrived!!! There was no need to contact the company while we were in Vegas because everything fit perfectly!!! If any assistance was needed however, they were ready to help.  We were totally satisfied with the logistics of having the tux delivered and  picked up from our hotel. If we ever need formal wear while visiting Vegas again, we definitely know who to call!!
