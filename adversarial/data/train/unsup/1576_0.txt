Giligans is a bar that my friend's and I LOVE to go to when out in old town. The prices are a little steep for a \"dive\" bar, however the atmosphere is always fun. My friends and I love to play the over-sized JENGA and Connect four. \n\nThis past Saturday, however, was horrible. We arrived and ordered drinks as usual. We started to play the connect four, and my friend cut his hand very badly on the connect 4 board. I asked a woman who was walking by for a band-aid, she appeared to be a manager. She said yes and kept walking. About ten minutes later his hand was still bleeding and she still had not brought it over. We walked to the bar and I asked a security guard if he could get us one. When he came out the woman followed and completely ignored us. I tapped her shoulder and asked if she had forgot about us. She immediately turned around and said \n\n\"I am too busy to be bothered with your little problems. Put your hands on me again and see what happens to you.\"\n\nI immediately reported this to the owner who was standing nearby and she apologized for what happened, but did not seem to really be shocked at all.\n\nThis is unacceptable behavior from anyone in any business. It was completely brushed under the rug by everyone who we spoke with and went unrecognized.
