The service: It's hit or miss. If you try to pay for dog food in the beer section, some employees will let you. Some will say they can't ring it up. \n\nMy favorite was the time I stood in the \"express lane\" for 20 minutes when the cashier told me when it was finally my turn that he was closing. No warning. No heads up. No nothing. And yes, I had to find another lane. \n\nThe produce: Fruit has actually gone rotten the next day when I buy it from here. Especially strawberries. I can't count the times I've found mold on produce in the store. \n\nThe prices: Not worth it. Sometimes you'll find an actual deal but you're better off traveling to Aldi, Target, Costco, literally anywhere but here. They're overpriced and the quality of food doesn't compensate for that. Nor does the service.
