I came here on a Friday for the fish fry about 5:30. The place was packed with a 35 minute wait. Once seated I was given the choice of one piece, two piece, or all you can eat. I opted for all you can eat. In about 15 minutes I got 4 HUGE pieces of fish, coleslaw, and french fries. The fish was fried perfectly. The batter was light and crispy. The fish was tender and flaky. The fries and coleslaw were just ok, but after all that fish who cares. As it was I ended up taking a box and foregoing seconds. This will make my best fish fry list. I will be back, just not tonight.
