Our home warranty company sent a plumber out to clear out a clog in our main line, which had overflowed our garage, laundry room, and kitchen sinks, flooding floors and cabinets. They didn't have the cable to reach it. The warranty company (Old Republic) then sent out Anthony's Plumbing, and Eric Munoz was the plumber who responded. He arrived right on time (actually they called that morning and were able to move the appointment earlier for me). He asked more questions than any other plumber, examined the layout of our house to determine the best clean out to use to clear the clog, and got to work. Within half an hour he had this clog (which had happened 3 months earlier) completely removed. \n\nPrevious plumbers had recommended a hydro-jet service because they thought we might have grease build-up in the line, which Anthony's had available also. But Eric said it was mostly hair and food debris that likely caught on a fitting and built up, with no evidence of grease build-up, and that his larger cable with a spring end clears out pipes much better than the smaller cables. He said I didn't need a hydro-jet service, but he did show me how much moisture was still in our walls with his moisture detector and recommended we have a free estimate from a professional clean up company to make sure we didn't start growing fungus in our walls.\n\nEric was fantastic, very clean, and explained everything very thoroughly. I highly recommend Anthony's Plumbing.
