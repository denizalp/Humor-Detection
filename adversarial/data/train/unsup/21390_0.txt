The food is really good but the customer service was the worst I've ever had and the prices are pretty ridiculous. They charged me $1.50 for a side of guacamole which was maybe 2 ounces at the most. The lady behind the counter was wearing sunglasses the entire time while taking orders and when I tried to order 4 tacos (which I didn't think was so hard) she began to huff and puff and seemed to be overwhelmed. She then proceeded by saying \"shit\" multiple times. In the middle of me ordering she had another employee come and take our order which meant I had to repeat my order. The other employees seemed more concerned about talking with each other about the parties they went to over the weekend instead of serving the customers who were in line. If I was basing it off the food alone, I would go back but given the customer service experience I had, I will probably not be returning.
