TERRIBLE essential oils, definitely not therapeutic quality, i you are just ordering to have perfumes their \"oils\" will work for you but if you use essential oils for health and for aromatherapy FORGET IT. These hardly pass as essential oils. I ordered a very large container of Frankincense and it was runny and evaporated easily (which clearly means its not an OIL). A loved one was using the oregano oil INTERNALLY and it caused him a great deal of distress. I should have known that it was no good by the 'off' color. What a disappointment. And it also took a VERY long time to get my order. I had to contact them several times before they FINALLY shipped it to me. I imagine all the good reviews are from stockholders or people who somehow earn their living from this company. They should be ashamed of themselves for trying to pass these off as \"essential oils\". I even purchased ALL organic in hopes that it would be a worthwhile purchase.  I should have known it was too good to be true by the PRICE!
