Snooze is our number one choice for breakfast.\nI cannot get enough of their pancakes especially the pancake flight where you can sample three different pancakes.\nMy absolute favorites are pineapple upside down pancake and the gosh OMG French toast.\n\nThis particular location is always busy and loud being close to ASU.\nI recommend going early really early if you want to get a table.\nService is a hit or miss depending on how busy they get.\n\nCheers!
