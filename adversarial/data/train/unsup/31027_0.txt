For just a $2.00 entrance fee you can't beat this place. Very interesting and informative. I haven't been out here in years but today my girlfriend and I spent an enjoyable morning checking it out.\n\nMy only piece of constructive criticism would be that some of the outdoor displays in the ghost town need to be redone. They have become weathered and are often times hard to read.
