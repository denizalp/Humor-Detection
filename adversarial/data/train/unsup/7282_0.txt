The only missing star is for quality of service. Our table for 2 sat for quite some time before even getting a drink order in, and I also noticed another table experiencing the same frustration. My thought is \"your food is incredible SO GET OVER HERE AND SELL IT TO ME.\" With that said, the sushi really, REALLY is divine. I haven't tasted such quality in a long time. It will speak for itself. We had the \"Sushi dinner 1\" (6 AMAZING nigiri and equally amazing spicy salmon roll. Seriously. Do it.) We also had a Tiger Roll (delicious!!!) and the Mt. Fuji roll (gotta do it, right?) I'm not a huge fan of \"California with something on top\", which is what Mt. Fuji roll was, but it was still ++ tasty. With all that plus a Sapporo from a tap and a lovely lemon-honey herbal tea (fresh rhinds), the bill came to $62. Reasonable and well worth it. GO HERE YELPERS.
