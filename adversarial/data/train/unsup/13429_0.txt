Vermont Sandwicxh company is a hidden gem.  We stumbled up this little shop this past week, and there were so many choices we could choose from.  Sandwiches, wraps, and salads.  I had a turkey breast wrap, and the meat was freshly sliced and super thin.  The owner ended up talking to us, and giving us a piece of Peanut butter cookie that was absolutely sinfully delicious.  I am defintiely going to go back for lunch soon!
