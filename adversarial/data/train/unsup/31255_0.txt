It's not Rocking Jump anymore. It is now called Get Air, which is a cute play on words. You can tell that they have just acquired the business because they are still in the process of working everything out with interior paint, etc. They are a not understaffed for the areas. Right now, there is only one person watching 6 different jump places. Kind of hard to do effectively. The wait to check in was long, probably 25 mins. I advise doing their waiver online ahead of time so that you can easily check in. I say in a few months they'll have all their kinks worked out and it'll be even better.
