A true gem, while not downtown, this area is Madison's best-kept secret. Have been 3 times, for 3 different meals, and have been pleased each time. Wonderful place that is clean and comfortable with prices that are fair. Also came here once with a party of 12 and they were so accomodating and happy to help us with questions!
