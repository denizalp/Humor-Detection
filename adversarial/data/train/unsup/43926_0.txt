Tried them for the first time back in April 2017 and the food was good and plentiful. \n\nHave been back about 4 times since and in my opinion, the food hasn't been as good as the first time. \n\nIt's never traveled well. All 4 times their containers leaked and I ended up with a soggy mess in the bag and on my car seats (always take a friend to carry it while driving, especially one that doesn't mind hot brown sauce on their lap). Maybe that's why they don't deliver?\n\nMy last dish there a few nights ago was sweet and sour chicken. Simply not good at all. It was an overlooked oily mess.  Chicken pieces were hard and got 2 rubbery pieces that I had to spit out. \n\nSorry, Li's Bowl. We had so much potential.
