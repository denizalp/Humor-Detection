I was so excited to try this place because my friend had really talked it up and she was so excited to take me here. After spending 45 minutes waiting outside, we were sat at a very small, cramped bar. I ordered the miso ramen, I have to say I've had better tasting top ramen for 10 cents. The noodles had no flavor and the broth was very salty with barely any flavor and 3 small pieces of pork. Am I missing something?? Definitely not worth the wait. I will stick with Ph√≥
