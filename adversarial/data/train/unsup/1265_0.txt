Before leaving Charlotte, I stopped by Paper Skyscraper to get something to take home with me. Probably my short stay in Charlotte didn't create many amazing memories but still, I couldn't leave without something to look back on. Also, I grabbed a very cute bottle sweater for my holiday hostess. The store is filled of interesting gift ideas and thoughtful trinkets. \n\nFour and Half Yelps
