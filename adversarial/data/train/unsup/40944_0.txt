Great news about the sample cups. They are now up front and center and you do not have to ask for them or get a limited supply only.  Lately they have alot of new flavors so sampling is highly needed. Toppings are great too as they have dark chocolate chips now too.  Top yogurt shop in area with good discount club for free 3oz of yogurt every month.
