They say it's the same, but it's not the same.\n\nMaybe because it was my first time and you always remember your first, but this was only passable. I mean, it was still a okay crepe, but not how I remember it. \n\nI obviously got the D'Anjou again. The time before, it was filled with an almond cream that was like marzipan. This time, I think it was a runny vanilla sauce without any hint of almond. The pears were the same, the chantilly cream was the same, the caramel was the same... but where is my marzipan??? \n\nSigh. I say \"Meh. I've experienced better\" but it was them... I swear they gave me better before.
