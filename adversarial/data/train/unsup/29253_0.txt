I've been to some excellent buffets in Vegas, and this was not one of them. \n\nWe went for breakfast, and for spending $50 for the two of us, we didn't get near as much or as good of food as I expected. They offered drinks, but they weren't included in the price (not even mimosas). \n\nThe food wasn't that great, and I expected to get a lot of seafood because of the pictures outside, but besides some sushi and salmon, that wasn't the case. \n\nI recommend the Luxor's buffet instead.
