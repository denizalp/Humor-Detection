I have known Nick for many years as a friend, but had never had the opportunity to use his professional expertise to assist me in selling a property.  Nick is amazing!  Not just experienced and professional, but a huge problem solver.  I am certain he doesn't cherish running into road blocks, but you would never know it.  He would always say \"Don't worry about this\"....and he would then go to work to find a solution.  And he always found a workable solution.  This alone should be the reason anyone would choose Nick to sell a property!  I also found Nick's entire group of associates to be top notch, skilled with helping me through the entire process of selling.  Nick Yale is a bright star in the real estate world.
