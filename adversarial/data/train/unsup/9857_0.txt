We always stay at MGM hotels. We thought we would try this one because it was new, bad idea. Horrible customer service the entire weekend! Account kept getting messed up, Casino staff was rude and not helpful, food was not impressive at all.\n\nThe only good thing that happened was we got a cabana by the pool for one of the days and the staff there was awesome!\n\nwe go to Vegas everything 3-6 months so have stayed at many hotels. So far the best by far is Mandalay Bay, which we almost ended up switching to halfway through our stay.\n\nThe rooms here are nice but since there \"techy\" rooms with full electronic touch pads to control everything you would think they would use \"new\" technology in their touch pads, instead it felt very dated and the design of the software was horrible and it ran slow. \n\nOverall I would not even waste your time here, there are sooooo many more options on the strip then this place.
