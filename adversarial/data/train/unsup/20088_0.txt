We'd heard a lot of good things about this reasonably-priced show so my friends and I were pretty excited to check it out. We'd bought our tickets online ahead of time so I think it ended up being like $30 per person with all the fees and whatnot. When we got to the V Theater in Miracle Mile shopping center to pick up our tickets we were advised to start getting in line around 9:30 (all the shows start at 10pm), as the seats are first-come, first served. They also try to upsell you to VIP seats but we didn't go for that. We got there right around 9:30 and there were already quite a few people in line. The doors did open at 10pm but it took quite a bit longer to get everyone inside and seated, so I don't think the show actually started til like 10:30 (although I'm not sure of the exact time). They also do the whole \"take a picture of you before the show\" so they can try to sell it to you at the end.\n\nOnce the show was under way, my friends and I were wondering if they make the shows start late so people might be a little bit more sleepy and more susceptible to hypnosis? All I know is, at the beginning part of the show where the hypnosis guy was doing his volunteer selection process I was feeling quite sleepy but I managed to power through the rest of the show once it got going. So yes, the show is mainly driven by the volunteers, and we hit a gold mine in this Mexican cowboy dude named Chuy. He was so good, in fact, I had to wonder how the guy could not have been a plant! None of my friends and I volunteered so I can't offer a firsthand account of being a volunteer, but plant or not, the antics of the people on stage were pretty funny. The show went by pretty quickly and we were done by like 11:30. Overall we had a good time but I can't really say it's a \"must-see.\"\n\nSTEPH JUDGEMENT: Entertaining, but not sure if it's a show I need to see again.
