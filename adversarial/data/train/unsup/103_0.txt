I've been here for dinner many moons ago and it was a great experience. I went here for brunch for Easter and I'm glad I did. I think I enjoyed their brunch menu more than their dinner menu.\n\nFor about $50, you can enjoy 16 butler-style table side items and for an additional $20, you get unlimited brunch cocktails (mimosa, sangria, Mojito, margarita, Bloody Mary, and caipiranha). About $30 for kids under 12. Servers with plates\/trays of food go around the restaurant. We were sitting in front of the kitchen so, we always got first dibs on everything.\n\nItems we got just for the heck of it (non mind-blowing but expectations weren't set high in the first place):\nHeirloom Tomato and Mozzarella Salad\nFresh Fruit Salad\nScrambled Eggs\nAngus Mini Burger\nChorizo Sausage Cup\nPancakes with Berry Compote\nTomato Mozzarella Flatbread\nVeal Short Rib Hash\n\nWhat we enjoyed and ate the most:\nCornflake Crusted Brioche French Toast\nMushroom Grits (I smelled truffles when the server passed by so, I had to have this!)\nBaked Potato Loaded Tater Tots with Brown Gravy (do you like Poutine?)\nHam and Egg Flatbread (raw quail eggs)\nEggs Benedict with Chorizo (one of the best eggs Benedict's I've ever consumed)\nEggs Benedict with Filet (you can't go wrong with steak and eggs)\n\nThis is supposed to be a leisurely dining experience so, if you have to be somewhere at a certain time, go somewhere else. I like my Lazy Sundays so this was an excellent choice. Laidback, no worries...just sit, eat, sip and enjoy life!
