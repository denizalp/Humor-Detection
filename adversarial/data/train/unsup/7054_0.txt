How have I yet to review this place?!?!  I guess as often as I've been, I just assumed I had!\n\nNestled in the corner of 7th Street Public Market is where you'll find Local Loaf.  Towers of fresh baked bread await behind the counter.  Muffins, croissants, and more await you in the glass case.  The chalkboard menu boasts a variety of breakfast and lunch options with daily specials peppered in.  \n\nWanna build your own omelet?  They've got you covered with a bountiful list of potential ingredients.  Fluffy pancakes more your fancy?  They do that too!  Brioche french toast?  Yea, baby!  Eggs with bacon and toast?  Over easy?  Over medium?  Over hard?  Sunny side up?  Yes, yes, yes, and yes!  Can you tell I've frequented this place more for breakfast?  Though I can assure you, the lunch options are equally enticing. \n\nThe staff is quite friendly, and most now know me by name.  Adam, the founder, is always busy in the kitchen.  He works hard to keep the menu fresh, making periodic changes.  When you go, you'll place your order at the counter and you'll then be provided with a number to place at your table, or wherever you chose to sit throughout the market.  The ingredients used to prepare your entrees are fresh and local, and you can taste it with every bite.  If you like what you taste, chances are it's available for purchase right there in the market.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?  If your answer isn't breakfast, go get your loaf on!
