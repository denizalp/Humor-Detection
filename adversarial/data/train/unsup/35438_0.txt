Called in as a new patient 2 1\/2 weeks ago telling the scheduling department that I need to see a dermatologist for a mole screening and skin check. The dermatologist was more than 2 weeks out so I set my appointment. They scheduled me for the wrong doctor and instead of Apologizing and trying to correct the error the woman and scheduling was incredibly rude and Dismissive. She couldn't believe that they could have done that. If you treat me like this over the phone how can I be assured that you will treat me well in person if something were to turn up.
