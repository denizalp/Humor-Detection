I recently moved to AZ and wanted to try a local spot. I got on yelp and found this place and it was a pleasant surprise. Great breakfast and lunch that you can tell everything is homemade. The pancakes are awesome, the homemade jelly is equally fantastic. I also recommend the build a burger option for lunch, they have great options like chorizo. The staff is always very friendly and attentive. I had the chance to meet yoli herself and she was extremely nice and outgoing! She even sat down and talked to us and shared her story. Me and my family are now regulars, even when my parents come in from out of town this is the first place they want to go.
