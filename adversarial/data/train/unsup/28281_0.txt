All the food was magnificent, started with the tuna tartare and ceviche, followed by the octopus, Greek salad (which was my favorite), the fried zucchini, grilled vegetables, medium and medium rare steak and the fish which we picked earlier in the evening. What I found extremely unprofessional was the lack of order in serving the wine. The waitress were serving the men at our table first instead of following the proper serving order. I would recommend for the staff to trained in how to serve properly. Rather than serving according to the gender of the customers.
