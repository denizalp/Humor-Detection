I don't understand why anyone would review this place unfavorably. This was my first visit here and the soup dumplings were just perfect and delightful. The Cumin Calamari was so pleasant and spicy, and unlike any calamari I've had ( except maybe a similar dish at wagamama). I'm looking forward to the next time I'm back on this side of town.
