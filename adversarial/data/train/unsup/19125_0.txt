This hotel is modern and chic! My friend and I booked a suite for 7 people online. It was easy and quick. We didn't encounter any problems when we checked in.\n\nOur suite was big enough for 7 people. The living room space had a lot of seats, it had a big flat screen TV, a counter with a bar, and an office desk. The hotel provided an extra bed and the couch could be turned into a bed. The bedroom had two queen sized beds and a TV in the room's bathroom. I thought that was really cool. It was the first time I've ever seen a TV in a hotel bathroom.  I want to install a TV in my bathroom now.
