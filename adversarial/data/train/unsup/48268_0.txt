We actually ordered take out because of the poor service we received the last time.  We ordered the haole Moco and corner beef hash with an extra side of banana muffin.  The hash was a nice serving but it's fresh corner beef not canned....I actually prefer the canned and like when it's done crispy but this was still good! Haole loco looked good (but didn't try).  The banana muffin as always was very moist...yummy! We were overall very satisfied for about $20 and change. I'd recommend take out because their servers aren't very friendly and also not very friendly to kids (under age 5).  Both times we went there they just stuck us in a corner like we were an annoyance.  I must say that there are adults who are just as annoying of not more annoying that kids...so that's that.  Good food....bad servers.
