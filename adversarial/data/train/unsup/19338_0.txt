Buddha Belly Deli. . .what can I say?\n\nThis is my new favorite place. I couldn't be happier. The staff there is extremely welcoming from the moment you step in. The atmosphere is relaxed and fun. Then there is the food. It is perfect. Each sandwich is carefully seasoned and put together. There is a reason for each item on the sandwich. They don't just pick things that everyone would like and serve it to you. No, each ingredient is there to compliment the other. \n\nThe wife and I have already been there a couple of times and I can tell you that we absolutely love the chowder to share. My go to has become the chicken katsu sandwich and she has been ordering the short rib. You can't go wrong with any though. \n\nThe best part, they have amazing desserts! How can one place be so amazing?   I don't know but go there, try everything and hang out with the guys, this place rocks.
