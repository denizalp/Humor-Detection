This place hasn't changed much in the last 15yrs or so and that's what I love! Still looks exactly the same!!! It's not the fanciest or stylish or even cleanest burger spot for sure but that's the best part!!! The salad bar for your burger choice takes it to the top!!!! Plenty of options and even a bar if that's the type of burger eating vibe you want!!! Thx for staying true and the same!!!
