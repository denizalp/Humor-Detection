Since I happened to be in the area and had a taste for Vietnamese, my search landed me here since the reviews were pretty decent.  I wasn't in the mood for pho so I opted for the vermicelli bowl, and spring rolls for an app.  The person at the register wasn't very friendly, but ok.  The food didn't take long to prepare and came out pretty quickly.  The spring rolls were small compared to what I've had before, but they tasted ok.  The vermicelli bowl was very skimpy on toppings but was full of noodles.  Overall, this place was just ok, but I'm use to much better and more quality meals at Vietnamese restaurants.
