The freshness of the food is divine! The chicken salad was so amazing I literally wanted to lick my plate (I didn't bc I am already weird enough). I also have the pickiest 2yr old that barely touches anything and he ate every single bite of a delicious fruit yogurt parfait. I can't wait to go back and try some more of their delicious food. I love that the owner came out and sat down at our table and was genuinely down-to-earth and very kind we will be regular patrons
