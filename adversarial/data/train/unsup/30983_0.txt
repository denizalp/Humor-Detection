Loved it, went for dinner. It's worth the wait. The food was of high quality and seasoned nicely. The grilled salmon was excellent! Also the crab legs are cut in half so it is easier for you to eat the meat right out of it. Has many varieties of ethnic foods. Loved the desserts as well. We came back later in the week for the breakfast buffet which was good too. The eggs Benedict were not my type, too tangy tasting. Go in the middle of week to get best prices!
