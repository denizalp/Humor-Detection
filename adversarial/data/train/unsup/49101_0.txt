I really love this neighborhood vegetarian spot! Whether you're looking for uniquely delicious breakfast fare (jalapeno waffles and a horchatte - yes, I did spell that correctly and it's exactly the beverage combo you'd expect!), fresh pastries, lunch (potato tacos!), happy hour (signature cocktails, locally sourced vino), dinner (jackfruit sliders!)... they seriously have something for everyone in your crowd to drool over and you'll never notice that it's non-carniverous! Plus, they put a lot of effort into being a welcoming community spot, so there's also some fun event going on -- DJ spinning, board games, live music, storytellers. It's just one of those places you always want to be at -- like hanging out at your best friend's home but with way better food (sorry, best friend!) If you haven't been yet, it's totally worth checking out.
