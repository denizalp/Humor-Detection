Not very happy with complete marine  went in looking for a steering system for my pontoon project  bought a rack system steering kit and had to pick it up from marine wholesale like 5 miles away when I got the  package it was one that they have in there   Catalog for $159. And I was charged $199 plus tax ,went back to complete marine, they said they could get the same product but they'ed have to order it from California and I would have to pay shipping ! not sure why they can't honor the catalog price !  \nDoesn't seem right to me!\n$40 mistake on my part \nLost customer for them.
