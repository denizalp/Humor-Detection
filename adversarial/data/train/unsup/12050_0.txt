I'm only writing for the hotel portion.\nHorrible.  Awful.  Smelly.  Uncomfortable.\nbut.... for $58 on a weekend, i guess it had to do.\nThe bed was harder than if sleeping on the floor (which you didnt want to do by the way).  Oh and the bed had rubber sheets!   \nThe water in the shower barely came drizzling out.\nThe decor was circa 1963 and never upgraded.  \nThe oldest tv ever was in this room.  It was barely a color television.\nNo extra blankets or pillows.  Two super thin, used a million times towels were given.  \nOh, and only the best part.... they give you Jhirmack Shampoo! haha
