OK, I'm gonna take one for the team and admit it.  Is it bad that I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place?  No judging now.  \n\nI mean, I usually reject any restaurant remotely chain-like, but Cheesecake Factory, you are one of a handful of respectable chains that I like and frequent.   \n\nAn easy solution when you don't know what you want to eat (you're sure to find something in the menu, yeah, it may take 40 minutes to decide, but whatever), or want to take Aunt Dorothy and Uncle Charlie from the Midwest somewhere fun, but not too edgy or Scottsdale-like.\n\nFunny thing is I've had their cheesecake maybe about two times, because with the ridiculously large portions would I really have any room?  And if you're looking to totally WRECK your diet, this is your place - there's hardly anything healthy on the menu (but they did just start a lite salad menu).  My favorite appetizers are the avocado egg rolls and the sliders.  Grilled shrimp club, BBQ chicken pizza, blackened chicken sandwich,  chicken chipotle pasta, chicken romano, and chicken madeira are all REALLY good.  I guess I like chicken, huh?\n\nFYI, they don't have a kids menu, which is really DUMB, because this place is such a family restaurant.\n\nFor those who care, they have Valet.  I mean, come on, really?  There is a parking structure on the other side of Macy's.  Valet in Phoenix with easy parking situation = lame.
