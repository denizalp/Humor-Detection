Wow these are some harsh reviews. ..\n\nAnyway, I purchased the Groupon Coupon. Made my appointment, Yes my appointment was scheduled very far out (2+ weeks!) but I wasn't in a hurry to get them done. \n\nDay of the appointment, I was a bit lost\/confused as to where she was located. There were multiple offices in building. I finally found it, was greeted but waited a few minutes (my appointment time was now being used)\n\nAfter a few minutes of the previous client leaving she took me in. She listened to what exactly I'm looking for & I loved my finished look. I have paid triple somewhere else, more upscale & HATED IT. She did exactly what I wanted...natural but flirty look.\n\nShe did give me a little TMI about her husband & family\/life but whatever lol...it could've been a lot worse. It's nice to have a little girl talk.\n\nPlus I was in & out fairly quickly..maybe 35 -40 minutes MAX ...\n\nI would absolutely go back..!
