Once upon a time, in a land not so far away (we'll call the land Tempe), stood a little bakery shop filled with some of the tastiest pastries you could find in all the realm. \n\nNearby, after much whirligiggling about, a very hungry little monster's tummy growled in dissatisfaction. The monster search all around, up and down, but found nothing to fix the tummy rumbles. This saddened the little monster.\n\nThen as luck would have it the monster stumbled upon a bakery (we'll call the bakery Arai Pastry). \n\nUpon entering the bakery, the little monster's eyes widened in delight from all the delicious looking treats on display. Cakes, mousses, flans, puddings, puff pastries and breads... \n\nSwiftly the monster ordered up more than plenty of the confectionery items to try. At first gobble the monster was speechless. \n\nThe cake was enchantingly sweet.\nThe cake was so airy. \nThe flavors were delicate;\nYet, strikingly present.\nAND the cake to cream ratio was truly harmonious. \n\n\"Amazing!\" exclaimed the little monster. \n\nWith that the monster's tummy hungers had vanished and the bakery was named the new reigning champion of cake in all the kingdom.  \n\nAnd all little monsters' tummies and pastries live happily ever after. \n\nla fin.
