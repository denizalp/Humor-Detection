Drove through to pick up a late lunch . . . ordered the 2 for $5 fish sandwiches, one \"Nashville\" hot and one regular.They were great! A thick, juicy, mild triangle of crunchy-coated fish overhanging a  soft bun. Plenty of shredded lettuce and tarter sauce. I was amazed at how big and fresh and satisfying they were!!
