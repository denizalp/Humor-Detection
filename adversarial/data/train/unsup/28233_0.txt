Terrible!  Had to wait I  line to park for 45 minutes,  only to stand in line for the stupid wristbands for another hour.  Then, you stand in line for tacos and drinks for another hour.  No seats,  hot,  and not enough shade.  Totally not worth the money.  Why did we have to pay 15 dollars to get into this? Will never go back.  They definitely need a way better system,  terrible planning.
