Though it is not stadium seating it has something just as good, luxury seats that are like the ultimate Lazy-Boy and they can go almost flat. I believe, at some point, they intend to  offer beer and wine but right now it is just the regular soda, popcorn and candy type of options.  Besides some adult beverages i wish they had an unsweetened ice-tea option for us non-soda drinking folks but hey, you can't have everything - the nice thing - you can get here right off the light rail. It is definitely my theater of choice (I will admit, I live in the area and can walk to it). Overall it is about the most comfortable movie viewing experience I've had and the sound system and digital projection is excellent. \n\nI do hope they continue to provide independent movies in one or two of the theaters, as that is a nice homage to the cultural richness of the area and expands the offering of independent film  around the ASU area.
