While searching for a New Breakfast spot to hit up, Yelp came to the rescue! \n\nCame over on a Saturday Morning and there was a considerable line out the door. Hey, this place must be doing something right?! Waited 15 minutes and we were seated. Place was surrounded with Stuffed Animal Teddy Bears, like the ones I used to win at the Circus Circus! Haha, that was a long time ago.. like ancient history!  \n\nWhat I ordered off the 'Black Bear Times\" Newspaper(Menu):\n\nBIGFOOT Chicken-Fried Steak and Eggs: Goliath Sized Dish! The chicken fried steak with the sausage gravy was One of the Best I've had! Their strip-cut hash browns, crisp outside and soft inside, the Biscuits Plump, spread some butter and Gameover!! Not Quantity over Quality.. Quality with Quantity!\n\nHomemade Corned Beef Hash and Eggs: Yes, shredded\/chunks of real corned beef that was consumed in minutes! Too bad this wasn't loaded like the Bigfoot chicken.. dish! The country potatoes with the onions and pepper, soo good!\n\nSweet Cream Pancakes: Better than average, not that sweet and it didn't have the fluff that I prefer.\n\n\nThis Place Rocks!! A Great Way to Start Off Your Day!!
