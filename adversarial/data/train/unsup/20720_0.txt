OK- I know you are not supposed to judge a book by the cover and how many times have I been pleasantly surprised, but I wanted no part of Pike's, I really thought it was going to be average with no reason to think it, just my idea in my pea brain. So, I have lived here for nine years and never step foot into Pike's. \n\nToday I decided to drop in, it was close to three, it is very cute, like an old fashion soda shop (that is a little revamped), a huge drug store clock where it's always ten till eight and cute little memorabilia around. \n\nYou may be asking, well Tonya, why the five stars? Let's start. \nFirst of all my french fry barometer scored it a 'yahoooooo' for my scorched fingertips from the hot fries. I ordered a hot dog with raw onion, jalapeno and yellow mustard. My hot dog was made with love, the condiments went to both ends of the dog, not just in the middle and what really made me happy, the simple act of sprinkling salt and pepper on my fries before serving. I can tell, whoever was in the kitchen, prepared my lunch with love. \n\nI also saw a Coca-Cola float go out with Mexican bottled Coke. Can I get a hell yeah? Sorry I was so harsh and judgmental.
