Do you hate cilantro?  If yes, you'll understand my pain. If not, let me explain: when I eat cilantro it tastes like a tiny-elf foot is rotting in my cheeks.\n\nI ordered off of this location through just-eat.ca.  All the user reviews were 5 stars, and the comments were gushing.   They have a deal now where if you ordered enough food, you get 20% off, so I figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nI will give them this much: it's a lot of food.  That's about the only positive.\n\nThe pad thai wasn't bad, for bad-pad-thai standards.  The two appetizers, a crispy spring roll and then a fresh garden roll, were both awful.  I had requested in the comment section \"no cilantro\" (usually not an issue since cilantro is usually added to dishes at the end), but the fresh garden rolls, which were just some iceberg lettuces in a roll, were crawling with it.  I guess when you're only other ingredient is lettuce, you have to add in something to give it flavour.   Oodles of Noodles had oodles of salt, almost to the point of inedibility.  \n\nI won't be ordering from here again, and I don't understand the user reviews.  Usually Just Eat users are pretty helpful.
