I have been going here for almost a year now and am practically never disappointed. All the masseuses I've had have been extremely professional and used great massage technique to provide me with a wonderful massage experience (Regina and Mandy, to name a couple). There was only one instance with someone else where I felt like that the pressure was not enough (even after I voiced my concern), but it has never happened again. Each time you come in for a massage you discuss your current concerns and level of pressure desired, and I feel like they have hit the mark nearly every time. \n\nIn regards to their skin care, I am extremely thankful for Elizabeth, their esthetician. I have had a facial, back facial, chemical peel, and microdermabrasion, all with Elizabeth and have never been disappointed. She always takes the time to ask about and listen to my top skin concerns and caters my experience to my skin care needs. She is polite and warm hearted, and I completely trust her and enjoy being in her care. I will definitely keep coming back to this location for my skin care needs because of Elizabeth and her expertise.
