What to do in Rock Hill, SC?  Well, I sure found out.....come to IHOP!  Granted it was a Sunday morning\/afternoon but it was beyond packed.  There were the usual churchgoers coming back from service.  There were also friends meeting up, birthday parties, familly reunions.  I think I even crashed a wedding or two at this joint!\n\nIHOP is IHOP; nothing major stood out.  Service was ok and food was actually decent.  The restaurant is pretty big and it's in a pretty convenient location.  I think it was just different to be in a restaurant that also serves as a town hall of sorts.  If you're ever in Rock Hill (pretty random occurance), just follow all the cars over there and enjoy some pancakes.  Watch some episodes of \"Hee Haw\" or \"Mama's Family\" to prepare yourself for the southern drawl.
