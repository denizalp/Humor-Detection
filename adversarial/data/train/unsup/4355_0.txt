The patrons here look like they are all on the same bowling league. Now before you think I'm being snotty, there's something very comforting about a blue collar, good food, family restaurant.\n\nI've had the baked spaghetti and it's delicious. The wine selection isn't very good, but they serve cold beer.\n\nI would recommend this place for a lazy week night dinner.
