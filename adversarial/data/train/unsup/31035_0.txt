I heard so many good things about buffets in Las Vegas. So when I was here for just one evening, I decided to try the one at the Bellagio. I read so many good things about it.\n\nIt was a Friday evening, so I was expecting the worst when it comes to wait time. However, the wait wasn't terrible. I waited approximately 30 minutes. After paying ($42 for weekend dinner), you're placed on a short line to wait for an available table. Drinks are included in the price.\n\nThere is an extensive selection of food available at the Buffet at Bellagio. I mainly lined up for king crab legs. There was plenty for everyone who lined up. The chefs will also heat up your crab legs if you don't like cold crab legs. I tried some of the other items, such as the beef roast, sushi, and pastas, however nothing really stood out. While looking around their extensive dessert selections, I was surprised to find a Paris brest. It tasted just as I expected.\n\nOverall, not a bad place to have dinner if you want to stuff yourself silly. The food is good and they have something for everyone.
