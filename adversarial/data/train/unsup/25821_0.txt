I really enjoyed my experience here at Markville. It can be intimidating to have the army of sales associates around you once you step foot in the store. They usually welcome you with some warm jasmine tea as well while you are browsing the jewelry! They didn't pressure me to purchase expensive things either - they were content with me purchasing gold jewelry. Great service
