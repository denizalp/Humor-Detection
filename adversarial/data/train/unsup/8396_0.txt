Brightly painted in reds and yellows this not your typical optometrists office. There is no corporate feeling here. I'd like to think its hip and chic especially when it comes to us four-eyes. \nThe front desk staff (Jaime and Denise) are awesome. You don't have to worry about that cold \"sit down and wait for your doctor to see you\" attitude you normally get going to any physician or specialist. \nI'd recommend letting them help you pick out the type of frames that work for you. I told Denise that I didn't like metal or rim less frames and that I only wanted plastic frames that were square. Within about 5 minutes I had an awesome selection to choose from. She did try to sell me on some goofy looking Ray Bans but clearly I'm not a Ray Ban kind of girl. With my glasses picked out (black pair of Candies and some really fun all white ones) I was ready to make my appointment.\nIf you're shopping around for a good optometrist Dr Burke is super awesome and extremely friendly by the way!
