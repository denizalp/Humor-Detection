This place feels more like a factory than a store really. When you walk in, almost everyone are busy working, mixing, steaming in the kitchen behind the counter. They typically ignore you unless you start the conversation or picked up some of their items and stood in front of the counter for awhile with hopeful look on your face that someone will eventually talk to you. Service and atmosphere in the store are not something that will make you want to stay there any longer.\n\nHOWEVER, they make AWESOME fresh Bak Tong Goh (literally translated white sugar cake) as mentioned in the review below. That's not the only reason why I would go there, they also sell fresh tofu pudding (tofu hua or taufu fa) in a tub (500g?), which is something I regularly get whenever I'm in the area. Do request for the syrup, or you can add maple syrup\/honey on top of it when you get home.  In the summer, I like a get a tub of cold tofu pudding and eat it in the park with my friend.\n\nThe only thing to take note is that they do overcharge you. One tub of tofu pudding is $2, with syrup (a small container) it's $2.50. It's still consider as really cheap, but 25% increase in price just for a small container of syrup.. ? \n\nI have yet to try a lot of their products, which I will eventually cos they do look really yummy. A lot of Asian Supermarket actually do carry a lot of their products which would usually be in the bakery section. Don't discount them just because of the appearance of the store or the staffs, in my world, nothing beat FRESH.
