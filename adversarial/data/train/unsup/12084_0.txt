I bought my house in 2014 with solar panels already on it. The SC lease was transferred to me. Though I was contacted by a rep and got signed up for auto pay they continued to charge the old owner and not me fore 6 months! We finally got the billing switched over and the monthly auto pay only worked for a few months before it quite without my knowledge. It took nearly a month of phone calls and emails to get the auto pay repaired and I had to pay for several months backpay at once which was a burden. Today I checked my account just our of curiosity and the auto billing has stopped AGAIN! This is almost two years of non stop billing problems all of which are out of my control. This is the most unprofessional and frustrating billing company I have ever worked with.
