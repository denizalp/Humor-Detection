Unfortunately the vegas location does not represent the Amorino brand. I used to frequent Amorino in New York, the unique presentation and quality made it my favorite gelato spot. The vegas location compared in quality bit definitely lacks in presentation. \nDuring my visit I requested a medium size cone and picked 5 different flavors: tiramisu, pistachio, hazelnut, amarena and banana sorbet. As the young lady worked on my cone, she made a center and 4 petals, one for each flavor. The tiny petals didn't even completely cover the center, it made no sense to me as I know Amorino values presentation. This may sound petty but I'm not only paying for quality gelato, there are several great gelato spots in Vegas, I fell in love with the shop for quality and attention to detail. If you're not even going to attempt to have your product represent the brand, why even bother making the cone into a \"flower\"?\nI actually asked the girl (for lack of a better term) if the one petal per flavor is a standard and she said, yes... If in fact was telling the truth and its standard practice, then quality means very little when you're not delivering what patrons pay for. \nI think next time I crave Amorino, I will hold out until my next trip home. Oh and you can go to New York Amorino's yelp page to see what this ship is supposed to be delivering.
