Located inside the Green Valley Ranch. It's in the food court area just upstairs over the movie theatre.\n\nThis is a small attached location with yogurt shop. The community seating for food court can be good or bad depending on how busy it is. When I was there it kinda sucked cuz there were a bunch of kids at the food court I think flowing over fro the movies.\n\nThe staff is friendly. Got my smoothie out reasonably fast and was in the mood for fresh orangy mango taste. Bammm Sunrise Sunset it was. Strawberries, Pineapple, Mango and Orange with extra orange. \nHad it my way and like it!!\n\nGood spot for quick fresh while in thete and not wanting the whole restaurant thing.\n\nAll good - do it!
