First time to try dim sum here on a busy sunday morning.  Had an assortment of dishes, some of the dishes were quite oily and heavy, particularly the pastry\/fried items.  Flavours are more on the lighter side compared to traditional dim sum places.  Liked the fact that they serve hot soy on the side in a jar for you to pour.  Just ok dim sum, not a place that I would come regularly.
