Sure they have black and whites to rival those at the Bagel Cafe, and their selection of fancy cake slices matches that at Patisserie Manon, but the piroshkis and bureks are only found here, on a covered tray above the pastry case. These treats are the best- flaky layers of pastry filled with your choice of potato, meat, spinach, or feta! Delicious, high quality, and oh so satisfying. \n\nThe lahmajoon \"Armenian pizza\" mentioned in other reviews is worth a try- took mine home to heat and eat, an easy lunch when paired with a  salad. Simple but solid flavors, adding Bulgarian feta kicked it up another level.\n\nGrab a $5 for $10 Yelp deal while they're still up, you won't regret it. They have daily specials, like Monday's $1 cupcakes from noon to 5PM. If they ever have a mushroom piroshky to add to the rotation...  I might move in to the apartments next door.
