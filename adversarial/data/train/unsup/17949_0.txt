Solid Vietnamese. Family-friendly and excellent service. While they seem to have phenomenal pho with up to 7 kinds of meat, I actually didn't try any. In any case, their other food was bomb! On their rice vermicelli menu, Bun Dac Biet (B1) was a total meat fiesta with savory grilled marinated shrimp, pork sausage, and sliced pork and a fried egg roll that seemed like a bonus! Then their Banh Mi Bo Nuong (BM3) with grilled marinated beef brightened with carrot\/daikon slaw and cilantro on a bun was so good I didn't want to share! Then my whole fam really enjoyed their Com Ga Nuong (C7)- fried rice full of little veggies topped with super juicy grilled marinated chicken. \n\nFrom start to finish, service was amazing! In fact, we forgot our doggie bag and our server came out in scorching 110-degree weather to find us in the parking lot. Get your Vietnom-nom on!
