I base this review solely on the bento and other dishes.  I dont like to review sushi because I am very picky and its not fair. \n\nThis place had \"grill\" in the name so i thought they might care about more than mass sushi but then again, they had two business names at the same address. Not sure how that works. \n\nOn to the food.. the box was advertised as teriyaki beef.  It turned out to be a very small portion of bulgoki with burnt teriyaki sauce poured over it. The burnt teriyaki sauce was hard to handle but at least it was dialuted by the horrible salad dressing they over poured on my tray making it more of a bento soup kinda thing.\n\nkorean owned and operated japanese resteraunt is the norm but cheese pajun? Really? Sesame oil and red pepper flake for dipping Kaarage? No thanks. \n\nBTW, green tea isnt served in a coffee cup but i guess thats what I get it after asking for a pot of tea three times. You also don't used julienned cucumbers for KappaMaki. People order cucumber because they enjoy them and want to taste and have some crunch. \n \nThe sushi rice is way to wet. If I pick up sushi and wet rice stays on the plate, then you are over doing it. \n\nLastly, if a resteraunt cant do items on the menu then they should  take them off or advertise them as daily.  I drove here because they advertised Hamachi Kama as an appearizer and then to not even have it at all. That was the only reason I came here. If they atleast had it I would have not left a review at all.
