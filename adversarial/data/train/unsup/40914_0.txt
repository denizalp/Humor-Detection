I've been in Pittsburgh for almost two years and this weekend was my first time visiting station square. I was a little surprised by it all. The image in my head was that it would be bustling with people like other similar venues -- Boston's Faneuil Hall and Seattle's public market on a much smaller scale. When I opened the doors to go in, I was surprised at how dead it was. A few shops here and there but no people. I went late afternoon on a Saturday and the weather was gorgeous. My coworkers tell me that station square is more of a summer venue; that there are a lot more activities happening then. Some of the highlights are the location and the variety of restaurants.
