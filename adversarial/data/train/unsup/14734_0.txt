Friendly staff, same yogurt goodness, and boy, I love the jelly bubbles. This Menchie's franchise doesn't offer $5 tubs on Mondays. However, they did honor my phone rewards. \n\nI enjoyed the Green Apple, Pink Lemonade and Pine Apple. I topped it with caramel, jelly bubbles, strawberry, kiwi, pineapple and cheesecake. It was delish!\n\nJoin their FB and get rewards!
