Well hello USNWC, you sure are an awesome way to pass the time! Just one minor complaint, I'm already paying a pretty penny to do some of the stuff there do you really need to charge me $5 for parking? And if you do can you make it so that you accept plastic?\n\nThe park itself though is gorgeous! There's plenty to do from the climbing wall, high ropes courses, hiking\/biking trails, flat water paddling, and of course whitewater rafting. I signed up for a 3 hour high ropes course and it included zip lines, some teamwork challenges, more zip lines, some tightrope walking, and was led by a very knowledgeable and fun instructor. I had so much fun that time just flew by and 3 hours was gone before I knew it! I'll have to sign up for an all day course next time.\n\nThis is pretty much the only park of it's kind in Charlotte, and if you haven't been you really should check it out, just make sure you bring some cash for parking.
