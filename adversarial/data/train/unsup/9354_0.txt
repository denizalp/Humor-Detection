Front office staff is rude and unresponsive.  My daughter got an infection and went to see Dr Garcia.  We were told to call back if anything got worse.  The next day things were worse so we called the office.  No reply.  We called back all day but kept being told that \"we'll call you back in a few minutes\".  Eventually, our calls just went to the office's answering service.  We were furious that her office could be so unresponsive to a sick kid.  We took her to a local pediatric urgent care instead, spent more money to make that happen but it was worth it.  The doctor we saw there was interested and attentive and our daughter got a prescription for antibiotics.  The next day I still had trouble getting ahold of the office staff at Dr Garcia's office.  When I finally got a call back from \"Erica\" at the office, she was snotty and condescending.  She explained to me that her rules state that she has 48 hours to get back to any call and if I got a call sooner it was a favor.  Screw her and screw this place.  Dr Garcia herself seems nice but her office is full of jerks that don't care about their jobs and don't care about your kids.  Avoid this place!!!!!\n\n*UPDATE* Finally Dr Garcia got back to us with a prescription for my daughter more than a week after the initial appointment.  Despite a penicillin allergy and a warning from me and my wife, she prescribed a medicine that is warned against for patients with penicillin allergy.  We just spent the night in the ER with our little daughter covered in hives and miserable from a reaction.  I hope Dr Garcia never gets another patient.
