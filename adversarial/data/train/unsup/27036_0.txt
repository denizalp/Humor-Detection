There are much better dentist offices out there !! My kids have been going there for about 2years and I thought to my self enough is enough the staff is fairly friendly it's the doctors I have issues with the husband and wife duo are annoying they don't listen to you at all the talk over each other as there going from patient to patient. They ramble on back-and-forth and sometimes they even bicker and fight in front of you it's awkward. You are just another patient $$$ to them not a person you can tell they are burnt out they need to slow down and treat you like a person. We won't be going back id find another dentist office if I were you. Again the staff is pretty friendly and the office is clean they have fun things for the kids to do while waiting but the husband wife doctors are awful.
