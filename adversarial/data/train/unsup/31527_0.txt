Salvatore's pizza is hands down just the best pizza around.  I have tried many options--special pizzas as well as those with my own choice of toppings--at both the Sun Prairie and Madison locations on at least a dozen visits.  The consistency of Sal's pizzas is fabulous!  It means the repeat diner is highly unlikely to be disappointed.  Sometimes I order a salad, which has ranged from okay (in dead of winter) to great (in high local market season).  Other menu items tempt but I have not gotten past the pizza yet.  It is that good.  \n\nService has always been pleasant.  The only critique I can offer is that neither location offers much in the way of atmosphere.  The Johnson St. location Is always crowded and pretty noisy while Sun Prairie has little charm (hopefully the new location will remedy the charm deficiency).  But the pleasure of really delicious pizza compensates for the lackluster atmosphere.
