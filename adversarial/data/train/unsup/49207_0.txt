Great place ! Great staff ! The food is so tasty and came out hot and server timed everything perfect. Our steaks came out the perfect temperature and my husbands lobster was amazing. They were busy dealing with a guest that was rude and acting like a grown adult child. I saw he made a review on here  but neglected to say his behavior was very inappropriate how he conducted himself to server and manager. You all do a great job at the DC and my Husband and I will make sure to spread the word in Chandler! Keep up the great work !
