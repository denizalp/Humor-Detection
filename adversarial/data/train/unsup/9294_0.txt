Horrible crew tonight...it's like everyone decided to dumb down for Memorial Day weekend. \n\nOur server with green hair was a bit awkward...\"oh I forgot the diet coke...I heard so many water orders...ready to order?\" You're joking right? Not even, \"let me go grab that real quick.\" No sense of urgency. \n\nThe gentlemen who brought our food out were nice. \n\nAs we were ready to close the check, to our knowledge we didn't know who was a busser and who was a server...the busser comes over and says \"I'll get your server...\" My father gives a confused look...and then a lady comes over and says \"I'll take care of that...(death stare to our table).\" And then she states \"he can't handle the checks he's a busser...AND! He's my son!\" Like you have shirts to differentiate what your job is...\n\nLast I checked, it's a place of business...him being your son has nothing to do with it. Business is business...\"he's my son\" BS!
