We have been going to Greenberg's for 8 years now, average of 2 times per year. The meats are always tasty and they do not skimp on them!\n\nI will admit I tried the potato salad once and it wasn't for me, so I stick to the bag of chips. The size of the sandwich is usually enough to fill me up, anyway.\n\nIt isn't cheap, but nowhere near the prices at carnegie deli (Mirage) or canter's deli (TI).\n\nHead over to Greenbergs, there is a reason for the line but it goes fast!
