We stayed at The D for 2 nights during the Life Is Beautiful music festival. It was very convenient & walking distance to all the downtown happenings, though the prices were jacked up for the festival ($250\/nt!)\n\nThe rooms at the D are decently nice and comfy. No frills, but no glaring grossness either - decor is modern, beds & pillows are fine, A\/C works but is really loud, bathroom was spacious. The hotel overall though, could use some love. The elevators are dreadfully slow, and the pool area is pretty depressing (tiny pool, broken plastic pool chairs, no umbrellas for shade). And like most hotels in Vegas, you have to walk through a stinky, smoky casino to get to the hotel portion. So, there's that.\n\nBut, customer service was above average, and the rooms were actually really sound-proof, so we slept well despite the hotel being packed with festival-goers. The D is located in the \"Fremont Street Experience\", so you have to be okay with a lot of stimulation going to & from the hotel. Once in your room, it's pretty chill.\n\nOverall, a perfectly OK spot to stay for any downtown happenings. I'd like it better at about $150\/nt vs. $250 though!
