Has anyone told you about the White Rabbit? No? No one has reviewed this place and mentioned it? \n\nInteresting. \n\nWell, allow me to enlighten you. \n\nIt's delicious black magic concocted with Frangelico, vodka, horchata, and white chocolate liqueur. Don't forget that vanilla sugared rim. \n\nCall an Uber. Order some tasty well-made cocktails. Tip well. If your conversation lulls, turn your attention to the silent films playing on the tv screens. Go ahead. Try to make sense of them. I dare you.
