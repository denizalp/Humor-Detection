I came in about 20 minutes before they closed with a broken phone looking to upgrade.  Immediately after walking into the store I was helped by a lovely sales representative named Ava.  I needed a new IPhone that same day and even though I came in with only 20 minutes left before close Ava was happy to help.  She quickly showed me all my options and helped me pick the right one for my needs.  She even helped me set it up even though the store should have been closed.  I really appreciated this and her help.  This is a great Verizon store and I highly recommend coming in here if you need help with your phone.
