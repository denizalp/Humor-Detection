Awesome food. And the ambiance is great, especially the patio. Drinks are always poured with a generous hand. Everything is delicious, breakfast lunch and dinner. Dinner prices are a bit high, but completely reasonable for the area. Great for girls brunch, healthy lunch, or anniversary dinner - a can't miss!!!
