'I do not feel like spending the rest of my life writing books that no one will read. It is not as though I wanted to write them.'\n\n+1 for carrying some of my stuff, and +2 for  selection\/layout, but the rest of my used book stars go to price, and i always just end up browsing because i've never come across a bargain,and i still associate used\/second hand items with bargains. (some mass marketed paperback classics i've found cheaper brand new online).\n\ni guess this would be akin to the modern \"friperie\", which sell  the same clothes as a real hospital run thrift store\/ salvation army. this is more of a boutique 2nd hand book store, old fashioned  name and street and storefront aside, as opposed to  visions of books piled high and only pocket change exchanging hands\n.\n if you know how to use the internet or are the type to hunt for deals in places left of center, there's nothing to discover or stumble upon here.\n\nmind you, obtaining books is a story in and of itself, sometimes more interesting than the story that awaits you between the margins, so if you're in the neighborhood, maybe a bagel and book and coffee and jaunt over to a nearby park is greater than clicking  around on the internet. novelty isn't lost on me, okay, it is, but  i'm old.
