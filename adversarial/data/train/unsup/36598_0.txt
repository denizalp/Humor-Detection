Stopped here today and we were pleasantly surprised! Decor is great! Food was very delicious and fresh! \n\nWe've tried a few Thai places in Las Vegas since we moved here in June and this is probably the best so far! \n\nItems ordered: \nThai spring rolls\nGlass noodle salad with chicken and shrimp\nGinger seafood dish\nPad Woon Sen with chicken\nYellow Curry (substituted yellow curry sauce for green curry sauce)\n\nDishes can run a bit spicy, i found, but i am a wuss.
