I just threw my Husbands birthday dinner here on July 23'rd of this year. We have been here before so we of course requested our favorite server 'Wes'. We had a large party, over 25 guests showed up. The staff was so kind and polite. They allowed one of our friends to play the piano and sing in there! Wes of course was do much fun and attentive, all our friends were impressed with not only the atmosphere but the 5 star service as well. Everyone had their meals brought out together and our cocktails were never empty. If you try this place out you won't go wrong with any of the servers there but if you want someone who is fun and incredible be sure to ask for Wes. Thank you Artisan, Thank you Mood & Thank you Wes for such a special time. We look fwd to returning again and again and again!
