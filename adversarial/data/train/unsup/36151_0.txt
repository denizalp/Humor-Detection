Time and time and time again, Nordstrom demonstrates that it delivers world class customer service; that the Nordstrom company hires extremely capable people who understand customer service and who make a personal commitment to delighting customers.  I'm not even going to talk about what they did for me today because it's just the latest example and I've got a half dozen more which I've experienced over the last couple of years.  \n\nI'm not a rich shopper but sometimes I need the best and I need it quickly.  \n\nThank you, this time, to Nordstrom in Scottsdale.  Great fan here.
