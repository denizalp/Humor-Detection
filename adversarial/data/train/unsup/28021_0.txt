I have been here a number of times. My latest visit was just this morning at the crack of dawn, which is very unusual for me. But I figured I was up and hungry so why not get good breakfast. Ordered Eggs Benedict with hash browns and why not add on a short stack it wouldn't be breakfast without them!  The eggs benedict was delicious, Canadian bacon, poached eggs covered in hollandaise sauce YUM! Could have gone without the hash browns not their best day.  But the short stack made up for them they were perfectly fluffy and just what I was craving. Good food and always great service keeps me coming back.!
