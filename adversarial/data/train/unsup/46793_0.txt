We passed this shop and didn't think much of it until a local sent us there. Oh my, I'm glad they did. Hands down the best donuts I've ever had. They're fluffy, fresh, super cute, and come in a variety of flavors. The prices may seem more on the expensive side, but they're not your usual donuts and we'll worth it. I went in one night and got a caramel apple one. The cinnamon on the outside with the caramel drizzle was great. The apple in the center was good too, just like apple pie filling. My friends got peanut butter cup and cotton candy donuts. Super good and flavorful. So good we went back the next day before heading home to buy a dozen! So far everyone that's had one is in love with them too! Please come to Vegas! You'll see me there all the time.
