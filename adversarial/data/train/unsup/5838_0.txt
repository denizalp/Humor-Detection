I can't say enough amazing things about Kate and the incredible team at Bloom & Blueprint! When I booked them, I was under the impression that they were a floral and decor design company only, however, they offer planning from start to finish as well! Major win, a one stop shop! \n\nI had the BB Squad build a fresh flower + greenery wall for our ceremony backdrop and HOLY HEAVEN, it came out even better than I had ever dreamed of! {See photos}. They also put flowers along the aisle chairs to spice up our aisle experience as well. Kate is one of the most talented floral designers that i've ever met and her sweetness makes the entire design process fun and seamless. \n\nTrust me, they can make ANY wedding decor vision come to life. If you have a vision but aren't sure how to make it happen, seriously contact Bloom & Blueprint, they WILL make it happen! Pinterest ideas aren't scary when you have a dream team who can actually create your vision! I can't thank them enough!!!
