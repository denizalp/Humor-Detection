The return policy here is ridiculous. I bought a blower\/vacuum for $89.99, I got it home and a couple weeks later attempted to use it. Hats off and high fives to you men that work these machines like pros. I couldn't seem to get the leaves to blow in a pile, I just blew them all over the place. I saved my receipt, and next time I went to Lowe's I tried to return it. No go. The policy states you can't return power equipment after 30 days. Even if it is in perfect condition (manual original packaging ect.) and you have the receipt. So now I am stuck with a blower\/vacuum I spent over 90 bucks on and can't use. And the chick at the counter was completely rude and condescending. I wanted to smash her in the face with the box. At least then I'd get some bang for the 90 bucks. Lucky for her I completed my anger management classes...
