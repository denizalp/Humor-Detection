We dropped by Town Crier Pub for a quick drink before Blue Jays game yesterday. At 6:15 pm, the place was packed! There were though tables that were empty which were supposed to be \"reserved\".\n\nWe told the waitress we were here just for a quick drink and seemed like they don't really have an open table for 3. We were squeezed into a table for 2...\n\nWe were here for 1 hour or so and all these time those tables were still empty....... \n\nThe Beer list is good if you are into imports! Still a good place to grab a quick drink or 2!
