Went to see My Doll tonight and walked from The Sets.  This is an awesome place to see live music, especially if you are a punk like me!\nIt's really well-lit for a bar!  Never a cover charge, which is always a plus.\nThe shows are always fun and tonight I almost got wiped out in the pit.  500 cool points for that!\nTakes awhile to get a drink from the bar, but that's a good and bad thing.  Good - you know there's a crowd.  Nothing like a dead place with bands playing.\nBad - well, if you're really jonesin' for a drink, you have to wait.  Suckas!
