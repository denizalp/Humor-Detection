Not gonna lie... first time I came to Dilallo Burger, I thought that they had served me my burger the wrong side up. But then I learned that they've been on that upside-down vibe since way before Stranger Things made it cool. I didn't realize that flipping it could make a burger taste better, but the proof is in the pudding. \n\nHonestly, no matter what you order, you can't go wrong. But if you need to try just one thing from this St. Henri institution, it's gotta be the Buck Burger. With capicole, cheese, hot pepper, onions, lettuce and tomato, it will make you say: \"where the buck have you been all my life?\" \n\nIn the immortal words of Missy Elliott: \"Is it worth it? Let me work it. They put the burger down flip it and reverse it.\"
