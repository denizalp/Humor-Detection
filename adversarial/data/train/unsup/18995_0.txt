You know those blind dates you get set up for? Your date shows up, she's kind of pretty, has a nice body and a decent smile? Then you get talking and find out she shares your fave colour and music, and you think \"alright! this might be it!\" Chatting continues and then you find out she's totally whack in serious matters like politics, food, and humour and she has crappy bedside manners? That be Harlem Underground.\n\nAfter reading some great Yelp reviews, I trekked out to Queen West and was greeted by a funky atmosphere and a super friendly, chill server. The menus were hip (like a record) and the content sounded delicious.\n\nFast forward 20 minutes of waiting for food (and being tempted by the mac-and-cheese at the table next to me in the meantime, and thus ordering one for myself), I finally met the Nice Lady (aka my wrap). The first bite was delicious but it got progressively worse as I couldnt find the other ingredients such as plantain, and all I could taste was the goat cheese. Bleh, Too much for me! My girlfriend got the Harlem sandwich with black forest ham, jerk chicken and havarti. I thought this was deeeelicious (minus the triple decker bread) but she found the spice of the jerk chicken too much. So, all you Weak Spices, stay away. Lastly, please don't be a fool like me and get suckered into the mac-and-cheese. You could probably make a better KD.\n\nShit really went downhill after this as the swarm of fruitflies over us became unbearable as we waited 20 or so minutes for our server. Such a sweet guy, but a really untimely smoke break.\n\nToo bad. It all started so good. Maybe will try again some other time when fruitflies go extinct.\n\nAtmosphere - 4\/5 if it werent for the flies. minus a billion points. \nService - 2.5\/5\nFood - 2.5\/5\nPrice - 5\/5
