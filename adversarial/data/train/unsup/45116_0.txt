Terrible service.  I asked for catsup and salt in my to go order.  Was not provided to me.  Then when I opened the sandwich box I had a chicken sandwich not the burger I ordered.   Went back through drive thru.  Explained the problem. Asked for no special sauce on the burger.  I was told to drive around to the front and wait.   When it was brought out it had the sauce on it that I did not want and was missing the onions.  What a mess.  Last time there.
