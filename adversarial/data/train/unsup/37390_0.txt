Pretty cool little toy spot in the arts district in downtown Las Vegas. Lots of unique plush toys for your unique kiddo. We got a Propapanda (Propaganda Panda). My daughter threw it all over the place on First Friday and destroyed it, but that has nothing to do with the store. Definitely worth stopping in for a unique toy or gift.
