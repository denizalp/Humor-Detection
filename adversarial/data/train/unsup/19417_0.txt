Let's start with an explanation of my once BAD review.  One of the employees at the water park, without explanation, told my 13-year-old daughter to \"take off your shirt\" at one of the water slides.  It was supposed to be a precaution, which is not located on any signage on the ride, but my daughter had been on that ride numerous times in the same outfit and never had an issue; it didn't help that the boy followed her to the pool right afterward.  She was scared to death!  So I went to Carowinds infuriated.  The first two people to take our complaint basically patted us both on the head and sent us on our way.  WRONG!  \n\nThankfully, a gentleman named Jerry met with us the next day, because I was seriously plotting an \"accidental\" mishap of one water slide employee down a nice, high flight of steps.  He took our complaint seriously, made sure it was handled the way it should have been handled and asked us to come back to the park so he could talk to my daughter and make her feel more comfortable about returning.  Ninety minutes later my daughter is feeling a lot less stressed, a LOT more comfortable and she has two new friends at the park who have her back.  Having this situation happen in the first place was a seriously bad scene, but I now have proof that the higher ups at Carowinds take this behavior just as seriously as we do, and it's not going to happen again.\n\nUPDATE:  That nice guy Jerry?  Just another CS liar.  Promised to make my daughter happy with future Carowinds experiences and reneged on every single promise.  Not happy with this place.  They won't be getting our money next year, no matter what the \"big plans\" are, and they got six season passes out of us!  We're officially done with Carowinds.  Saving up that six hundred bucks to go ELSEWHERE.
