Ughhhhhhhhh, I wanted to love this place. I was so excited to visit and it just didn't live up to my expectations. The workers were nice and the shop is cute, but the cases were pretty bare in the middle of the afternoon AND some of the cupcakes in the front case were turned over and falling off of the tray. Just looked like someone threw the tray in there and left it - I know Buddy wouldn't be happy about that. Also they had a sign up saying they were out of cannolis....look, I know it happens but it just seems like they could make some more if they run out. It's a bakery right? There were 4 workers in the bakery area that didn't look like they were working on anything the entire time we were in line (and it was a big line). Maybe the show bakery area is used for breaks lol. \n\nOrdered a Napoleon and a Cookies and Cream Lobster Tail. The filling on the lobster tail was great! The outer shell had a weird texture to me but I think that's a personal issue, not the quality of the item. The Napoleon did not taste good to me and was very messy to eat; I had major buyer's remorse on that one. There isn't a place to sit and enjoy your treats outside of the bakery (at least not on our visit) so we took our box and sat on a bench near the canal in the Grand Canal Shops. Overall I'm glad we went but I'm not sure I would go again. If I did go again I would try different items.
