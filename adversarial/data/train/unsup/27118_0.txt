I cant believe I had never been here before. I was craving something cold and fresh, maybe even healthy, why not right?\n\nMy wife ordered a Beef Gyro and I got the Mediterranean Salad. The Gyro was really flavorful! Almost tasted like Chorizo! Which was a good thing! \n\nThe salad I ordered was very large. It had a little too much parsley for my taste but overall the rest of the ingredients worked really well together. The lemon vinaigrette wasnt very sweet and was packed full of flavor. I managed to finish the whole thing and was pretty full for a good while. \n\nPrices were about spot on as to what I expected. About $10 salad and what not. \n\ni would definitely come back for more freshness!
