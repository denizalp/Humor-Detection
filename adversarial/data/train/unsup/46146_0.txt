Wow! Great!\n\nI have really long hair, so I am always hesitant (read:scared) to get my hair cut, but I needed it.  I walked in at 7pm and was greeted right away and they took me in no problem.\n\nThey had a locker for my purse which was nice, and took my coat for me.\n\nI asked for 3-4 inches cut, and told her that I was nervous about it (I've had some bad cuts elsewhere in the past), and she got right to it and went nice and slow and kept checking with me to make sure length was what I wanted.  She was quick and efficient and did exactly what I had asked for and wanted!\n\nThe wash and dry was included and she blow-dried with a round brush - my hair looks so shiny and beautiful and I'm never going anywhere else.\n\nI CANNOT believe that it was only $35! Great deal, great service, great price.  I would highly recommend this place!
