This place is absolutely GROSS! The meat is so fake I even heard that there is sliders in their meat, yes spiders I am not lieing. The service there is terrible! I was wait 15 min for just a cheese burrito like seriously how sad is that?? One time I was their and they out olives in my burrito instead of meat!...like why olivies and my point is they didn't even give me a refund...just terrible! Another thing is that there is always red dots, big red dots all over my taco shell. And there was also a piece of longggg brown hair in my bulk of meat...and my hair color isn't even brown. I will NEVER eat at Taco Bell ever again in my life.
