This is a really terrible company.  I am not altogether convinced that the staff are not crooks.  They tried to charge us extra, then refused to honor our reservation, and were otherwise pretty sketchy. They actually were caught in a lie at one point by me.  \n\nThere are so many other car rental agencies that you can choose from at the airport.\n\nCHOOSE. ONE. OF. THOSE.\n\nLook at the reviews here (and compare them to Alamo and National--and no, I'm not affiliated with either of them). \n\nPlease don't think you will be one of the one or two exceptions if you rent a vehicle from here. If you choose this company, your experience will likely suck.  90% sure.  \n\nYou are in Vegas, but don't bet against these odds.
