Gotta say,,,,I absolutely LOVE the Frank Sinatra Calzone !!! Been eating here for years now and I just have to say the Food is delicious . The Manager Angel Rojas ?? Stand up guy who's very Professional!!! I have nothing but positive remarks for both him and the employees there. If you haven't tried NYPD Pizza yet , You owe your tastebuds this treat.
