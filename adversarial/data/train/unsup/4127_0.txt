Bright side:  Cocktails and wine were very good, the bread was delicious and attentive service gets 4.5 stars.  But these perks did not compensate for overpriced\/under-flavored food.\n\nScallops and pappardelle were bland, and the salmon was dry.  Left hungry because I'm an eating beast and these portions are for people who are OK paying $0.25\/calorie.
