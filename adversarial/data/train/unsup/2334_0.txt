Oh, US Airways.... You were my first. January 25, 1986, I flew on my first jet from Indianapolis to Washington International Airport, and you were in charge. Okay, your name was US Air at the time, but you're still the same airline... or are you? \n\nThis year I have noticed a funny thing. The only doors that seem to shut on time are the ones that are on oversold aircraft. That seems awfully convenient for you. For that, I have nothing but hate. \n\nThree times this year I've watched a boarding door shut as I jogged up to a US Airways gate. Coincidentally, all three times your ticker at the gate has said: THIS FLIGHT IS FULL!!! \n\nGood to know you could overbook the flight, then benefit from a schedule deviation. Those of us who got screwed spend an additional three or four hours in the airport, while you get all the revenue from the oversold flight, with no penalty for screwing the rest of us by putting us on the \"shockingly\" underbooked flight that gets me home in the middle of the night. \n\nIf my outbound flights are ever undersold, you always wait for me. You know what that means? Yep, you do. And I HATE you for it. \n\nTo make matters worse? Tonight I heard two separate customer service reps for US Airways talk shit about passengers well within my earshot. Explain how I can hear that and not blame a lousy corporate culture. \n\nYou know, 1986 was pretty nice, but US Airways has managed to suck a little more every year since then. I wish I never had to fly through Charlotte or Philly again.  You're the first airline I ever flew, and you're also the first airline I've ever actually hated.... with the fire of a thousand suns.
