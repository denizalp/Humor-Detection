I'm giving this place more like 3.5 stars. The food selection here isn't as big as other places but the quality of the food is good. It wasn't even packed when we got there at 630 on a Saturday night. I really did like the mac n cheese here but nothing else really stood out in my mind. \n\nYou have to remember I'm Asian though, as long as there's prime rib and crab legs, I'll be happy.
