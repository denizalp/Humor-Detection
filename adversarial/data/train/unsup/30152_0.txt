The only target I prefer to go to is this one! They are always stocked up and the place is so quiet Friday night! I love that! The Target on Frank Lloyd Wright is always over picked and never stocked up on things. I know a lot has to do with the location of this store (plus for me minus for others being farther away) but when less ppl go to a store, it's in better condition--clean stocked and less crowded! A win in my book!
