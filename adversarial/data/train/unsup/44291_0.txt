Heard of this coffee shop on social media and was very interested in their horchata drink. Went down on a Sunday afternoon and the drinks were amazing!! The only issue I had was the limited seating and no pastries. Loved the Latino vibe and decor made me feel like I was at my grandmas. Hopefully they will have more seating outside next time I visit.
