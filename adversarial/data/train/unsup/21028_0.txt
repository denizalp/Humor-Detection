The front door lady by the name of Marci was very rude, yelled, and snippy to my friend in front of everyone in the waiting room today. Not only was she rude but she exploited and said my friends middle name loud in front of strangers in the waiting room which made her feel very uncomfortable and then later as her and I talked and kept thinking about it,  angry. This is the second time she has been rude to my friend. The first time my friend  let it slide but now she feels it is personal and she don't feel comfortable going in especially when she see's Marci.  When I have witnessed Marci's aggressive behavior, she is definitely  loud on her phone all the time yelling, very arrogant, aggressive personality, which doesn't work well when working customer service and quality. I do love the medicine here but Marci makes sure to go out of her way to make my friend  feel uncomfortable. What a mean impatient lady she is. Everyone and I was effected by her approach to my friend as well and silently questioned what was wrong with Marci. I will and do not allow anyone to continually mistreat my family or friends especially when I witnessed this and my friend spends her hard earned money to receive fair, kind, and the best treatment any where she goes to spend her  money. The dispenseraries out here are horrible in the way they treat certain people. They are like the anti Christ in a way.  They know people need their meds and they use it as a arrogant karat over whoever they feel like choosing to mistreat, I've noticed. It takes patients like me to stand up for themselves and others to receive  the treatment that is expected and deserved. A lot of patients I have personally spoken to other fellow patients  in Arizona and others complain about the same thing. I want a good experience. So does my best friend. I don't want to feel bad like I felt when this place treated my friend bad, inhumane,and unfair. How sad it is and was to me. What a horrible experience.
