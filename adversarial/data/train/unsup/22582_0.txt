I couldn't find the actual buffet location for M's buffet so i'll write a review here... \nHOLY FOOD GODS ! thank you for blessing us with such an amazing buffet ! lol \ndriving from LA to Vegas this was our first stop to get food. Heard so much about the buffet so my family and I had to try it out. We did not stay at the hotel, but it is really nice inside, they had it all decorated for chinese new year, it was pretty neat. Anyways back to the buffet ! Unlimited complimentary wine and mimosas... can I get an Amen ?! haha they also had so many selections of food, I felt like I was dining at the united nations for a moment ! Mediterranean, Thai, Italian, Mongolian, American, Soul Food ?! and many more, wow the buffet here has it all. But not only did they have a great selection, the quality of the food was worth paying for. The deli meat that they had tasted fresh and not store bought lol, the crab legs, the shrimp, so much seafood !! my mind was going nuts! but it tasted so fresh. My body hates me for this but they had a big tub of melted butter on the side for the seafood, yeah this place gets more than a 5 star for me. But not only was the food good, but the waiters here were so accommodating ! Whatever you needed, they were right there in a heartbeat. Honestly cant find anything wrong about this place other than it being kinda cold inside but is that really a problem ? NO. \n\nPERFECTION AT ITS FINEST!
