I was driving along Derry Road just after picking up an item at the TSC warehouse. I was hungry. I needed dinner. I remembered the KFC-Taco Bell combo on Goreway and decided to drop by.\n\nI have never had KFC here. I wanted wings. I saw the $10 chick'n share deal where you get ten hot wings. The only thing was that I wasn't interested in sharing. They were all for me! *insert greedy laugh that goes away after the hunger pangs die*\n\nI walked in. There were a couple of folks eating. I walked over to the counter and ordered. The man handling my order was polite and helpful. He advised that my wings would take six minutes. Cool. It's a good thing that I'm a patient person.\n\nI also got a fountain drink. I went to fill it up with Diet Pepsi. I then came back to the counter to get some napkins. Moments later, a woman in the kitchen said that my wings needed another four minutes. I let the man know that I was going to find a table and sit down with my drink.\n\nThere is free wifi. You don't need a password. It's not the best connection. You have been warned.\n\nI finally heard an order for wings that was ready. I headed over to the counter. I saw an order of fries next to my wings. He told me that the fries were complimentary. I was happily surprised and thanked him. I wasn't expecting free food simply because my wings took longer than anticipated.\n\nI loved my wings. They were hot, but the roof of my mouth was fine. They had the perfect amount of heat, crunch, and meat. Yum!\n\nI liked my fries, too. What's not to like about getting a free order of them, right?\n\nIt's an older store. The washroom is clean. It needs to be restocked with toilet paper, though.\n\nI find that the two closest KFC-Taco Bell combo stores by my workplace are the ones that I like. They have decent customer service and yummy food that I like. \n\nI am still on a fried chicken kick. This place has decent hot wings. I'm coming back again when I'm in the neighbourhood.\n\n(292)
