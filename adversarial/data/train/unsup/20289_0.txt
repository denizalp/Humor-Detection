My brother and I went here yesterday because I bought the Living Social deal. The staff was very attentive from the moment I walked in and sat down (mostly because they were dead, on a Monday afternoon, too). The place was a decent size and looked nice and clean.\n\nThis is why Go Wild gets 2 stars from me:\nWhen the waitress saw my Living Social deal ($20), she stated that it could not be used on any lunch specials or combination specials, which was fine because some restaurants have a \"catch\" to these deals. So, we decided to order a few regular-priced rolls that equaled (and was even more than) the amount of the deal. On top of that, we wanted to go ahead and get the lunch special anyway because the $20 amount was fulfilled. The waitress told us that we couldn't do this even though we were ordering more than the $20 worth of regular-priced sushi. It didn't make sense why they wouldn't let us order the lunch special after that, and the waitress should have asked her manager if it was okay, because in most DECENT restaurants that care about their customers, it would be.\n\nFurthermore, the sushi was just okay.  We ordered tuna sashimi, the Japanese lasagna, the 007 roll, and vegetable tempura. Everything came out fine, nothing spectacular. This place has changed its name so many times since it has opened as a sushi restaurant; maybe because of poor management. I don't know. I wouldn't go here again because of the experience we had there. My brother is a server and fully understands how the restaurant business works, and even he disagreed with their ridiculous policy.
