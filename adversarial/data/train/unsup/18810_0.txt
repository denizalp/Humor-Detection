This place doesn't even deserve one star. I made my reservation in advance and I chose this place because their fees and prices were very affordable. Little did I know I was getting charged three times more of what I had been promised when I made my reservation. \nWe got there at midnight and there was a huge line that wouldn't move. We waited in line for almost 45 minutes while other car rental places people were in and out. \nWe finally get someone to help us I showed her my reservation code and she said she couldn't give me the car I chose instead I was going to get a Chrysler. I was okay with that. Once I was ready to sign for it my bill showed a complete different price from $100.00 for 4 days the price changed to almost $400.00 at first I thought that was with the $200.00 refundable deposit but it wasn't. My bill all together reached the $550.00 nothing closed to what I was supposed to pay. When I complained about it the useless lady at the counter said those were the policies and most of it was taxes and fees.\nThis was a total scam! Why promise compatible prices to their customers and then charge a different amount when you go pick up your car? That should be illegal! \nAfter that we decided to go next door with Avis we got a nice SUV for $204.00 with insurance fees and everything included on the price. There was no line and their customer service was awesome! \nI'm telling you don't even waste your time with this company. We weren't the only ones who went thru this that day.
