Called them to ask about labor rates for a few minor repairs, was met with very rude comments like, \"thats like calling a doctor with a broken leg and asking for prices\".  I asked about changing out rear brake hardware and he quoted me 4 times the amount they cost at the store, and then said it would be $100 in labor just to change out hardware, its like a half hour job, should be like $50 tops.  Most of their reviews are just plain fake, they werent even open in Goodyear yet and they had like 10 five star reviews.
