My husband and I just purchased a 2013 X3 from Desert BMW. We were fortunate to have Trent Jenkins as our sale representative. Mr. Jenkins was very professional and knowledgeable about the vehicle. We appreciated Mr. Jenkins politely and patiently showed us all the vehicle's functions. \nWhoever service the new car forgot to fill in the gas When I called the next day, Mr. Jenkins asked me to take the car back and he filled in a full tank of gas with no questions ask.  He also bought me a gift (out of his pocket) from the BMW shops to apologize for the mistake the service department made.  We highly recommend Desert BMW. When you go there, talk to Trent Jenkins and he will find you what you want.
