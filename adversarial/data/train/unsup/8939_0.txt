i received a 20% off coupon for my birthday on my phone. Decided to do some shopping today. The cashier scanned the coupon and told me I couldn't use it because it was only for regular priced items. Then she scanned a coupon she had and it only took 30 cents off my total. I walked out a very unhappy customer. Definitely will not go back. HOBBY LOBBY is my store!
