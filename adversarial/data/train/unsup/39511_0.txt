HOLY MOLY!!!! This little hidden gem is AMAZING!!! The Chamango was phenomenal, during other visits I have had thelime, tamarindo,  guayaba, gansito, and Yogurt de Fresa ice cream. ALL WERE TO DIE FOR!!! \nIt is a hit or miss on the wait, the first time I went the line was out the door, but it really does move fast, and is definitely worth the wait. Everyone is very friendly and are willing to keep the samples coming. :)
