WOW- I dont even know where to start with this place! First of all, even though we were staying at this hotel (Wet is part of MGM Grand hotel), we couldnt get in FREE unless we were on some type of guest list. After talking to a lifeguard, we somehow managed to get on a list by randomly texting a person that works there (although we had no idea who he was). We were also really excited when he text us back letting us know that he would also be reserving us a day bed. \n\nAfter going through 2 lines, before we actually went in-they searched the hell outta of my purse. opened my wallet, checked the inside on my sunglass case, and every mini pocket of my purse. Can't bring outside food, so I had to toss my snack I brought. (oh well). We then attempted to find our day bed only to be told that we had to rack up 500 bucks in drinks\/food to have it. All the seats around the pool were reserved for VIP or daybed guests, so basically--if you CANT afford to rack up a HUGE bill, then you're stuck setting up your towel on FLAT unconfortable CEMENT. Dj was alright and all the chicks wear HEELS with their swimsuits (totally not my style!). Everyone was kinda of BLANDO--i would expect people dancing, but in my opinion--totally not worth it. We stayed in the regular pool area the rest of our days at this hotel and had way more fun!. Also, if you aren't on a guest list its 20 bucks for girls and 40 for guys...prices change depending on the day though.\n\nThere are 2 pools in this area and real nice waterfalls in background, but again- totally not worth going outta of your way for. The regular pool area plays good music as well....and if youre more interested in listening to club music, you can hear it by sitting the other side of WET-in the regular pool area!
