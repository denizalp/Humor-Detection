I like this boba place! They have so many flavors and a big menu. The guy behind the counter was very patient and explained to me and gave us recommendations. I had the taro black tea with boba, little sweetened. It was perfect. I like their boba as well, not too hard nor too soft. \nThe parking is indeed a pain in this plaza given the Vegas standard.
