We figured we would try this place instead a chain restaurant trying to support local business, but that was a bad idea.  Ordered a reuben and it was nasty, they grilled the meat and not the bread!!   Who wants a reuben without grilled bread? and dryed out grilled meat? Also got the antipasta salad, would have been better with more topping and none of the house tomato blend which is tomatoes in various sizes, large pieces of onions and some green pepper with way to much oregano.  I guess it is italian salsa and it sucks.  I guess it is a good way to use cheaper banged up tomatoes.  The menu says it is on the steak hoagie too and I can imagine how nasty that would make a steak hoagie.  I would never go back.
