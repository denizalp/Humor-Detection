Although I miss my Paradise Caf√©, I can still get some of my favorite things here at Panera.  This location is convenient when shopping or for a working day lunch.  Although Tempe Marketplace is a busy place, you can usually find parking not too far away on a weekday. \n\nMy favorite is the 1\/2 & 1\/2 -  your combo choice of salad, sandwich, flatbread or soup.  I usually get the tomato soup, but opted for the Autumn Squash along with 1\/2 a chicken salad sandwich.  The service was pretty speedy - they brought it to my table when ready.  Everything was tasty and fresh.   Just what I needed.  \n\nI noticed they had iPad stations at the entrance for preorders, but I didn't take the time to check them out - they were being used, so will check that out on my next visit.
