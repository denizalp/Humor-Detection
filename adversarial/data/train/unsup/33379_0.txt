A few years ago I was incredibly to move to the city on my own. I knew no one and was baffled at how I was going to move each year with no support - until I met the staff at STORExpress. For three years now, they have been my \"family\" in the city when it comes to moving. They support me physically and emotionally during the most stressful days of moving, and make me feel significantly less alone in the process of transition. I can't say enough good things about the people that work here. Amber and Gary took the time in my most recent move to help me repack my boxes that had fallen apart and gave me tape for free. They gave me bottles of water and refilled them, and helped me find the perfect unit to meet my needs. I don't know how I would've moved without them this time or any time in the past.\n\nIf you're in downtown Pittsburgh and need a storage unit, there is nowhere else you should go. Do yourself a favor and do business with these amazing individuals.
