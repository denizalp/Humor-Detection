Booked through a third party online site. They said everything was included for the nights and I paid a flat rate all the way through for a week. When checking out, they charged me $22 bucks for resort fee. I complained and the lady behind the counter was pissy and argued with me. I took out the paperwork of my booking and it stated nothing about a cheesy resort fee. The booking site covered my ass and the staff refused to do anything about it. I asked for a manager and the lady took my paperwork. The manager said to waive the fee. SCREW YOU AND YOUR STUPID RESORT FEE! I rather stay at some nicer hotel if I knew there was some stupid fee you tack on after the stay. \n\nAlso, we experienced 2 rooms that did not get clean. Both the rooms were on the same floor. Both rooms didn't get cleaned on the last day of our stay. No new towels, or accessories. Bed wasn't made! WTF? GET Out
