We had a problem with our order through the drive-thru and the manager Hugo expediently addressed the issue. He exemplifies excellent customer service. He exceeded our expectations and helped make a not-so-good experience in to a five-star-worthy experience. All restaurants should be so lucky to have such a gentleman manager! Thank you again!
