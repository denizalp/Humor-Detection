They are very nice and good at selling pools. They were recommended by a friend who is now sorry too.They built my pool about 6 yrs ago. Wow! did it look nice. However quickly fell apart. Started with the decorative stone (sand stone?) it just crumbles into the pool. Obviously not meant to get wet. 1\/4 inch Gap appeared between the tile and deck all the way around. The bottom has two cracks in it. Yet I continued to brag about this great company that built my pool. I was in denial. I did not want to admit I purchased crap. There is a leak in the plumbing somewhere under the pool rendering it now useless. It might not be so bad if their warranty outlasted the half-assed workmanship. Sure Lisa and Cohl are nice, but they are not the ones building your pool. It is built by losers that have no skill or pride in their work. To be fare they did offer to try and see if we \"could maybe work something out\" after I complained. At this point I am too disappointed and disgusted to even allow them to build me a dog house. Customer service is everything they say. When spending 30 thousand dollars I would rather have quality.
