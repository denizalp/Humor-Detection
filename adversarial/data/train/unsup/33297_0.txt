My wife and I have been coming to Gelato 64 for years. We have always been blown away with the stellar selection of favors and we love the modern look to the place. If you are a fan of unique fruit flavors like I am you will love it. I always get flavors like Pear, Kiwi, Apple, Guava or Passion Fruit. My wife likes more traditional flavors like chocolate and strawberry. There is a flavor for everyone! \n\nThe service is always outstanding and they never seem to get annoyed by customers asking to sample lots of flavors. The prices are a little high in my opinion, but it's a small price to pay for our favorite dessert destination. We tried Frost and hated it... It didn't have any of the unique fruit flavors that this place has. Don't believe all the hype about Frost, it sucks. \n\nGelato 64 has amazing flavors and great service!!! We can't say enough great things about this place!!!
