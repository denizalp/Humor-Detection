The sandwiches are going to be the same as all the other subways. Unless the really screw it up. They didn't manage to do it, so the three stars were for their service.\nI had to wait for awhile for someone to come out to help. No one up front. Actually UPS was there waiting also. Someone finally came out, was going to make UPS wait until I was served. I told them to take care of UPS first.\nGot my sandwich and poof! gone.
