I went here during the middle of the day this past weekend, NOT at night, so I can't comment on how it is as a club.  Upon entering we were given a tour of the place, which I recommend to anyone stopping by.  After being awed, we chilled at the outdoor area.\n\nIt was a great place to kick back and chill, and it had a nice view of the strip.  The drink menu was over the top, and one of my friends got really buzzed thanks to the bartender messing up the drink order and making an extra martini (I was surprised that they actually gave the extra drink to us).  However, be sure to watch your tab; they automatically tagged on a 20% tip to my friend's bill without him noticing.\n\nWe weren't here late at night or during any huge games, but I highly recommend it as a stop to kick back and enjoy a few drinks away from the smoke and flashing lights of Vegas.\n\nFor a few moments, at least.
