Nothing beats something warm and hearty on a cold winter's day. The staff are really friendly and service is prompt. I tried their Curried lamb wrap and Ravi stew on one occasion and on another their porcini mushroom wild rice bisque and their Flank Steak Wrap. \n\nFrom the recommendation of the cashier, I got the Ravi stew which had a nice kick to it from black pepper. The Ravi Stew was hearty with various vegetables and chunks of meat. The Curried lamb wrap was really flavourful, it had a good amount of both vegetables and meat.\n\nTheir mushroom wild rice bisque was no joke, it was filled with mushroom and had a nice peppery taste to it. It was so hearty and paired with their Flank Steak Wrap, it made such a winning comfort food combination. The Flank Steak Wrap is usually good but when there's the perfect amount of sauce and wrapped so it doesn't fall apart, it's amazing! There's something savoury about having a wrap with sweet potatoes which gives the otherwise regular wrap a unique twist.\n\nI highly recommend getting the combo since it's a great deal.
