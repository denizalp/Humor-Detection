I stumbled upon this place when I got lost driving a new route to my relatives in North Vegas.  It's a smallish place, and very sparsely decorated as someone else said.  From a presentation standpoint, these cupcakes are very pretty.  I decided to go with the six pac.  I had two chocolate, two red velvet, one white with whtie frosting and a pumpkin.  Average price was about $2.50 each.  The guy behind the counter wasn't skinny, so I knew he had eaten enough of these cupcakes and probably enjoyed them, a good sign.  He did admit later that was the case. \n\nI am a sweet tooth, but whenever I buy a cake or cupcake, frosting is the second most important thing on my mind.  If you have a tasty cake, the frosting can only make it better.  But if the cake sucks, I don't care what is on top. That's just me, I guess. From a texture and moistness standpoint, their cupcakes were average, not moist enough to be great but moist enough. A great cupcake has that rich mouth feel from the butter or whatever fats are used. After it sat overnight in their closed plastic container, it was even more dry and I only ate part of it before tossing it.  \n\nIt did smell pretty good in there, so I knew it would taste at least okay.  The pumpkin, white, and chocolate cake for me was average, but red velvet is IMO the best of the ones I tried. I think maybe the addition of red dye to the chocolate batter gave it some additiona flavor as well.  Ironically it may have been the cream cheesy frosting that made it better, too.\n\nAll in all, not bad. We need more cupcakes in this world.
