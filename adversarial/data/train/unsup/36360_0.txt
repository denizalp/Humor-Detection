There is something about hanging out on the sidewalk in mission that gives one exposure to the vast ranges in lifestyles of Calgarians. From the patio, to the North I can see Master's Gallery. Directly south is Mercanto. And yet, the street with everyone to young professionals with dogs the size of my big toe to strange down-on-their luck people. The dichotomy characterizes the area so well.\n\nI had a Vietnamese coffee which they surprising served cold. The coffee was fine, but I don't think I would drink it cold again. Cold didn't feel right to me.\n\nAll in all it's a decent coffee shop. I would like to try the food next time.\n8\/30
