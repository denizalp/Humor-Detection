On my most recent trip to Michaels, I was looking for supplies to decorate my graduation cap. Of course, this wasn't my first trip to the rodeo. I've been to this location in the massive shopping center that is Centennial Center plenty of times for my sporadic moments of craftiness.\n\nThe store itself looks dated. The one on Deer Springs is much newer and dare I say, larger. Employees are hard to find throughout the store. The only time I seen one was when I was being informed to hurry my ass up because the store was closing soon. \n\nIf you're not using a coupon when shopping at Michaels, you're doing it wrong. Anyone with a smartphone can go to their website and pull up the latest offer of the day. I scored 20% my entire purchase on this shopping trip. \n\nIn sum, not my favorite location but it'll do in a jiffy!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #98
