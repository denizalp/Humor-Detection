My uncle passed away and I came in from California.  I expected the mortuary to try to take advantage of the family because there was no pre need planning.  I was pleasantly shocked by their reasonable approach to the arrangements.   Phil the director went way above and beyond to make sure that everything went exactly as we had planned.  I had spent 3 days preparing a PowerPoint presentation and tried everything to get it to work but couldn't.  I was devastated.   Phil to the rescue he had their media person put it in the proper medium.   It meant so much to our family.   I highly recommend this business.  I would have given more than 5 stars if it was an option.
