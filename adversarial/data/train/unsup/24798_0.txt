Experience:  we were headed to Color Me Mine, when my friend said, \"let me buy you an ice cream for your birthday\"....well, ok!  This is my first time here, so I was curious anyway. \n\nFacility: it's a small narrow shop that has a few seats and a long ice cream counter.  It was clean and well organized, and smelled like heaven. \n\nService:  I ordered \"Sweet Cream\" and the guy helping me grabbed the tongs and went to scoop, but it still had chocolate on them and swirled right in....oh no, this girl doesn't eat chocolate. So, I told him to just give me vanilla. He seemed a little irritated, but got new spatulas and got me the vanilla.  The rest of the time, he was friendly, so no complaints here. \n\nFood:  I ordered French Vanilla with coconut and macadamia nuts, topped with toasted coconut in a waffle cone. I was so excited to be able to pick my own flavors!!!!! I'm so picky when it comes to sweets. It was so good!!!  I loved the touch of coconut and the crunch of macadamia nuts!!! It was one of the best ice creams I ever had. \n\nOverall:  I'm not a huge sweet eater, but who doesn't like ice cream?!? Crazy people...that's who.  ;)  So, if you're gonna get ice cream, why not come where you can pick the flavors!  It was so yum!!!  I won't be back often, but I'll be back!
