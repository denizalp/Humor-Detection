Crabsssss. The seafood crabs and not the other one that you can potentially get in Vegas...\n\n4 full plates of crabs, 3 prime rib, some other things and 4 mini desserts and a crepe. Yes I ate that all and I have Betsy S. as a witness. It was quite gross to see me eat all of that. Or maybe amazing if you see someone like me eat that much. The buffet food was okay, the crabs had no flavor though, so I make my own flavor sauce. I don't eat it with butter. I take a bunch of lemons and squeeze it out to make lemon juice and  then put some salt and pepper in the mix. That's all. Simple yet delicious. The prime rib was okay only when it wasn't well done.\n\nWhen we went there wasn't a line, we beat the dinner rush and it was awesome! Overall it's not like your buffet at Bellagio or Wynn or anything. But it's pretty decent for the pricing especially if you join their membership you get like a 15% on your first buffet. Also there wasn't anything \"spice\" about this buffet.
