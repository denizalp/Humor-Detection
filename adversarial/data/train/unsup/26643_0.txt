More of a sports bar and drinking atmosphere than a sit and dine one. The food is good sports bar fair with Greek fast food. Chicken wings, home burgers, souvlakis, hot sandwiches &  fries. All available for take out as well. A must try item on the menu is George's homemade lasagna. Absolutely awesome.
