This was one the stars of our stay at the Palms Place.\n\nI have always liked the Lounge-Bar concept: comfortable couches, minimal decor, in a dark color setting with metal colors and nice house chill music.  I don't need anything else. And It seems like the people who envisioned this place did a good job, because i didn't feel like going anywhere else. \n\nAs i walked by the absurd lines to get into Rain or Ghostbar...it felt good to know that there was this little place called Rojo Lounge waiting for me, where a fun and good looking bartender was about to serve me a drink in less than 5 minutes while i sat at the bar and enjoyed my boyfriend...  all that immediately after a high class hooker with bad ass tattoos lit up my cigarette...Its Vegas after all.
