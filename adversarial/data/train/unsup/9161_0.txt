Noble Beast is great because they carry the frou frou organic dog food (Canidae) that we feed our puppy. I never thought I'd be one of those people that gives their dog organic food...never did I think I would find myself on a website such as dogfoodanalysis.com. But alas, thanks to a friend of mine I am now enlightened to the world of pet nutrition. \n\nI actually don't think the Canidae is really that much more expensive than what you get at Petsmart. The 13 lbs bag is $22. I mean if I can spend $22 on an entree at a restaurant I can certainly spend it on food that will feed my dog for a month. They have a decent food selection, the organic toy and gift section is a little spartan. \n\nI'm deducting a star because of their hours. They are only open until 5pm on Saturdays and then closed on Sundays and Mondays. If you are going to be closed two days in a row you shouldn't close early the last day you are open.
