The spa was Beautiful. I absolutely loved the decor of their lounge area and they did have an outdoor natural looking patio outside which gave a nice touch to their modern spa. I got here after sunset so have no idea how this place looks like or is during the day. When I walked in the staff was super friendly and our receptionist who was having a little trouble serving us in English did her best and then we finally switched to french which was fine. They only provide 2 towels and you have to bring your own robes, sandals and bathing suit. I didnt have any of the treatments or massages so will not have any comments on that either. The snack bar was great, I had their hot chocolate and yogurt parfait, because they were closing then too. The place was average size not too small because they had 2 saunas, a small relaxing room and a steam room. Not big either because .. well they have only small sized saunas and baths too. Plus the relaxing room was really small and didnt really leave everyone much privacy. But I loved the concept and the modern touches they added. There wasnt really any total silence policy so its great for couples or small groups of friends to come relax. I wil come back to this place in the summer when they open their big windows and to soak up the sun.
