[Part 2] Not entirely bowled over by Black Lasagnetta, the Fennel unfortunately overwhelming any hint of Truffles even though the Lemon did a marvelous job of accentuating a sizable portion of Shellfish, it was straight from the kitchen's two-day-old Pizza Oven that Chef Trees' delivered his Clam Pie featuring Lamb Sausage and a touch of Chili Oil, the Sourdough base bubbling up nicely with a big cornicione and maintaining its structure without being limp or 'wet' at the center.\n\nOffering only three Meat entrees, the most intriguing by far a roll of Porchetta made in limited daily portions and offered on a first-come-first-served basis, it was with the same share-plates still in place that crispy skin was sawed at with a butter knife before finally being able to enjoy the spicy Pork, a late arriving plate of Cacio e Pepe actually proving to be a well-placed 'side' in the same way Macaroni and Cheese often accompanies Pulled Pork or Barbeque Ribs.\n\nAt this point finally refreshing serviceware and reciting three Desserts tableside, an all-in approach clearly the only acceptable way to finish, it was beginning with thin Panna Cotta lined by Basil Oil and Huckleberries that palates were gently transitioned from savory to sweet, the Dark Chocolate Tart and Butterscotch Pudding targeting two entirely different ends of the spectrum with the former boldly bitter but well balanced by its accoutrements while the latter falls somewhere between STRIPSTEAK's Macallan Butterscotch Pudding and Pizzeria Mozza's famous Budino in terms of booziness while outperforming both in terms of texture by way of crushed Honeycomb and a dollop of Whipped Cream.\n\n*****What does it take to pour your money, sweat and time into an off-strip restaurant in a city built on multi-million dollar marketing campaigns and implosion economics?  Some might say a lack of common sense while other may say a lot of guts, but whatever it is that brought James Trees back to Las Vegas to open Esther's Kitchen the whole city should be grateful because bite-for-bite and dollar-for-dollar this may be the most heartfelt Restaurant to open in a decade.\n\nRECOMMENDED:  Polpette, Weiser's Parsnip Risotto, Rigatoni Carbonara, Bucatini All'amatriciana, Chitarra, Porchetta, Butterscotch Budino.
