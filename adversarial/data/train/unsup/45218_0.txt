Always a treat we have come in here when we visited Arizona the last few times. And now we just recently moved here and have taken visiting relatives there every time they come. We love the fresh tasting ice cream and homemade waffle cones and always nice to see the different flavors my girls love it. And I have to say the service is excellent.  They usually come by and  ask us if we need any water and help my girls with coloring books. Just a very friendly atmosphere .Keep up the good work.
