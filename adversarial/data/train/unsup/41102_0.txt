I have been here a couple times for dinner on a weeknight. It is a great Italian restaurant, if you go after 7 on a weeknight it's super easy to find parking and you won't find the place crammed. (I've heard weekends are super busy and unpleasant because of too many people around).\n\nThe food is really great! I've had both Pizzas and Pastas and they are both fantastic but I prefer the pizzas here. They have an amazing whole wheat dough for the pizzas that was so delicious! The service is friendly and attentive and it's definitely a great meeting place for friends and family. Not so much on the romance but there are tons of romantic places for dinner, head here for a nicer atmosphere for dinner with friends or a group!\n\nI've also had the takeout from here and it was great. Surprisingly the portions were wonderful and their takeout containers are actually conducive to takeout, so you don't have to worry about soggy food or food jumping all over the box in a car ride when you take out! I definitely recommend for a fun night out with a couple people!
