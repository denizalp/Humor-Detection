Tried a one hour massage in the student clinic because yelp states that they open at 9am and I try to get out of the heat before 11am in the summer. It turns out that they do not open until 930am. I scheduled a morning appointment for a couple of days later. Oddly enough, they wouldn't schedule the appointment unless I paid in advance or gave them a credit card to hold the appointment. I paid cash and was not even provided with a receipt (I deducted one star for this weird policy).  I have had massages for many years and normally payment is not expected until after the massage. The facility is clean. The massage was great (thus the four stars). The student was very nice. The cost of a student massage is a little high ($33) compared to Spa Pima on Dobson in Mesa ($25) and I will probably return to Spa Pima once the weather cools off (they only have morning appointments on Friday and Saturday).
