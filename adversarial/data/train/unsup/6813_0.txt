Got in before lunch rush, tho wasnt really one. Had med salad...good size with ample toppings but hardly any dressing. Had some med pizza...this was really good. The fries that had the seasoning on them were really good, otherwise just average.  Prices were fair.  Im afraid that if they were much busier, service would have been too slow, but for us it was ok...I should have left some of the onions on the plate-in dire need of a mint:)
