I am a regular at stingray sushi. my friends and I go there ALL the time. tonight we were there and we had the worst customer service I've ever experienced. her name was rachel and she didn't once check on our table. she also was irritated when we wanted to wait to order our sushi after the appetizers. never once did she ask how we were or make any sort of conversation with us. we will be back at stingray because of the quality of food but will be requesting anyone but rachel as a server.
