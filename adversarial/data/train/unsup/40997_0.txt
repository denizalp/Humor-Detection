I was hoping I would like this place. But I'm not sure what to make of my visit there today. I ordered Huevos Rancheros. First of all they ran out of breakfast potatoes, and then my egg yolks were cooked all the way through. I found the dish to be very bland.\n\nOther than that the place is very nice. I enjoyed the atmosphere. I will try it again.
