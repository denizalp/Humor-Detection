I'll admit I was a little nervous heading to Scarpetta after a lot of mixed reviews I have read since its' opening this past summer and the Yelp rating wasn't entirely supportive of this restaurant as well. But I am here to help bring up its' rating as I believe this place is a solid 4 stars.\n\nI made a reservation a week in advance for a Wed night (if you don't have reservations for a weeknight, I noticed a lot of empty tables late in the night around 930\/10ish). My date and I knew we had to try some of Conant's signature dishes ie the Creamy Polenta and Hand Made Spaghetti. We also tried the Raw Waygu Beef and the Veal Tenderloin. \n\nSo here's the run down:\n\nCreamy Polenta: Comes with a truffled mushroom sauce and this is by far the best Polenta I have ever had, it is just melt in your mouth goodness.\n\nRaw Waygu Beef: This was the only dish of the night where we thought it was just \"meh\" as the true taste of waygu beef isn't brought out very well raw and the nuts and seasoning over power this flavorful meat.\n\nSpaghetti: Magnificent and dense mountain of handmade pasta with the right hint of tomato and basil marinara sauce\n\nVeal Tenderloin: Extremely tender pieces of meat and a dish that all guys (even gals) would truly enjoy.\n\nCoconut Panna Cotta: This came recommended by our waiter and all I got to say is WOW. I'm usually not a huge dessert fan but this is one dish you can't pass up. \n\nI'm definitely a fan of the food and would disagree with a lot of the harsh critics out there. The service was impeccable and the tables are arranged with a lot of room in between so it's a very happening yet relaxed environment. My only complaints are its' lighting as it's pretty dark inside the restaurant, the hostesses in the front are sort of useless, and the seating is just ok as I started to get a bit uncomfortable near the end of dinner. If you had doubts before just go and try for yourself, I did and I'm certainly not disappointed.
