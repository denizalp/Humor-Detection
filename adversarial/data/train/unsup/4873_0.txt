3.5 stars - Please don't take me wrong!  I do like Shoushin though I don't love it.  My husband and I both had the omakase A ($80) and thought it offered decent but not outstanding value for money.  Everything was fresh and delicious but somehow failed to wow us.  \n\nService is awesome!  Our servers are extremely attentive and our tea cups were constantly refilled.  The hinoki cypress sushi bar and platforms are so beautifully zen!  \n\nThey didn't have liquor license when we went last week.  So if sipping sake with your meal is important to you, inquire when making reservations.\n\nDinner options:\nOmakase A $80\nOmakase B $120\nOmakase C $250\nFor an extra $4, you can upgrade their standard dessert (red bean jelly with matcha sauce) to a black sesame puff. Recommended.\n\nHonestly, I have trouble understanding their pricing structure.  IMO, a resto that charges 80\/120 per person is highly unlikely to be the same one charging $250. The latter ambitiously pushes the range of Hashimoto which offers authentic kaiseki!  What you get by paying $250 for omakase C is that you get an additional wagyu course plus some upgraded sushi over omakase B.  In Japan, a decent wagyu feast fetches $120 up.  So paying a $130 increment for a single wagyu course really doesn't make sense to me.\n\nUpgrading from omakase A to B, the difference is $40 for a sashimi course.  Again this is a little bizarre!  I'd much prefer to go to Sushi Kaji @$150 per person.\n\nIn short, if my friends invite me to Shoushin, I'd be pleased to visit Jackie again.  But I'll stick with omakase A.  If it's my call, then I'll most likely suggest Yasu or Zen.  In Toronto, we've got plenty of good choices at the $80-$100 and the $120-$150 ranges!
