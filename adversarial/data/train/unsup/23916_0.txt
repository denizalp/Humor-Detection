I am really surprised this location has so many glowing reviews! I came here while I was on vacation shopping for possibly a handbag and maybe a wallet. The salesgirl that helped me Christina was GREAT. She was not pushy, just really helpful. The problem arose when within 2 seconds of her walking away from me I felt like the vultures were circling around me and this was every time she left my side. The saleswomen were all nice, but I swear I was asked more than 20 times if I wanted to try something on, \"that looks amazing on you\" or what I was shopping for. The someone would whisper \"Christina\" and they would all scatter, knowing I was already giving my sales commission to someone else.  \n\nThis particular weekend was \"black friday\" weekend, so hopefully thats why they had so many people working, and were so busy. \n\nWith all that said, I got two great items and I love them both. An amazing handbag and a leather jacket. I am so glad I was being helped by Christina. She went above and beyond to have a new purse brought from another location, since they were out of the one I wanted. This located is really well organized and they have shoes, bags, clothing, lots of wallets, and jewelry. Its convenient if you are headed to the Forum, just pick one person you want to shop with and stick with them.
