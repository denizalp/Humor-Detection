Wow! Worse service ever! Starring Tammy, server with a bad attitude... Apparently server Tammy felt it was appropriate to take out her frustrations on her customers, specifically the Asian ones. She offered no apologies or acknowledgement that service was slow, but did successfully tell us that she had 12 OTHER tables to take care of. Read: she didn't care that we were unhappy and was quick to just hand us our bill. We had a show to catch but I still called out the manager to express my dissatisfaction. Not only did our food take forever, parties that seated after us received their food and requests before us, no one checked on us and even the food runner gave us attitude. We had empty cups and had to flag down service. What was really appalling was they had my mom get out of her seat and stand there while new customers walked through past our table. There was obviously not enough walking room since the tables were too close together on that side, but alternatively the hostess could have walked the customers around our table on the side with a wider pathway. So inconvenient and inconsiderate. \n\nWe were so so upset and management didn't provide anything to make us feel better about the situation. Zero tip.
