Ordered here while on a vacay in Vegas while staying at a nearby airbnb. Good solid breakfast food at reasonable price. Good variety of omelettes gluten free, high protein, vegetarian - something for everybody! , Love that most breakfast items cane with a choice of coffee cake which we all ate as breakfast the next day.
