I was here, at their new location, on Saturday, August 15 for a Girls' Day Out. My mother-in-law bought me, along with my two sister-in-laws, a spa day. We were treated to the entire spa to ourselves, lunch, and two services. Most of us got a gel mani\/pedi or, simply, a pedi. What a fabulous mani\/pedi! The girls took their time with us. The service was just relaxing and fabulous. I also got the OLEASLIM ANTI-CELLULITE BODY SLIMMING TREATMENT. Wow! It was just amazing! It started with a sugar scrub. I've never done that. It makes your skin so soft! After the scrub, you get a half hour massage. The woman who gave me my massage was an angel! She hit every spot I never knew was sore. She went on to massage an oil into every inch of skin and wrap me in plastic. I was then covered in a portable sauna. The sauna can be put on whatever heat setting is good for you and you are left, to cook, for a half hour. Within that half hour, your body burns 400-600 calories as it tries to lower your body temperature. When I came out of the sauna, I was dripping! The woman who massaged me wiped me down and applied more moisturizer. I came out of that treatment feeling like a new woman! We had the opportunity to clean up and primp after our treatments so we could go to dinner looking appropriate. Ladies, go see Michele. She will treat you like a queen. Her new location is stunning. Everything about this spa will make you feel better about yourself!
