I had been looking for a specific dress everywhere in Charlotte. Through the process, I called roughly 5 Charlotte boutiques and none of them were helpful. The associates that answered the phone at the other boutiques wouldn't even take the time to check the store for a dress of this specific brand. But, when I called Julie's, the store associate was quick to check the store and when they did not have my size, they immediately called the Wilmington store and had the dress shipped to Charlotte. You can't ask for better service!\n\nThe store associates are always helpful, great clothing for a good price, never a bad experience.
