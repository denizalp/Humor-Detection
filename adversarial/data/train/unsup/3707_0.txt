The Artisan is #Epyk !!!\nDo you like ART?? Do you like sultry lighting and hide and go seek? Strange people dancing against flashing lights late at night? Batting lashes and suggestive conversations?\n      Well, this is the place for YOU! \nI hope you don't come alone- it is quite a fun spot to come to with a significant other...I have had some fun times here on my own and with my partners. I have had ESPECIALLY fun times here during the summer. My spouse is another with stories to tell from this place as well.\n\nThe prices for the rooms are pretty low, but it is SLIGHTLY off the strip...It is also VERY close to a bunch of strip clubs (score!). Sometimes it's hard to find someone who works there for something (which could be a good and bad thing depending on the situation) After hours can get very #SEXY !\n\n I will never stop coming here even if they take away ALL of their happy hour drink prices. As long as I am always allowed to be topless at the pool during the summer I don't really mind. Now make out.
