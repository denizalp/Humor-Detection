OK, I know this sounds stupid, but I went for fish fry at Steak on a Stone. Right off the bat, I know it was a bad idea, it wasn't my choice, but that's what was chosen so there you go. \n\nNeedless to say, they are not known for their fish fry. Also the smell of meat was a little over whelming even for this lover of all things that once walked. And the next time I did laundry I was like, holy smokes! My pink sweater smelled like a delicious beef jerky! \n\nWith that said, the decor is kind of boring and non-descript. The mildly gimmicky lava stone with raw meat on it looks cool. I kept thinking what a disaster the place would be for kids. I can just imagine a toddler reaching out to touch the pretty stone making noise and unwittingly burning off their fingers to little stumps. \n\nI've heard the meat is delicious, it's good for groups, the meat seemed pricey for having to cook it yourself... I always find that annoying. But all in all,  I'll try it again sometime, for the meat.  And the jerky sweater bonus.
