Healthy. Very healthy. It tastes healthy and it is healthy. That's not to say it's bad though! In fact, the flavor was pretty tasty, especially when I added the hot sauce to my salad. When I say healthy, I don't mean healthy tortilla wraps. They don't serve bread here so come in prepared to go bread-free. I ordered one of their salads which was stock full of avocado and other delicious veggies and chicken. It was really good, but I love bread so I would have loved to have the salad as a wrap. But again, this isn't the place to expect bread! I will definitely visit again if I'm in the mood for super healthy and I want to try one of their shakes or bowls as well.
