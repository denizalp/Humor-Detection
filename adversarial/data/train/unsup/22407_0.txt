Pretty sure that if you're a dermatologist, you should look at my skin while I'm in your office. Not here. Instead, the doctor looked at his computer and continually asked me questions like \"Who's treating you now?\" (Uh, nobody, that's why I'm here.) \"Who last treated you?\" (Dermatologists in South Dakota, Minnesota, California....you know them?) \n\nFront desk staff wasn't the best either...I have eyes, and you can look in them whenever you want, just to convey friendliness or whatever. \n\nProps to the PA though, he actually looked at me and cared about me. I won't be back.
