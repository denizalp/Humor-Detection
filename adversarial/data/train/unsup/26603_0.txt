If you're dining at the cheesecake factory as a party of one or two, they will often try to stick you in one of their tiny, little tables. You literally sit five inches from the guests beside of you. This may not be a problem for some, but I always make sure to ask for a booth to avoid these tables. This place has a HUGE menu. I don't think you can go wrong with what you choose, though. My favorite dish is the shepherds pie. It's a huge portion and so delicious. I like that, during lunchtime, you can get the half portion. I usually still end up taking some home! If you're not starving, I recommend getting the cuban rolls, which are an appetizer. I enjoy the cuban sandwich, but actually love these even more. They're so crispy and come with a great dipping sauce. Oh, and the cheesecake is a must- duh. Even if you have to take it to-go. I've had so many of their cheesecakes and just can't choose a favorite. You seriously cannot go wrong! Try this place next time you are in the Southpark area!
