I had a gift card from V-Day I needed to use before it expired(6month limit) so I went this past weekend to check it out. When I first got there using the information listed on the gift card (between McAllisters and the the Mexican restaurant) I couldn't find it. (by the way McAllisters is gone)There were at least 3-6 closed shops in the strip mall. So I tried calling the number on the gift card, \"mailbox full\". \n\nThen when I was ready to accept defeat, I drove to the other side of the strip and found them tucked away in a corner between an Italian place and barber shop? \n\nWhen I got in the place was empty so they got started on me right away. I was really disappointed in the quality of work. It was supposed to be a spa mani pedi and it felt like a quickie. No massage, no salt scrub, no lotion, I got cut on my hands and feet. \n\nIf you want to go somewhere cheap, they are kind of cheap in that their prices are in line with most places. They use subpar tools to save money. I will never go here again. I didn't even wait for my nails to dry completely, I just wanted to get out of there.
