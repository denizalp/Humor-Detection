I stopped by for the first time after going to Wollersheim for their brandy event.   Wollersheim did a great job with tasting at different tour stations, but the place was a zoo due to popularity, and the place had an over-sanitized feel, though this is necessary to provide a venue for the crowds.\n\nSo, then,  looking for something laid-back and homey, went into Roxbury, and the Dorf Haus wasn't open yet (good reviews on Yelp).   The Roxbury Tavern was, and although I had read the hiccuppy reviews, it looked welcoming, and it was.   Sitting at the bar was a feast for the eye - - great hanging things and odd bar-ish things.  The Port Huron stout was a semi-decent brew, and then noticed a sign for grilled asparagus for $3.95.   From where I was sitting, I could watch the burgers being made on the grill (done with style and care) and then how the asparagus was grilled (vegetarians be careful - - it was done in the same spot on the same griddle as the burgers).    The asparagus was super tasty on a bed of spring greens with lemon (though a touch heavy due to the old burger flavor and post-grill butter drippings), the people were really nice (especially the waittrix, who was super genuine and naturally fun, not over-the-top manic fun - - but genuinely nice), and the atmosphere was actually kind of rare and wonderful.   I'll head up there happily from MIddleton again (under half an hour) to sit at the bar, with the really nice people, on both sides of the bar.   Next time I'll also get a burger.   A really fine experience.
