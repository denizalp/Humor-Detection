I went to see Star Wars in IMAX last night and there was some sort of GLITCH with the screen the whole time. It looked like there was a fruit fly in the projector room and it was flying over the lens. There was a black dot moving across my vision the entire duration of the film. It was irritating and I didn't enjoy the movie at all. Star Wars is an incredible film and I paid extra to see it in IMAX and it was ruined because Cineplex Vaughan was so lazy and incompetent.
