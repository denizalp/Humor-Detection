Extremely disappointed. The food is worse than at Woori Jib (when cooked by the boss there, not by the Mexican \"substitute-chef\" who has no idea what he is doing) or at Good Fella, also on Neil, which is overall the best Korean restaurant in town. \n\nBoth my and my friend's dishes were VERY salty and unhealthy, a ton of salt, MSG and excessive oil. Yes, we know that Korean food is not necessarily dietetic, but it CAN be extremely tasty and well-cooked without sending you to the hospital. It's hard to believe how people talk about how this would be \"authentic\" Korean food. Far from it, it is a bastardized, vulgar version of Korean recipes, with unhealthy, unbalanced spices piled up in order to shock the tastebuds of (sorry) undiscerning customers. Your tongue will be anesthetized, your stomach, liver and kidneys will NOT thank you. \n\nThe atmosphere is awful. The owner and the waiters are rude, they give you the impression that they don't want you there, that you're intruding on them while they have better things to do. A guy basically ORDERED us to order RIGHT AWAY. We've received just a tad of tea in some odd glasses and FOR 40 MINUTES we never had a tea refill and no waiter ever asked us whether everything is OK, whether we need anything else etc. Given how salty the food was, we were really thirsty, not that they cared.\n\nWe'll never go back. For those of you familiar with the British series Fawlty Towers, this is the closest experience to that one which we've ever had in Urbana-Champaign. The only place which serves food which is even worse is The Great impasta, but B-Won takes the trophy for the worst service in town. By comparison, Soup Nazi from Seinfeld was a gentleman.
