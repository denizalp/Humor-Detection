COMPLETE AND UTTER TRASH WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD AT ANY ESTABLISHMENT AND I WOULD UTTERLY RECOMMEND TO NO ONE EVER COMING HERE!!!!!!\n\nWhere do I even begin! We got there and noone greeted us on a Sunday Afternoon for the Giants Game which we where there because a few friends where in town from San Francisco, CA visiting and they had SF flags all over.... THEY DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE GAME ON OR THE CHANNELS... can anyone say a JOKE!\n\nNEXT we where just there for a few drinks and some food so we ordered our drinks and our food and the first waitress we had wasn't horrible but definitely in short attendance to the tables need and was rarely seen while glasses hung out on the table empty or practically empty.\n\nWe where then switched waitresses to the new waitress who I guess has won the award for WORST WAITRESS IN SCOTTSDALE MULTIPLE TIME or maybe it was just the staff overall at Salty who knows? She asked if we needed anything and I personally ordered a round of 5 \"house tequila shots\". This was my first time ever being at salty and I was just ordering off the happy hour menu that was in effect. The waitress proceeded to leave and come back about 15 minutes later from the bar that is not 10 feet from our table to inform us that the house shots are pre made and does not have tequila?? I proceeded to ask what it was made with... WOW SHE HAD NO IDEA LUCKILY my friend who had been there a few times knew that it was with flavored vodka ... NO BIGGIE moving on in life RIGHT?\n\nProceeded to just ask her to bring us 5 of those and that would be fine.... 20 minutes go by and I see our waitress at another table? I called her over and asked about our missing shots? she informed me that she was there to RE RE VERIFY that we wanted the shots for the going on 3rd contact we had had about ONE SET OF SHOTS!!! THAT ARE PRE MIXED!!!!!! I slightly quizzed her on the issue and asked if she saw anything wrong with the situation? She informed me not at all and I asked if her manager would because I would love to explain it to him. \n\nIT GETS GOOD HERE!!!\n\nSO the manager walks up with what I can only describe as a cocky and I could care less attitude ( YOUR A MANAGER IN \"INDUSTRY\" SERIOUSLY!!!!)! Proceeds to ask what had hapenned so I started to explain the situation while being constantly interrupted by him informing me I was wrong or that there was just NO WAY POSSIBLE that it had taken over 30 minutes to get said shots!!! NEVER AT SALTY... \n\nTHE BIG ISSUE is about 1\/2 way through the explanation the manager starts LAUGHING!!!.. i mean seriously your in CUSTOMER SERVICE.. what are you going to do when your SERVICE ... GETS YOU ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMERS TO SERVICE???? who knows but I proceeded to ask \n\"Are you laughing at me and about the situation?\"\n\nhis response- \" Yes, I think its quite the humorous situation\"\n\nI proceeded to ask if you enjoys laughing at situations where his restaurant completely screws up and asked for HIS MANAGER\n\nHIS MANAGER'S NAME WAS DOUG.... he wouldn't tell me his last name obviously I wouldn't either if I knew I had reviews about my restaurant headed to yelp!! HE Walked up to the table THREW the check on the table and said I heard we are having some issues! My buddy tried explaining the situation and was ABRUPTLY CUT OFF and we where then informed that \"WE WHERE ASSHOLES AND TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HIS RESTAURANT\"... now YOUR A GM AND YOUR CUSSING OUT CUSTOMERS BRINGING TO LIGHT THE HORRIBLE SITUATION YOUR SERVICE LEVEL IS AT IN YOUR STORE SERIOUSLY??? I then walked up to try and rectify the situation on the way out because I felt that the wait staff had OBVIOUSLY portrayed us as just being bad patrons! He proceeded to RUDELY TURN ME AWAY AGAIN WITH MORE LANGUAGE\n\nAT this point I had had enough I walked outside to my group of friends and they all agreed that NONE OF THEM would EVER BE GOING TO SALTIYAGAIN because of this service.. by the way we had a group of about 8 people and had more on the way GOOD JOB SALTY! \n\nSO IN THE END SERVICE IS HORRIBLE THE SHOTS WHICH WE FINALLY GOT AFTER GETTING OUR CHECK TOSSED AT US\/OUR TABLE WHERE SUB PAR WEAK AND TASTED HORRIBLE!!! The food WAS DRY AND NON IMPRESSIVE and the Happy hour was SUB PAR for the location... In a State \/ city \/ bar scene where Tequila Cantinas \/ and MEXICAN BARS ARE VERY PLENTIFUL I WILL NEVER EVER and when i say EVER i mean EVER BE going to ANY SALTY SENORITA ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN! and I will tell everyone I know to never go there as well. I wouldn't want to put anyone I know through this CRAPPY of a dining experience... THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS TREATMENT!!!
