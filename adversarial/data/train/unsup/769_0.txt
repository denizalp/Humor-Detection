We went here to grab a quick bite to go. I read some reviews and figured why not. Wow people of yelp are nuts (or just being paid) because the food was horrible. The price point is like $1.00 cheaper than a normal Thai restaurant.  I really wonder if the people who tried this have had real Thai food, I get it that it's fast food and all. The pad see ew was bland and I don't know what was going on with the sweet and sour stir fry haha.
