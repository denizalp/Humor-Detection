Wow one of the best boba places that I've been to in Las Vegas! I ordered the yogurt butterfly pea drink and it was delicious. It also came in a super cute bottle that was really pretty when the ingredients were layered. The taste is very unique and is also not caffeinated. I also tried the watermelon tea and they use fresh watermelon juice to make it. Very refreshing and tasty!
