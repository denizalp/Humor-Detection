We wanted something a little different than typical ramen joints you can find throughout the downtown core, so we tried this brand new place. Lan Zhou Ramen is a hand pulled noodle place with a variety of different noodle soups. We had the A01 beef noodle soup and the A02 lamb noodle soup, along with the jellyfish and secret ribs appetizers. Both noodle soups, being hand pulled noodles, were very springy and chewy which was definitely a plus. They used the same broth which is just right (not too salty). With a nice assortment of meats and vegetables (include bok choi and pickled daikon), it was a delicious noodle soup I wanted more of! Adding the freshly made and aromatic hot oil and you have a match made in heaven.\n\nThe appetizers were also fantastic! The jellyfish was served with pickled vegetables which was a nice complement, while the ribs had a memorable savourness  to it. I would definitely recommend both.\n\nAfter the meal, the waiter even asked us if the soup wasn't too salty! I really respect asking for our opinion so they can improve in the future! Overall, a very good experience for something a little different.
