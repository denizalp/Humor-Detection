Wow! This is amazing! I've previously bought Gusta vegan sausages at the store so I knew they were delicious but the meals they make here are out of this world! The staff is very friendly and informative. You can tell they're proud of the food there and they have every reason to be. Even if you're not a vegan you can appreciate the taste. McD's has nothing on this place. You can also buy the cheese and sausages straight from the source!
