We were visiting the outlets and my husband got a haircut, it was awesome, the girl was a perfectionist and my husband loves that, she was caring and very nice, for time issues I couldn't get my hair done as well so I decided to go back next morning just to find a VERY young girl, people, young is not the problem, but she seemed very insecure about what she was doing man, she barely talk and when I asked her about clubs in the strip, she said, \"Hey, don't ask me that, I'm not even 19 yet\" lol, anyhow, I had my hair washed 15 minutes before arriving, so I only needed the flat iron thingy, I have had that done hundreds of times !, they usually take between 20 to 35 minutes depends on the salon, she took ONE HOUR ! and... oh God, it was horrible, I could touch my roots and they felt \"curly\" still, probably girls will understand this more easily, no offense guys please !!, anyhow, they charged me $30 for that mess, I was so disappointed =( \n\nGood luck =)
