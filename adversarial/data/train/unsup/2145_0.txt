Browsed through this Zara location very quickly over the weekend. Picked up a surprisingly nice beaded sheer blouse from here and paired it with denim. It was an item with a bit steeper price point than most of the items in this store, but worth it to me. The sales associate at the cash register was also very careful when bagging it and very nicely put it into a cloth bag before placing into their paper handle bag. I appreciated the care and attention to my purchase. I'd return again if staying nearby and out browsing around.
