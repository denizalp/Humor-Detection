This Starwood property is a little more roomy and luxurious than their sister Westin property down the street. Both hotels have really comfortable beds, but the Sheraton Suites Eau Claire makes me feel a little more at home. \n\nI'm a fan of the faux Irish Pub (Finn MacCool's) off the Lobby. The meeting rooms and the associated catering are also very good. And when I get tired of being a Corporate drone for the day, a nice walk through the nearby Prince's Island Park helps put it all in perspective.
