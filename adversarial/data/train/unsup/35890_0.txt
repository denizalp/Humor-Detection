We found a little hidden gem in Little Italy where you can oysters every night for $1! A dream. Until 23h. Isn't that AMAZING? Their specialty is \"balls\" of all kinds. \nMeat, fish and even desert ballzzz! Cool decor, upside-down lamps on the ceiling, lots of wood, a bit hipster but with a touch of classy ;) lol We got there early and just in time before the crowds and groups; which is around 19h. But it was a Thursday night, always a little busier out :)  Bon app√©tit!
