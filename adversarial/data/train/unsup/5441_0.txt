My wife and I stopped by this new Porsche Chandler showroom on a Saturday afternoon.\nIt was about 12:30 pm.\nThere were two sets of customers at work-stations, reviewing potential cars.\nThere were about seven to eight sales staff on the general sales floor. One group near the receptionist chatting away. The other group congregating near the sales manager. Shooting the breeze.\nMy wife and I were the inky customers walking around the showroom.\nYou couldn't miss us.\nWe spent twenty-five minutes in the showroom, looking at each car.\nOnly one thing.\nNo sales staff EVER approached us for any questions, comments or even an acknowledgment.\nNo one sales person. Perhaps we did not look the type to be able to afford these expensive cars,\nIn the end, we walked out and wondered to ourselves.\nWhy no one bothered to speak with two potential Porsche customers?
