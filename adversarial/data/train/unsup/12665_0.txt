I come here fairly often because I live close by. Tea is hit or miss depending on who's making it and how busy it is. If you get tea for take-out, ask for a stamp card so you can eventually get one for free. \n\nThe food here ranges from meh to terrible. The biggest problem I have with the food is that it's never consistent. The portion sizes, sides and presentation are never the same, and not in a good way. One saving grace is that they seem to have dumped the egg scrambled in cucumber (which was awful) and replaced it with the soy sauce boiled egg they started with - much better. \n\n\nThey're often out of my favourite dish which makes me unhappy. Also, they advertise as tea and desserts, but they don't have desserts? At least, they don't have the desserts that all of the other Tea Shop 168s around the city have (waffles, ice cream). \n\n\n2 stars for this place, for location, the fact that they're open late, and the tea being decent most of the time.
