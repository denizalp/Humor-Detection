Best poke in Vegas!!! Me and the wife was so happy that they have this location.  I used to drive to the north location and we lived at the very south of  Vegas. Favorite thing to get is the spicy ahi poke.  We usually get 2lbs spicy ahi poke, 1lbs shoyu poke, 1lbs wasabi.  The fish is always fresh and tasty.\n\nThey have a special on Monday and Tuesday, if you buy 2lbs or more its $9.99\/lb. Regular price per pound is $10.49.
