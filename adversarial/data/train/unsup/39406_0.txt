Excellent and trendy Ramen Shop. Service for such a small space was great. Food was timely and drink selections were great. Sit outside on the patio at dusk for an even better experience! The Rice Crispy squares with Tuna were a standout of the appetizers. The traditional frozen beer foam Sapporo draft was my favorite drink.
