I made an appointment to get my nails done by Dani. I was literally on time. Maybe a minute late. I originally asked for hard gel manicure (something new I wanted to do). It was explained to me over the phone. But in person it was explained to me differently. I was a little confused. Either that or I just nod my head and didn't hear it clear enough... So I just changed my mind and went with the normal full set acrylic with gel polish. \n\nI was taken by surprise when she said \"I have to check if I have time for that.\" Like whoa? Am I an inconvenience? She came back and started doing my nails. In the process she eventually said to the receptionist to call her other client that she will be running 15 minutes behind. Since I'm a person who always looks at both sides of the story; it was easy for me to understand. And I thought it was nice of her to do that. I would appreciate that if my nail salon called me to come in at so and so time so I don't show up waiting. You know?\n\nThe quality of her work is amazing. She doesn't half slack anything even if she's behind schedule. I tipped her well. I thought it was a bit pricey. I was charged $55 in total. Supposedly the full set acrylic is $20. Plus $30 for gel. And $5 for coffin nails. The hard gel cost the same price? I'm still trying to figure out the difference if anyone can tell me... But I don't regret one cent. Normally I pay $35 for gel, acrylic, and coffin else where. \n\nI gave it four stars because I didn't like the fact that she commented; if she had time. Like... Customers change their mind all the time. I felt like I wasn't important and her next client was? You know?
