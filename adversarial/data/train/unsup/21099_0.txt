Sano sushi used to be amazing but I can definitely see the cost cutting coming into effect. The salmon sashimi used to be cut nice and big - super fresh but now is cut into smaller pieces, not as fresh as before.\n\nThe sushi doesn't seemed crammed with rice but looks half-assed.\n\nService is still quick and the servers are quick to offer you a refill with your drink.\n\nThere is no 15% discount anymore.\nBottomless drinks and dessert are still included in the lunch and dinner.\n\nI would still give the place another shot because I did come during a snowstorm, so that could've been why things were a little off.\n\n3\/5
