Hmm Mexican or Chinese food...ok both! Yep I did it again, found Chino Bandido where they combine both! Super good and sorry I didn't come up with that idea earlier. A must stop in Phoenix, AZ! Pollo Diablo and Jade Red Chicken with Fried Rice and Refried Beans would be a good start! \n\nGreat Fast Food, Great Takee-Outee or Eat-in, something different and something for everyone. F.A.S.T. Review speaks for itself!
