For around $25, you can get six pounds of food. I know because I weighed our bag. Pearl Wok To GO is conveniently located to my home and work, great price to value ratio, and good flavors. Particularly the won ton soup!\n\nLemon chicken is spot-on in flavor, and perfectly crispy because they poked holes in the box lid. Good attention to detail!\n\nMoo Shu pork is decent but not my favorite dish, served with pancakes that are reminiscent of tortillas. Healthy-seeming dish with lots of cabbage, mushrooms, and other veggies. Menu also offers steamed veggie and protein options for those seeking healthy choices.\n\nBut the won ton soup. Lord. The $5 bowl is huge, has 6 plump and stuffed won tons, but the broth is the star! Perfectly savory, probably packed with MSG, topped with a ton of shredded green onion. Perfect when you're under the weather.\n\nEDIT: Subtracted a star for lack of consistency. Have gone back for the wor won ton soup, and the broth isn't as good and the wontons were soggy despite being allegedly  \"fresh made\". Lemon chicken is always solid though, and the barbeque pork egg foo young is really well done.
