My husband and I decide to have lunch at BJ Centennial Hills today, worse experience every.  First 2 gentlemen ahead of us were told by the hostess that it would be a minute or 2 and they would get a table, we were standing right behind them waiting and the hostess took our name and told us it would be 5 or 10 minutes before we got a table. The hostess escorted the 2 men to their table came back to her work station and answered the phone then told us there was a table in the bar area available and we would get our menus once we sat down. As we were sitting down another couple followed us and sat at the table behind us.  \n 1) We mention to the serve that the table was wet, she gave some excuse that It was just clean off, that was not what we were asking, we want the table dried off.\n2) We were seated before the table that was behind us in the bar section, but our server went to that table and took their complete food and drink order. We stopped the waitress and questioned do they take the order by when you are seated, she said that is how it is done, we then informed our waitress that we were seated first, and she offered us an apology but did not ask if we wanted to order.  It so happens they were white; the waitress was white and of course we're black. We decided not to order lunch there but to go somewhere else were the only color that matters is green. \nIs the way BJ restaurant conducts business they pick and choose who they take orders from if you are not of the WHITE race your order is taken second to them!!  I work in a customer service business, BJ your service is bad.
