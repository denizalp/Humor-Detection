Really good Indian food, with some South Indian twists such as dosa appetizers, plus several chaat. The korma and vindaloo were especially good. The naan was perfect. The saag paneer was the only disappointment because it wasn't stewed spinach but spinach-infused cream sauce, so a bit bland in flavor and texture. You need reservations for dinner due to its popularity unless you come after 8:30pm.
