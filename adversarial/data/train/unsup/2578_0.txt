Located on Pittsburgh's South Side, The Hot Metal Street Bridge was originally a dual railroad bridge owned by the Monongahela Connecting Railroad (The MonConn).  The MonConn used it to connect steel mills on both the north and south banks of the Monongahela River.  The upstream span carried regular freight trains.  The downstream span carried train cars of  molten iron across from J&L's Eliza Furnaces to the Bessemer converters, furnaces and rolling mills at J&L's South Side Works. \n\nWhen the J&L South Side Works closed, the bridge no longer had a use.  With new development on the South Side, one span was redeveloped for auto use and it now connects Hot Metal Street on the South Side with 2nd Avenue in Oakland.  A few years ago the other span was redone and is now used for bicyclists and pedestrians.  It's a part of the Three Rivers Trail System.\n\nI've never driven across it, but I've used the bike span on numerous occasions.  It's a great way to get from the South Side to Oakland or to connect between the Three Rivers Trail and the Eliza Furnace Trail.  Those trails along with the bridge are a fun way to explore Pittsburgh's industrial past.
