well, it doesn't seem very fun to review a grocery store, but this one is infamous. because of its proximity to ASU, it's often called the \"hot chick\" safeway - no joke. \nit used to be open 24\/7, but i think it now closes by 12 a.m. and there are always lots of co-eds, usually newbie college freshman shopping together (you can tell they're freshman because they haven't yet realized that shopping wtih roommates for food is a terrible idea). and i agree, they're all very cute in that typical \"college\" way. \n\nand it's always refreshing to see kids dressed up to go out, just picking up a back up bottle of vodka for the after party on a monday or tuesday night. ha ha, in fact, last night while shopping for a Valentine's dinner meal, my boyfriend and I giggled at the frat boy who was inspecting cards while holding a handle of jim beam in one hand and a heart-shaped box of chocolates in the other... his girl is one lucky lady...\n\nto get to the point, the co-ed factor and busyness of this place kept me away from it, choosing instead to shop at the next closest store, fry's on mill and southern. ok, let me tell you Fry's is a dump; it's dirty, dingy, it smells funny and their veggies are gnarly. hot chick safeway is clean, bright and they have super friendly staff, who are always willing to help you find something or tell you how to broil a steak cause it's raining out and you're screwed for your valentine's grilled steak dinner idea. it's a tad more expensive than Fry's but totally worth it, not for eye candy, (but that's great if you're a 19 to well, 70-year old guy) but for the better service and better facility, and they always have killer deals on things like frozen pizzas and snacks cause, well, what else do college kids eat?
