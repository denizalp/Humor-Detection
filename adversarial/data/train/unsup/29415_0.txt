Had the Black Angus Club and was happy with my choice. The food was good and the sweet tea is as good as any I've had. I only had a couple of negatives I felt I should bring up. \n\n1. The cashier reminded me of Aubrey Plaza's character, April, in Parks and Rec.\n\n2. It took my coworker 15 minutes to get his lunch after they forgot his order. They quickly fixed the problem and offered him a free cookie to make things right. \n\nI would definitely go back. I won't call it a must go but if you're looking for a solid sandwich and one is nearby check it out.
