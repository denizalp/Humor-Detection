Definitely tourist central by day and creepy club hoppers by night. It's a cool view of the city right across the river. This place is full of chain spots like hard rock and bucca. The melting pot is there which is something everyone should try! There is \"some\" shopping and by some I mean very little. \n\nHowever, I do enjoy the brunch on Sundays down at the grand concourse. It's pretty awesome, but make sure you call ahead or get there early cause it gets PACKED!
