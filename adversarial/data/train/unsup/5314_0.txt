Just moved in about a month ago and it has definitely lived up to the expectations. The apartments are really spacious for the price and you have the option to decide how upgraded you want your finishes which is really nice, so you only pay for the quality\/ updates you want. \n\nI also have to say I was really impressed with having 4 pools and 2 hot tubs not to mention now 2 dog parks on property. Love using the work out facility and the office staff has always been super polite and professional.
