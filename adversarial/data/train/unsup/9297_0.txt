Do not eat here.  \n\nAbsolute SH&T hole!  Tourist only like it because they're intoxicated enough to destroy taste buds.  I tried it again just to be sure, and now I'm certain that this place is about the worst italian food you can get in Old Town.  Olive G is better (that's how bad this place is).  Everything tastes like it was frozen like a tv dinner and just heated up to serve.  Service is super slow.
