A great local coffee place across the street from the Plaza Theatre. Open late so an excellent place for a drink after the show. They are licensed and have excellent coffee drinks. Over the last year and a bit, the owner and manager have been working together to improve the store with things like WiFi, free wired access (WiFi is part of Fatport (http:\/\/fatport.com\/).) And small improvements to the store layout that have allowed them to add tables. They've automated the espresso machines for consistency and expanded the food offerings.\n\nNothing quite like a steamy cappuccino in one of the bay windows on a frosty January Saturday morning.\n\nStaff are usually friendly and attentive although, like all Calgary shops, there is some fluidity with the staff and the school seasons change.\n\nGreat baking, great atmosphere, why would anyone go next door to Starbucks? \n\nShop local, tell Dave (owner) and Jon (manager) I say \"Hi\" while you're enjoying the fireplace. I miss this place  now that I'm an out-of-towner.
