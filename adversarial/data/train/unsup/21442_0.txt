Where does one go for cheesy souvenirs?\n\nGrand Avenue Stores houses everything from the 2-for-$10 Vegas T-shirts right down to the condom lollipops and bottle of lube on the second floor.  Need gifts for children?  Take the escalator right up to the second floor and find yourself surrounded by Made in China plush and felt hats that read \"Got Beer?\"\n\nA large storefront in the style of a mine shaft so be prepared for the fake walls of rock.  We were here on a mission: to find a fanny pack for one of my friends to ensure the freedom of hands and a strict \"no\" to luggage.\n\nI was hungry and since I was already a chubby tourist decided to purchase a snack.  A king size Payday ($1.99) which happily kept my appetite at bay while we headed over to the MGM Grand.
