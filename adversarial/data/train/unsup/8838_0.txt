Atlas Bistro hires the very best upcoming chefs. The past chefs have moved on and opened some of the best restaurants in the metro Phoenix area. Atlas Bistro is a very tiny upscale ten table restaurant that's B.Y.O.B. It's adjacent to a very good wine shop next door. This restaurant serves up organic, local, wild line caught exotic dishes. All the dishes I had were painstakingly detailed and masterfully prepared.\n\nWe started with an amuse bouche of House Smoked Hawaiian Opah Fish with a caper and Lemon Aioli. It was so darn tasty I wish I could have purchased some to bring home.\n\nMy first course was a combination of crisp cucumber, sweet watermelon, creamy Israeli Feta, jicama, pickled honeydew, pistachio, fresh mint tied together with watermelon\/lime vinaigrette. This was so light but bursted with bright flavors. Just delicious!\n\nMy second course was a very detailed beet salad. What stood out were the beets. You can taste how different a just picked beet taste. It has a totally different texture. The whole salad was earthy and bright from the fennel and tangy from the blue cheese. The crisp rye berries added some texture.\n\nDinner was Wild Hawaiian Hebi Spear Fish. The fish was mild sweet, meaty, moist with a nice tasty crust. This dish had many components but the one that stood out was the beet infused cous cous topped with harissa. It was so darn delicious it was the star of the plate. It had great flavors. I had to fight off my husband from taking too much of it. \n\nUnfortunately I was to full to try one of the interesting sounding desserts.\n\nBeing that this is a B.Y.O.B. place I do note your bottle of wine you bring might not pair with the plates you order but if you drink wine between plates it doesn't matter. As of the time of this review the corkage fee is $15.00
