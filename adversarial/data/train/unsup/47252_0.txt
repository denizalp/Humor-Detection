Just discovered this place a couple weeks back and it's a little piece of gluten-free heaven for me. I was diagnosed with celiac about six months ago and have been struggling to find food that tastes like food. This please was a awesome fine for me. The food was delicious and there was not one item I had I did not like. Unfortunately when I went back they were closed due to plumbing issues but I hope they open up soon. This place is definitely on my top five list. It is worth the 30 minute drive to get there!
