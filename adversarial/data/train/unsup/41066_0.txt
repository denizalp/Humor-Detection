My family of four stopped for lunch and decided to sit inside rather than the front porch and it was beautiful. Open air and plants every where. My wife and I had crepes. I had the rabbit saddle and my wife had the curry chicken, both were fantastic. The kids had a pizza which was also tasty. Their microbrewery beer is good and good service too.
