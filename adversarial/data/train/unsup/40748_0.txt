OK, there is a lot of potential here with maybe just a few small kinks to be worked out.  The atmosphere and cocktails were good.  Definitely make a reservation if you can because it was rather busy when I first arrived for a late lunch.\nI started my meal with the New England Fry, which was good, but the real winner was the  Fried Chicken Sandwich.  The bun was just right and the flavors and textures of everything came together into a beautiful dish.  The chopped salad that accompanied it was woefully under-seasoned and bland.  \nThe dessert menu was a little disappointing.  I enjoyed the McConnell's ice cream very much, but none of the other offerings were too tempting.  My friend let me try her Triple Layer Cake which looked very homemade (not meant as a big compliment) and was just OK.\nThe biggest disappointment was the horrible decline in service as my meal progressed.  By the time we finished, the dining room had cleared out and there was quite a bit of staff cleaning up.  I tried several times to make eye contact with anyone, but was pretty much ignored.  I finally resorted to waving down a busser to ask for the check and it STILL took a while to get that settled.
