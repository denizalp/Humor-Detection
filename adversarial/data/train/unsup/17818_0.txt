I've been to many dealerships, and I have honestly walked out of 50% of them because the sales agent. I had Tony help me on my purchase of a new corvette. He was the best sales guy I've ever had to be honest!  I can't just say he was only nice because we bought a corvette, because I originally went to Ed Bozart Chevrolet because it's close to my house. To say the least they treated me like sh$t and I walked out. Tony more than met my expectations and was always extremely helpful.  He even answered any questions via text when he wasn't even at work. \n Thanks again Tony!
