Being from FL, it's a treat to see a state staple here in NC. I'm biased when it comes to BBQ and this is no exception. This location is my first time and I'm impressed. The staff is excellent and very personable. I don't expect less from any Sonny's location I've visited. So I don't expect the food to be any different either.
