Thought we'd give this place another try since the 1st time we came..it was terrible. Took forever, over an hour, but it was when they had only been open for 2 weeks. Today we got the Cookie Monster and Pink Lychee, both very good. There was a short line that went quick and the food only took 5 mins.\n Popcorn chicken salt n pepper- good portion , good flavor, hot and fresh\nHot cheetos cheese fries- skinny fries with melted cheese and crushed cheetos..my son's fav\nI took one star off because the Elotes (classic) was disgusting. There was barely any corn and WAY TOO MUCH PARMESAN. I pretty much paid 6. For parm and Mayo so if you're looking for a mouthful of powder mush, go for it.\nBonus- Great play list!
