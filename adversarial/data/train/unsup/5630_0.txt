So I decided on giving this place another chance, to crave my sweet craving, I should of known better! I am definitely not impressed with any of there selections, the birthday cake should of been delicious, but sadly it wasn't- the buttercream was just too sweet and oily, it had a very weird texture. The freckle (chocolate with cream cheese frosting) was unbearable, the chocolate cake was super bitter and gross- as if it was deep dark chocolate, which would be nice if me or my kiddo liked dark chocolate, I don't think I will be coming back for more, I definitely will go the extra mile and drive to TSP baking, there confetti cake is off the hook, and they probably ruined me from going back to mediocre Birthday flavored cakes!  I wish I didn't buy two of each- such a waste of money, let's just put it this way- you know your cupcake are horrible when your 6year old refuses to eat them, even without the frosting!
