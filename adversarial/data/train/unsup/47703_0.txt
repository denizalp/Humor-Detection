Not a fan. The pizza was just ok. What I can't get over is how nasty this place is. I wanted to take a shower after going. The table was so sticky that my arm kept sticking to it. It smells, and the kitchen looks like someone got murdered in it. Surly there's got to be a health code they need to pass, right?
