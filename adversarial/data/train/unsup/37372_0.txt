Had a very enjoyable AYCE lunch. This was my fist visit but definitely not my last! It may sound weird, but they have the most flavorful sushi rice I've ever had. I've never even really noticed the rice at any of the other sushi places I've been to, but here...the rice is soooo good. You have to try it to know what I mean. \n\nI highly recommend the salmon kama, super white tuna, and garlic tuna. Delicious! I was so focused on eating, I forgot to take a picture.
