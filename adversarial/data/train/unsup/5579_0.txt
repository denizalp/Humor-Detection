In-N-Out Burger is still the most comfortable of comfort foods. \n\nAfter all these years, I will still go out of my way, plan my day, and not care what I weigh to have an Animal-style Double-Double Cheeseburger with an order of In-N-Out Fries Well Done.\n\nThis Las Vegas Strip location (near the High Roller Ferris Wheel at the Linq) is just as busy as all the In-N-Outs in Southern California. Our wait time for an open seat was about 5 minutes after getting our burgers. My recommendation is to grab a table or seat as quickly as possible after walking in while someone else in your party orders.\n\nThe delay to pig out was worth it though because In-N-Out Burger remains the best Hamburger and Fries at this price point. Obviously, there are a zillion choices of what to eat in Vegas, but if you want pure inexpensive comfort food then there really is nothing like getting the most comfortable of them all: In-N-Out Burger.
