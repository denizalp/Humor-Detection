Well to begin with....all the staff seem to be clueless about the items on the menu and once they figure it out, they take infinite time to complete the order. I wanted to order a plate of wada and the serving lady wasn't sure what wada was. Even after telling the item number from the menu, she was searching all around and realized that there weren't any left. I asked her to check with the kitchen staff if they are making any new ones inside and she told me it's gonna take 15mins. I was charged upfront and to my dismay after 30mins, when I went to enquire about my wada order...guess what..she was unsure what order it was and started the same crap again. I got my $ refunded, but boy I felt they were half asleep and working.I will never go to Adisil again\n\nP.S besides me and my wife there we just 2 other people in the restaurant and it was at 6pm
