Forget what you know about ordering pizza, because you won't need any of that. Traditional pizza pricing has been thrown out the window, with any combination of toppings will cost you the same. Although approaching the counter can seem a daunting experience, the staff (especially at this location) will be happy to help guide you. You can be certain that no matter what, your toppings will be correct and they will be on your pizza exactly the way you want them. The service is exceptionally quick as well.\n\nMod is a refreshing take on pizza places. I got a Mod with: red sauce, mozzarella, spinach, sundried tomato, arugula, bacon, mushrooms, artichokes, and a pesto drizzle. All for the same price as the base Mod-sized pizza. \n\nThe decor is post-naughties, very modern. The music is good. \n\nThe only concern that I have about Mod Pizza is that there won't be one when I go back home to Tampa. \n\nI am glad that I decided to stop in for some dinner.
