I went to this place three times on our recent trip to Montreal. I dig it, though it is a bit inconsistent. \n\nMy boyfriend got the breakfast burger but the fries came out cold. \nOne day they made me an iced americano and the next day the ice came on the side so I had to wait a while for it to cool enough to use the ice without it just melting.\nOne day the hollandaise on my California scramble was amazing, but on my benedict the next day it was broken.\nThe bravocado was so good! But my eggs were poached to the point of being overcooked - very different from the poached eggs I got on my benedict, where even the whites were still runny.\nThe french toast page was great! Although the second day it came out cold, with less fruit, and no syrup. \n\nAll this considered, I would still go here. Definitely worth checking out; big selection and yummy smoothies and juices too.
