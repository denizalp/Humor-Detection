Fabulous little store with Middle Eastern and Asian food, in a rather skeezy looking little mall where some of the stores are closed. I hope Sunny and the big fancy Shopper's Drug Mart attract business. I made a wrong turn off Don Mills last month and spotted this place, but forgot where I'd been and wasn't able to find it on Google Maps. It looks like a very new store. Anyways, I went looking for it today and it's on Gateway east of Don Mills.\n\nI think this place is about the size of the T&T down on Cherry Street. Ridiculously cheap produce. There's also a huge bakery section, two or three fish\/meat counters (??) including the one with the ducks and the pork pieces all hanging up and barbecued, and a hot food deli counter. And rows and rows of frozen seafood and other treats. Oh, and they have paneer. \n\nHighlights of this grocery haul: king oyster mushrooms, looooooong beans, fried tofu in a bag, and \"Creamity\" wafer cookies. \n\nSmall supermarkets usually make me suspicious that they're going to be expensive and only have convenience food. But this place is bigger on the inside. \n\nI'm sorry, Food Basics, it just isn't working out.
