oh my god - cutest coffee shop in the world! \nLocated inside the Community Wise Resource Centre (http:\/\/communitywise.net\/) this little coffee closet is a hidden gem! \nGo in the front doors, and go to the right - follow the little \"K\"s on the floor down to the end of the hall, turn left, and there it is! \nThere's a little seating area to the left if you want to sit for a bit, or just walk down the hall and look at all the other cool stuff that is in this building! \nI'm very excited that my coworkers and I stumbled upon this place today, and we will definitely be returning!
