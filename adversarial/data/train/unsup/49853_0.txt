The staff at Oswalt are very professional, very friendly and always willing to help. Where we were disappointed was when we went to our free consultation. If the person was more educated on Chapter 13 bankruptcy and told us what our monthly payments would be closer to, then we would never had gone further in process. We were told \"How does $350 a month sound\" and of course we figured it would be about double that which we would have been fine with. He also said a few other things that were incorrect but the biggest issue was the monthly figure estimate. Well, we got our paperwork back and the payment was almost 4X that! Had we known it was going to be that high, we NEVER would have paid them the $2500 to move forward. We decided to not go further since it made no sense to us but ended up losing $1500 because of this. Ms. Oswalt was very fair and did reimburse us for unearned costs but we were extremely disappointed with what happened. I will definitely say that her staff was wonderful and I would recommend them but do your homework and ask a lot of questions up front before you sign on.
