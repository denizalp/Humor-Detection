I'm all for a 'hole in the wall' sorta place and this one fit the bill with fliers on the window, no real seating, and a menu that looked straight out of the 80's with specials on a white board. This place has all the appeal of a hot dog cart - but without the ability to see the dirty hot dog water. \nI came here for a hot dog - a Chicago dog to be exact. A good sized hot dog with plenty of toppings. When I looked at the menu and saw prices upwards of $6 for a Chicago dog I nearly turned around but I gave it a shot after the guy at the counter said it came with fries and a drink (an offering on the white board) for $7. \nThe dog came good and warm along with a good portion of freshly chopped fries. The \"Chicago\" dog was somewhat disappointing though in that there were plenty of toppings but they were either really thinly sliced (a pickle spear i could see through) or sparse (2 small quarters of tomato, a spattering of neon relish). The hotdog was a good sized thickness dog (about an inch and a half in diameter) but barely filled the un-warmed bun. It ended up being an OK dog though and the fries were pretty good. For $7 I was satisfied - much better than a 7-11 or wienerschnitzel option. \nAll in all I'd say if you are looking for somewhere new to try this place is a good stop. They seem to have a few other non hot dog offerings so I may have to go back. This is no \"gourmet\" or \"Chicago replica\" however I do not think. Just a hole in the wall joint that offers a fair deal on decent food.
