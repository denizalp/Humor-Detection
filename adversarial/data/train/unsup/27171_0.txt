Atmosphere, selection from food to wine, service and the owners are AMAZING!  The bartender Jason was amazing in painting a picture for the food I was ordering and describing the varietal and origins of the wine I looking to select.  I will be bring more peeps to the loungy area during the cooler months because their patio is absolutely amazing!
