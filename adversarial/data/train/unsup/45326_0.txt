The Venetian is like a hot girl, beautiful but barely functional. My hotel room key didn't work and when they replaced it, it worked once, then didn't work anymore. The keys were replaced like 5 times in total until they finally worked. The whole structure is great if you want to spend half your day walking, it takes 2 long walks and 2 elevator rides just to get to my room. The place was really crowded and security guards will interrogate you even if you've passed by them a hundred times. I do not recommend this place and will certainly not come back.
