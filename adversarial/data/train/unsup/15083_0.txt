I am so impressed by their lunch! I got their Prime Cut Hamburger on the House bun and added Age Cheddar and boy I was not disappointed. There was a hearty amount of meat and it tasted great! They even gave little mints as well. My coworker suggested the Prime Rib sandwich but since this was my first time eating their food I stuck with something a bit more traditional. Next time I'll definitely try it though. I was barely able to finish my burger without feeling full. I was only able to eat a few of the house fries because It was just so much. You get your bucks worth here for sure.
