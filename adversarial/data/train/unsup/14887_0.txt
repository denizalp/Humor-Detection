If you're looking for over-the-top, gaudy royalty, keep looking... you're better off in the middle of the desert in a pop-up camper with Sky Mall d√©cor. It seems the entire budget of the resort and casino was blown on the front walkway.  You get allured into this grand castle.  But once you're through the gate, it's all down hill from there.  There are no knights to greet you.  No castellan.  No kings! Just the faint scent of menthol cigarettes and bowling alley cheese mixed with B.O.\/cheap perfume permeated throughout the castle.   I sure hope there's no feast or buffet here.\n\nI didn't step past the lobby, I was afraid I couldn't hold my breath long enough from the stench.  I presume the basement contained the 'casino' which consisted of a low-budget Chuckee Cheese arcade playing Rob Thomas on repeat (it would've been better if they threw in some hits from The Police or R.E.M).  Normally castles contain a grand hall.  The lobby was anticlimactic and not very king-like if you ask me.  I give this 1 star just for the outside.
