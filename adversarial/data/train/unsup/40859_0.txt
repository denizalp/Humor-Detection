I am extremely busy and barely have time to stop and take the time needed to feel better. Thankfully my wife forced me to try the Joint. I have to give praise to Dr. Jimmy who has been on point. As I've gotten older I am getting more pains, but it has improved since I now come weekly. I enjoy the quick turn time and appreciate that he will get you out quick and if you have questions or concerns he will give you the time. If you have to wait, then it may be a new patient or there may be a few people ahead of you, but it's worth it!\n\nI enjoy the monthly plan because even if I miss a week or two the cost is just way to low to pass up! I have had sciatic nerve pain that acts up from time to time and in the past few months I have been doing great. Most of my pain is now just from not being active enough but I am starting to feel much better and look to become more active with my family!\n\nThanks Dr. Jimmy! \n\nRyan I.
