Great post hike breakfast spot. The Greek Omelet is amazing. Well, as amazing as an omelet can be, I guess. It's, like, not a breakfast burrito or anything. Still though, it's something good enough to get excited about.  \n\nOh, what's that? You don't get excited AF about food? Then go eat at a Good Egg and stop pretending. You're basic. \n\nAlso, can someone please tell me why I always have to order iced coffee AND iced tea? Like seriously, Morgan, it's one or the other. I don't even think caffeine works on me anymore. I just double fist my way through every morning (and every night).\n\n(I kid.)     \n\n(Ha ha.)\n\n(God, I'm hilarious.)\n\n(At least to my mom.)
