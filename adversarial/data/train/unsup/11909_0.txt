Hi. My name is Cara and sometimes I'm too lazy to leave my own home when the fridge is looking like a frozen wasteland. Don't judge me. \n\nI'm not going to lie... I really can't stand most pizza. Chain restaurants are always disappointing and I'd rather spend my money on something local. The problem is, not many locally owned pizza places in Cleveland deliver--especially on Sundays when the Browns are on.\n\nThat is, except for Guy's Pizza! \n\nThank god for Guy's. This is a great pie right here, folks. You like a sweeter sauce? Done. They have a choice of spicy too! Love thin crust? Welp, they have hand-tossed and crispy, crunchy pies. Or you could just be like me and order the GINORMOUS \"New Yorker.\" For those of you who are not familiar with this pizza, just made sure your doorway is big enough to fit it through before you order it. \n\nThe selection doesn't end there. Gyros, calzones, salads, wings, a variety of bread sticks, desserts, and a whole-lot more. It's all good, bone-sticking and satisfying. Nom. \n\nJust FYI--I ordered two pizzas this past Sunday from Guy's for delivery during the Browns\/Steelers game. The game was quite gut-wrenching, BUT the pie was delicious and fresh. \n\nWhat's even better? The people who work here are friggin' awesome. You know what I'm talking about. Crabby teenagers and miserable people just seem to flock to pizza places and always answer the phone when you're ordering. I don't know if Guy's just has a vigorous recruiting process for their employees, but they are funny-helpful-friendly. We gave them a huge tip just for being cool. \n\nSo, thank you Guy's Pizza for your uber tasty pies, friendly service and the 5 lbs I'm sure I gained this weekend from devouring your precious delivery.
