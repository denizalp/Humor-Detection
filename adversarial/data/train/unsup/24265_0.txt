I wasn't quite sure what to expect from The Andy Warhol Museum but we had a great time working our way from top to bottom! Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Pittsburgh. It's not so big that it takes a lot out of your day, but definitely worth a couple of hours of exploration.\n\n$20 gets you entry to the museum for adults. The museum is organized chronologically from his younger years being at the top and his later days on level two. On the ground floor, you'll find the gift shop (don't you just love gift shops at art museums), a studio where you can practice silkscreen printing tote bags, t-shirts and more (at a fee), and a small cafe. \n\nMy knowledge of Andy Warhol didn't go a whole lot further than Campbell Soup prints, so it was fascinating to learn about his upbringing, ventures into film production, modeling, and more. I read every single plaque to make sure I didn't miss a beat, and was honestly very fascinated by it all. \n\nWhy four stars instead of five? There was some construction going on so one entire floor was vacant and a few other rooms incomplete. It also seemed like the exhibition that was there (Ai Weiwei) was only partially complete and it was a bit confusing. Maybe they took pieces out and kept some in while they were in transition? Regardless, maybe they should consider lowering the price of admission during this time!
