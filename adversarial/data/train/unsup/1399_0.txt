Yummy yummy yummy!! I tried this place based on the excellent reviews and I can say the pizza is great! Super fresh ingredients and the perfect sizes too. I got a mod I think and a mini and even though they may look small they are honestly filling. $8 for a pizza that good is a place I will be visiting a lot more from now on. Unlimited toppings all included?? Where have they been in the months I was looking for great pizza. The crust was great too flaky and fresh and just great! I highly recommend!
