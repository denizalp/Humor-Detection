Love the change in management, Kathy is AWESOME and her happy attitude keeps me coming back.  It is slow sometimes but is understandable considering she has been the only one in there a lot of the time.  Glad to see she is finally getting in and training new staff to get things back on par.  Love this place and the people, aside from a few one offs this place is awesome, her staff is great and Christian always has a great attitude, awesome addition to the crew.  Highly recommend.
