This place is totally legit. If u want flavorful food this is it. I love spicy food, but the 5 outa 10 is enuff for me, caution on going higher. Their fried rice, pad sew ew, is super tasty. I wish they had some bigger shrimp w tail off but their pricing is legit w what they r serving. Everything i have ever had here is good. Love the Roti, satay, the pad thai is a little different than the pad thai than im used too but maybe this is authentic, not sure, but it is still good. I used bitesquad for delivery, it was really fast and the food was still hot.
