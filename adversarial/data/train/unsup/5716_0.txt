Cream cheese in rolls. Loud, obnoxious music. You have to scream to talk. This is the epitome of trendy. Ra doesn't serve sushi. They serve pretentious hype. \n\nGive me authentic. Give me style. Give me an experience that doesn't make my ears ring. \n\nSimply, there are far superior places to go for sushi. \n\nOh, but what if you don't go for the food? Are you going for the social scene? The drinks? To be with the in-crowd? Oh, then ignore my rating. I'm only concerned with the fish.
