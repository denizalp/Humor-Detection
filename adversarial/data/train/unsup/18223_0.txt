What can I say but this place is rude, pretentious and not worth anyone's time, my friends and I walked into this place thinking it would be an awesome restaurant to check out but the second we walked in the door we were treated like shit. They basically told us to gtfo because we were in jeans and tshirts. This was at 1pm in the afternoon and all we had wanted was to check it out and grab a drink at the bar (we were also sober af), we get greeted by the hostess and she said \"you guys can't come in here\"?!? What kind of restaurant says that to paying customers? Apparently they learned their hospitality skills from united employees. Not even trying their food or drinks I highly advise anyone that visits Pittsburgh and end up riding the incline they fill find this shithole of a restaurant up top! DO NOT GO THERE unless you wanted to be treated as shit right as you walk in the door!
