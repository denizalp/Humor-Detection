The buttes look like a set created for the \"Flintstones\" movie back in the '90s and Universal just left them there. They just don't look real, but that's not say they aren't damned cool to look at and drive between. \n\nAnd let's not forget Hole-in-the-Rock and the Botanical Gardens. \n\nArizona has one gorgeous desert and the BEST sunsets. Papago Park is just one hell of a great place to watch the sky as it turns red and gold with cactus silhouettes in the foreground.
