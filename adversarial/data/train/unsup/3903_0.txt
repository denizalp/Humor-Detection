Hello.  I'm a stupid American that doesn't pay attention to local holidays.  I still don't really know what a \"Civic Holiday\" is, other than it means almost EVERYTHING is closed.  Funny I'm writing this on the American \"Labor Day,\" eh?\n\nWe struck out at Pai, Khao San Road, and one other Thai restaurant before finding Queen Mother Café.\n\nThank you, Queen Mother, for being open for us ignoramuses.\n\nIn the mood for Thai (duh), we ordered the Pad Thai.  While the waitress assured me that the \"spicy\" was indeed, spicy, this dish was milder than I had expected.  It tasted good though, and (bonus points) had both chicken and shrimp in the dish!\n\nI had two margaritas, both tart and strong.\n\nThe menu is a little all over the place in this moody, casual café.  There's also a full bar menu.  It saved our asses just before we started to get hangry.\n\nQueen Mother Café still probably would not be a \"destination\" for me, as I was obviously headed for some serious hot spots for Thai, but it worked beautifully as a back-up plan.  We left with our bellies full and satisfied.
