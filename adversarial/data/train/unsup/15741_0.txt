between my best friend and i, i think we've turned oodles of people onto this gem. we've brought mutual friends (kfood crew what up!!!), acquaintances, dates, family, you name it. and with one or two notable exceptions, everyone we brought either agreed wholeheartedly with us that this is a fantastic place, or at least agreed that we hadn't managed to overhype the place. lemme tell you, that is no small feat.\n\nalright, let's get started on stuff you guys probably actually want to read.\n\nthe food: is AMAZING. \n\nin terms of appetizers-- \nthis place probably has the absolute best seafood pancakes i've ever had in my life. they put generous, generous amounts of seafood in there, and i order it every single time and am never disappointed. once or twice it's been a little more overdone, but the one i got today was the perfect blend of chewy and crispy and not too oily. the potato pancakes are apparently also really great, and the ddeokbokki with instant noodles dish is a legitimate full portioned meal all on its own.\n\nside dishes-- \nthey have 6-8 different refillable banchan options. i don't think i remember them all though because my memory is terrible... \n- potatoes in a sweet sauce (i'm not a fan, but today they were really good!)\n- soft green crepe pancakes (super fun to eat and i don't know why?)\n- cucumber kimchi (!!!!!!!!!!! THE BEST)\n- japchae noodles (these glass noodles are never over-sesame-oil'd, and they add a sprinkle of black pepper just for extra yumminess)\n- kimchi\n- bean sprouts\n- i'm pretty sure this place has seaweed salad. i think. possibly.\n- tofu cake things!\n\nmain dishes-- \n(for the record, they have a brilliantly full variety of delicious veg\/seafood options.)\n- the pork bone soup here is supposed to be good (i'm not a fan in general, so i won't weigh in on that)\n- the cold noodles (naengmyun) is actually pretty good! and i'm not a fan of it, so that's something! the noodles are somehow a little chewier and tastier than others i've had at elsewhere.\n- aaaaaaaallllll the jjigaes (stew) are fantastic.\n- the squid\/bulgogi combination is to DIE for. it was a little oily the one day i got it, but it was still spicy and tasty and generously packed with ample amounts of everything that i was completely fine with it and didn't mind picking around some of the sauce. the beef was super tender, and so was the squid.\n- got the mapa tofu today, which i was a little skeptical of at first, but it's actually quite tasty even without any bamboo\/pork\/other chinese additions i'm used to! it's fully vegetarian, with only tofu, peppers, onions, and some carrots.\n\nand now for a brief respite from my unabashed gushing, because there are a few dishes i would recommend... less... than the others.\n- bibimbap at lunch is going to come intentionally chilled and you'll basically be eating a cold rice salad. that's just a thing that's done. bibimbap in general is hard to make spectacular, and it's so easy to make at home, so why order it if you're coming here for lunch?? maybe someone out there is a bibimbap connoisseur and can tell me what a spectacular bibimbap is supposed to be like, but otherwise, there are so many really amazing things to get from here, so i'd say just skip the boring bibimbap for now and get that the next time you're at an uninspiring regular old inauthentic korean restaurant.\n- actually that's about it. just don't get the bibimbap. lol\n\nbeer--\n- yeah, don't get this either... i mean, it's dirt cheap. which is great. but it always comes in this gross old kinda dirty looking bottle and bleh.\n\nthe ambience: everything else in the store is spotless and clean. it's very utilitarian in atmosphere, with some very blindingly bright choices in orange and green paint thrown in for some excitement, but honestly, at these prices, who cares if it kind of has a super clean food court vibe?\n\nthe pricing: pretty darn cheap. most dishes run from about 6.95 to 8.95, and that includes tax.\n\nthe service: fantastic!\n\nthis place is such a cute little family restaurant. there's never more than a few workers in total at any one time, even when the place (which is admittedly small) is packed, but they work so hard and are so cheerful and fast that you'd be hard pressed to complain much. the servers are almost always hardworking and attentive without being pushy, and at worst they're professional and distanced without giving you any attitude or anything. even when it's empty, it's not like they're standing around chatting or watching you and waiting for you to leave so they can kick up their heels and really let loose. one time i was with a fairly large group (about 8 of us?) and they came out and gave us an extra ddeokbokki dish on the house just because they made it accidentally and were then going to start making the dish we'd actually ordered right away. how sweet is that? they're so cute. we wouldn't have even known they almost messed up our order.\n\ni'm running out of characters
