I like  this park I really do but it's too far and the trees aren't fully grown so there aren't a lot of natural shading. Plus it took a long time for them to build it. 1 star. haha come on now of course I'm only joking. It's probably my favorite park in the area. \n\nLocated just north of 215 and Stephanie St, Cornerstone Park is a nice park where right in the middle you'll see a huge 31 acre lake that stretches across the entire park. You're not suppose to swim in the lake, so please don't, I don't even know if it's safe to but there are ducks, dragonflies, The lake is surround by a walking path so it is a nice peaceful walk if you do decide to however there aren't any water fountains or much shade along the path except for in the pavilion area. \n\nThere'a two separate pavilion so there can be two parties going on at the same time.  Both has heavy concrete tables and grills, bring your own charcoal and fire. Restrooms are usually clean. And there's electrical outlets.\n\nLarge grass field, don't remember if it was fake or real grass. There's 2 lighted full court basketball courts and some sand volleyball pits.\n\nI've never seen it busy with what seems like  enough parking to handle it if it got busy.
