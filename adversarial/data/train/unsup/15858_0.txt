I came here since it was on many of those \"must do in downtown Vegas\" lists. \n\nThe one star is for the fact that service was nice and friendly.\n\nThere are so many cons. The decor is tacky and distasteful. The spankings just seemed sad and fun only for those who were drunk and wildly awkward for everyone else. The prices are unreasonable. \n\nFor a place that claims to be a \"taste worth dying for,\" shouldn't the burger actually taste at least mediocre? The burger was overwhelmed by the chili, which is good but salty. The fries are crispy but flavorless otherwise. The milkshakes are thick and come with a slat of butter, but the only noticeable difference is that it's very smooth but feels like you're sipping room temperature butter with flavoring.  Frying something in lard doesn't automatically make it taste good. Honestly, it feels like a waste of calories and money coming here--Red Robin, Shake Shack, etc all have better food and prices.
