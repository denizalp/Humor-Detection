We wanted to try  something new and outside the strip. Found this jewel on a list called Best Las Vegas Restaurants: Secret Spots Where The Locals Eat. This place will not disappoint! They have great friendly service and very attentive. The ambiance is low light kinda romantic! The food is great! I highly recommend the spicy duck rice and the drunken noodles!
