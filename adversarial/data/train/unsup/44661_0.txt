Nice little discovery not far from home. We were a group of 6 so we ordered a bunch of different starters to share. The gyozas (with their respective sauce) were all good and tasty. We also had tempura shrimps, light, despite it is obviously fried, with also a nice sauce. We had brisket steamed buns as main course, it was so good we ordered more. Would go again for sure. Staff was really nice and patient with us and offered shots at the end of the evening.
