Review is strictly for the seafood buffet on Fridays featuring King Crab for 17.99 (used to be 15.99 all last year).\n\nIt's a bit out of the way but if you want the cheapest king crab in town, here is where to go. They don't have the long king crab legs as all the portions seemed to be of the sectional claw variety (see photo below). \n\nAside from serving the cheapest king crab in town, they also have a cooking station where they grill up fresh minute steak to your liking along with shrimp scampi sans pasta, quite my style. The steak, although thin, came out quite tender (had it cooked rare). \n\nThe dessert bar looked garbage so I went with the ice cream machine. Soft serve was middle of the road quality but they offer hot fudge and hot caramel which was nice since most places think they can get away with \"chocolate sauce\", totally NOT the same...and I went back for seconds.\n\nExpect to dine among a local crowd. Service, while friendly, is hit or miss. \n\nNote: The rest of the buffet looked like a miss but the clam chowder and chicken noodle soup weren't horrible.\n\nSteak+shrimp+king crab+hot fudge sundaes for $17.99? Keep it to that and it's a 3.5 star \"A-OK\"...not rounding up because the drive from Summerlin sucks and they raised the price.
