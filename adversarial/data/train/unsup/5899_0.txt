I was here today for an eye exam, and was so impressed by the wonderful service I received. The office is beautiful, and very upscale and professional. The lady at the front desk was so friendly, both on the phone and in person. \nThe doctor was also so friendly and helpful. She was professional, and kind. She told me if there is anything she can help me with, or questions, to not hesitate to call. \nThey are a family run business, and next door, family owns the optical store. They don't judge at all if your paying out of pocket, insurance, or on OW and ODSP. They treat everyone equal, and it's so nice to see a quality, family run business again! I HIGHLY recommend this office.
