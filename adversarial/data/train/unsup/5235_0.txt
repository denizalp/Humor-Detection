Tried it today and will now be a regular.\n\nUpon entering I was made to feel at home and I was very comfortable.  The staff were professional and the service was first rate.\n\nI ordered a pork and chorizo burger with a side of black bean and corn soup.  The flavours were vibrant and tasty without being overwhelming.  \n\nAs information, the inside of the restaurant seats 25 or so people, and another 20 or so on the sidewalk patio.  That said, the tables seem to turn over fairly quickly and those waiting were given coffee by the staff.  Nice touch.  \n\nThey serve wine and beer, and seemed to have a nice selection of desserts.  \n\nI can't wait to go back.  Give it a try.\n\n....and back I went for a late afternoon lunch.  \n\nNote: Kitchen closes at 4 PM for 30 minutes.  \n\nI had the Dairy Lane burger with bacon and fries.  It was terrific.    I noticed the list of Alberta suppliers on the wall.   The local sourcing of food combined with the care and attention it gets in prep make for great results.
