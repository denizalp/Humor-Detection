Just had an hour couples massage at Oasis Spa. Here is our review on their Groupon page that says, \"Share a tip.\"\n\n\"Share a tip? Well here's a tip for you. After paying for your hour mediocre massage, be sure to have a very impressive tip on hand so that you don't get treated like shit by the staff as you leave. Supposedly, according to what we were told, their massage therapists only work for tips. #bullshit \"\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't that be illegal? \nWe paid $35 each for a couples massage and when we were leaving the lady at the counter (surrounded by six other employees) called us out for not tipping. After being told that the girl ONLY get tips, My husband apologized and asked what was the customary tip amount. The lady at the counter said, \"Well, how much you like you massage?\"\nSo I said, \"Well I usually give my nail girl $5.\" So My husband reaches in his wallet and hands each girl a five. The condescending looks of disgust we received from the staff is one of the most tacky, unprofessional things I have ever experienced. Unbelievable.
