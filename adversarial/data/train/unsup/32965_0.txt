Ferraro is amazing in all aspects. The owners are very nice and the food is amazing!!  \nI love the fusili al polo and their pizza is very fresh. Very family friendly yet still has a simple bar if you're in the mood. they also have an outdoor seating which is very refreshing in the summer. \nMy favourite italian restaurant in toronto!
