We had heard about this place from a coworker. Since we were in the area, I decided to pick up treats for later. The staff was very helpful, and even looked up the recipe for the two that we wanted (Black Raspberry & Moose Tracks). My daughter insisted on eating some of hers right there on the spot. While I really liked the ice cream; the eating area not so much. Most of the tables were dirty, and several of them appeared to have been that way for a while. We sat at the cleanest of the available dirty tables. My original thought was a 3* rating; however, after my husband ate his ice cream I bumped it up a star. He said that it was the best he has had outside of New England.
