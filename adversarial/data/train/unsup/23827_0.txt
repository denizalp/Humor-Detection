6\/24\/15: One of the best meals we had during our whole week-long vacation in Canada!  The waitress was really nice to us, and the food was very good!  The restaurant had a great vibe, and the ambiance was warm and modern.  Prices are somewhat modest too for a high-end restaurant.  If I lived around here, I'd totally be a regular!\n\n1. Stn. Sparkler C$11:  Sorry can't remember remember details, but it certainly was good.\n\n2. Niagara Ice (2 oz) C$13:  Was refreshing and sweet, but again can't remember details.\n\n3. Bread:  Good French artisan bread with perfect texture.  If I remember correctly, the dipping sauce was different, perhaps apple cider vinegar with olive oil?  It was good.  Bonus points for doing something different.  8.5\/10.\n\n4. Digby Scallop Crudo C$13:  Scallops were fresh and the plate was beautiful.  Nice crunchy nuts for textural counterpoint.  8\/10.\n\n5. Lamb Neck Croquettes C$13:  Mmmm..... who doesn't like a good neck!?!?  Unfortunately the puree was a bit strong and overpowering.  It was a bit hard to taste the lamb flavor.  Also, why use a cast-iron pan to serve a cold dish?--odd.  5\/10.\n\n6. Slow-Cooked Rockfish C$25:  Perfectly cooked fish.  Typically you see rockfish in the better Chinese seafood restaurants where they are kept live in the tanks, visible to all.  But I've never seen this in a Caucasian restaurant.  Everything on the plate was delectable!  The title is a bit strange though cause it's obvious this fish wasn't stewed for very long, else it would not have such a delicate texture and flavor.  We did ask the waitress to explain the discrepancy, and I kinda recall a somewhat complicated process that might have involved sous vide.  So hence the \"slow-cooked\" part.  Anyway, whatever they did it was great.  9\/10.\n\n7. Stn. Burger C$21:  So I am not sure, but at another Canadian restaurant it was explained to us that there's a law saying you can't serve burgers less than well-done?  I dunno, but they didn't ask us here how we wanted it... and definitely didn't need our help cause it was perfect!  Probably just about medium--very juicy.  So this burger is unlike any I've ever had--it's actually stuffed with pulled meat--I believe the waitress said short rib?  I think a standard high-end patty still tastes better, but perhaps this was their way of keeping it moist while still abiding by the law (if there is one)?  Bonus points for creativity.  Didn't like the chutney spread much though--a little too much sweetness for my burger.  It's not dessert after all, ha ha.  Anyway, overall was great.  8\/10.\n\n8. The Acid Test C$9:  YOU MUST GET THIS.  It's like a candy store melted down and condensed into a plate!  So many colors.  So many toys for your tongue!  It's like a kaleidoscope you eat!  Fruity, sweet, syrupy, crunchy, completely mesmerizing!  In America I've never had any dessert like this, but I'm starting to think this might be more of a thing in Canada since after this I actually had another similar dessert--but this one was the best!  One of the best desserts I've ever had!  Seriously.  10\/10\n\n9. Free Ice Cream:  I don't believe this is standard for them, but they had a special dessert that day using this ice cream, and perhaps since we came somewhat late they had some extra to give us?  It was totally delicious, and REALLY SPICY.  I loved it!--the super spiciness was awesome against the cold of the ice cream.  Great stuff!  (And even better it was a gift!)  10\/10\n\n10. Gift Chocolate with our check:  Can't remember the details, but I liked it.\n\nDamn good meal.\n\n5\/5\n\n#canada #canadian #dessert
