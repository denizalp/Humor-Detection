6 mos ago I had three memberships to three different gyms around town and could never seem to make time to go to any of them or didn't want to deal with the crowds. My husband signed us up for Golds since we have gotten pretty out of shape. Not only do I love how convenient the location is, but everyone is very nice.  It's not a huge gym, which is just my speed. In the times I've been there, it hasn't been super crowded either (5pm) and I have been able to smash through my workout and get home. I did sign up for training sessions, they had a special going and I'm really looking forward to finally getting into shape than paying for a gym I'm never going to go to.  Donald, the trainer I signed up with, is great! Unintimidating,  knowledgeable and motivating (which is half the battle of going too)!! I would recommend this gym to anyone who is actually interested in working out and no nonsense.
