I dined here with my husband and two friends last night.  We sat at a high top table in the bar area.  I was pleasantly surprised by how good the free chips and salsa were.  The chips were thin and crunchy just the way I like them.  We had the fish tacos, chicken tacos and the mini chimis.  We all thought our dinners were delicious.  I had the grilled fish taco and they said it was halibut. It had large chunks of fish as well as avocado.  It came with an awesome sauce to pour over it.  The rice that came with it was equally as delicious.  The black beans that I received with it were a little bland.  \n\nThe decor was classy and they had a pretty good happy hour, too.  Service was spot on!   I will definitely be returning!
