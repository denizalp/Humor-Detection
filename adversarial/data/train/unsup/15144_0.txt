This place is terrible,  I called and made an appoinyment with specific guy and I was told that a student haicut was 20 dollars by the receptionist, the next day I came for my appointment,  the recptionsy said I never made an appointment,  and let a different barber cut my hair, he gave me a haircut wothout lining me up, he trimmmed roughly and left my hair uneven,  and once tje I was charged 23 dollars, I STRONGLY  RECCOMEND NOT GOING HERE
