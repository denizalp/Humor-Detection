Fix8 is helping me be a healthier eater!\n\nThanks to Fix8 opening just minutes from me, I am now able to get a great meal when I don't want to cook at home.  You chose from a wide variety of proteins, carbs and greens.  \n\nI have tasted several of their protein options.  My favorite is their Garlic steak.  It's tender with such a fulfilling flavor.  The 8 oz is almost too much with all of the brown rice they pack into your meal.  The mango salmon is good as well as the teriyaki chicken.  But nothing compared to the garlic steak.  \n\nA side salad comes with your meal.  You can opt to pay a few bucks more for various vegetable options. They offer broccoli, asparagus, mushrooms and spinach.  \n\nAnother option is their pre-packed meals.  You can choose what you'd like in 6 or 9 meal portions.  They offer delivery on Tuesday and Saturday. \n\nWith friendly and quick service, I can see this becoming a favorite.
