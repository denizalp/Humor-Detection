I am blown away by the customer service Constantine and Karina have provided to me and my company. We needed some polo shirts embroidered with a very tight deadline and they went above and beyond for us and got them done 2 days early! \n\nThe particular shirt I ordered wasn't going to be there in time so they found a similar, better quality, shirt and made sure they arrived in time. They send proofs before they print so you are 100% satisfied with your order. \n\nWe are a small up and coming company, but C and K has earned our business for all of our products!
