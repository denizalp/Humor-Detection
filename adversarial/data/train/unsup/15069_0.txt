I waited till my second visit to rate Soho 5 stars after having dinner and their happy hour.\n\nChef John literally delivers a strip-like Social House experience for a fraction of the price in a neighborhood setting.  A well-known friend chef of mine not to be named told me they took almost the entire menu and brought it to Soho - he frowned a little upon this but I have no issues with it.  The locals benefit from it and they put out one of the best happy hours in town.\n\nThe dollar tostastas are so addicting.   I feel like a child ordering 6 and 12 pack taco's from Taco Bell but this is obv much more refined, elevated cuisine.  My favorite is the salmon tostata but they are all good.  We got one of each as they offer 4 selections.   The rest of the happy hour has a cajun albacore sashimi, black cod lettuce wraps (YUM), and several roll selections.   The rice on the rolls were a little under seasoned but overall everything was good.  The waiter recommended the bacon wrapped kurobata sausages.  They reminded me of little smokey's.   I wasn't a fan at first but it was greatt paired with the pickled cucumber.  The rest of the HH items are all priced between $3-5 per item.  \n\nAs for dinner, I came on another trip and i was really impressed with their beef tataki.  It's 100 times better than Tonkatsu Kiyoshi's version and a level or too better than Kyara's.   I love their ocean trout topped with rock salt - love the textures and freshness of the dish.   We also ordered the beef short ribs, a Yelp favorite, live uni, oysters, and on my most recent trip i sampled their king crab topped with a little butter and hint of garlic.\n\nEverything here is great!  For dinner you won't find your yum yum roll here - This is more about the fish.  Chef John says that he gets his fish from the same supplier as most of the sushi spots on the strip so you literally are paying a fraction of what you would at Social House!
