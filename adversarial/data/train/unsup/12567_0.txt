A low-maintenance bar for low-maintenance people like myself! Beer in a can, live music in the room next door, and excellent people-watching. This is slightly off the beaten path on Central Avenue- blink and you'll miss it. I've found that there are two camps of people- those who have never heard of Tommy's, and die hard Tommy's fanatics. While I wouldn't consider myself a regular, I am definitely in the second group. This is solidly among the Milestone and Thirsty Beaver in competition for Best Dive Bar in the city. Luckily there are 7 days in a week so you don't have to choose- just make sure Tommy's is in your rotation.
