I wish i could give negative stars. I lived here over the summer for an internship and when I left, they were supposed to fwd my final service bill to my home address. Unfortunately, they were too incompetent to copy my address correctly and instead, kept mailing the bill to my correct street address, completely wrong city. Instead of calling me, or wondering why their letter kept getting sent back as 'undeliverable', they sent a debt collector after me for $69. The debt collector in turn was too incompetent to send me a bill after giving him my correct address for FOUR months, but still managed to call me at random hours to demand my credit card number even though I never received any sort of bill. Instead, he decided to insult me when i refused to give him my credit card info over the phone by asking if I was 'avoiding' them because I was too poor to afford the lousy 69 bucks.\n\nBottom line: DONT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH INCOMPETENT LOSERS SIX MONTHS AFTER YOU MOVE OUT
