Sign up for birthday emails and you can get a free egg sandwich. The bagels and coffee are also very good. Get there early for the cranberry bagels! One thing I don't particularly like is that they have a different register to order and to pay. I feel like they never have enough workers or orders to have someone queued up at the orders and pickups. Just use one!
