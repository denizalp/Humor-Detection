I usually don't like giving 3 stars or less..  But I honestly don't think this place deserves more than 2 stars!  Went there over the weekend with group of friends (5 people).  Okay.. I will just cut to the chase.  50 mins to get dinner.  Asked multiple times for refill.   Another 20 mins to pay.   $20 for 12 oz ribeye with 2 sides, and it wasn't that great!  I can get better service and better tasting steak for less at Texas road house.  This explains why lot of their locations are out of business..  Maybe they should change their name to \"Black Anus\".. LOL! Okay that was little rude!
