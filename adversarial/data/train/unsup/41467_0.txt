Best haircut I have ever received.  Frankie saved me from a horrible haircut.  I went in to get a bad haircut fixed.  He said he can't put hair back, but he can make some recommendations.  We talked it out.  And he made me look so good!  I will never go to another barber shop.  \n\nAlso...... They are cash only.  Which kinda sucks.
