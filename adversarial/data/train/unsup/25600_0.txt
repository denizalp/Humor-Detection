You pull up and find yourself parking in a strip mall.. you open the door expecting to be seated, but instead you are looking at a poster of Guy Fieri from DDD. You are then politely greeted and asked if this if your first time here. Then you're given samples different dishes... the jade red chicken is awesome.. free refills at the soda fountain... You wait for your food in anticipation in a simple open dining area. I sat at the table next to the Chino Bandito.. ariba! ariba!  The sugar cookie surprise topped off the very nice experience.\n\nI give this place a 3.8!
