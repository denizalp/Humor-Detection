Something White is the place to go to find a wedding dress in Cleveland! It is an adorable boutique with a great selection and fabulous service. I went into the shop not knowing what I wanted and Karin helped me find the PERFECT dress, I can't wait to wear it! She also helped me find some accessories to wear on the big day. I also attended their Boutique Bridal Bazaar in January and got so many great ideas and vendors for my Cleveland wedding! If you are wedding dress shopping in Cleveland, Something White is a must!
