Worst and least understanding customer service and hotel security I've ever experienced. Went to the beach club, lost my friends who had my hotel key, wallet, phone, and cloths. I then decided to wait outside our room until they came back. Instead of letting me into my room, hotel security came up and tells me I have to leave the premises because I had no t-shirt and no proof that it was my room. Guy litterally told me they would call the cops if I came back into the hotel. They kicked me out on the street wearing just a bathing suit, and told me to take a cab elsewhere. Where was I supposed to go, especially with no wallet and no phone to call anyone. I'm a paying customer with a room!! This was the most disrespectful act I've ever seen a hotel do upon a paying customer and will surely never come back.
