2 words....protein pancakes. These pancakes are amazing! They are made with blueberries and some other things including almonds. They have a taste of cinnamon also. Their eggs and skillets are usually pretty good too, but every time I go I have to get the protein pancakes. \n\nI have never had to wait for a table, but I typically go pretty early for breakfast. The service has also always been good, never had a complaint about it. It is definitely one of my favorite places to go for breakfast.
