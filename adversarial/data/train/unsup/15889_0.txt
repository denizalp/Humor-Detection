Consistent with the kiddy theme that is the Excalibur Casino & Hotel, this uber cheesy event is best served for a teenage date or a family fun outing.  Though I came here with a group of like minded youngins, I couldn't help but think if this was the type of place Ralph Macchio (AKA Daniel-san in Karate Kid) would bring Elizabeth Shue for a date.  I determined at the end of the show that it was not only karate kid worthy but totally not worth my $40 ticket.\n\nThe show takes place in an arena like venue, with cascading stadium style seats that surround a dusty pit made for folks on a horse.  Once the show begins, the characters that eventually joust each other to death while speaking in Medieval dialects are in character from start to finish.  Yes, this means cheesy lines, plenty of fake violence, and forced laughs \/ gasps from the audience for a good 90 minutes.  The waitresses are dressed like skimpy maids and while most of them were hot, something tells me they hate working there.  The chicken dinner that was served like it was in the middle ages, roasted and with little flavor and no utensils.  I suppose a pizza would've been asking for too much.\n\nAllergy sufferers beware, if the seats are near the dusty arena floor, then watch out for the horse dust that will eventually cloud up and rise.   I was coughing and gasping by the end of the show, no meds would've been strong enough to prevent all of the hacking.\n\nUnless members in the party are younger than 15, spend a bit more money and see something else.  Magic shows, concerts, The Blue Man Group etc. could beat the premise of this weak production any day.
