So I've always called this place Awful House, and really it aint that bad.   For some reason I thought it would be like an extra ghetto Dennys with more roaches and surly teenagers, but it was spotless and ruckus-free.   The waitress seemed happy to have people ordering more than just coffee and was pretty attentive, especially for a diner.  Good selection for a late nite menu. Im always down for late night eats and now this is one more place to try when the city is too hot to venture out in during the day.
