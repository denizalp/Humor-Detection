What better to write about Food that I love the most for my 600th Yelp review. (BTW, this is also my 1st anniversary review since I wrote my first ever Yelp review on November 11, 2009 when all these Yelp Madness started!)\n\nYes I love Japanese food, especially something that is authentic. Not traditional but authentic in the spirit of the art of Japanese cooking! \n\nIn the sense that the chefs spends a lot of time and effort to: \n- try to buy the freshest and the most seasonal ingredients \n- perfect the process of food preparation \n- paying attention to details \n- make the presentation a work of art \n- understand serving the end product with people that appreciated is their goal \n\nShinobu Sushi is really the ONE! Love the small, intimate set up. The chef is the one that prepare every single order which ensure that everything that Shinobu serves are up to his standard. \n\nI have to say the sushi rice is the best I have in Toronto. That alone blow my mind away. Now I don't really want to eat those crappy rolls\/sushi in other places... don't tell me that it is the same as AYCE. \n\nThe Volcano Rainbow Roll ($8.90) is so awesome. I know using the blow torch is something more westernized but it does give the roll a really complex taste... \n\nThe quality and the cut of the Sashimi is amazing... and with the fresh wasabi..(thanks GOD no tube thing!) oh so melt in your mouth orgasmic experience! (gee I don't believe I wrote that!) \n\nThe price is reasonable so compatible to other Korean\/Chinese Sushi place I have been too. Extra +1 stars! I hate pretentious places that charging people stupid prices for their food!\n\nShinobu Sushi is one of the few Japanese restaurants which I will say \"I AM IN!\" when someone ask me to go for dinner! \n\n*Thanks my Food Crawl Buddy  for including this little gem in our mega Food Crawl!
