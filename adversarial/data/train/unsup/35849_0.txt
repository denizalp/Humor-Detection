I had a mammogram scheduled at the Women's Imaging Center yesterday. It was my first mammogram after completing chemo and radiation. Although I had met my deductible I was informed that I owed $210 which I did not have at the time. I cancelled my appointment and left in tears. Absolutely no compassion from the staff. It has been a really rough year and I hoping to see that I'm cancer free.\n\n\nThey sent the nice email below. I gave them my info and no response. I guess that when your done with Chemo and Radiation they no longer care.
