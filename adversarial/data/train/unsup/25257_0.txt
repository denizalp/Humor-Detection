This place is quality,  I've been here twice and so far the only thing better than the service is the food.  The grilled meat is especially good.  When it comes to Mediterranean Cuisine I'm very picky. The chicken kabob is full flavored and juicy as is the kefta and tenderloin. I highly recommend trying the mixed grill and get tenderloin since the kefta is already a mixture of beef and lamb.  If you like meat on a stick you wont be disappointed.
