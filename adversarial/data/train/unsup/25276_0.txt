WHAT A FAB FIND in DOWNTOWN SUMMERLIN ~\n\n  While I am not a beer devotee, don't like it! Don't drink it don't want it!!! This is a great place to go & drink and most definitely EAT! \n  \n   We made it in time for Happy Hour, which was an added bonus for sure~ my gf ordered a craft beer on the recommendation of our REALLY GR8 server (sadly I didn't get her name) and raved about it.o ordered a cocktail as they do have a full bar, just no specialty liquors or blender.\n\n  We ordered apps consisting of the fried cauliflower, deviled eggs w\/speck & a margarita pizza. All simply DEEELISH! And the real stand out was the cauliflower....very different however delicious served with blue cheese dip & hot sauce, kinda like buffalo wing sauce~\n\n  The weather was nice so we sat outside in a booth that had it's own heater ~ quite nice & comfy too! If you plan on conversation outside would be preferred as indoors gets pretty LOUD~\n\n   Very casual and in addition to the bar & outdoor seating they offer more traditional tables for dinner off from the bar area. Ez & plenty of free parking so this makes it even more appealing...
