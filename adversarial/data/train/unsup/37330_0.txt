I'm literally sitting inside Kung Fu Tea right now taking a break from my work to write this review. It's my first time at here and I'm very impressed! I've heard lots of great things about this place, so I had to come check it out.\n\nAtmosphere: From what I can tell so far, it's really chill. The seats are comfortable, there are a handful of tables, and it's quiet\/relaxing. It's definitely not as crowded as places like Chatime, but tastes just as great! They play soft Asian music in the background which I'm not the biggest fan of... but this is Chinatown we're talking about so I wouldn't expect anything else.\n\nService: The baristas behind the counter seem nice and friendly. They're also patient because I pretty much stood by the cashier for a good 10 minutes staring at the menu while they waited for me to order and gave me a run down of what the popular drinks are.\n\nDrinks: There are a wide variety of drinks here, but I decided to be super basic and get a regular Pearl Milk Tea under the King Fu part of the menu. Oddly enough, the simplest drink here still tastes different and unique. I love the flavour - it's creamy, not too sweet, and has a delicious milky taste! They use honey in your drinks as well so maybe that has something to do with it. I got a regular amount of honey and it still tasted good to me; wasn't too sweet or overpowering at all.\n\nOverall a great bubble tea place in Toronto\/Chinatown. Also makes for a good study or remote work spot. I would definitely return to try more of the drinks on the menu!
