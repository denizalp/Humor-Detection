Super friendly staff (front desk lady and owners daughter who I believe is the owner now). Fixed my dog ate glasses for free! I also got a new pair of glasses (Marc Jacobs) and they were incredibly cheap compared to any corporate store. They have a ton of designer frames that are all very reasonably priced. Lenses are SUPER cheap compared to other stores. I was in and out in 20 minutes. Wouldn't go anywhere else!
