I've known this restaurant for over 10 years now, I just do not go often because it is quite a drive from my place, and a little pricey for thai food, but it is good !\n\nI went back tonight for my bday dinner. You can reserve on OpenTable, but only for 6 people (max) so I called them to change it to 15 and they cancelled my Open Table (oh well). We were well greeted and were seated in the back, and since we were the only group in the back we had privacy, which was great ! \n\nI really enjoy their papaya salad (you can ask for the shrimp powder on the side if you're not too sure you'll like it) and their pad thai !! It's well spiced, and you can ask for citrus (they don't serve it automatically but have it). I also really used to enjoy their tom yum, in my mind at least, but tonight was a bit disappointed to it, it's not as tasty as I remember it. \n\nService was really good and we did not wait that long for food. Everyone on my table enjoyed their meal !!
