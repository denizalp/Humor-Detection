As a local, I have to admit that I thought this was a cheesy tourist trap, before I took a ride myself. My Valentine's day date took me here and we had a gondola to ourselves. We took great photos and actually had a really fun time! The gondolier was very nice and definitely tried his best to put on a show. I think it's worth doing at least once, just to have the experience and the pics!
