Let me first start off with the things I like about this place. The food here is good, I wouldn't say it's the best breakfast in town, but it does the trick. I would best compare this to what you make at home, nothing fancy. What brings this place down some is the fact that it is just as good as what you could do at home. The ingredients fall short for me. The bacon and sausage are just okay, nothing special. The service also is just okay, not the friendliest front of house. With all of that mumbo jumbo said, I would say this place is a good place to get a simple fresh meal for a good price. \n\nSide note: You may smell like breakfast after so bring a change of clothes!
