We have lived in Medina for twelve years. Over the years, we have really enjoyed Dominics. But lately I have noticed that the quality of food and service has been declining. This evening, we ordered the fish special (8 piece bucket of fish, French fries, slaw & rolls $14.99). I realized, after I called, that I forgot to ask for tartar sauce and vinegar. So, I called back. The girl who answered the phone told me that the meal came with tartar but more would be extra. I asked her how much it came with. She said two cups. Two cups of tartar is not a lot for 8 pcs of fish. So I asked about vinegar. Any vinegar is extra. I paid with a card. I wasn't about to put tartar sauce and vinegar on my credit card, so I went without. So, my experience is alread soured before I have even taken a bite. We've noticed more and more nickel and diming from this restaurant recently. That combined with a decline in quality and service does not spell continued success. Beware, Dominics. The customer NEEDS to come first. Don't squander an opportunity on a few extra pennies.
