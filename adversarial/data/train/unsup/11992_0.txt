A scam!  \n\nMyself and 3 friends bought VIP tickets to go here. But when we got to the place were told to wait in a crowd and make our way to the front. After 15 minutes we were approached by a bouncer who encouraged us to tip him to get in. So we offered him $20. He said \" try 5 x that\" and walked away.  \n\nA few minutes later my friend went to the front and explained our complimentary vip tickets. The bouncer at the door also requested a line tip to let us in. \n\nI can't believe the bellagio hasn't cought on to this scam yet!
