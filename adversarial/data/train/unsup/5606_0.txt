Last cheat meal before a photoshoot? I voted for barbeque, so we looked on Yelp and thought we'd give Bobby Q Grille a try. Off the bat, minus 1 star for no ribs available on a Sunday afternoon... *sad face* But Bobby Q redeemed itself in other ways, as follows...\n\nOur server Stef was very nice. The restaurant was not particularly crowded but there were a handful of other patrons there. Stef was the only server and she did a great job of being attentive.\n\nWe ordered:\n-Cornbread\n-Shrimp and grits\n-Bbq platter (no ribs available though)\n-Chicken tenders (with Oscar Goodman sauce)\n-Sides: coleslaw, vegetable of the day, mac & cheese\n\nThe best part of the entire meal was the OSCAR GOODMAN SAUCE on the chicken tenders. I asked Stef for a spicy sauce recommendation. Her reply, \"well, the Oscar Goodman is made with habeneros, but are you sure you want that because it's so spicy I can only get through one chicken tender. Some grown men even cry.\" Um...that was music to my ears, lady. I WANT THE OSCAR GOODMAN SAUCE!\n\nIndeed, it was SPICY. I think I could have handled it maybe even a notch spicier (blame my Korean palate) but maybe that could be accomodated with a gradient scale when ordering that sauce. Regardless, it was flavorful, spicy, and even though I was quite disappointed when we first arrived to learn that there were no ribs available for order (it IS a bbq place, right?) that sauce really made my meal.\n\nI will definitely be back again soon, and the next time I'm there I hope that 1.) I can finally try some ribs and 2.) that I can buy a bottle of that sauce.
