This used to be my favorite cafe, but lately it's been really disappointing. The last 4 times I've been here the quality of the drinks have been especially terrible. I used to come here every weekend, so I know my order really well. I usually get a small hot chai, and it was my favorite chai of all time. Since early July, the chai has not been the same, and when I order a latte, the foam take up 1\/4 of the drink! When I pick it up it FEELS obviously light and when I take a sip, the layer of foam is unbelievably thick. This also applies to the chai, and the people who make it haven't been putting in as much cinnamon or any of the spices that usually go in it. I always come in around 11 PM - 2 AM, and usually on Saturday or Friday nights. I thought maybe the first time it was because there was a new employee, but it's been CONSISTENTLY like this ever since.\n\nBut the best thing about this place is the lemon lavender cake. I haven't had it in a while, but it's very flavorful and moist. I hope it hasn't changed
