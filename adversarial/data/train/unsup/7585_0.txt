A stand alone restaurant and not in any hotels with plenty of parking.  Travel back in time to old Vegas with super cheesy d√©cor, neon lights, but hey it's all good.  Fashion repeats itself...  Enough about the looks, you'll see it for yourself.\n\nThe portion are decently large, but that didn't stop me from pouding my burger, fries and eating a handful more of sweet potato fries off my friend's plate.\n\nThe chicken focaccia is a pretty big hit, with pesto sauce, it's always a good time.  The chicken was so tender and I shouldn't be shocked, but it was tasty.  \n\nThe word is, the chocolate milk shake look enticing, but hardly worth the calories since it taste worse than Hershey's chocolate.\n\nIf you're a breakfast person, you can eat here anytime 24\/7, as this joint serves it all.  \n\nThe worst service was the lone cocktail waitress that serves the entire restaurant was no where to be found, after 3 different waitresses requested for her to come by our booth.  If you want a drink, you just might have to find the bartender yourself.  \n\nWe went home with a free souvenier picture and the suckers we are, one of us spent $20 to get another photo =)  All in good fun!  A must try in Vegas if you have time to kill.
