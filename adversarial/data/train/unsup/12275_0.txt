I love eating with my hands.  It is such a sensual way to enjoy an exotic meal.  I appreciate that the Ethiopian House restaurant encourages customers to use their hands for the full experience.\n\nThe menu was extensive with a great selection for vegetarians.  I went with my gut and ordered Tibs.  The pan fried beef sauteed with onions, garlic and awaze.  It was finger-licking good.  Normally, I don't like injera, but it was the perfect compliment to Tibs.  Especially the part that was completely soaked with all the spicy juices.\n\nNot familiar with words like awaze or berbere?  No sweat.  Look for \"Do you know what it means?\" on the menu.  I found the information very useful.\n\nThe cultural ambiance, the attentive service and the food -- everything was fantastic!
