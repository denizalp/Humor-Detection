I'm kind of digging this place. It's like they took the downstairs beer bar area of Salud and made a cool, adult hangout upstairs. It feels a little sketchy when you open the door and just stare straight at a flight of stairs, but as you walk up each step, you hear the laughter and socializing get louder and louder. By the time you're at the top, you know you're in the right place. \n\nThey have a fairly small bar. Several chairs around, but really just a spot to get a drink and go sit down. They have a bunch of large communal tables, a lounge area with plush chairs, and a skinny table where you can stand and rest your beer. It's definitely set up so you can talk to people you don't know and make friends. \n\nThis is definitely the place you want to come on a hot summer day to meet up with a group of friends. It's fun, social and you're sure to have a good time trying some interesting beers and meeting new people!
