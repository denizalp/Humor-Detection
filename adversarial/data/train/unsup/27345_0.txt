I can't say enough great things about this chain. I have been to 3 locations now, and all 3 have a great ambiance and the Bruschetta is literally my favorite thing to eat anywhere in the valley. They have a decent wine selection too. This spot has an awesome patio that is super cozy looking out into Kierland.
