Went here for dinner without a car wash. Full rack of ribs slathered in sauce with two sides (I chose coleslaw and fries). The meat was moist and came easily off the bone. It was certainly not the best ribs I've ever had, but solid nonetheless. The sides were average.\n\nIt's an interesting little eating space on the inside. Certainly not charming, but not without its own eclectic character.\n\nOur servers were attentive and nice, although I felt a bit rushed by them at the end of the meal.\n\nWe did a quick walkthrough after the meal and scanned high end gas station fare with plenty of kitschiness and some Restoration Hardware furniture for lounging. Not your average place whether you are getting gas, a car wash, leopard print steering wheel covers, a beverage to go, a brisket, etc., etc.
