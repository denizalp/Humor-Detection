I got pretty blasted and decided I wanted chicken wings late night and this place had 5 star reviews and man everyone must've eaten somewhere else because the food sucks.\n\nI ordered 20 chicken wings and 6 cheese sticks delivery. Let's start with the cheese sticks like the cheese was barely melted like lukewarm and they didn't taste like anything. Sad.\n\nThen we got the wings it's like they didn't season them or anything just dumped em in the fryer for 97 minutes because they were overcooked as fuck. So damn dry and the skin was hard. I got them plain because I didn't want buffalo sauce not because I wanted them to be flavorless and terrible. I couldn't even eat them. I even felt bad about giving them to my dogs, so I didn't. \n\nI don't know if the pizza is good here or what but everything else on the menu got gluten in it and my wife can't eat that so I guess we're just never ordering from here again. I mean I wouldn't anyway but still. If you decide to, skip the wings and cheese sticks.
