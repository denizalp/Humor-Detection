I have never had such awful service!\nWe ordered 2 pizzas online and showed up to pick them up right when the website told us our pizzas would be ready. When we walked in we were asked what our order was and then paid for it. We then sat down waiting for our food. About 20 minutes went by in which 4 more customers walked in, paid and left with their orders. Finally, we were asked what we had order. After informing the kid once again what we bought, he walked over to the heated pizza holder and pulled out our order. Then, with no words spoken, he set the order on the table we were waiting at and walked away. \nI didn't even know what to say to the worker so we just went home only to eat a soggy pizza with a chewy crust (assuming from sitting in the warmer for a half hour).
