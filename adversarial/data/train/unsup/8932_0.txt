This bakery has been here a while now. I did not stop in until a couple of days ago. \n\nI can not speak on the deli aspect of it, I did not get any meats. \n\nI did however ask for one item that in on the menu. I was told this is a special order item. Well then state it as such. So I got a poppy seed something or other. It was dough with poppy seed shaped in to a roll. One personal sized lemon cake and an eclair. The poppy seed doohickey had no flavour, I mean nothing. The eclair was pretty bland and tasted as less than stellar ingredients were used. The lemon cake was so bad it was trash canned after one bite. \n\nSo I can honestly say I have had better. Arizona has a hard time with good bakeries. \n\nThe bakery it self felt bordering on depressing. I could not stay there for long.
