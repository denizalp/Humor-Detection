Terribly slow service! I ordered curbside pickup from work today. The pick up time they gave me was 1:45 pm. I was there at 1:40 and called to let them know. My order didn't come out until 2:05...20 minutes late! I was late getting back to work and when I opened it 5 minutes later, it wasn't even hot! I will not be ordering from here again.
