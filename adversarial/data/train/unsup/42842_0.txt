So disappointed.  When we first arrived, 7:15 on a Friday night, the restaurant is empty and we had to wait for them to set our table.  I realize that the theater crowd just left but with the people all gone how long does it take to reset a table of 4 for a 7:45 reservation. Then, while setting the table the hostess set all the glasses by touching the rims.  Yuck. So the ladies ordered glasses of wine and the men Woodford and ginger ale. The waitress came back and said they only had enough Woodford for one drink!  They would have been better off saying they didn't have Woodford as it was more like enough for 1\/2 of a drink. We ordered an appetizer to share and our meals. The waitress came back again and said they were out of shrimp so one person had to order a second choice but she made no mention of what they would do with the appetizer as it had shrimp on it also. When we asked she said they were going to substitute calamari. The food was decent but the experience was terrible. They have lost a customer.
