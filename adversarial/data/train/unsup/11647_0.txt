Phoenix is lucky to have a theater like this, and by that I mean one that brings in the documentaries, foreign films, and award nominees that don't get play in the regular multiplexes.\n\nSure, other towns sometimes have one art theater that will play a limited selection of these movies, but to have a multi-screen theater that runs these films continuously throughout the year is just a treat and Harkin's Theatres should be commended for making this available.\n\nYes, it's a little dated inside, and I do wish they had stadium seating, but those are minor complaints. In fact, I'm old enough to remember going to see Tron when it was first released in 1982 at the Camelview (before the mall even had another theater) and I loved the theater then and I still love it today.\n\nI certainly hope the rumors that this theater will be demolished to make room for more mall expansion are just rumors because the Camelview Theater is a shining point of light for cinephiles in the Valley and it deserves to remain so.
