There's no reason to go here.\n\nWhy would you drop $10 on a fast food burrito when you're surrounded by a plethora of BETTER, CHEAPER and TASTIER options?\n\nThis place isn't even the best burrito place on this block.\n\nSure,  I had a hunch before I walked in here that this would be the case... but I was drawn in by the faux-graffiti sign and the fact that it had just opened this location.\n\nBland food.  Canadiana Fast food aesthetic.  No Interac.  Vomit slurpie.
