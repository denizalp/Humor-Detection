Mori and the Uehara crew are great guys. I brought in my Subaru Legacy after making an appointment for a full suspension install with wheel\/tire mounting.  The pricing and quality of work was great and their communication was top notch.  Mori offered tips on which parts would work best for my car and i couldn't be happier with the results.  Definitely recommend!
