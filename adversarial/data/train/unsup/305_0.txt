I love this establishment don't get me wrong, but I was disappointed in the food I received today. As always, I ordered the quarter chicken with fried yuca and cilantro infused rice. My chicken was so dry (which could be masked by the tasty sauces thankfully) and my rice was so hard so it did not seem fresh to me. \n\nBesides this, service was on point. I would give it 5 stars. I had people constantly checking up on me, asking if I needed more water, asked about dessert, etc.
