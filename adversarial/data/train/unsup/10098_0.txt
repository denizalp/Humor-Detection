So my craving and curiosity finally over rode my laziness to truck to the north but let's say it was SO worth it!!\n\nThis place is not only like Pinkberry but in my humble opinion surpasses it! The Twangy fro-yo has the familiar tang but with a more creamy mouth feel and tangier intensity. They also offer WAY more toppings including cereal, fruit and jimmie's... while they have my beloved Fruity Pebbles and Mochi they also have loads of other items. Included cotton candy (looks like the candy Nerds but tastes like cotton candy).. very unique. Other fro-yo flavors include Pomegranate, Mango, Blueberry and of course the PB like Twangy.\n\nWe also tried the frozen custard.. oh yeah, good stuff as well though, I was loving my Twangy to much to even think about ordering it. We met the owner very handsome Dave Cha, super nice guy,  and knowledgeable about all things fro-yo. It was a treat to meet someone with such enthusiasm and genuine sincerity.. especially in that neck of the woods (North Scottsdale). \n\nIf you have a craving for the good stuff.. do yourself a favor and head to Ice Tango.. I really don't think you'll be disappointed. Hurry before the word gets out and there are lines out the door!!
