A small natural health store just north of the High Level Bridge in Cuyahoga Falls. It didn't seem like this place had many customers. Then again, I went a few minutes before the store closed.\n\nThis place is a Christian, family-owned business, minus the bigotry of Chick-Fil-A or the obscene, hypocritical right-wing politics of InfoCision (what happened to \"blessed are the peacemakers\"?). They are very nice and helped me out with my purchase. They even gave me testimonies of how certain products helped them or people they know. The best part is they seemed honest, even telling me which products don't work.\n\nI don't fully understand what \"natural health\" means. I mean, what makes whey protein organic or non-organic when both use chemicals to enhance workout results?\n\nMy first time here was definitely a memorable one. I plan on returning.
