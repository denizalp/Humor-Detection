Horrible atmosphere: the smoke from BBQ is simply annoying; overpriced beer and food. They play loud music till 2 am on the rooftop patio! Don't know how they get away from the law and order and more astonishing how none of the residential condos complain about the noise. \n\nNot going back; not worth my money!
