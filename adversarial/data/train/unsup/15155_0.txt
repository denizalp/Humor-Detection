I discovered Blue Sky Yoga in 2005 and Cheryl is my top favorite yoga teachers.\n\nCheryl's teachings is traditional and spiritual.  I have been in her Sacred Sunday Classes where I can feel the healing energy as I go through the vigorous postures.  \n\nI have been to so many yoga studios and experienced a handful of yoga teachers. But for some reason, I can only feel everyone's vibrant energy as we chant...OHM Shanti Shanti OHM in Cheryl's classes! It's silly to others but only a few will get it. And for those that do, isn't it amazing? \n\nI highly recommend Cheryl at Blue Sky Yoga and she also teach private classes, which I am looking into.  \n\nNamaste Yoga lovers!
