Me and my fianc√© came here for drinks. We were seated outside  and it wasn't too busy. We waited for over 25 minutes and  not a single wait staff came by. A couple who was seated 10 minutes after us was waited on and able to receive their drinks before we left. I would understand  if it was super busy but it wasn't and I noticed the waiters stopped by every other table while we were there with the exception of ours. After 25 minutes of waiting for not even someone to come by we were done with this place. The one good thing -- the hostesses were very polite.
