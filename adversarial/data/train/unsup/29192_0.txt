Bought items. Checked out. Got coupon for $5 off any CVS brand item.\nReturned to store to use coupon. Told the I cannot use the $5 off because the account number on the receipt does not match my account number. HOWEVER, it was MY purchase, and MY credit card's last 4 on the receipt. They basically accused me of taking someone else's receipt and trying to use the coupon. Really, over $5? Called corporate. NOTHING can be done because the numbers don't match. \nWELL, I got a coupon from CVS pharmacy in my Target store to use at that Target store. When I went to check out and use that coupon, the cashier said she could not use the CVS coupon. A manager was called over, and she overrode the register and applied the coupon.\nSo, how hard it that?  \nCorporate CVS said there is NO WAY to override the system or apply the $5 to my correct card. So their mistake is non-reversible.  I was told they would happily let me buy anything else in the store.\nDON\"T give out coupons you will not honor, just to get people back in your store.
