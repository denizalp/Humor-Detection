Great experience. The staff are all very helpful and did a great job making me feel welcome.  There is a great selection to choose from.\n\n The only obstacle for me would be there seems to be a couple price points and much more inventory in some of the higher points. I'm not doubting they are worth that much at all, but I can only spend so much on clothes. I completely spent a few more dollars than intended too but  I really enjoy what I got. I thank the gentleman that helped me  (I'm sorry I can't remember his name) put together a couple outfits so I wouldn't look silly on vacation.
