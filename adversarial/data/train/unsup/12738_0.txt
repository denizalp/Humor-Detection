'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane...but I normally know when I'll be back again. \n\nThis is what I like the Phoenix airport the most...I like it when I'm leaving to go somewhere fabulous and fun. But while that only happens here and there and I can't judge an airport based on where I'm flying to, this review will be about the airport and not my traveling adventures. \n\nI'll start with my likes. \n\n - I like that they have some reasonable parking options that don't leave you $25 poorer everyday your motorized vehicle sleeps over. \n- I like that they have a Paradise Bakery \n- I like that they have a Borders Bookstore. My pocket book doesn't. \n- I like that they have Cold Stone Creamery. My waistline doesn't. \n- I like that on most occasions, I can get through security in under ten minutes, but I might have to give the crappy economy a point for this one. \n- I like that they have free wi fi. \n- I like that the flights are normally on-time. \n- I like that the staff is friendly \n\nWhat I don't like...\n\nIf Phoenix International Airport was the only airport I'd ever visited, I'd probably give it four stars, but unfortunately I've seen what a truly fabulous airport can look like (I'm talking about you, North Carolina Airport and you SFO International Airport...the list continues) \n\nI don't really like that the food varies based on the terminal. For example. I love frozen yogurt...as if you couldn't tell. Well, TCBY is only in terminal A (I think) but I'm always sent to terminal C or D...so then fro yo is a no go and my sweet tooth argues with me the rest of the trip. \n\nI don't like how incredibly creepy the airport feels after 9 pm. Every time I've taken a red eye, the airport was eerie and nothing was open for me to get a drink or snack. I thought the airport knew the term \"midnight snack.\" \n\nI think that's about it what my likes and dislikes. When it comes down to it, the airport does its job --- it sends people to their destination and it welcomes them when they come home. I guess they shouldn't make it too comfortable because then they'd find lurkers trying to eat at the restaurants all the time instead of just when they are in fact traveling.
