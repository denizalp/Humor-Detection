We went here today for breakfast, and we will come back tomorrow with friends. Yes, this is good!!! \nGreat service, really modern interior design, most of the food is good, especially their daily donut and savory French toast. Management is attentive and greets every table ... my new favorite breakfast spot. And I will come back with my girlfriends for their noon high tea which needs to reserve 24 hrs ahead and starts at 10am.
