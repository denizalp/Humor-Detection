This is a salon that has future to be great. A few things that could change: fix air conditioner . Fans blowing all around does not seem sanitary. Brighten it up a little bit, it has a dark feel to it. It is convenient and I really adore Ashley, she is an up and coming stylist. She listens, she asks questions and is not over priced. Shelley is a wonderful manicurist. She has a lot of great ideas and can draw just about anything. Her partner Wendy is sweet and will always share a color Shelley may not have. \nThey have a manicurist there that is annoying- she is loud, sings and every other word out of her mouth is like. It drives me crazy!!
