We wanted to check out the hype on this Cure Burger, so that's one of the items we ordered...\n\nI ALWAYS order my steaks\/burgers medium rare, but this was a time where I couldn't because it wasn't an all beef patty, the cure burger is a mix of beef and pork, so we ordered it medium. We also ordered Their steak sandwich(forgot the name) and split both. I think it was kinda like a French Dip.\n\nOur Server was great, offering suggestions and answering questions we had about anything on the menu. Our orders came out rather quickly and dug right in. The steak sandwich was very tasty, meat was well seasoned and the roll was nicely toasted. The Cure Burger was love at first bite, and is as good as everyone raves about! A bit messy in a good way, and the Jalapeno Jam gives it a nice kick. We enjoyed every bite.\n\nI don't know about you, but after having something savory, I crave something sweet, so we took a look at the dessert menu. Their Bread Pudding sounded good, so we went with that.\nWhen our server brought it to our table, our initial reaction was WTF!?!? This BEAST could seriously feed 4-6 people and pretty much covered the entire plate almost! The gooey nut topping part was good, but the custard part needed a little more love. After a couple of stabs, we were done.\n\nGreat visit, and a good spot for late night drinks and bites, but the kids aren't allowed...ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  4
