Do yourself a favor and rent from a reputable car rental company. They mislead you on the pricing you get when you make an online reservation. They breakout the price differently on the estimated cost when you take delivery by adding an upgrade fee which they cross out and tell you not to worry about. Meanwhile, that is the price you are agreeing to pay because that is your contract. Don't be fooled by the friendly staff. They work hard to hide the game they are playing. \nOn top of that, they charge administrative fee per day for using the toll payment device ($5\/day) for making one toll bridge pass.  When I inquired about their system prior to using the bridge, they told me not to worry, my card would be charged for the toll, they would not mention anything about the administrative fee. \n\nReally, when you think you are getting a good deal by choosing a cheap option, watch for every detail on the contract and make sure that's the deal you want.
