I am no stranger to Winners as there are 2 within walking distance of where I work, 2 within driving distance of my house, and plenty of others that I've gone to before.  This one has got to be one of the worst ones I've been to.\n\nWhile selection is plentiful, the quality and trendiness of their apparel is underwhelming.  They do however, have one of the biggest men's sections I've seen at any Winner's.  All of their Christmas stuff is piled up in front (mostly chocolates and gift sets), and their foods section is quite scant.\n\nPerhaps the worst part of this Winners for me was the lineup at the cash register that seemed like it never moved.  It wouldn't hurt to put a few more cashiers on the till especially being holiday season.  It was an unpleasant line of snakes and ladders and I'm glad I was near the front of it as it would definitely turn me away if I were only wanting to grab a few items.
