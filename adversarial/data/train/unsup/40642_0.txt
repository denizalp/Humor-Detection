Good, friendly service like the PHX locations.. The toppings were a tiny bit scarce today compared to normal but that may be due to chef error (hence 4\/5 stars). \n\nSuper busy even at 5:45pm today, guess it's post-work time which makes sense. Just shocked since it wasn't the 8oclock yet (when they have their specials on Monday's and Tuesday's-- bottle of wine with a board of 4 diff bruschetta).
