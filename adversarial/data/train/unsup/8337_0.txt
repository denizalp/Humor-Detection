One of those many experiences where I should have read deeper into the many ratings.\nBefore I start I would like to say that there were 15 employees working when I was there. Seriously? I'm just going to assume it was a training session because no fast casual restaurant needs that many employees working and bumping into each other. \nI ordered an 8 piece Mix Box ($12.99) and 2 sides; Reg Red Beans ($1.99) and a Reg Mac & Cheese ($1.99).\nThe chicken was fine. Nothing special at all. K thought for the money I should have just picked up 2 whole roasted chickens at Costco. The sides? Well I can only comment on the Red Beans because instead of Mac & Cheese I got Mashed Pot & Gravy. And C was really looking forward to the Mac & Cheese. The Red Beans were fine, again, nothing special. For the 2 bucks, the size was pretty small as well. K ate the Mashed Potatoes and Gravy and she said it was fine as well, but again, nothing special.\nAverage Chicken, employees can't read\/fulfill orders, price vs size ratio a bit skewed. 2 Stars.
