*** I ONLY CAME HERE FOR THE FOOD. DID NOT STAY HERE! ***\n\nTHAT being said, this review is for the steak and eggs special....\n\nOH. My. God. SO. delicious. @_____@@@ Steak was SUPPER good, eggs were phenomenal, but what you really need to get is the whipped potato and gravy on the side....\n\nI died.\n\nI might have been drunk, but gdi that was the BEST steak and BEST mashed potato I've ever eaten. Really nice waitress as well. It's hard to be chipper at 5AM :P
