I've always thought this place was going to be average like a P.F. Changs or Yan Can Cook. What a surprise that it wasn't! My girls and I were starving after Hakkasan. Luckily enough we made some friends who fed us :) this place is open practically all day long so it was perfect to dine here right after we partied the night away.\n\nThe menu had really good options. I would've expected the prices to be much more extreme but it wasn't! My gf and I shared the Pork Belly BLT. Honestly best BLT of my life. Forget the bacon because pork belly is a much better substitute. And the pork belly was a pretty thick slice in my sandwich! I love pork belly and get so annoyed when the slice is so thin where I can't even taste anything. So for the price point and the amount of meat I got... YES to this place! \n\nThe fries were addicting too! My other gf got the burger and the meat patty was super juicy! I liked how I could really taste the sharp cheese melted all over the burger. Yum! I'd come here again !
