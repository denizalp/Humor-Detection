Happy Hour plus a free concert, think the AZ State Fair.  If you go on Fridays before 6PM, they offer $1 food item(s) per a booth, $1 per game, and $1 ride.  Not a bad deal!   They have $5.00 parking if you park at 18th Ave and Encanto at the golf course parking lot.  Admission was 1\/2 off.  The best $1.00 deal was the Indian fried bread with powder sugar for me.  If you do go on a Friday, I suggest start from the food row near the McDowell Rd. & 19th Ave entrance.  They have better discounted food items and cheaper drinks.  To finish off with the night, I got to watch Colbie Caillat for free with great seats.  I might need go back to try their fried butter.  Anyone tried that yet?
