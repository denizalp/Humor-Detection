I've had my eye on this place ever since I saw the sign put up ages ago. I've been hunting, searching.... trying to find any piece of information I could. And then about a month ago an opening date was given. It was also then I discovered that it was being opened by the owners of Not Too Shabby on Cave Creek Rd. \n\nI was a bit worried at first that it was going to be a beautiful store, but nothing that fit my mid-century modern feel. That still didn't keep me from being breathtaken today when I swung in to see if I could find a lil something for myself.. and walked out with a few items.\n\nThe vibe is like a yard sale and really makes you feel at home. The employees have some pretty swanky aprons I want to steal for my kitchen and are super helpful. Even when you don't think to open a book to check for the price. And even when they said they'd been eyeing one of the items you purchased, wanting to get it in a week or so.\n\nThere are tons of items from the 30s-60s mainly, from farmer to modern. There's some new items too, with that old feel, such as jewelry. But mainly, this is stuff I've had a hard time finding on 7th Ave, and at a better price. \n\nYou can tell a lot of attention was made to purchases and decor and that everyone there cares.\n\nI didn't expect to purchase Mr. Boston's De Luxe Official Bartender's Guide.. or the steel mik crate and bottles... but I'm sure I'll find a place for them. They are lovely.
