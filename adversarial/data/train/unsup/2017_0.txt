A-OK In my book. Some friends invited us out for Mexican food in Tempe and this is the place they picked. Not crazy busy on a Saturday night at all, which was nice not having to wait. Our food was good, came out in a reasonable time, service was good.... everything was just good. Nothing bad nothing amazing. If you are in the area and in the mood for some Mexican food, give them a try!
