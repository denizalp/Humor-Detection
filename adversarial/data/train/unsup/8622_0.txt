Perhaps car repairs, like life, tends to go in cycles.   Sometimes you're up and sometimes you're down and one just needs to expect and get on with it. So I have a painful and grudgingly accepting relationship with our  older vehicles which have been in the downcycle of repairs for the last six months or so.  \n\nFinding a shop that is reliable and trustworthy is hard.  We have purchased most all of our vehicles through Zimbrick and have used their service often over the years. But for other than the vehicle I primarily drive, we have been gravitating towards Odana Tire which is just off of Odana on Yellowstone Drive. \n\nScheduling with them is fairly easy and they are always friendly and professional. \n\nThey have always repaired our vehicles on time and at the cost promised.  We have bought tires, had oil changes, tire rotations, exhaust work, alternator, belts, and head gasket work done.  All have been well done and the costs seemingly fair.\n\nThey do not have loaner cars but I believe will provide some shuttle service.  While their customer amenities like a loaner, shuttle service or better coffee in the waiting room(!), may not be on par with the large dealerships, the professionalism, trust and relationship I feel we now have with the guys there easily overcomes all of that.  That is the primary reason  five stars is necessary and is one of the ways we say thanks to them.\n\n I am very much looking forward to getting out of the current mechanical downcycle and not being there again.  But until the tide turns, Odana Tire makes the repair pill\/bill a little easier to swallow.
