Worst Papa Johns experience I've ever had. A man who looked like he was the manager made a sexist joke when I asked to split my purchase on separate cards. Him along with several other employees laughed in my face when I asked for extra sauce. It's no wonder the business was going downhill with service like this. I've never been treated this way at any type of customer service establishment.
