My wife and baby daughter came here right at 5pm when they opened. The place was practically empty. They asked if we had reservations, and we said no. The host said that she was going to have large parties coming in later on that evening. She looked in her system and said, \"sorry, we have a few parties coming in about 30-45 minutes.\"  \"Would you like to eat in our regular dining area instead?\" I could not believe what I was hearing. We would be done eating by the time those people came. I'm sure the real reason for them not wanting to sit at the hibachi grill area, was because they didn't want to waste the cooks time with just 2 people and a baby. Thanks for ruining my wife's first Early Mother's Day Dinner!
