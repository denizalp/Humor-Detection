Who would have thought ax throwing could be so fun?? I seriously had my doubts when a member of our group chose the activity but decided to give it a try. \n\nIt takes a lot more skill and thought than you think to make the ax stick in the board. The friendly staff provide a very thorough explanation of safety and technique before the session and were around to help if needed. In my last lifetime, I was some kind of lumberwoman or ax throwing ninja because I caught on pretty fast. Our group had a great time and were sad to see our hour end so quickly.\n\nIf this were in Los Angeles, I would love to come back.
