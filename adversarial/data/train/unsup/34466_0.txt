We have been going to Sweet Gallery since they opened many decades ago. They did our wedding cakes. Their cakes are always delicious and real. My favourites are the cheesecake and the Dobos. Once you have had their cheesecake it is difficult to eat others...it is THAT good. What makes them so special? Many things...the recipes, the ingredients, the \"art\"...too many to mention. This is how cake should be, and they have seriously spoiled me for all other bakeries.
