This place is packed.  Valet parking only.  Place is nicely decor, nice atmosphere, it is happening at the bar, and the servers are supper nice.  Maybe it is because I am back from Maui.  The food just did not wow me.  I got the Pan Fried White Fish with rice and lemon caper beurre blanc.  It is just ok.
