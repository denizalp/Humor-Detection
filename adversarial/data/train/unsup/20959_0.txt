This place is ok if you're just going for a basic cut and color, but you'll pay a lot less for a similar result at Super Cuts.  I went in today for a cut and all over color.  I'm a red head and when I walked out of the salon it looks like I got it colored 2 months ago instead of 20 minutes ago.  The cut is also mediocre at best.  This is the second time I've been here with similar results on the color, although last time the cut was excellent which is why 2 stars instead of 1.  Unfortunately the girl who did my cut last time is no longer there.  I won't be back, not even to let them try to fix it.
