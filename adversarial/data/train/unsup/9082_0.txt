I can't say enough good stuff about Tokyo Discount.  I can't believe I've never reviewed it before...  Anyway, it's right in front of Sushi Mon, my favorite sushi place, and is part of the Japanese one-two punch on Silverado and Maryland.\n\nIt's a small shop carrying Japanese items of many different types.  I'd break it down into three main types:  \n\n1)  Anime, Manga, and Novelty items:  This is where all the Japanese fan boys go to find soundtracks, DVDs, figurines, Keyblade and Gunblade models, Cosplay parts, and Hello Kitty erasers.  Having some of that in me, I enjoy this part a lot. \n\n2)  Japanese Home Items:  This includes lots of plates, bathroom items, sake bottles, tea cups, hair dye, shampoo, shoe horns, strainers, lamps, home decor, and other such things.  I mainly use some of the tea accessories, and have recently bought dishes and bowls.\n\n3)  Food!:  This is mainly Japanese packed food.  This includes things like Pocky, packaged candy, biscuits, cookies, Melon soda, Mochi Ice Cream, packaged teas, pastries, and the like.  This is what I get here *every* time I come.  It's all so delicious!\n\nAnother thing you have to know about Tokyo Discount is that they really are discount.  Everything is cheap!  Get t-shirts for $5, and sodas for $1, whole china sets for under $20, facial products cheaper than Wal-mart, and you simply can't beat the prices on import CDs and DVDs (most, but not all).  Staff is friendly and helpful, as well.  Go see May, she's the best!
