Didn't realize how terrible this place was until I went somewhere else. Reason I went somewhere else is because they told me that I couldn't do my wellness check and std screening together- when I always have in the past. They wanted me to schedule two separate visits where I would have to pay two separate co pays.... I went to a new doctor and not only did she do it all in one visit she also gave me my birth control on the spot with no charge and without going to the pharmacy, and I also found out that the Estrella clinic had given me false information. This place treats you like a cattle not a person. I would never recommend this place
