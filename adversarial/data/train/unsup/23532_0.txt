Horrible!!!!! I can't believe that this HUGE international airport doesn't have a better traveling system. We arrived late from Chicago due to American's plane mechanical issues. So we had to get from gate A to E in about 5mins. WE DIDNT MAKE IT. The employees didnt care. All they could advise is to go see American customer service. This has gotta be the dumbest shit ever that this airport doesn't have trains or trams to expedite you getting from gate to gate. I will definitely try to avoid going thru this airport for connecting flights.
