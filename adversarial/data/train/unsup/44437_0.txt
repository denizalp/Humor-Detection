This place is garbage.\n\nI was out of town visiting the area and stopped in as I had run out of vape juice. I purchased a juice which I am already familiar with and buy on a regular basis that is a popular brand name.\n\nTHE SEAL ON BOTH THE BOTTLE OF THE E-JUICE AND BOX WERE MISSING!!!!!!\n\nWhen I went to use the juice, the juice came out much quicker than normal. The juice seemed watered down \/ diluted which is the last thing you want to see when putting something like this in your body.\n\nJuice was also overpriced, even-more overpriced when you consider they may have sold diluted juice ;)\n\nI had already traveled too far away when I noticed and was on a busy schedule.\n\nStraight to the trash this shop and their juices go. \n\nStay away from this shop at all costs!!!!
