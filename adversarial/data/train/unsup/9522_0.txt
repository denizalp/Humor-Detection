Man this place is...soooo...GOOOD. Huehuehue do you get it?!\n\nIn all seriousness this arcade is super unique! Upon first glance they may seem to lack games. But trust me. Quality over quantity holds true here. Be sure to try the 3 player contest game! You'll kill so much time with it! ANDDD if you get to the highest level they'll give everyone a free game! :) \n\nOther games I recommend: MaiMai (hand ddr ish) and Project Diva (beat based game, also hand ddrish style)\n\nDon't be intimidated if you don't understand the games! The employees are super friendly and patient. They always give a good run through if you don't understand the game :)
