awful dentist.  this dentist scheduled a cleaning for which i did not need.  they asked for my \"co-pay\" then charged me over $100.00 when i asked what this was for they said it was for the peri dontal treatment ..in which they never discussed with me?? then lied about saying they told me what it was and also said that she told me she was going to be charging me the $100.00 before she did and she didn't she lied.  i asked to talk with the manager and they have the receptionist call me.  i have never felt so betrayed by a business!!!!!!!!!i also the crown they put on fell off!!!  find another dentist to go to.. they are lieing cheating criminals!!!
