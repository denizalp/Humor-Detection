My family loves this place! We went here for the New Year's Eve skate for all ages, from 9 pm - 2 am and had a super time. It's not a cheap outing but not prohibitively expensive either. The drinks and food are extremely reasonable. The staff are very helpful and knowledgeable! We will definitely go back again.
