I was actually skeptical because ALL of their reviews are good. I contacted several offices before I chose them. They got me in the next day. Breann cleaned my teeth, she explained everything and reassured me. She also was great at cleaning, I didn't feel stabbed or like I was drowning. The doctor was very personable and kind, no up selling. Just honesty. Very pleased and I will return.
