When I come to Little Caesar's Pizza it's not to get the best tasting pizza out there, it's to feed the family quick, fast and cheap. This visit was a tad below average: a homeless man was opening the door and asking for tips, the wait was long as there was only 1 register working of the 4, we had to wait while the manager made change for a new cashier, though we were all paying with cards, they stated if I wanted crazy bread it would be 30-40 minute wait, but pizza was hot and fresh. \n\nI changed my order to just a pizza and was out the door in 15 minutes (line waiting and cashier change time). The pizza was average and filling, a little soggy in the middle but the crust was crispy. We did eat the whole pizza.\n\nAs other reviews said, there were only teenagers here and lacked management to make the shop run efficiently. I witnessed a worker walk outside and sit on the curb and smoke whilst I was waiting in line. Prior to ordering, this employee came back in and got a drink from the water tank and went straight to working without washing their hands...SMH. \n\nI'm not sure I will be back for another pizza at this location as it seems to be descending lower and lower. I hope that management takes this review into consideration and turns this business around.
