We moved to this side of town on Saturday, and we passed by Little Hong Kong on  every trip over to the apartment.  \n\nOn Saturday afternoon, after moving all day long, we decided that we didn't want to cook, so we ordered Chinese for delivery!\n\nFirst and foremost:  the lady on the phone was SUPER nice.  She was polite, repeated my order back, and gave me more info on some of the dishes I was unsure about.   They offer a military discount (being so close to the base), which was nice, since my fella is a veteran.  \n\nThe food arrived very promptly.  We were told about an hour, and it was just a bit under that time frame.  \n\nThe delivery man was also very nice, very polite.  \n\nAs far as the food goes, it was ok!!  Its really difficult to find REALLY good Chinese food in town. We ordered:\nEgg Rolls:  Not really egg rolls.  The were spring rolls.  While they were tasty, the inside was a bit mushy, which is something we've seen pretty commonly out here. \nImperial Egg Rolls:  GREASY.  But really delicious!  These are enormous egg rolls with chicken, pork, and shrimp inside.  The meat was cooked and seasoned well, but there were no veggies, and they dripped grease.  Still damned tasty!\nCrab Rangoon:  REALLY good.   Really really.  Plenty of filling, and the wonton part was nice and crispy. \n\nMongolian beef:  The website said \"hot\" and they weren't kidding, which was a little off putting with Mongolian beef.  The beef itself was tender, and delicious, but this was too spicy for me.  Fella commented that the sauce was a little runny, and there were way too many onions.  \n\nAlmond chicken:  One word:  YUM.  This was spot on.  Tender delicious chicken.  Baby corns, green celery, flavorful sauce...this was excellent.  We'd order from here again JUST for this.  \n\nAll in all, as first experiences go, this was a good one!  I can't wait to try out more items from the menu.  \n\nThanks a lot Little Hong Kong!
