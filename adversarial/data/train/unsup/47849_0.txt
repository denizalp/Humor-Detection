Came on a trip with some friends for my friends 21st, which obviously meant go to the strip and take a pole dancing class! This place was more than I could have asked for. It's located I rose deja vu boutique, which is a sex\/lingerie store. Perfect to get the vibe going if you ask me. \n\nCrash was super cute, bubbly and extremely talented as well as gorgeous! She made us all feel comfortable and welcomed. I loved the way the studio was laid out. Very private and small.\n\nWe were all worried (yet excited) that we wouldn't be able to do anything cool since we are all such beginners, but She really created a great routine that was easy enough to pick up at such a beginner level, yet not too easy it was boring. \n\nWe did a little warmup which was actually kind of difficult and then we eased into a choreographed routine which I loved! The song choice was on point and the routine itself was simple yet sophisticated and sexy! I have a pole I wanna set up at home somehow and I am so excited to have a routine to work! We all had a great time and I will definitely go back the next time I'm out in Vegas!
