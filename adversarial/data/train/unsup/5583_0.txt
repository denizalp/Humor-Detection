A perfect brunch! This is why...\n\nUpon walking into the restaurant, we were greeted by a wonderful smell of a wood fired grill. Already it felt comforting and lovely. Not to mention the kind & polite gentleman who greeted us. \nLooking around(I'm an observer) I noticed how nice and different architecturally this restaurant is. Modern, but still with a cozy, and rustic to it. Not fancy, simply rustic. \n\nWe had a lovely table of two looking towards the open kitchen seeing the hard working staff. Because the kitchen was quite close to our table, we had an extra hit of a fireplace smell. Lovely! \n\nWe ordered(to share!) a monkey bread(Or pull apart bread) that was served alongside of a lemon sweet cream. For those that are not familiar with monkey bread, it's little sweet rounds of dough rolled in cinnamon & sugar baked together. Since it's sticky, you pull it apart with your hands. Yes it's messy.. but worth every lick of your fingers. Delicious!\n\nI ordered a hot chocolate(prepared to perfection!!) Could be a tad warmer, but it was still quite delicious. \nNow to eat.. I ordered a Croque Madame served with a perfectly cooked fried egg on top of two delicious crusty perfectly toasted(On their wood grill!) sandwich of BÃ©chamel sauce and a lovely Coppa ham. Outstanding! Along side was a coleslaw(It was OK!) and a tender oh so fresh spinach salad. Delicious! \n\nWe also ordered a dish which had two perfectly poached eggs, a lovely and delicate Hollandaise sauce on top of two slices of perfectly toasted country bread. Superb!\n\nOverall our experience at Hoogan & Beaufort was perfect. Two little things that I would hope they change soon, the server was a bit slow yet very kind and polite. \nDo keep in mind the restaurant is situated a bit out of the way and somewhat in a remote area. Don't let that turn you off. whether you go by car, foot, or any other way. It's well worth the mileage. I promise you! \nI certainly will be returning!
