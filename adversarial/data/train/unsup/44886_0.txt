I walked in to buy a 22k vehicle with a loan liner & cashiers check in my hand. The online sales clown says they don't take out of state checks.\n\nThe reality, they SELL Wells Fargo loans at 2.89% instead of the 1.49% I walked in the door with. I wonder why I bought the second one less than 6 months later at #1 Cochran's dealership.\n\nWhy did I wait 6 months to complain? Because your dealership performed a hard inquiry on my Credit Report before your bank did & after you let me contact my own. That makes 3 hard inquiries for the same car. With a score of over 800 it doesn't matter, but you never asked & it really wasn't your business even.
