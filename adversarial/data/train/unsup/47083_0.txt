I have been to this Jasons Deli several times, it has always been good.  We have ordered delivery from here several times, it has always been very delicious.  I ordered delivery from here today, and it was very forgetable.  The butter croissant that held my turkey sandwich together was really dried out, it was actually breaking as I ate it, it was that dry.  I have said before that they have the best brownies I have ever had....... Just not today. The brownies were overcooked,  one of them actually tasted burned.... they were very dry, not moist and fudgy the way they have been, when I have had them before.  Everything was disappointing about this meal...... it might be awhile before I order from here again.
