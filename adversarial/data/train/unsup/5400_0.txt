It's been a while since I've been to an IHOP so I was very surprised to how modern this location is in terms of atmosphere and menus! Kudos to them in that aspect. \n\nWith everything else...... shouldn't expect that much but if it takes us three tries and two different servers to be able to ask for anything like a bottle ketchup or hot sauce, we'll probably be done with our meal by the time we get any of our other requests. In addition, our server seemed to really hate us by the way she talked to us or she wasn't having the best of days. But either way, we apologize if we caused her any inconvenience!\n\nIn terms of food, everything was pretty subpar. Eggs were a little salty and hash browns could be crispier but the pancakes were not bad! But it'll take a lot of convincing for me to come back.
