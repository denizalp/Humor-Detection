I was on Queen St W looking for a salon to get a pedi. But everywhere I went, they were full and I found this place on Yelp which was on my way home. They had good reviews so I called up and they had a spot for me. \n\nAs soon as I came in, I saw a couple of people getting their nails done and a girl lying\/sitting on one of the pedi massage chairs on her phone. She had a mask on so I knew she had to work here. I secretly hoped that I wouldn't get her but knew I had a high chance of getting her as my aesthetician. \n\nSo I sat in the massage chair as she sat in front of me with a big sigh. Her movements, behavior, gave me a sense that she did not want to work. At all. I told her I have ingrown problems so asked if she can take care of it. She nodded. With a sigh. As she worked on my toes, she was rushing through everything, and she didn't do anything about my ingrowns so i ask again and with so much attitude she said she cut it. She didn't. She called another lady over and asked her to deal with it and this lady wasn't any better. She kept asking what I wanted. After this happened, my aesthetician started to handle my toes more roughly and even hurt me. She didn't apologize. It hurt and felt so mistreated that I almost cried. \n\nMoving on to removing deadskins off my heels, this girl was so rough my heel was sore. I was like my heel hurts, and this same other lady says so do you want it more smooth then?\n\nThere were more episodes but this review is already too long so I'm stopping here. \n\nI give two stars because another guy ended up painting my toes and he was way way nicer and patient. Although he was really really slow. Other people other than this girl seemed nice. \n\nWon't be coming back to this place.
