Wow Wow Wow I haven't tasted dumplings this good since I lved in Taipei after college.  After sitting down I asked if they have ever had a reataurant before?  It is a family ran business and they are originally from Taiwan.  Apparently they owned a similar type restaurant in Seattle for over a decade before heading south for some Vegas sun.  Mom and Dad were cooking in the back and making everything from scratch.  My favorite type of place.  I got excited.  The smell of the food on my table brought back memories of street vendors hawking dumplings all over Taipei.  After my first bite of fried dumpling my  taste buds thought they entered an excellent Asian massage parlor.  Yum.  Hands down the best dumplings I have ever had in Vegas.  You will love the euphoric garlic sauce especially mixed with some soy sauce.  Beware...you will still be tasting it hours after you eat there.  Dumplings we're juicy and cooked to perfection..not overdone like most places. They were huge and hot.  The Fried dumplings were my favorite but the steamed dumplings are also awesome.  I was impressed with the outgoing personality of  the young man working the front end and he took excellent care of us.  When I left I was completely satisfied and I felt like my taste buds got a super Shiatsu massage complete with happy ending. Highly recommended
