While they didn't have it out today, I am such a sucker for their Highland Grog coffee.\n\nAnd, although this is not a very timely review, there is nothing better than the Bean's and Cream crepe stand at the Sun Prairie Farmer's Market in the summer. I feel so fancy splitting a crepe and coffee after buying fresh local vegetables.
