Stopped in for a drink to check out what this lounge was about. We had great service, no make that exceptional service. The raspberry lime sorbet cocktail was awesome. Intended to have one but stayed for two. Now I must warn everyone, this place is very expensive. These drinks were $18 each. If you are looking for value this is not the place to party. If you want to stop by for a drink while on a first date to impress then you should give this place a shot.
