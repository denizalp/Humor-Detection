Got my lashes done less than 5 days ago and it already started falling out. I am disappointed. This was my second time coming here (first time was excellent) but sadly my lashes started falling off right away! I take care of my lashes very well so I didn't understand why it fell off so quickly. The direction of the lashes were all over the place and just wasn't happy with the result. It wasn't glued on right and my eyes burned too. Sorry Pop Lashes, you have disappointed me and I wouldn't come back.
