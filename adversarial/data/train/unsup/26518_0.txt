The food was amazing.  We were a party of three and we all absolutely loved the food.  The only reason i didnt give five stars is because the food took 30-35 minutes, and I noticed that was about the going wait for everyone.  The kitchen is very small (i know this, because you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom), so there is probably not a whole lot they can do about turnaround time.  Anyhoo, if you are patient and not on a time crunch during their busy times, its worth the wait.
