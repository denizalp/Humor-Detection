Got a cronut craving? If so, come to Coco's. I was directed here by Amanda M. and if she says it's good, then I know it will be. This new donut place is not too far from my house, so this past Saturday morning, I made the ten minute drive to check out the sugar. The parking lot was deserted when I got there, but the Open sign was on, so I didn't start crying immediately.  I walked into a pristine donut shop, with the cases so shiny, bright, and full of sugary goodness--I don't think I've ever been to a donut shop this clean.  And, lo and behold, one case FULL of cronuts, and no one else was around?  Jackpot!  There was only one cinnamon sugar cronut in the case, so I chose that, as well as a glazed one and one with white frosting, which upon closer inspection at home, had filling.  I'm not a fan of donuts with filling, but that's just me.  There were some pumpkin donuts that I'd like to go back and try, but I felt I needed to exert some self-control on this first visit. Of course, everything else looked amazing, too. I drove home with the smell of the cronuts filling the car and enjoyed that cinnamon sugar delight as soon as I got into the kitchen--delicious!  The b\/f started off \"just tasting\" the glazed one, but ended up killing it, too.  Blessing or curse that Coco Donuts is just down the road?  Only time will tell, but in the meantime, go check it out yourselves for some delicious donuts before word gets out and there's a line for their sugary gems.  There's always room for donuts.
