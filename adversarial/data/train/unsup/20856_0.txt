Work's been my life for what seems like forever and finding starbucks anywhere and everywhere around Toronto has worked into the daily grind.  Found a nice little starbucks that's brand new on Victoria Street.  And they got these nice new leather couches, my group and I ended up taking a breather on them for 5 minutes because they were pretty sweet.\n\nThey don't get a lot of business, so it's basically deserted.  Most visitors are working around St. Mikes or live in the area.  If you're at Eaton centre, you'll probably be going to the one on Yonge or the one inside Eaton Centre.  But if you're like me, this spot's a nice little getaway from all the craziness when a breather is needed.
