We really like West Elm, which is part of the Williams-Sonoma retailing empire.\n\nWest Elm is geared for a more upscale urban living and was originally focused on folks living in lofts.  So you see smaller furniture items and more knick knacks.  But don't be fooled into thinking this is just another inexpensive Pier One.  It's not.  Like I said, it's part of Williams-Sonoma and the quality is outstanding.\n\nWe would highly recommend you consider being added to their email list, if only because it comes with a 10% off coupon on your first purchase.  After that they will tip you off to upcoming sales.  Nice!
