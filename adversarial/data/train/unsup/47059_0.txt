After reading reviews for different nail salons, I decided to give this salon a try since missioning all the way to Pacific Mall was too much of a hassle for me. First off, the location is convenient for those living in the McCowan\/Hwy 7 area, it's located in the plaza right across Markville Mall and has multiple parking spaces available. The interior is clean and simple, which is essentially key for a nail parlor and a spa. \n\nFor my nails, I decided to go with a clear-coloured shellac manicure. I believe the girl who did my nails for me goes by the name of Jennifer. To be honest, she was nice but she was really quiet so I had a hard time understanding what she was trying to say half the time. When it came to doing my nails, she shaved my nails down way too much even though I wasn't even getting extensions and painted my nails way too thick for my liking. \n\nOverall I'm giving this place a 4\/5 stars because I wasn't completely impressed with my nails especially for my first time, and first impressions are everything. However, I'll be returning to this nail salon in the future because their service was acceptable and everyone was nice but I'll probably get my nails done with a different person the next time around.
