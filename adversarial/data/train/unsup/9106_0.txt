Silvertree Dental is a great dental office, thorough, efficient with modern equipment and technology.  Never a wait.  Everyone is very friendly, warm and knowledgable.  Dr Koerperick is thorough but very gentle.  The staff submits all insurance and tells you in advance what the costs will be or if you have hit you benefit max for the year.  I highly recommend Silvertree Dental.
