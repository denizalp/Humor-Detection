I'm addicted what can I say? Seriously, they should have just reserved a whole cow just for me.\n\nThe BLT burger had it goin' on til the break o' dawn, literally (they close hella late)! Succulent, juicy burgers cooked to perfection with several condiments. Not a huge fan of their sweet potato fries but the waffle fries saved the day.\n\nI'm lovin' the vibe here. The staff is excellent, people look like they actually enjoy working here. You can see the people actually cooking the food behind the bar and they even look like happy employees. Our bartender\/mixologist\/waiter named Dan was hella cool! He gave us a few samples of beer on tap before we locked down a drink. He also, ensured our meal and drinks were on point.\n\nA few pointers: pricey but worth it, fun atmosphere, no convenient bathroom (so don't hold it), sit at the bar, and order waffle fries!\n\nSo, random tidbit, they all wear these shirts that have statements on the back. Definitely good conversation starters. One for example was \"tip waiters not cows.\" I was pretty embarrassed to ask what the hell that meant only to discover there is a thing (mean) ppl do called cow tipping, wtf? Look it up if you are ignorant like me. Also, another one is \"always use a condiment\" (ha ha). I hope I'm not stealing their thunder but these shirts were so clever and left an impression of the atmosphere. It's the little things, I swear.
