This is the best walk-in clinic in the area. The office is extremely busy so if you're impatient I suggest coming in first thing in the morning. Dr. Shane Long rocks and I wish he was my regular doctor. His mild manners will put you at ease, he's easy to communicate with, and most of all he's a very knowledgeable GP. What a stand up guy!
