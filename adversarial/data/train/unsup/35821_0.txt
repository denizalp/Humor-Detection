I live in Michigan and every time I visit Toronto, I make sure to stop by here. The food tastes like authentic Iranian food, something that is not easy to find in North America. Such food quality is a win even in Iran. Stews, Kababs, and lamb shank are great. The place is neat and classy. Staff may at times be slow, but when you ask for their help they will be available.
