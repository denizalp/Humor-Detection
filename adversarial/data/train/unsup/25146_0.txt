I suddenly had a Cabo flashback! Never tried them before this location opened. Amazing food. The place is set up in a cafeteria station style with seating outside and inside with two floors. They have Happy Hour everyday from 6-8pm and a Mariachi Band every Monday 6-7pm. A lot of the staff doesn't speak English well, so that could be a problem for some but what a good way to practice your Spanish! The service was a little slow and disorganized at the counter but the staff was friendly and the bartender Christopher was great and made a great margarita. Definitely worth the visit.
