Birdsong was the final destination on an afternoon of Charlotte brewery explorations.  We were over at NoDa and were on our way to our car and saw the sign for Birdsong and my husband and I agreed, why not give this place a shot too while we are already here.\n\nWhen we got to Birdsong there was a band playing out on the deck, they have a nice sized covered deck.  We proceeded to go inside and inside is a nice little tap room.  We sat up to the bar and had a jalapeño pale ale, my expectation with something called a jalapeño pale ale is that it is going to be a bit spicy... wrong.  It was really good and you know the smell of peppers whenever you first cut them?  I got that smell and taste, which was surprisingly good in a beer.  I recommend trying it!
