Brace yourself Yelpers, here comes a novel:\n\nHere is my situation: I live in a townhome and found out that my next door neighbors have a bed bug infestation (eeeek!). We share a wall, so I am terrified. I have searched my entire home and can't find any evidence of bed bugs, so I want a preventative service, just in case!\n\nOn paper, APS was exactly what I wanted:\n- Positive reviews on Yelp\n- A- review from the BBB (I even read the reviews on the BBB website and took the complaints with a grain of salt)\n- A Yelp voucher! $45 for $100, which worked for my budget.\n\nHOWEVER, it all went downhill with my FIRST call to APS:\n\nStrike 1: When my first call kicked over to voicemail, a generic greeting informed me that the mailbox was full and I was unable to leave a message. Without a personalized APS greeting on the voicemail, I wasn't even sure that I had called the right number. \n\nAn APS employee, named Arman, called me back. I explained my situation and warned Arman that I was\/am completely stressed and didn't even know what questions to ask... if these guys had told me that they treated bed bugs with the bone marrow of a baby t-rex and needed two weeks to do so, I may have believed them. Despite my Class A pest control idiocy, Arman still took the time to speak with me. He told me APS is locally operated, flexible with time, and close to my house.\n\nWe were disconnected once, but, in total, the conversation lasted for about twenty-five minutes (Arman did most of the talking). The conversation was pleasant enough so I told Arman I needed to speak with my boyfriend and he offered to call me back in a couple of hours. The boyfriend came home and we discussed the call, during which time I realized that I didn't know any of the following information:\n1. The ballpark price of an APS service.\n2. What the APS process is. \n3. Approximately how long the process will take.\n4. What the service will entail.\n\nStrike 2: Despite the twenty-five conversation, I didn't have any of the information that I actually NEEDED to know. \n\nArman didn't return my call, and I didn't return his. Cut to yesterday morning. I called APS back, hoping to clear up some of the fuzzy details. A man named David answered the phone. Since this wasn't Arman I said \"Hi David, my name is Rachel, I'm calling about bed bugs.\"\n\nDavid said \"Yeah, I remember you, I spoke with you yesterday for like thirty minutes, how can I help you?\" At that moment, I was taken aback for two reasons. 1. I am certain I didn't speak with a  David. 2. David immediately sounded annoyed when he greeted me. When I explained to David that I needed more information from him, he made no attempt to disguise his annoyance. He even gave me the impression that my call was an inconvenience.  \n\nWhen I dare to re-ask about price, David barked, at warp speed, that APS can't do an evaluation over the phone, that other companies would charge me $2500 for a fumigation and that APS would charge less than that, and then said \"how's that?\". I said \"Well, since I don't need a fumigation, are you saying that a spray for my place is going to cost me around $1000?\"  His response: \"Why won't you just let us come over and do an evaluation?! Why won't you just let us come over?\"\n\nEvaluation? Whatever did he mean?! This is news to me!. I attempted to explain, but he cut me off yet again. Finally, I curtly say \"Sir, no offense intended, but if you would let me finish my thought, perhaps you would understand my situation better...\". To which he says \"No, no, I have been listening...\"  which was laughable, if nothing else.\n\nStrike 3: LISTEN. Don't assume that you know your customer's problem and then talk over them.\n\nBefore I could respond, I heard a click, and I was suddenly talking to someone named Arman (but still not the original). Arman 2.0 said that \"David needed to step out\". That's right Yelpers, in the middle of our phone call.\n\nStrike 4: Unless you have just cut off a limb, are going to crap your pants, or the building is on fire, you don't to \"step out\" with no explanation.\n\nArman 2.0 gives me more snarky attitude until I forcefully RE-EXPLAINED my situation, which resulted in a useless attempt to salvage the call.\n\nI am completely stunned that these two people are allowed to handle calls from potential or existing clients. I am even more STUNNED about the rating they've earned here on Yelp. Over 4 stars! Who are the APS people that Yelp reviewers dealt with and where can I find them? \n\nInstead, I spoke with two of the most unhelpful and condescending people I have ever experienced in \"customer service\" industry. Thanks for showing your true colors before I gave you any money, APS! What a huge relief.
