I was here with friends last night as one of the many stops on our Halloween Bar Crawl on Saturday, October 30. I was instantly drawn to the DJ booth which is decorated like a huge Firetruck. There was this freaky, scary looking baby doll on the window. I had to have pictures with that thing.\n\nThe LONG line to get carded and enter was a turn off. We had to get through that line to leave, too. How about separate entrance and exit doors, people? Can you say fire hazard?!\n\nThe inside (and outside patio), is much bigger and roomier than when it was Mickey's Hangover. Great job remodeling! Having more than one bathroom stall is ingenious. (duh)\n\nI tried to borrow (permanently) that scary baby thing, but was stopped outside the patio by one of the employees. waaaaaaa. Now I have to search the Internet for one and actually buy it. Life goes on...\n\nWe will definitely be back, so look out Firehouse!
