My review has dropped slightly since my last visit.  Since then, I've been 2 subsequent times and honestly, the girls working can be a LITTLE bit nicer.  It's irritating when I order coffee, get attitude like someone's doing me a favour, and hafta hear girls gossip while I'm waiting for my latt√©.\n\nI really don't get the reason for an attitude.  You're working in a really busy bakery, perhaps you don't like it, but that's not my problem.  Get over yourselves!\n\nThe 2 times that I've been to order coffee, the girls who took my order were not pleasant whatsoever.  They just treat customers like they're invisible.\n\nSince the cash at the coffee bar wasn't working, I was directed to go to the main registers.  I stood waiting in line, right in front of an older female cashier.  After she finishes serving someone in front of me, she just turns, leaves her register, and didn't even bother noticing that I was waiting to be served.\n\nI'd say you roll the dice when you get served.  It's 50\/50, half friendly workers\/half people who are just burnt out and seem to take out their frustrations on the customers.\n\nTip:  I believe the baked goods\/bread on the racks are fresher than what's in the glass showcases.  Had tiramisu today and it was sickeningly sweet.  Felt like all I was eating was layers of whip cream in between 1 layer of lady fingers.
