Wow, after reading good reviews and looking at the menus on line, what a bummer here.  All the interesting looking preps but food was bland, dull, typical of Valley.  For instance the beet salad with blue cheese.  How do you ruin that?  Boiling the beets into mush balls and putting a rock hard block of cheese next to it.  Some greens, no dressing but some sort of gelatinous goo on the side.  Fish with harissa?  There was a small dot of something hot on the side of the plate.  I had to put on my bifocals to see it.  Fish was taste-less.  Ditto for hsb duck dish. Not cheap either, $140 for dinner with 2 glasses of wine.  How this place is in business for 25 years would amaze me like an alien invasion if i didn't already have experience with this valley's dumbed down food.  \n\nNice to sit outdooors but thanks I'll sit on my balcony and order something from Sal's or Marco's or someplace that puts some flavor in.
