Have gon to another country I seriously thought today I was in a third world country corruption. I went to do laundry at this laundry place and to my  luck I used the three large washers as I was using them this is lady name is \"Adriana\"because I even got the name that's how corrupt and monopolized this laundry is ! She hounding me for them as I was putting my clothes in them when the washer is finished this guy that was with the lady \"Adriana\" ( the lord of the carters lover)was  hounding me for the washer stating they had loads of laundry to do at that moment I felt bullied and went to a attendance at the counter she simply  knowledge  me and nothing more the next thing I know as I'm putting my clothes in the dryer the managers Ramon ( the corrupt cop)  approaches me and ask that I empty my washer I acknowledge him and told him I would as soon as I was done with my first washer putting my clothes in the dryer,  as I finished with my second washer that's putting the clothes in the dryer I look back at my third washer and the staff at the laundry place are  empty my washer as I approached them and ask them why they simply said they asked everybody in the laundry if it was theirs which was a lie I never left the building I was in the dryer area and they never asked me if that was my washer therefore they were emptying out because \"Adriana\" ( the lord of the cartels lover) ask them to do it!  I only thought this would happen in third world countries like in Mexico as I witness the owner taking cash out $160 to be exact from a chase banks credit card God knows who's card and giving it to her! So never return here again!
