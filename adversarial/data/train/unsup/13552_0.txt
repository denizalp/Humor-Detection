Ok......its 110 degrees out, the snowbirds are gone so its safe to grab a meal in old town Gilbert. We stopped in to look around DB's place and \nordered a drink. Coors draft and a froo froo drink. We were quickly relieved of 17.00 for our mistake. Check out the displacement of the spherical ice cube in the froo froo drink! Come on Dierks.... Really? \nThe staff were friendly, the place was packed but sorry Dierks....we're out!!\nFooled me once!\nI think we'll leave the crazy expensive\nTourist traps to the tourists. See ya!
