I just have so much mixed feelings about this place.\n\nI woke up with a kink in my neck earlier this week and always wanted to try a non-hotel massage so, figured this would be the time.\n\nI had been reading many yelp reviews about this place and knew not to expect \"hotel\" fancy massages but, I still wasn't expecting this.\n\nI had an hour massage where I was poked, and stretched, and massaged where I wanted to laugh during half of it. \nIt reminded me of my yoga and pilates class that I wasn't expecting so, I couldn't breathe correctly....this in turn wasn't relaxing to me. \n\nMy masseuse was very nice and kept asking me if it hurt; which it didn't....but, I just wanted to laugh when he'd lift my hand up and drop it. Felt like I was a dead body that he was playing with. ***Is that a weird analogy?***\nHe did work on my kink for a while but, this just felt all too routine for him. Like he just goes through the motions.\n\n\nAnyways, my kink was still there. \nSo, that's my review on that!\nI want to really like this place but, I feel like this kind of place is strictly for relaxation purposes....and not  to get kinks out of your neck!
