As I drove around to find the perfect parking space I notice a sea of people walking towards the festival. I parked my car and waited to meet my girlfriend at the entrance. \n\nWe already had tickets so off we go. We had to purchase drink and food tickets for about $20.00 but I wanted more. I couldn't wait to stuff my face.  \n\nIt was hot but with a cool breeze. I was in heaven people watching.  \n\nYou definitely have to wear great walking shoes.  It's a MUST!!! \n\nThere were so many tents for you to use your tickets. I was running around eating everything in sight. \n\nI enjoyed myself. See ya next year!!
