This review is only for the seafood department in the store.\n\nI'm not an idiot, I realize that trying to buy fresh seafood in the Phoenix area is not one of the greatest ideas one could have, but I live in Boston and make my living as a fish monger\/fish cook.  So I know about fish, and my family was hoping that i would cook for them while I'm out here.\n\nThis place was a fail as soon as I walked to the counter.  The shell fish were all kept on plates above the ice and I noticed that several mussels and clams had already opened.\n\nNot only should shell fish be kept directly on ice, part way buried in the stuff is best, and if you loose a few in the process of the day you take them out of the case and dispose of the them.  Not leave them out for everyone to see that your not keeping your seafood cold and just letting it go south.  You may as well keep it out side in the trunk of your car.  Spoiled seafood is spoiled seafood.  I don't care if you do put it on a shiny platter and put a \"sale\" sticker on it.\n\nI ended up having to make do with some frozen flounder, I brought them home and thawed them out, only to find they were SATURATED with water, I actually had to hold them over the sink and gently squeeze water out of them.  In the years I've worked with all manner of fish, I've never actually had wring a fish dry like it was some sort of towel.   \n\nHonest to god, I twisted the ends until the fillets started to curl, then they started realizing an truly unusual amount of fluids.  It was disgusting.
