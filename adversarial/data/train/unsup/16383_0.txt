Some great, some average, overall would definitely recommend Buddy V if you're craving Italian.\n\nThe good: Our server was very sweet and funny and speaks five languages fluently, he definitely made our experience more memorable. the Lasagna and Sunday Gravy are freakin delicious. Lasagna has just the right meat\/cheese\/carb ratio (Read: a lot of cheese. Can you blame me though?), served hot, and melt in your mouth. Sunday Gravy is a luscious, generously-portioned plate of stewed meat and meat balls soaked in marinara sauce that will blow any carnivore's mind away. Buddy's favorite pizza is also tasty with well-seasoned sausage. For dessert, don't miss the warm Nutella cake. Just, don't, miss, it. For drinks, old fashioned was worth a try. \n\nThe meh: chicken parm was dry, chicken rigatoni was unmemorable. Tiramisu was good but was paled in the presence of the Nutella cake. Cheesecake was pretty average (Read: not sweet, worth ordering if you're going for cheesecake). My drink (sugar and spice) was too sweet for my liking.\n\nRecommend going family style and get multiple things to try. Portions are big so don't go crazy.
