To summarize with one word: STUNNING.\n\nIf I could rename the O show, I would call it the O So Random show.  Lots of water.  Fire.  Clowns.  Weddings.  Ships.  Spaceship.  Random.\n\nI'm sure there was a storyline of some sort behind the production, but I was too busy staring at the acrobatics to even follow the story.  But that's okay.  This show is all about intaking the stage and performers with your eyes.  So much is happening at once and while I want to concentrate on the center act, my eyes were drawing attention to the ensemble and other parts of the stage.\n\nLoved the fire poi and any of the diving acts.   Just amazing.\n\nAnd my mom really, really enjoyed it, which is rare since she's Asian, doesn't understand anything, and mostly just complains about how things don't make sense and suck, but she absolutely LOVED this.
