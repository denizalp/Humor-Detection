Dear Yelpers,\n\nI have many fond memories in the waffle houses around our dear valley. Why? because I went to college, and I wasn't always under the influence of strictly oxygen if you know what I mean.\n\nThe place is what it is. Hightened sensory perception makes it \"burn a little brighter\" perhaps , but its A FRIGGIN WAFFLE HOUSE!\n\nMost Sincerely,\nDr. Obvious.
