I wish I could do half stars. Arrogant Butcher is good, but not great. It's consistently good food with good drinks. It also has a good atmosphere. But that's it. Good, good, good. I would never pick Arrogant Butcher as a place I definitely want to go to. It's also a bit overpriced.\n\nI've only ever had salads. The Market Salad is quite tasty. Although, it seems to have spaghetti in it. Not the grain I was expecting. The Chinese Chicken Salad is just ok; it needs more spice. The pretzel balls are legit.\n\nThey provide speedy service, and I really appreciate that, especially at lunch time. They're also very accommodating of groups.\n\nI'm curious to try out their happy hour.
