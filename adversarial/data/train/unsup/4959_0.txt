Formerly Baton Rouge... and before that Planet Hollywood (who remembers that?) The Pint definitely is a much better fit for the neighbourhood (and the city) than either of it's predecessors. \n\nI was here AFTER a Jays game for bite to eat and a beer with my SO, we wanted to sit on the patio but it appeared to be full and the staff weren't exactly helpful with their \"seat yourself\" approach. Not wanting to wander the patio aimlessly we went inside to find seating. There was plenty to be found but the restaurant is a labyrinth inside so we were unsure where to seat ourselves to ensure a server knew we were there.\n\nAfter sitting down and connecting with a server we perused the menu and ordered drinks. They've got a fair selection of beer (as they should with a name like the Pint) with fair distribution between large and small breweries\/companies. I had the Lasershow from Leftfield brewery in Toronto - kinda hoppy but crushable with a good citrus finish.\n\nFood was where things kinda hit a wall. My SO is vegetarian and if you are Vegan or Vegetarian this is not the place for you, everything on the menu (and I mean everything) has bacon, beef, pork, or all three on each one. Not a problem for me I ordered the beef dip sandwich with fries but the only option was the veggie burger for her. She ordered and OOPS - they were out! She then had to resort to fish and chips.\n\nWe got our food after what seemed like FOR-EV-ER (literally the long side of 45 minutes) and it was terrible. Her fish was small, undercooked and soggy. My beef was overcooked, dry and required every ounce of au jus, horse radish sauce, and ketchup to make it palatable.\n\nWe would have returned it but after the food was dropped off we didn't see a server again for 20 minutes (and I went looking).\n\nConclusion. Good spot for a beer (not drinks... a beer) - eat elsewhere (anywhere else)\n\nEatcrest Out
