Brooklyn Bowl, you disgust me. Curious as to why you guys think it's okay for your male security crew to use their size and \"authority\" for harassing, bullying and intimidating your female patrons? I was singled out and harassed a total of four times by three different security guards for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. Even after attempting to leave due to the first two harassments and being begged by the manager to come back in and give the place a second chance (which we did), the harassment continued twice more. I have read more than a few similar reviews about your security crew. THIS IS NOT OK. ARE YOU LISTENING, management? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS??
