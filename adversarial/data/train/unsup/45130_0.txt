This place is heaven!! We got the blueberry latte, grape mojito drink, and the honey toast. The blueberry latte was to die for. The cream was so thick and delicious. The grape drink was so refreshing and would def get again. The honey toast was also so good!!!\n\nI love that the menu has pictures so you can see what you're getting prior and it also makes you want to try everything! The place is so clean and the lady in the front was super nice!! Such original desserts and drinks.
