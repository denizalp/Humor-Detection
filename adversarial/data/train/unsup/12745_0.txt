I could walk to this place from my house...but I have been cautious to try it because last year we tried to go eat here and we got major attitude just trying to stop and look at the menu.  The staff was pissed that they would actually have customers.   Imagine that!  \n\nYesterday we tried to go to the La Jolla Cafe which is right underneath The Painted Horse, but they were closed.  So we decided to give The Painted Horse one more shot.  \n\nTHE FOOD:  Eh....good but nothing to write home about. Way overpriced.  I have to say my little dinner salad was great and sadly the best part of the meal.\n\nHubby ordered the ribs. Meat was tender, but they skimp on the sauce, which was a little too bitter. I think they were going for Chipotle Raspberry sauce and it just didn't work.   Fries were good. \n\nI had some sort of chicken that was oddly in the shape of a ball. No joke.  I don't know about y'all, but I thought chicken was supposed to look like chicken, not a softball.  It was stuffed with cheese and spinach and then drizzled with a creamy sauce over a bed of whipped potatoes.  Overall, it was decent tasting.  I think the presentation was just too weird.  Ball chicken...that's what I will always remember. LOL\n\nWe didn't order dessert which now I'm thinking maybe my review would have been better if we had.  \n\nVERDICT:  Food is \"ok\" but way too overpriced for what you get.  Seems like prices are ridiculous just because the Four Seasons is right down the road.  Staff was \"attentive\" but not friendly.
