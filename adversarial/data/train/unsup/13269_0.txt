This has to be one of my favorite restaurant in north Scottsdale. I've been coming here for few years now and the food is consistently good and service impeccable. \nAs you walk in, the hostess seats you and if you're wearing dark clothing, she will swap out the white cloth napkins to a black one. \nI've tried almost everything on the menu over the years and never had a bad meal. Their jambalaya is amazing; comes with giant shrimps. Their salads are so delicious as well. It's amazing how juicy the chicken on their salad is. My favorite is the kale and spinach salad and ahi tuna salad.\nMy son always goes for their BBQ ribs or their burgers. Both juicy and delicious. The meat just falls off the bones. \nDid I mention dessert? Omg! Their bread pudding is to die for. It come out warm. It's a must when eating here. \nThe staff is amazing too. They never let your water go half empty without refilling. The dirty dishes get taken away immediately. \nOnly downside of eating here is that it gets crowded during peak hours and wait can be as long as over an hour. If you don't have reservation, the trick is to call before leaving the house. They will put your name on the wait list without being there. Enjoy!
