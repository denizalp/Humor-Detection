I found Mac Masters on a google search and figured I would try them out with an iPod Touch that had a shattered screen. I bought the replacement screen kit online for $25 (Amazon) and followed a youtube instructional video on replacing it. I didn't get the screen to come on but heard the iPod still working. So I called Mac Masters and ended up bringing it in for them to complete for me. After a $45 diagnostic charge and 14 hours later I get a call telling me that unfortunately, the cable for the volume and lock button was cut. I don't recall cutting any cables as I was extremely careful when handling the device as I followed the youtube instructions which told me exact ways to prevent the cutting of any cables. \n\nThey said they could fix it for $109 and there was NO negotiations (everything in life is negotiable--I'm in sales). This was after already paying $45 for the \"diagnostic check\".\n\nI then received a call an hour or so later from them now saying that the cable for the NEW SCREEN that I just bought was cut as well. I know for a fact that I did not cut any cables on the part that I brought as they were all attached when I brought it in.\n\nThey told me the charge for this addtional was normally $154 but they would do it for $54. So, now I'm at $45 + $109 + $54...$208!! This 4th Gen iPod is all over Craigslist for $100-$120---and that's for 16gb and larger...not that 8gb that I'm trying to have replaced.\n\nI said no to their offer of charging an additional $54 and it was ludicrous that I was look at $208 to fix something I had started and bought the parts for. When I was told initially over the phone that the total cost wouldn't be more than $139 if they had to replace the whole piece and I bought the parts from them!!\n\nThe response from the guy on the phone was what drove me to write this review...\"not to be rude, but we aren't the ones who told you to go do this repair on your own\".\n\nWhat an awful way to try and appease a customer. There's a reason you tech geeks are stuck fixing stuff all day and don't have anything better to do than rip people off.\n\nI am now thinking of these guys in a way I think of Firestone (the auto repair company) you go in expecting one thing and what seems to be a legit price and after the \"technician\" works on it and causes other issues, now (unless you are an expert in the field) you are told about a million other issues that end up costing you a ton of money.\n\nAVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE. THEY ARE A RIP OFF AND A SCAM. THIS ALL HAPPENED TODAY AND I HAVE ALREADY GONE AND BOUGHT A PERFECTLY GOOD CONDITION IPOD TOUCH 4TH GEN 16GB FOR $90 FROM CRAIGSLIST. WAY BETTER DEAL!
