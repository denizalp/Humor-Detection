Have not been here in probably 5 years.  So they re-did the interior.  I'm hoping they re-did the food and service.  NOOOOOPE.  We sit down and order drinks.  They come WITHOUT STRAWS.  I ask for straws.  SHE SAYS THEY DONT HAVE STRAWS BECAUSE OF THE ENVIRONMENT. Seriously a big chain like this can not find other ways to satisfy the minority of tree huggers?\nAnyways as I slurp my drink like a idiot barbarian we order our meals.  I decided to try the Italian wedding soup.  It tasted like the tears of joy from all the tree hugging mellenails that got their ways with the straws.  Full of sodium as if someone urinated in it.  By the way in honour of them having no straws i officially decided from now on to use 3 straws for every drink.  \nAnyways the food as usually comes late.  Sons pizza comes 15 minutes after our pastas.\nI paid an extra 2.99 for 2 tiny morsels of broccoli.\nThe food here is basically high school cafeteria quality with a hefty price.\nIt's time to pay our bill and I asked for a box for my sons pizza which he barely ate.  SHE SAYS THEY DONT HAVE ANY BOXES?????  THEY RAN OUT OF BOXES???  I know this is false because I just saw someone take a box out of the takeout section.  I got the waitress to admit that he manager is too cheap to give out pizza boxes for your leftover pizza.\nHOW DUM CAN YOU BE MANAGER. East side Mario's I must say you serve endless salads and ENDLESS DISAPPOINTMENT.\nVery unlikely I'll come back ever again.
