Without the neon cartoon bird decorating the front window, you'd never find this place while driving. I stepped in to be greeted with dim, red light, freezing A\/C, and Miike Snow blaring from the ceiling, and then I knew this would be a sweet spot. \n\nOkay, yes, it's a little hipster with the faux old-fashioned themes to their cocktails. They love their whiskeys, and it shows when everyone orders a Manhattan with garnished with a lone, giant ice cube. You could feel thrifty and order the \"Codger\" as well, with a shot of who-knows-what and a can of Old Style for $5. The beer selection features quality IPAs, such as Modus Hoperandi from Ska Brewing. \n\nThe bartenders have a bias toward bitter. I heart bitter, but I don't like whiskey. I saw a bit of tequila there too, but their selection doesn't appear too eclectic. \n\nIn the back is a narrow room with shuffleboard, foosball...and even ski-ball! Oh gosh, I love that, even though after a few my balls might derail and ricochet elsewhere. :-x\n\nOverall, this place is stylish, comfortable, and has a good selection. I especially like the huge, communal table in the center that looks like it would be perfect for beer pong. \n\nIf they don't let me play, it's still cool. I'm gonna bring some friends here.
