Really disappointing dinner. Two stars (instead of one) because the waiter was really attentive and quick with beverage refills and because it is a great atmosphere and we enjoyed the terrace (which was why we chose to come here for dinner).\n\nI had Chopped Chicken Salad where nothing was chopped - not the lettuce, not the chicken (breast piece), not the sliced avocado and sliced hard-boiled egg ( just matchstick carrot and a bit of chopped tomato on the side) and completely drowning in a watery blue cheese dressing that swamped everything. I ate about half until I was left with a soggy pile of lettuce (did I mention not chopped) and a literal puddle of watery dressing. The chicken (not chopped) was fine but didn't taste of the advertised lime cilantro marinade (probably because coated with the \"dressing\") and the avocado (not chopped) was good. We also had the meatloaf which arrived with a thick coat of congealed looking gravy so heavy-handed with black pepper it overpower everything else (except maybe salt). Apparently more is more - and not in a good way - on the dinner menu. \n\nI had an excellent brunch shortly after they opened and a very good burger and frites for lunch a couple months ago. Surprised the dinner was SO sub-par. My advice - stick to the brunch and sandwich menus and always avoid the watery blue cheese dressing.
