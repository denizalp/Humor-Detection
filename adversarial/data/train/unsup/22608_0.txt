This place is a bit hard to find in the dark if you've never been. I ended up at the library but it's down the street a bit, tucked off the main street. \n\nThis place definitely caters to the 'hipster' crowd with a heavy dose of pretentiousness but I've come to expect that from more popular local coffee places. The interior is very modern (though not well-maintained). We came in right before closing so it wasn't busy at all but they still had plenty of baked items in the case. The barista that made our coffees was very nice when my mother asked what ristretto meant (how they make all their coffee drinks, as advertised on the menu) but the other barista seemed very aloof and non-engaging. \n\nMy overpriced small mocha would have been a lot better if they didn't use dark chocolate but that's all they had. Is it more hip to use dark chocolate now? I'm a huge fan and frequenter of Dutch Bros. and if you can't compete flavour-wise with a drive-thru coffee place, it's probably time to re-evaluate.\n\nSeems like a good spot to hang out if you live in the area (and can find parking) but I would definitely not come back when there are better options in the same area.
