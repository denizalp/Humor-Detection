I would rather not even give this company ONE star, but I must give it something! :\/\n\nMe and my 2 other friends were picked up by a strange cab driver who went by the name of \"the Easter Bunny,\" who later told us his name was 'Brent'  .. if that is true or not I don't know but he MUST BE FIRED.  He was driving cab # 201 on the night of Dec 22nd.  Instead of taking us home, he took a major detour to a strip club in a very seedy area of town and said he was picking more people up.  We replied we didn't feel comfortable with that, all being small framed females in a scary side of town, he said too bad.  My friend told him she was quite religious and did not like the idea of being outside \"The Burlesque\" .. He seemingly was not a man of religion, possibly athetist (not that is matters anyhow), and critisized her religion and wanted her to 'explore the topic of religion' more in depth.  Of course she declined, things got heated.  We told him we just wanted to get out of the cab to which he relpied we NEEDED to get out because we were being rude & obnoxious to him.  \"How so?\"  \"You said you were religious but won't explore it further, GET OUT!\"   I literally thought this was all a joke. \n\nSo, he tore out of the parking lot like a mad man into traffic, whipped into a VERY seedy bar parking lot across the street and screamed to jump out.  2 of the 3 of us did while the other tried snapping a photo of him, WHILE he started to drive off MID getting out of the car almost killing us (and no, that is not being overly dramatic, this guy was NUTS! Badger Cab, is you are reading this PLEASE fire this man.  He put our safety on the line.  Something must be done and your hiring process must be more tight.  He is a gentleman that wears SPIKED bracelets up his arm (by saying that, another one of your cab drivers knew who he was) FIRE THIS MAN!!! Save your companys name by getting rid of bad employees.
