I was really impressed with Il Posto, especially after all of the mediocre reviews. My favorite Yelper, Christina P, put together a UYE here last night, and the event could not have been more perfect.\n\nThe bartender and staff were really friendly and made us feel very welcome. They have a fantastic patio with a fire pit in the middle which made for a perfect happy hour setting.\n\nWe happened to be there on the night they unveiled their specialty pizza line. I had the pleasure of trying both the margharita and the goat cheese & onion, both of which I thought were fantastic. They also serve bread with a cheesy pesto dipping sauce that was to die for.\n\nOur group ending up trying a lot of different pizza's and everyone seemed to really enjoy.\n\nI was pleased with their happy hour specials ($2 off specialty pizzas; $1 off appetizers, well drinks, house wines and draft beers) and especially pleased that they extended those specials for our group for the entire time we were there.\n\nThis is another time I wish we could give 1\/2 stars because I would give Il Posto a 4.5... and I will definitely be back to grab another glass of the Chateau Ste. Michelle Riesling and snack on one of those delish speciality pizza's on the patio!
