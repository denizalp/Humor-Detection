Delicious food and good sized servings, especially the Chicken Pad Thai-no peanuts. I have never dined in but I order a lot of take out from here since I live very close by. The serving to-go is perfect size for my boyfriend and I to share and get full from. It is always ready when they say it will be and the ladies at the cash register are always friendly. I would recommend to try this restaurant.
