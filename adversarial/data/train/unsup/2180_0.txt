We wanted to love this place. Great location they put some effort into the theme and decor. \n\nThere was another diner at 7pm on a Monday night. No bartender no drink menu. \n\nOur waitress was attentive. She brought us biscuits with honey butter. They looked beautiful and tasted like half a box of baking soda. \n\nWe ordered the fried tomatoes, po-boy sandwich and chicken fingers. My husband doesn't ever complain. The other review comparing it to long john silvers was GENEROUS. It was gross. The bread was a hot dog bun. \n\nThe chicken fingers were meh. The main problem is quality of ingredients and lack of creativity.
