Once when I was in Highschool, we used to come here at lunch and there was this ballin' old dude named Phil who was the bomb. Phil would sneak us extra fries and pickles and stuff. He was like a kindly old Grandpa who somehow still worked in the fast food industry but wasn't jaded by it. It was magnificent. In fact, one time we arrived and he was driving his car in to the parking lot. He was so excited to see us that he waved, didn't pay attention and mashed into the dumpster. Bummer, Phil. But what a gem.\n\nPhil is gone now. Last time I went here I wound up waiting over 10 minutes in their drivethru line for a poorly assembled burger that had definitely been sitting on the warming rack for the past millenia. Not good, but I was starving.\n\nAt least it was only $3. \n\nBring back Phil. He should be the only old thing behind your counter.
