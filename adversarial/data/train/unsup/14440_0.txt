Normally this place is generous and I enjoy supporting local family owned restaurants. We received a quarter chicken dinner buy one get one free at the Santa fest parade. \nWe went to use it and the chickens in both meal were so small - and when we asked that one not have rice and potatoes and add lettuce instead.  They refused.  We are so disappointed. It cost us $17 and they weren't even nice
