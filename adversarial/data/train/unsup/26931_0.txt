Fraud!  We rented a car for Spring Training week in Arizona.   At no point while at the check-in counter did the agent ask if we wanted coverage of any type or something they call, \"counter products.\"\n\nUpon check out, our $380.00 rental became $790.00.  \n\nAccording to the receipt we purchased $120.00 in \"counter products,\" which I assume is GPS and or Satellite Radio.  In addition, the receipt showed we bought every coverage available at the maximum rate, such as road side assistance, windshield damage, medical etc.  \n\nWe have never purchased these in the past from any agency but this is the first time we were never asked if we accepted or denied coverage. \n\nWhen we disputed the fraudulent charges by phone the agent stated, \"we are a professional company and would never do this, but we will submit a claim.\"\n\nThe claim came back rejected but we had information they were unaware of.  \n\nThe previous renter and Payless, left their agreement in the vehicle.  We called the previous renter and he too claimed he had fraudulent charges and they were removed when he called customer service.   \n\nBottom line, this company clearly seeks to take advantage of travelers by fraudulently adding charges in hopes a percentage of consumers will not pursue a refund.  Shameful!!\n\nWe are not finished with this ordeal and will pursue action to ensure Payless Car Rental does not take advantage of any consumer in the future.  \n\nBuyer beware!!!   Payless Car Rental is literally stealing from consumers and this will not go unnoticed.  They messed with the wrong people.
