I really want to love this place because it's so close to my house, but I've tried several times and always have a bad experience.  The atmosphere is dirty, loud and hot, and the service is slow and rude.  And, it's more expensive than most coffee shops.  It doesn't open early enough and their food selection is dismal.  Fresh croissants are delicious, however.  Sorry but I think you can do much much better in Madison.
