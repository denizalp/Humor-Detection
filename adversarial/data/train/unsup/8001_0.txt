Seriously! Their block schedules and misinform employees make your life a living hell. I am trying to take classes to transfer over to ASU and they make it near impossible to make it easy enough to move along with the classes. All the employees need to learn how to talk with each other, so they do not have the students bouncing back and forth in a endless loop. It makes it even more frustrating that I pay out of pocket for my classes and they are going to try to drop you from a class if when you're paying out of pocket, like who does that? If it wasn't for my work schedule I would go somewhere else
