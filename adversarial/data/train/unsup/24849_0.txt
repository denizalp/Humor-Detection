In a word, shameful. \n\nPer my prior review, I'd been going to this location for quite a few years now. In that time, I've been through three different regular stylists. Why, you might ask, do I have that many? Turnover is the answer, and the reason why i finally went back to update this review. \n\nThe first stylist I had here was great, and the reason I came back over and over. He got into a tiff with the balding, in the back and doing nothing manager (he's currently pictured in the only photo for this business) and apparently walked off the job. \n\nThe second stylist I had after that for a little less than a year, until he too got into a tiff with the same exact manager and, likewise, walked off the job one day. As the French would say, \"Le sigh...\" but I started to suspect a pattern. \n\nFast forward about another year and I'm out another stylist. Why? Because Mr. Manager of the year drove her away too. I'm also aware of at least two other stylists, though I never used them, who also walked out, also because of said manager. \n\nI'm sorry but I like to have some consistency and not having to find a new stylist every six to eight months because the manager can't retain the best stylists in the salon. The guy cuts hair himself, rarely, but I wouldn't let him near me with a 10 foot pole, let alone scissors. \n\nWhat's the expression, fool me once and shame on you, fool me twice and shame on me? I wonder just silly I look having done this song and dance -three- times with them before giving up and taking my business elsewhere. Lesson learned though, no more Great Clips for me, at least at this location. \n\nIf you're looking for any kind of consistency and enjoy working with your regular stylist when you need a haircut, avoid this place like the plague.
