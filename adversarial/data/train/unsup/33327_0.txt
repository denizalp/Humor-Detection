I love heading out to the Cue Club on weekend nights! While the line out front may scare away some potential customers, the wait always seems to fly by. Every time I've been to the Cue Club my group has been able to make new friends. Even while often packed, it has never taken me too long to get a order a drink at the bar. In the back it seems like have enough pool tables and space for people to get a few games in without being bumped around too much as there is only a few tables affected by the men's bathroom crowd.
