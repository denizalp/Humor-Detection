I was actually very disappointed with my experience at Bouchon. I used to hear great things about the food, view and service. I hadn't heard any personal recommendations in a while but happened to be in the hotel for work and decided to treat myself to brunch.\n\nI was seated quickly, not a long wait at all. When I sat down in a very slow and quoet resteraunt it took about 5 mins for my server to come over to me. I don't know what waa going on, maybe a bad day? I noticed while I was waiting that all the servers looked upset or in an unfriendly mood. That struck me as odd.\n\nThen my food arrived, bland and tasteless at best. Gaufres au Levain $14.50 (waffle with Carmel banana, walnuts and cream). I could have made AMAZING moist waffles at home, to come to a fine dining resteraunt you want better than what you could do yourself. Isn't that the point lol. \n\nSo for my visit, nothing memorable that would make me go back unfortunately.
