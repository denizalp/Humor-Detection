200th Review of 2013!!!  Might as well make it the city I live in. \n\nThere are so many quotes, sayings, and cliches about Las Vegas.  You have \"Sin City\", \"Lost Wages\", \"the Silver State\", and my favorite \"What Happens In Vegas, Stays In Vegas\" to name a few.  But for me, it's now \"Home Sweet Home\".  \n\nBeen visiting the city of Las Vegas at least 5 times a year since 1998.  It wasn't until 2011 that I can now consider Vegas my home.  Prior to moving here, my purpose out here was to visit friends and lose a ton of money.  I also can't forget visiting the zoo every once in awhile where you'd spot the occasional crazy horse, cheetah, and even a spearmint rhino.  Now my purpose is work, friends, family, and to make money.  And because of the lower cost of living compared to my hometown San Diego, that money sure lasts a lot longer out here.  \n\nLas Vegas is known for gambling and entertainment. Been coming out here for years to party.  Now I'm partying only when friends and family come from out of town. I love this city and learned that there's a lot more to offer than just casinos, hotels, shopping, and entertainment.  In the short time I lived here, I discovered that Las Vegas is one of the most convenient cities around.  Distance from South to North is only about 20 miles.  Within these 20 miles, you have everything that the heart desires.  One of the biggest perks for living in this city is the local discounts, cheap strong pours, no income tax, minimal traffic, great hikes, and a ton of restaurants.  Don't get me wrong, still love and miss San Diego. But in the meantime, Las Vegas is my \"Home Sweet Home\".\n\nUseful Sites Las Vegas Sites:\n-Yelp:  niner13.yelp.com\n-i4Vegas:  http:\/\/www.i4vegas.com\/\n-Vegas.com:  http:\/\/www.i4vegas.com\/
