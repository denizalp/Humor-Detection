We arrived at 7:20 last night and asked for a seat outside since it was a gorgeous day. We were immediately seated outside. However, the waitress avoided eye contact with us and no one even asked us for a drink of water for 20 minutes. When my fiancé went up to the bar to get someone's attention,  the manager was too busy speaking to his friend. My fiancé literally had to gesture him to come his way. Then, the manager yelled at the waitress in front of customers instead of picking up the slack. The waitress who was also the busboy looked overworked. My fiancé ordered a short beer but was given a large and charged for it too. I ordered a water with a lemon and I never got the lemon.  Our nachos arrived a little cold. We were given dirty looks by the workers. All we wanted was beer and nachos.  It's not that much to ask for. Needless to say, we probably won't go back.
