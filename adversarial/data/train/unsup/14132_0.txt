Oh man, my experience with this place was my worst chinese delivery nightmare from start to finish.  Delivery minimum, so I had to order 3 dishes even though I couldn't possibly even eat 1.  Driver got lost on the way to my house and called me.  He was about 100 feet from where I was and all he had to do was turn left, but he could not speak English well enough to understand what I was telling him, and didn't seem to be motivated enough to actually try to go in the directon I was telling him to go.  We were on the phone for about 15 minutes.  \r\n\r\nThen I at last had the food in my kitchen.  The menu claims no MSG but my food tasted like 4 different textures of MSG.  When I opened my (admittedly totally tired) General Tso's Chicken, the first bite (and all subsequent bites) I took was overpowered in flavor by the 4 sad sorry florets of brocolli that had been thrown in the box.  My sweet and sour pork that I had to order to meet the delivery medium was of the sweet and sour comes in a separate tub and has to be combined with the deep fried pork pellets variety, which is my least favorite variety.\r\n\r\nAt least the dishes were themselves inexpensive?
