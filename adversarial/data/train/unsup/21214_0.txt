I haven't written a review in a while, but the service here is so incredible that I feel it needs to be done. Here's basically all you need to know: I fly in FROM NEW YORK CITY to have my hair cut and colored by Melissa. Seriously, this chick is a freaking wizard. If wizards could wield scissors and make me look like \"Friends\"-era Jennifer Aniston. When I first went to Mel, my hair was a fried disaster that could make a small child cry. Now, it's silky, smooth and healthy. BOOM. If you're even considering going anywhere else, you're wrong. Just go here. You'll be happy you did.
