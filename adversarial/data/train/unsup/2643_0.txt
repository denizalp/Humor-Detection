For some reason, whenever I have good hot dogs that are worth every stinking dollar I paid, I always want to smoke two (2) cigarettes, one after another, while faux-drunk calling an ex-girlfriend.\n\nFood court did not have ashtrays nearby. \nCellphone signal was blocked in the casino.\n\nSerendipity likes to tie me up and have her way with me sometimes.
