After today's experience at the Eglinton Ave W location, I will never shop at The Healthy Butcher again, nor will I recommend it to others. \n\nAnyone who reads my reviews on Yelp knows I use Yelp to support amazing local businesses or to become aware of them so I can enjoy the very best they have to offer. I love the Yelp community!\n\nI don't enjoy writing about - or having - negative and stressful experiences, which is what I received today - and from the owner no less!\n\nIt is far too important to me to support local businesses that treat their customers properly. If you read through their reviews on other popular sites, you will see others have experienced poor customer relations. \n\nSo what happened?\n\nI called in an order for some chicken and 3 bone-in ribeye steaks. Google \"bone-in ribeye steaks\" and you'll immediately see images of what I expected to receive! \n\nThe butcher taking the order - who was female -confirmed that I wanted 3 prime ribs. I  took that moment to clarify 3 bone-in ribeye steaks. She said it was the same thing. \n\nNow I am no butcher, so maybe I got the terminology wrong. Granted I'd been ordering from their butcher Dave on the phone and this never happened before. I trusted her and that was that. \n\n$122 later for the steaks, and when my over 70 year old father brought the order home, I realized it wasn't in the form I wanted. It was prime rib roast.\n\nI called and had the misfortune to speak with the owner Tara (she identified herself as such toward the end of our conversation). \n\nShe told me these things happen given different terminology, which I totally understand, and that she could help me cut it, that that was all that needed to be done. That I got what I ordered. \n\nShe said she sided with her butcher and it wasn't their error. She also told me what I should have ordered were rib chops. \n\nI maintained I just ordered ribeye steaks a few days earlier at an awesome butcher when in Texas (check out that review!), and that was what I wanted so I asked for it. \n\nTo me, the error should not fall on a customer who has come back time and again for over 7 years to this location for my meat and poultry needs. I would have expected them to treat a long-standing customer right. \n\nHer offer to help me cut it over the phone wasn't going to work. For various reasons I cannot do this and I advised her of that. She suggested my 70+ year old father who doesn't and hasn't ever cooked in his life do it. I don't even have a proper knife for him to handle it. And for $122 before taxes, it's not what I expect. \n\nWhen she asked what they could do I suggested a gift card for next time for a customer like me who is loyal. (I would have had to find a recipe for the prime rib roast and it wasn't what I wanted to serve anyway. They are also an hour away so getting them to cut it for me doesn't make sense.) She said no. I asked if I could freeze it and return it jn a week when I will be back around that location. She said no. \n\nThe final resolution was having my father drive an hour back for a refund, which I took. I feel terrible for my father and disappointed with the store. \n\nIt is clear that the owner here doesn't care about me as a customer. I will never be back. \n\nI will try Sanagan's meat locker, which was highly recommended to me before, but which I never thought I needed to try since I was used to The Healthy Butcher. \n\nHere's to my search for an awesome Toronto butcher!
