On our way to Sedona, my bf and I decided on making a stop by the Heart Attack Grill. We were intrigued by this restaurant since it was featured on the Foodnetwork and the Travel Channel. Also, we're not in AZ often so we decided to check it out.\n\nThe restaurant itself is located in a dying strip mall. The signage outside does not stand out at all so if you're not keeping an eye out for it you may miss it.\n\nWhen you walk in the door, you're greeted by the smell of lard and cheerful waitresses dressed in nurses outfits. I was a little grossed out by lard smell but it was barely noticeable after a while. Haha.\n\nMy bf and I ordered a single bypass burger and fries. I didn't care to much for the fries. It was bland and soggy so I only had a few from the unlimited fries bar. The burger is delivered to you plainly as a cheeseburger and there's a condiment bar with pickles, jalapenos, onions, etc. LOVED the fresh pickles. It definitely made my burger eating experience more pleasurable. I was 2\/3 done with my burger when my bf tells me to not watch the video playing on the screen which shows the cooking process of the burger. What do most people do when you hear something like that? You check it out due to curiosity, right? I wish I hadn't seen it because I completely lost my appetite upon seeing the video. *shudder* I sort of knew and remembered the cooking process from the foodnetwork or travel channel shows but seeing it and actually eating it grossed me out. \n\nI'm glad I tried it but I doubt I'd be coming back again if I'm in the Arizona area. I value my arteries a little too much to subject it to such grease\/lard again.
