Well I needed a burger. I had gone past my normal time of consumption and I needed a burger, now. Well Tom's looked like a nice place - I'm going through the drive-thru. I have to say as far as drive-thrus go this is a five star drive thru. The Person was nice, attentive, patient, and took my order easily. I had a the pastrami Burger and I have to say as far as fast-food burgers go that's was very nice and the fries were excellent. So I liked it as far as restaurants go it's still just a 3 star restaurant but with a five star drive thru
