I came in with a phone that was stuck on the startup screen. I had an appointment but still had to wait 30 minutes. Finally it was my turned to be helped. I gave him a briefing and asked what could have caused it. He said, and I quote, \"I don't get paid to know that. I only get paid to fix it.\" How the heck can you fix something you don't know?! So he plugged my phone into itunes. 5 minutes later after it didn't do anything, his next suggestion was to buy a new iphone. Listen Apple. If your ONLY solution to fix ANYTHING is to buy a new iPhone then I can understand why so many people keep telling me to cross over to the darkside and get an Android.
