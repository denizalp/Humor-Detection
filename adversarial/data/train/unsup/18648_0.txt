I purchased a massage on Groupon for Espres. I get massages on a regular basis so i figured this would be a good way to save some money. Let me start with saying how BEAUTIFUL the facility is...and that's where the good part ends. The woman who gave me the massage was HORRIBLE! I have had better \"massages\" from friends who come up behind you and quickly rub your shoulders. It literally seemed like she was just moving lotion around on my skin...it wasnt even relaxing! I would bet money that this woman has no official training or certification in massage. Right after my massage, she went onto paint someone's nails...I was EXTREMELY displeased with my experience. I will never return.
