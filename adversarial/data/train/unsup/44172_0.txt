Conveniently located on the second floor of the new Loblaw's at Maple Leaf Centre, the newest LCBO location in Toronto's core district offers the same selection as other locations, but in a more modern and spacious store. Unlike the closest store to this location (on Yonge Street; south of Wellesley) this store is not as crowded and has more checkout lanes.  Perks such as Air Miles (and the occassional bonus miles offers) still exist. Located next door to the Joe Fresh apparel shop, it's worth a visit if you're in the mood to buy alcohol for a special occasion or just for fun.
