I am a bad, bad person.  I discovered FEZ very shortly after moving here 3 years ago, and have never reviewed it.  But I promise you, I have made up for this  by recommending it to everyone I know.  Whenever anyone asks where's good to go, FEZ is my answer.\n\nEverything here is spot on.  My personal favorite is the Casablanca chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries, but I adore the kibis, the rosemary fries, the burger, the salads, the soup, some lettuce wrap something that Thomas served us, the kisris, and the martinis, oh lord save me from the martinis.\n\nSadly, I have not stopped by for brunch, nor have I ever had any dessert.  But seeing as how there has not been one single thing that I've tried there that I didn't absolutely love, I'm sure they're wonderful, and I'll correct this injustice next time I go.\n\nThe ambience and decor are wonderful, service is good, prices are good.  FEZ has been my go-to spot since the first time I went, and I doubt that will ever change.  It's great for a nice date, it's perfect for a gaggle of girlfriends, and as I recently found out with Dave, it's even lovely for a lazy late lunch on a Sunday when you can't bring yourself to get dressed up.\n\nYay FEZ!!
