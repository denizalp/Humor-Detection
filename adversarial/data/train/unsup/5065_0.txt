[NOTE: I'm reviewing this as a foodie, and someone who doesn't consume alcohol on a regular basis. Also as a foodie who went into this take out experience without realizing this was listed as a \"Dive Bar.\" Because I'm an observant male human like that.]\n\nSo it was a little off-putting to walk in and see the circle of counter space surrounding the bartender. And it was a little awkward walking up to him and asking for my takeout. And I basically just wanted out of there asap. He didn't do much to assuage my uneasiness either, since he never actually said a word to me. Are bartenders usually that much of a hardass? As a non-bargoer, I just kind of assumed all bartenders are part time therapists and best friends as well. Probably my naive Christian college experience talking. Take that paragraph as you will.\n\nAnyways, the burger I ordered. I got the Paradise because, why not, it's safe, and this is the Paradise Lounge. (Side note: I was SEVERELY disappointed that their lunch menu did not carry over to dinner. I'm sure there's some marketing or ingredient pricing reasoning behind it, but there were some tasty looking burgers on that menu that I basically wasn't allowed to try because it was 8PM. Dumb.) Let me just say, the entire way home, my car smelled AWFUL because of this burger. Like, I had no desire to open the box encasing whatever fowl-smelling creation Mr. Grumpypants handed me. Do it for the Yelp, though.\n\nAnd (thank God), it didn't taste nearly as bad as it smelled. But, it was unremarkable. Just another burger. Honestly feel like I could have got the same thing anywhere else - and probably a larger one, too...This thing was tiny. But I mean, it was palatable. So that's always a good thing, I suppose.\n\nMy advice: If you're like me, and not trying to drink away your Friday or just have a good time with friends (AKA, you just want some local grub), go during lunch and try one of the burgers I wasn't able to.
