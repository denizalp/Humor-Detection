My girlfriend purchased a game for me (in error - \"Punch Out\" vs \"Mike Tyson's Punch Out\") and I called to ask if they had the desired game in stock.  I was informed that they would not accept the exchange unless the item was defective.  \"Mike Tyson's Punch Out\" costs about $10 to $15 more so they would be benefiting from the sale.  In the end, they lose a regular customer and a sale in one fell swoop.
