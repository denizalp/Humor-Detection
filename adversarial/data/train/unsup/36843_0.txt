Came to Border MX based on the good Yelp reviews, and was let to disappointment. \n\nWe were seated in the far back corner of the restaurant by the washrooms. We were literally out of sight from the kitchen, front counter, and rest of the restaurant. This of course led to non-existent service. \n\nOrdered the ground beer nachos with added guac $1, 3 baja fish tacos, and a mixed flag (3 sauce) enchillada's plate. It was weird that each dish came separately with a long wait between each. The nachos took 30 mins to arrive and it was soggy. \n\nThe baja fish tacos were not crispy, and the overall taco was quite tasteless. The enchillada's were nothing special. The meat inside them were actually cold, and not hot! \n\nDid not bother using the Yelp check in for a free churo, as that likely would have taken another 30 minutes. \n\n$57 after tax and tip for 2! I likely not be back based on the food and service.
