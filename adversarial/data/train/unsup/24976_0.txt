If you are looking for hooch (after getting cheaper gas across the street and lunch at Cracker Barrel), Frugal MacDoogal's is the place to visit.  Whenever a reason to party arises, we head south of the border for our beer and liquor.\n\nLocated just in front of Carowind's (appropriate) right off of 77, it's a bit of a challenge to get through the DO NOT ENTER and stop sign and around the building to get to the parking lot - I think it's some kind of test to see if you are already drunk.  Plenty of parking and you can get a churro from Plaza Fiesta when you are done.\n\nVodka, whiskey, mixers, beer, cocktails, big bottles, small bottles, boxes and bags.... it's enough booze to get Lindsay Lohan through the weekend.  Although not as pretty as some of the NC ABC stores, the prices are right and the selection is amazing.  It's well organized, good signage so you can find what you are looking for and well stocked.  Whatever you like to drink, Frugal's is sure to have it.
