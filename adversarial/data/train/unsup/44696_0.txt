Worst food experience ever!!!!!!\n\nIt's not in my nature to be rude but this place needs a quick reality check. Singers that sings loudly when you try to have a conversation. Food that is sold at higher prices that they should ever be\n\nDÃ®ner for 4 children's and wife more then 200$ for crap food \n\nPictures says all !
