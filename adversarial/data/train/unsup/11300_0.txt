Quick and convenient place to grab some good curry katsu. They have really fast and friendly service so I've become a solid regular here now. My go to order is the chicken katsu curry. All in all it's definitely not bad. Is it the best curry\/katsu I've ever had? No but for the price and convenience I'm definitely still a fan!\n\nThere's tons of parking in the complex and the wait is never that bad. I usually like calling my order in ahead and it's usually just a 10 min wait. You can also create your order curry here. You pick your meat (chicken\/pork katsu, spam, etc) then your curry and spice level then your amount and type of rice! Tons of options and combos to fit your curry desires.
