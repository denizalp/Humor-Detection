Someone from here reached out to my dinner group about having an event here.  \n\nThe place is in the front of an office park across from Carowinds.  It is a bar with lots of TVs and a couple of pool tables in the back. Each of the booths has its own TV.\n\nWhen I arrived, I mentioned to the bartender that I was with a dinner group and she had no idea we were going to be there.   Nice to see this was coordinated so well....\n\nThe place is not suitable for a large dinner group with only the bar, a few booths and about 5 bar tables.    Thankfully we had a couple of cancellations and were able to pull the bar tables together. \n\nFor food, I tried the fried pickles which are described as \"A southern favorite with a little bite\".   These were actually some of the worst fried pickles I've ever had.  They were pickle spears cut into chunks and dipped in bread crumbs.  There was no bite to them other than the pickle flavor and the temperature.  \n\nThen I had the rueben which was recommended by the bartender.  Worst Reuben I've ever had.  It was on pumpernickel bread.  There was little sauerkraut and it was smothered in thousand island dressing.  \n\nI was trying to figure out what another review was referring to in craft brews.  For drafts they only had 3....PBR, Blue Moon and Sweetwater.   Maybe the bottled selection was better.\n\nThe only reason I could see coming back here is to watch a game or to play a game of pool.  Stay away from the food unless you've had a few.
