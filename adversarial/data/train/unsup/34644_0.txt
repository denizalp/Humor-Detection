While the place is a little hidden it turned out to be a real gem. Located on the south side of the street just a little west of Bathurst Street the awkwardly placed door which sits at a right angle to the street leads into a really small space. The decor is simple and straightforward with exposed brick on one wall and bead board on the other. Along both of the interior walls are bar stools and two counters to have some food. The serving area sits in the back section of the shop while a window lets in a little light from Bloor Street. While the place is small, the food was actually really delicious. They have a number of pre-made poke bowls, with marinated fish on rice or make your own options from a menu of choices. I had the Big Katuna while Mr.T had the Ninja salmon bowl. The food was the perfect combination of flavours for a warm spring-like night and will definitely become one of summer dinner options.
