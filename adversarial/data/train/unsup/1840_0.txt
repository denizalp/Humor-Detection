Came in on a lazy to take the muscle pain away. No groupon.\n\nThe massage itself was lovely and lasted the entire time it was supposed to. My masseuse applied just enough pressure and asked me how it felt intermittently. It was quiet and was relaxing. Money well spent.\n\nThe problem arose when it came time to leave. I handed my masseuse $7. She looked at the money, and then looked up at me with a look of utter confusion. \n\nI never saw someone react this way to being handed extra money, so I was beginning to become confused as well, so I stated \"It's for you to keep. It's a tip. The massage was great, thank you\"\n\nShe then shook her head, and pointed to the sign on the wall with the tipping amounts. Me, in shock said, \"Oh, I didn't know there was a certain amount to tip. That's all I have.\" Which was a lie...Had she been a little more  subtle , I definitely would've threw in an extra 3 bucks, but after that, I wasn't about to be pressured into giving her more money.\n\nShe then asked me if I wanted to tip more on a credit card...I wanted to say \"HELL NO!\", but I smiled and apologetically repeated, \"That's all I have\"\n\nI suppose she felt defeated. She looked sadly at the money in her hand and walked away.\n\nI should've took my $7 back from her. Completely ungrateful.
