It is what it is.  It's a thrift store.  I come here mainly to buy used toys for my wee-one.  At first I was a little skeptical but I started digging and I found some pretty awesome little toys for next to nothing.  Yay me!  Baby toys are really expensive and babies get bored of them so fast that paying $20 for every toy (which seems to be the going rate for most basic toys) gets really expensive.  I've found some toys here that are almost new for $2.  On the weekend I found some old school wooden alphabet \/ number blocks for 4$ - a little on the pricey side for VV but significantly cheaper than any toy store would sell them in Toronto.\n\nI always find the \"bag 'o toys\" to be hit and miss - there's usually one toy in the bag that I want and then 3 or 4 others that I don't.  Also, I'm not sure why they bag multiples of the same items together... Why would I want two tambourines?  Or 5 rattles?\n\nIt sometimes seems that parents drop their kids off here to run wild down the aisles, tearing all the toys off the shelves.  I've had kids scream as I start trying toys that they'd previously not seen and that are out of their reach - clearly the toy I have in my hand is much more interesting than any of the hundreds of other toys they've already pulled off the shelves and tried themselves.  The toy section is usually pretty hard to navigate with a stroller and I've had to protect my baby from toys being thrown \/ waved around by these children that appear to have been orphaned here.\n\nI also like watching the ridiculous hipsters shopping here.  I spotted one guy wearing a poncho with navajo printed leggings with a ridiculous moustache shopping for a wooden tennis racket on the weekend.  I kid you not.  It was picture worthy but I didn't want to flater his ego.
