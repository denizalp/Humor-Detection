Who doesn't like Ace?!?! It's sometimes a little more expensive than the other stores, but the customer service is well worth it at times. You know, when you're looking for that strange sized nail or funky tool that you wonder aimlessly at those large stores looking for the familiar apron to ask without any luck ......Ace always seems have someone to help and know exactly where it is and many times only having to buy a couple rather than the whole bag. \nI usually can find a coupon to use here and often, when standing in line to pay, find some fun little needless chochsky that I can't live without. Lol
