I have been going to this and the original one for the last 30 years. It's been great up until the last time I went where I got food poisoning from the chicken yero. But the first 100's of times has been excellent. Best hero in town. \nBut the service is very poor esp. when you get these grumpy french waitresses who god forbid they crack a smile. Its like they are doing you a favour to eat there!!! Anyway even with the food poisoning I will go back but avoid the chicken for a while. \nFood 4 Stars\nService 1 Star\nso I gave a 3 star, if it was take out I would have given a 4 or even 5 star. Service always sucked there. \n\nGet a Greek waitress who knows how to speak greek......or at least english as most customers are greek.
