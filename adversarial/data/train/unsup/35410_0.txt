Located in Aria on The Las Vegas Strip. Ok so here we have yet another dimly lit place with blaring music (yet no dancing,(I still don't get this) and over priced drinks. I had had to keep checking my GPS to make sure that I wasn't in Los Angeles, sadly I was in Las Vegas. If I want loud music I will go to a club that has dancing. If I want self-aggrandizement and pretension I will go to Los Angeles. Bring back the Las Vegas of old! But perhaps this is your thing if so. Stop in and have a drink. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
