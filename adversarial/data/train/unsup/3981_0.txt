So disappointed with this place after seeing it was a 4.5 star joint and I seldom make it out to the beautiful section of Northeast Vegas (cough). \n\nWe walked in and 90% of the customers were Mexican...usually a good sign and that's when it all went downhill...\n\nWe ordered: Corundas Tarascas (13.99) and Bracerito a La Meseta Tarasca For Two (38.99)\nand here's what went wrong:\n\nTHE WAIT\nWaited almost 90 minutes for our food. Even the waiter said, \"You guys haven't gotten your food yet??!!\" When he saw our drowning looks after an hour and fifteen minutes...and we were close to just leaving.\n\nDISH UNO\nThe corundas tarascas was supposed to have pieces of pork, I counted 4 small pieces in the sauce. $14 for some corn bread in a red sauce...no bueno.\n\nDISH DOS\nThe Meseta Tarasca for two...I've had these type of mixed \"paradilla\" (or whatever each restaurant likes to name them) plates before many times and I'm familiar with how they're grilled and how they come out...it's like fajitas for two with a shitload more meat (hence $40 tag). The entire dish was completely burned and overcooked, embarrassing to even bring to a table. The steak was beyond well done..gray and tough, destroyed. The chorizo was black and dried out, inedible. The pounded chicken breast was so overcooked and tough I couldn't cut through it with a regular table knife. The beef ribs were both burnt to black...and the sauce that comes out on top of the dish that many yelpers took photos of (and is on their website) was non-existent. \n\nACCOUNTABILITY\nThe waiter saw we weren't too happy and apologized and said he'd bring the manager over. I guess he knew he served up a plate of embarrassment because I didn't even ask to speak to anyone (wouldn't want them to replace the burnt food anyway because who knows how that really goes) but an older woman comes over and I said, \"We waited an hour and a half for our meal and look, it's completely burnt.\" Her response, \"Yes, ok.\" with a smile...and that was that.\n\nTHE SERVICE\nHad a guy and a girl serving us...very friendly, but totally incompetent. We were asked if we wanted corn or flour tortillas. We said, flour...we got neither...20 minutes after the food arrived I had to ask for them. Also, the mixed meat dish was supposed to come with a skillet of melted Mexican cheese as is shown on the menu, on their website and is on all the yelp pics. When I asked for the cheese the waitress said it doesn't come with cheese. I then had to point it out to her on the menu that it does in fact come with the \"melted cheese\"...\"oh ok, I'll get that for you.\" This was 30 minutes after the food had already arrived and I was just wanting to bounce...maybe she didn't want the extra work of grabbing what I paid for or it was her first day of work...I'll go with the first.
