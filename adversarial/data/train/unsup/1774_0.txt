Now open where Chili's used to be, between the A and B concourses in the Charlotte airport, you'll find the 1897 Market. And wow, what a spot. If you had asked me yesterday what was the best food choice in CLT, I'd have said the burger bar in C. Now, I'm not so sure.\n\n1897 has it all. Pizzas made to order in a gas oven. Sandwiches made to order. A large selection of grab-and-go that looks amazingly awesome. There was a container of Queen Charlotte's Pimiento Cheese in there that caught my eye. Mmmmm... tasty!\n\nAnd to top it all off, a large bar on the atrium side that has local brews on tap! Yep, even the award winning Hop-Drop-And-Roll and my own favorite, the Jalapeno Pale Ale. Jeez, Louise. I might have to arrange more layovers here just to eat!
