I was local to this place doing some other shopping and my phone suggested it, having never been here I wasn't sure if it was a pub with minimal food and mostly drinking. The inside is far bigger than it seems, has a great boat or lake house feel to it. The service was amazing, my server was responsive and when i asked for garnish removal, I didn't get a it on the side when the dish arrived; which to me equates attention to detail. Perhaps the owner, but an older gentleman was working the floor and assisting as backup, that impressed me. Normally a manager is far from the action or above lifting a plate. I ordered the chicken wings in a maple sauce and they were the best wings I have had in this neighborhood of over a year living here. Cooked to the bone not mostly, breaded and marinated evenly without excessive fat or breading to hide low quality chicken, just fantastic. I also had the lamb burger w\/ sweet potato fries, the lamb was cooked perfectly and without the slightest bit of fat. The fries weren't over greasy and had more of a baked texture. Again very well prepared. I visited noon on a weekday if that helps.
