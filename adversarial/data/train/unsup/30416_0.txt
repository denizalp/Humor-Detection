This restaurant was fantastic.  We were in Montreal for a weekend away with friends.  We went on Yelp to find a good place to go for dinner on Saturday night.  After reading the review about the male lamb, we just had to go.  We walked in with nice jeans and dress shirts and the staff gave us no problem (my impression was that most folks don't wear jeans there).  We were seated at the manager's table and he was very friendly and contributed to our great experience.  Everyone got the special lamb dish.  It was delicious.  We had great wine, great food, and a great dessert to top it off.  The physical surroundings are beautiful.  The service is excellent.  The price is slightly higher than I was expecting, but it was worth it.  If you are looking for a fantastic fine dining experience in Montreal, you must go to L'autre Saison!
