Omg!!! What a gem! \n\nWe were looking for a place near blossom and this was highly recommended. \n\nWe sat at the bar, and in my opinion that's the best seat in the house. Watching the chefs perform their magic was like watching a ballet. We couldn't believe the precision and pace that they were putting out amazing dishes. \n\nEverything that we saw leave the kitchen looked fabulous.  I had the Steak Pizzaiola and the steak was perfectly done, and a very interesting twist on steak. I thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nMy friend had the jambalaya and it was excellent, perfect amount of heat!\n\nWe wanted to stay and try everything on the menu!\n\nIt will definitely be new destination restaurant!\n\nI am very excited because I will be doing a project in Cuyahoga Falls, so I'm sure I will be back soon!\n\nAlso I have to mention that the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We got delayed on the freeway and were late for our reservation and they were great about keeping in touch with us and we're very pleasant about the unfortunate situation. With the restaurant that is as busy as this place, sometimes the front of house people can be \"stressed\". The ladies I spoke with were extremely pleasant and friendly!  \n\nAlso, our waitress at the bar was really friendly and accommodating to a special drink request that I had.
