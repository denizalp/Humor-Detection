This is a tale and review of but a single dish.\n\nSometimes nothing tops off a meal better than a cool Dairy Queen ice cream treat--especially after spicy fare like the Guacamole Dip and other fusion cuisine served at KoMex.  In this case, after a late lunch, a short drive to Dairy Queen had the desired effect of quenching the KoMex flames and soothing the gut with just one medium-sized chocolate-dipped Dairy Queen cone.  That cone was savored for 15 minutes while enjoying the creamy interior goodness and breaking hard chocolate outer shell that it had to offer before polishing off its ridged cake exterior with the cool vanilla ice cream still inside.  This particular Dairy Queen restaurant also offers cherry and butterscotch dips, and chocolate Dairy Queen ice cream as well as the vanilla variety.  But there is something about the unadorned vanilla that simply has not been exactly replicated anywhere else.  Like Coca-Cola, one day someone really got the formula right, and as a result many years later Dairy Queen is still very much in business, now pleasing new generations of consumers.  To keep those flavor memories alive and try something new, I picked up a box of Butterscotch Dilly Bars on my way out the door!\n\nAnd, if you are wondering why a four-star rating instead of five-, my cone had a slight break in its side that exposed a bit of white ice cream delight as it was handed to me.
