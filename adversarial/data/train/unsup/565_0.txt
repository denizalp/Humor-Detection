I have been into the office a few times, and spoke on the phone a few times, and I have dealt with happy, cheerful people in every conversation. They love on my fur baby every time I walk in, and kiss on him when he leaves. He just did his first overnight stay for a week, and when I picked him up, he was bathed, fluffy, and smelled heavenly. I will definitely be returning!
