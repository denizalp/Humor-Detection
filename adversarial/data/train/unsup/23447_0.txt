2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     27\/100\n\nIf you got that Dunkin' craving while at the Fremont Experience, you're in luck! \n\nIt's just like the other Dunkin' Donuts, but conveniently located within the Fremont Casino\/Hotel. \n\nI only come here when I have family staying at the Fremont hotel or with family that enjoys gambling at the Fremont Casino. \n\nThey have great service each time, they're quick and open 24\/7, last night we were able to get Boston Creme and coconut donuts at 10-11pm (a Saturday night.) \n\nQuality of donuts and coffee is okay. It's Dunkin. \n\nIf you're with family or friends and you're not in the mood for donuts, it's located right next to Lanai Express which serves Asian Pacific Islander fast food- Chinese, Hawaiian food. Quality is 2\/5.\n\nTIP: I did not know this till last night, they offer 1 FREE REFILL on coffee!
