LINQ hooked it up for us! My group comprised of two couples and we were both upgraded to suites, which was really nice. The suite was spacious, clean, and had a great view. I was skeptical about LINQ at first because it seemed to be a small hotel compared to other hotels on the strip, but I enjoyed my time at LINQ. The only thing I would say is that you are only allowed to have 2 devices on the wifi, anything more you would have to pay. Staying at the LINQ is affordable and comfortable - I'd recommend staying here if you're on a budget.
