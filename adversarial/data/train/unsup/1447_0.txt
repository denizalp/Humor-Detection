We found the original Cafe Monarch a couple years ago, and yes it was by far the best in the valley.  I was crushed to find it had closed.  Recently I saw it on Open Table and found they had reopened.  Alas, it is not the same place at all.  No more BYOB, which was fab, as we could enjoy a really great wine.  So now at $55 plus just for the food, it is quite expensive.  But then so are the (ugh) steak joints, soooo.\n\nThey really jammed the tables in the courtyard which is small.  The tables are tiny and you really feel crammed in.  God help a large man over 6 feet in the chairs.\n\nThe food was very interesting, a great mix of flavors but TOO SALTY.  Everything was too salty (except dessert).  \n\nNO BREAD.  For $55, can't I get some warm bread!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'd even pay $56!!!!\nSome of the sauces were very tastly (except salty) and I wanted to polish them off.  Was I to lick the plate to get my money's worth?   Please, give us some BREAD!!!\n\nThey also need WARM PLATES.  So hard?  Not really.  Our main course was warm but not hot.  I want my food HOT.  \n\n Be prepared to spend $100 each for dinner.  My hsb thought his meat was not the quality you would get in some places, but again compared to the steak places.....\n\nThat being said, we will try it again.  The food had a very interesting mix of flavors.  Everything was interesting, and would be outstanding if they lost some of the salt.
