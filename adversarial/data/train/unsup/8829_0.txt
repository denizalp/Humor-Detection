My family and I have been using Roadrunner for at LEAST the last 11 years, going back to when my first kitty developed hyperthyroidism.  My vets thought the best approach would be a transdermal (= goes onto the skin) gel for Kitty.  He has since passed, but his sister-from-another-motha' is now in her 20s and has also developed the condition.  She's now on the same meds.\n\nThe process is simple:  My vet calls in the script, Roadrunner calls me, I call them back to pay (either with an operator or via automated system with my script and cc info), and I get the medication within 5 business (BUSINESS!) days.  \n\nSince I'm always on the run and usually don't have the Rx number, I've consistently opted to speak to a customer service rep. They've always been friendly and quick with my transactions! They've also been flexible if I need to change the shipping address in order to ensure I receive the meds at the optimal location.\n\nTiP:  Make sure you're in contact with Roadrunner when you have at LEAST 10 days left of meds. I'd shoot for 14 days to be on the safe side. (Again, you need to take BUSINESS days into consideration!)\n\nIn all of these years, I've never ONCE had an issue receiving the meds, and IMO that's saying something! \n\nThey always send a well-cushioned box that includes the meds, a kitty toy (awh, thanks!), and dosage\/application instructions.  The BEST part?  They're a bit generous with the transdermal gel, so each syringe always has 1 extra dose packed in past the end line.  I totally appreciate that!\n\nThe prices are reasonable -- I pay about $55 for 2 syringes of gel (3ml each, 6ml total), which lasts 2 months (3ml = 30 doses; 6ml = 60 doses).  That means Kitty's meds cost me less than $1 per day. \n\nTo sum, Roadrunner Pharmacy is totally reliable, friendly, and, I believe, people and pet-centered.  I have no qualms recommending these guys for your pet's medication needs!
