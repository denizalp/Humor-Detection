For years, I frequented Willo House. And I don't know why.\nThe place was dirty and cramped. Sanitation was questionable at best. Plumbing in the restroom was hit and miss. And the stench of patchouli *still* makes me nauseous. But I was under 21, and coffeehouses were the only places we could nurse a drink for hours and be allowed to hang out.  I had some good times there, made some friends and saw some good bands play our front. Back then, I couldn't help but thing - what would happen if they cleaned this place up?  If they did some basic improvements and made themselves appeal to people with, you know - JOBS? The location is great, the property is great - and the old house has so much character and charm.  It had so much potential - just get rid of the patchouli freaks, raise the bar on food and drink options and the place could be great.\nFlash forward.  Willo House is dead and gone. And Hob Nob assumed the location.\nI can't believe it's the same house!  It's - well - CLEAN!  Bathrooms (there are 2 now!) are modern and clean and functional. Walls have been sanded and repainted (no longer fear splinters from resting my hand on a door jam.) They still support local artists, and wares are for sale throughout. The baristas are knowledgeable of the products, efficient and friendly!\nThank you, proprietors of Hob Nob - you have brought the vision I had so many years ago to life. Now I know what it could be if the potential were realized - and it is lovely!\n+100 for the beer and wine license and the great selection of bottled beers - for when I am not in the mood for coffee.
