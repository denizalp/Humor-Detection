Although this studio is very difficult to get to (If you don't live in the area, & will encounter rush hour at any point of the day), it's pretty easy to find, snuggled in a plaza near restaurants and dry cleaners. (Because of this, it will also be hard to find parking in the evenings, and I suggest going early to find a spot). The Viva and Yrt will also pass conveniently close to the studio.\n\nThe service here is pretty shameful. I visited this studio twice, and on my first visit I had been waiting for a friend, (caught in northbound rush hour, of course) I signed up for a class and let them know I was waiting for her. I wasn't even expecting a response, since it was a haphazard comment informing them why I wasn't heading towards the changeroom. What I got was a rude and unnecessary, \"Well we don't let latecomers in\" response from a young man & woman. I am very well aware of that rule, and I was in no way going to be late (and this was at least 20 mins before the class).  \n\nOn my second visit, the service was satisfactory but totally forgettable at best. \n\nThe studio and changeroom(s) are clean, well-lit and new, albeit cramped once the evening crowd makes its way in. You'll be left wondering if there are by-laws set in place for yoga studios and crowd control, and the studio is representative of that. It was very, very cramped for a regular-priced Moksha class. \n\nIf you're thinking of making your way to Moksha Markham, either go during a weekday or prepare to be facing someone's buttcrack for a pretty hour.\n\n2.5 Stars
