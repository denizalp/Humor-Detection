Having a real Italian Market and Meat Market is a blessing to any neighborhood. Tony and the staff are all great folks. \nWhether you are Italian, a fan of Italian food, or just good grub in general, this is the place for you. It is also a meat market carrying a full selection of different meats and chicken. In addition, you will find some excellent heat and serve meals. There is even a small but carefully chosen selection of affordable wines as well. \nThe prime steak, sausage and peppers, basil pesto chicken salad, meatballs, stuffed pork chops and Garlic, Parmesan, and Prosciutto mashed potatoes ( to die for) will make everyone's taste buds dance with delight. \nLest I forget deserts - black and white cookies (from NY of course), cannoli (made on-site), tiramisu, and cheese cake... \nJust say yes and treat yourself!
