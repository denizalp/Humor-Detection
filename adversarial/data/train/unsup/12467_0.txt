*******DO NOT TRUST OR USE THIS INCREDIBLY INCOMPETENT VET*********Absolutely horrible.  Dr. cellars treated my dog for 11 years.  About 4 years ago my dog was in a grooming accident. His eye was lacerated. He needed med for his eye for the rest of his life.  When I contacted pets mart to file a claim, Dr cellars told them there was nothing wrong with my dog. Also 6 months after filling his ongoing prescription, Dr cellars denied a refill even though the prescription was less than a year and he knew it was ongoing.  His new staff treats everyone like garbage. DO NOT USE THIS VET
