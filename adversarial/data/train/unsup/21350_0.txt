While Karve opening a location in Scottsdale may be great for me physically, it's not so great for my wallet... \n\nBut as they say, and as I believe, \"you can't put a dollar amount on your health.\" So, looks like I'll be shelling out some dollars to Karve to keep me healthy and strong!\n\nI'd taken a few Karve classes at the Mesa location, so I'm happy to have Karve access closer to home now.  The studio is beautiful.  Fresh, clean, and convenient... all factors that make me want to return.  Plus, the two classes I've taken there so far have been challenging and fun.  I took Kendra's class on a Tuesday and Casey's class on a Monday.  I was a tad bit sore from both, but a good sore... \n\nI agree with some of the other feedback about the studio not having lockers for purses, and I know showers are coming although that is not a priority for me since I live so close.  \n\nAll in all, Karve is a great way for me to cross train - i love how it combines toning and strength along with stretching for flexibility, and that it really is a full body workout.  Combine Karve class with some cardio and a healthy diet, and you'll be good to go... at least that's what I keep telling myself!\n\nHope to see some of you yelpers at class - just not so many that I can't get a reservation when I want one!
