My mother stood for 4 minutes attempting to sit down at the dining room sofa with her walker and no one came to her attention resulting in her falling forward and breaking two ribs then to not receiving a shower for 3 weeks because of the fall.. and resulting in 3 serious bed sores! Now they are telling us they cannot help her any longer!! So so sad!!! Do not put your loved one here!! Laura, the director is very convincing but the last 13 residents have been kicked out in the last 2 years! The beautiful setting is a hoax!!! This is Kivel campus of convenience!!! If your loved one is too much work for the staff they find political reasons to get rid of them and they DO get rid of them!!!! Please call or email me! I am passionate about this injustice!!
