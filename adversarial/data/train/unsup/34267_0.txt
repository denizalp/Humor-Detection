Had a great time this last weekend.  Service was prompt, our waitress was always checking on us and the band was spectacular. Some band members even mingled with the crowd during their break to get a feel for what everyone wanted to hear.which was pretty cool.\n\nJust wish you had Coca~Cola for the cocktails and not just Pepsi!
