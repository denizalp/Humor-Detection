The medical care here is the equivalent to taking your child to a county hospital. I can't afford high end, Mayo Clinic level, care for my puppy, but I know I can do better than this place. They are under staffed. They give conflicting information and give VERY bad customer service. My puppy had an umbilical hernia. The sutures were HORRIBLE! A child could have done better. They sutures are normally in for 10-14 days. I could see the healing process had progressed faster than normal. I called to get them taken out on day 7 and the receptionist refused to let the doctor see my puppy!!!!. I took him to another Vet (All Star Animal Hospital - Mayo Clinic level Care...Bell and 303). The doctor started to tell me the 10-14 I already knew...but he was much nicer than the other place. I showed him the sutures and he immediately removed them. Crossroads Towne Center is never going to see another one of my animals!!!
