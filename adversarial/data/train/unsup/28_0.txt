I came for their grand opening and was able to get a year's worth of pizza with a weekly customer punch card. Stoked.\n\nEverything I've tried here so far has been outstanding. They use boar's head meat on their sandwiches so the ingredients are quality.\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\nAngry Sicilian sandwich: A loaded sandwich that was so good I forgot to take a picture. I guess it's their signature sub. I was surprised to hear it's only 10 inches as it does look a lot bigger when you get the large...seems to dwarf a Subway foot long.\n\nMeatball sandwich: Ridiculously tasty meatballs formed to perfect size with outstanding sauce in their freshly baked bread. The meatballs have a hint of distinct seasoning that stands out from other meatballs I've had and it really works...will have to ask what it is if I run into the owner again.\n\nCustom pizza: Soft, airy crust with a hint of garlic, a little light on the cheese and sauce put probably because I loaded up on the other ingredients. If you want to add \"roasted vegetables\" don't assume it's roasted peppers or a mix of other roasted veggies, it's actually just eggplant. I'm not an eggplant fan and especially not an eggplant on pizza fan so I'll give the roasted vegetables topping a miss next time, perhaps they should call it exactly what it is: eggplant. I also opted for a ricotta cheese topping to compliment the meatballs, pepperoni and sausage and it was the light and creamy ricotta similar to what they use over at Pizza Rock, suffice to say I'm a fan of that stuff.\n\nYou can tell immediately if you have a chance to meet the owner that he is extremely involved and passionate about the food they are putting out. They are also active in giving back to the community through various charities. \n\nI'll be looking forward to many future visits this year and further down the road.
