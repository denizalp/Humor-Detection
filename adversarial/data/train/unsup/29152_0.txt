Fantastic food in a lively and fun minimalist-inspired environment. Thoroughly enjoyed my pierogies and kanapki, and my wife and I split an apple tart that was easily one of the best desserts I have ever had. Amazing and innovative cocktails. When we went I got the Riga balsam cocktail, which was probably the best mixed drink I've ever had, as well. I highly recommend that if it is still on the menu when you visit. My only complaint is that it was a little frustrating ordering at the counter. The place seems busy and fancy enough to justify not having customers order at the counter, at least for dinner service. Overall, though, 4.5\/5 stars. Will definitely be going back.
