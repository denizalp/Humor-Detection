Based on L'aura L's ROTD review, I hustled on down to AZ Mills (sans gat) with my daughter.  She had been talking about scoring some H.K. merchandise for her upcoming birthday, so the review was very timely for us.\n\nThe staff was gracious, bringing us a shopping basket, taking our big items & our Tilly's bag and (conveniently for us) storing them behind the cash register, so we could continue shopping uninhibited.\n\nI kept making a move toward the checkout counter, which would cause one of the staff to shift over to the register, and then I would turn away towards another corner of the store.  I do enjoy the occasional game of salesperson cat & mouse.\n\nWhen it came time to pay, I opted for one $1 ticket to 'the game', where my daughter walked away with the grand prize.  She loves her purchases, and we're hatching a H.K. egg in a cup of water.
