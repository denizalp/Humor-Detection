Love the food here. You can go as unhealthy or healthy as you like!\nThe meat portions could be bigger: around 5oz would be awesome.\nI think the above could go towards just about every Cafe Rio out there. For this one in particular though - I find it odd that the management allows employees to park right in front, thereby forcing patrons to park over by the bank. It's not a huge deal, but it's not how I'D run a business.
