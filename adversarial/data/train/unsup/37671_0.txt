This is the second Basil Box location and it's soo gorgeous! The food is non-dairy and gluten free, so it's perfect for me. If you are used to lighter meals, definitely do half greens, you'll thank me later. You can also mix the sauces- I did half peanut sauce \/ half tamarind. The Thai tea and lime ginger macarons are full of fresh flavours, I could eat 10+ in one sitting. The cold brew coffee hit me pretty hard, I'm usually so used to caffeine that it has no effect on me but I was pleasantly surprised. This location is central Toronto - right by the Eaton centre and Ryerson, it's worth checking out.
