$50 cover. $24 for a vodka redbull. $500+ tax to get a small table fitting maybe 4 people. Club is small in general, not enough room to feel comfortable. Bar was hard to order at, covered with people just standing around eating food. When I tried to order from a bartender who wasn't serving, she started dancing behind the bar, and another bartender who was in the middle of serving another customer a drink had to take my order. Dancers are okay (average is 7\/10) but not very personable, don't seem to like talking unless you're of a certain \"status\". Give these girls money and you'll just leave feeling as if you just got swindled. They have some good pole dancers and performers but it feels unappreciated by the end of it all. \n\nNo real reason to return to the club. Doesn't leave a person with any good memories or any good moments. Just the feeling of getting hustled. \n\nMayweather walks around and says hello but he's busy doing his thing, out of respect it's good to let him handle his business.
