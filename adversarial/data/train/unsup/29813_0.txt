I stopped in to grab a snack and use wi-fi, and they had so much to offer. The muffins are cheaper than most ($2), and there are numerous sweets and savory breads to choose from.\n\nThe location is pretty convenient, next to many cool hipster restaurants and stores; hipsters love locally made stuff, so Nova fits right in. Also, their hours are great! Open late most days, especially for a bakery.\n\nMy pumpkin muffin was pretty solid, though a tad dense and dry. I really liked the flavor, and you could see where the pumpkin batter was stirred in. If it was more moist, it would have been amazing.\n\nNova's provides a solid bite to eat, a no-frills cup of joe, and ample seating in a trendy, young district. It gives off a little bit of the \"warehouse\" feel, but that is sometimes a cool thing to have in bakeries, as opposed to \"quaint\" coffeeshops.
