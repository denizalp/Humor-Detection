I bought a house at the end of last year, Shane Barker from the Lizy Hoeffer team helped me with the loan and I could not be more pleased. I bought an Opendoor house and my situation was a little out of the ordinary but Shane and the team handled everything perfectly, despite approaching closing right around the Christmas and New Years holidays. I know I got an amazing rate and overall deal for my circumstances, but I am mostly happy about the service I received, making an otherwise extremely stressful time as painless as possible. I would absolutely recommend them to anyone needing a mortgage, and I will absolutely be using them if I ever need financing on a new house in the future.
