I'm giving this a two star rating because of the service.  First time being in the place so I ordered at the counter, when the lady asked me if I wanted it for here or to go I said here.  After placing my order I went over and had a seat waiting for my food.  After about 20 minutes she comes out with everything in a to go bag, when I said I ordered it for here the lady just looked at me with no explanation and turned around and walked away.  I thought humm that was weird.  All I can say about the food is it was ok for what it was but for sure didn't like the egg drop soup.  Couldn't understand the lady at the counter very well at all either.  She didn't speak very good English..maybe that's why she packed my food to go.
