XO Karaoke is great option for a night out with friends.\n\nYes, it's dark, yes it's a little dirty - but for $20\/hour you can party like a rock-star (and sound like one too).\n\nDrinks are reasonable, you can bring in your own food (if you dare!) and there are enough English songs that you can be entertained for a reasonable amount of time (the selection can be dated at times).\n\nI've closed the place out a few nights (4 AM?) with terrific performances - once you start signing (and drinking) you never want to stop!
