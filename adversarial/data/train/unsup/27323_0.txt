Was wanting to have Chinese take out for lunch, but all the places were too busy... I really craved Vietnamese, and didn't want to go to my usual spot because I didn't want to drive all that way... When lo and behold... The Submarine...  All I read on the signage was Vietnamese Pho, and Vermicelli...WINNER!!!  Didn't know what to expect, and it blew me away.  This is my first review, but I had to write one because its so lovingly made, by a Mom and Pop shop.  I ordered quite a bit of food and bubble tea, and everything was so Fresh and seriously well done.  Now, it did take a while for my large order, but the owner did say it would take longer.  I have to say well worth the wait, AND she gave me a hug after she packaged my meal... Oh, the SUBS are Perfect, with a hint of spice, caramelized onions, savoury cilantro.  The Bun Vermecelli was excellent as I ordered 1 of each meat for my Family to try and they all were super tasty!  Such a great find, and so close to my home...WOW!!!
