So my gf and I thought we would try this place out for lunch.  I had chosen it on a recommendation but didn't really know what to expect.  This place is LEGIT!  The second you walk in with the French music playing and the smells that just surround you, it mimics a Parisian French Bistro quite nicely.  \n\nThe food. No words can describe the food.  We shared the Provancale Crepe and Montgmarte and it was absolutely to die for.  The taste and ingredients, just perfection. \n\nThe service is the owner and its a family owned in the Seville shopping center, which makes for nice afternoon shopping to walk off the many delectable calories from lunch.\n\nDesert we got the last crepe on the menu, can't remember what it was called but it had rum and orange and it was quite possibly the best dessert I have ever had. Ever. Anywhere. \n\nGo. Check it out. You won't be sorry.
