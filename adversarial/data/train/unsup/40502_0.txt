Stay away!  Their customer service is a joke.  I booked 4 months in advance and called a week ahead to confirm that my appointment was good to go.  They told me I wasn't on the calendar!  Then I agreed to go another day at another time but then they didn't have the masseuses available for the couple's massage!  Then past all that it took 2 weeks to get a simple $99 refund.  Don't waste your time or money!
