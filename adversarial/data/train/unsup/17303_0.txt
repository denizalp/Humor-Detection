A great place to grab a brew or dinner! I've been a consistent patron of their bar for two years now. Their Happy Hour is very solid and rotating craft beers are worth checking out. Everything is perfect but wish their staff would recognize a continuing costumer for years now.. Only management remember my face and I come in frequently for both beer and food. It's always nice to feel appreciated in a local brewery. I will still Recommend you checking this place out for their delicious bar food and beer. Cheers!
