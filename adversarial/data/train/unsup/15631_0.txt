Dear Nice Folks at Snoh,\n\nIf you look into the till, you'll see that you have a lot of my cash. Not that you'd be able to tell it apart from the cash from your other loyal customers, but it's there nonetheless. Personally, I blame you all for putting in such a nice, comfy, artsy hangout spot with delicious Taiwanese-style ice. I blame you for making such delicious thai tea flavored Snoh that now I have a full-on addiction. I don't know if there's SA (Snoh Anonymous) but I'm sure if such a thing existed, I'd be on the roster. \n\nI'm a longtime customer of Cherry Blossom\/Tokyo Express and had been wondering about this new joint setting up shop next door. At the recommendation of my friends (one of whom is in the frozen yogurt biz), I came in to try Snoh and now I feel like Frosty the little freakin' Snoh-Elf. My favorite is the thai tea Snoh with boba and condensed milk (or black sesame glaze). My favorite thing is that when the the milk tea Snoh melts, BOOM! You got milk tea! It's a two-fer!\n\nAnyhoozle, thanks to the nice folks at Snoh for opening their doors just as the weather is heating up. Prep the till, gentlemen, more of my cash is going to be making its home there this Summer!
