What a lovely place!! I love how smack down in the middle of the city the commons are, surrounded by highways, construction and homeless men with needles is a little piece of tranquil paradise, WITH porta potties?!?! LOVEZ.\n\nWent here for TURF (F**K YES TORONTO - YOU GO GIRL. So proud of my city). Everyone was super friendly, the staff was probably just hired for the festival so I can't speak for whatever this place is when it's not a music venue? But as far as the festival goes, they had free water, security, +19 hand bands, the acoustics were pretty solid for an outdoor venue.\n\nGrass was green, sun was shiny, trains were hooting and we were partying in the middle of all this concrete and fast shuffling business men. Great memories, if you can see a show here I highly recommend. \n\nIf TURF is here next year, I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend. Hell, go for all 4 days it's seewwww worth it. Mingle with the hipsterest of them all. And me, fresh from my 9-5. It's lovely.\n\nThank you, Toronto. Your mayor is a fat pig but you sure know how to throw a rockin, eco-friendly outdoor jam.
