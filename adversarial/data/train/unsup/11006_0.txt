I got here before the rest of my party, so as I was waiting, I read the newspaper articles of the owner and the restaurant they had hung up. Got me excited for my meal and I was right to be. Service was great right off the bat, and the restaurant has a colorful, welcoming interior. The kofte that I ordered was fantastic. Usually the problem I have with kofte is that it is overcooked. However, the five pieces of kofte I had here were very tender and seasoned really well. Highly recommend! However, boyfriend's lamb shank (which was a special that day) was just okay and tasted like it was just microwaved before being served. Although it was only $16, it came in a really small portion. Next time, he'll probably just go for the lamb chops. \n\nTaste | 4\nAtmosphere | 3.5\nPresentation | 3\nService | 4\nOVERALL | 3.5
