Great food and vibe. Five stars on the fried chicken (wow), shrimp and grits, short ribs (my wife loved the caulifower mashed potatoes), mac and cheese, and crispy brussel sprouts. Solid wine selection too. Props to AJ Gonzales and his staff. We'll be back. Try it once, but play it safe and make reservations.
