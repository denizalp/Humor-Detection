Okay, this was my first strip club, so I don't have anything to compare this place to. However, I think it was a great place to cut my teeth, so to speak. The dancers are decent-looking, and could stand to put on 10 or 15 pounds. I was truly amazed by the pole-dancing and bleached anuses; these girls are committed to and are good at what they do. The only turn-off was the bored expressions on some of their faces. It's like, I get that you're so over flashing your gash at strangers every day, but can you fake it for me, please? How about for my $4? The biggest disappointment was not being offered a lapdance by any of the girls combing the floor. I guess they assume that females aren't interested or won't pay as much. I must admit that my private dance was the highlight of my visit, even though I had to ask one of the dancers for it. (Her name was Mirage...sigh.) Also, I have to compliment their use of props on the stage. One girl came out in a Grim Reaper outfit, complete with sickle. It was a little strange seeing her doing her thing on the pole whilst sporting a hood that covered her whole head. Another girl dressed up in a fireman-inspired bodysuit and sat on a Fischer Price firetruck going \"Nee-ner-nee-ner-nee-ner!\" (like the siren?) while another dancer wheeled her around the stage. Hilarious. We were there until 5 am.\nOverall I think I'd visit this place again if I happen to be in Vegas. Some of the dancers seemed friendly and kind of sweet, and the DJ's pretty witty if you listen closely. Just stick with the free soda and water, and tip the help.
