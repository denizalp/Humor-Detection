The northside of town is notorious for fast food chains and other quick-eat type of eateries, with only a handful of mom-and-pop restaurants sprinkled throughout the area. Tokyo Cafe brings a bit of what's offered to Chinatown without the 15-20 minute drive. \n\nTonkotsu: Generous amounts of thick noodles, slices of chashu, a soft boiled egg, slices of green onions, and an over abundance of bamboo shoots bathed in a hot, milky-colored broth. Although the broth had that oily fattiness, its flavor didn't have depth. \n\nMiso: The miso ramen that my boyfriend ordered was reminiscent to a shoyu ramen with a richer, saltier flavor.\n\nGyoza: Our bill was over $25, so we received complimentary gyoza, which makes for a good shareable appetizer. \n\nIf ramen and gyoza aren't your thing, there are also other items on the menu, such as a variety of curries. \n\nI have to give props to the service. The staff here works incredibly hard to run this establishment and keep patrons happy. \n\nTokyo Cafe is worth the try if you're in the area looking for something to eat that isn't at a chain restaurant.
