Another Winterlicious journey to one of Susur Lee's restaurants- Luckee! It's a Chinese restaurant and bar located near the Rogers Centre. When you walk in, the décor was amazing for Chinese New Years. Lots of nice decorations. It's quite the beautiful restaurant. The kitchen is open-concept so you can see through the class what the chefs are making for you. This was my second time here and here I am again for Winterlicious.. The menu this time around is pretty much the same when I went here a few years ago. We first started off ordering an appetizer and a main entrée. We ordered Chicken Cheung Fun (8PC) (rice roll with tofu, ginger, green onion & soya juice). It was beautifully presented and quite flavorful and delicious. This one cost $12. For the main entrée to share, we ordered Yunnan Fried Vermicelli with crab meat, black pepper & egg. For me, it tasted rather peppery but it was okay. There was nothing unique about the dish though. For the Winterlicious menu, my friends and I basically the order the same dishes. We started off with the Lucky basket which had long xia gow, siu mai, steamed spinach & chinese celery dumpling. I liked every dim sum in this basket but my favorite one was the Siu Mai with the scallop. It was quite good. For the entrée we ordered a Peking Duck. It was beautifully presented on the plate and it looked too good to eat. The duck was nicely cooked and quite delicious even though it was only a few pieces of it. To wrap up our meal, we got the Trio of Desserts Mango & Passion Fruit Panna Cotta, Coconut Foam, Chocolate Sponge Roll, Raspberry Coulis and Sesame Rice Donut, Dark Chocolate Sauce. You can never go wrong with dessert and I found all 3 of them good. Overall, a great dining experience at one of Susur Lee's restaurants. Nice décor and friendly staff. Food was awesome despite being on the upscale side of dim sum dishes. Would definitely highly recommend this restaurant to others.
