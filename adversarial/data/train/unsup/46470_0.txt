Tasty food, lousy service. I had one of the pizzas (\"The Bitter\") and one of the pastas (\"Canestria alla Vodka\"). Both were very good.\n\nI didn't have a reservation, and I appreciated that they squeezed me in (at the counter overlooking the open kitchen), but then they essentially forgot I was there. I waited almost 30 minutes to place my order. I thought about leaving, but had limited time, and had already committed to the spot. I turned all the way around in my chair and caught the server's eye a few times before she finally came over, with no acknowledgment or apology for the incredibly long wait. \n\nFood-wise, It reminded me somewhat of Frankies in Brooklyn (which is a compliment), except the service there is warm and attentive (probably one of the few times New York will beat Canada in this category!).
