Just not a big fan of food on the Vegas Strip - too fancy, too pretentious and of course too expensive.  Cleo is an exception to the rules.\n\nLocated in the SLS Hotel (formerly the Sahara) in the DMZ between the Strip and Fremont Street, this restaurant did turn out to be a rather pleasant surprise.  And Eastern Mediterranean tapas (Greek, Lebanese, Turkish) is a very nice break from the norm, so a welcome change of tastes.\n\nSmall plates which our server recommended four per person to start.  And with five diners - a lot of sampling was going on.  The menu is a bit limited, but enough to choose from and have a well rounded sampling of the cuisines.  Standouts included - a delicious Babaganoush, really good hummus with tahini, the Lebabeh, yogurt, spankopita - all very good.  A variety of bold but not overwhelming flavors and spices that complimented but did not battle each other.  One other standout - the potato latkes - I like a good latke, these were really good.  \n\nA nice Harira soup - great tomato base with lentils and veggies and a decent Greek salad.  And really good bread for dipping - fresh and hot.\n\nOnly disappointment - the falafel.  Dry, kind of bland, Just not at the same level as all the other dishes we had. Odd.  \n\nA word of advice - order no more than three plates per person to start,  You can always add on as you go and not wonder where all this food is coming from and why it keeps coming to the table.
