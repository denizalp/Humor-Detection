Worst service ever! I had the most rude waiter you could ask for. He talked back and gossiped with other customers and ignored the ones he didn't like. The food was pretty good and even though the quantity was not as large as the other buffets it was pretty good for the price. Even though the waiting staff sucked the food wasn't bad.
