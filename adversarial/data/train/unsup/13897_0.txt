This isn't a TTC station.  It's obviously a church; \n\nOUR LADY OF PERPETUAL CONSTRUCTION.  \n\nI have watched the \"progress\" of the retrofit on this station and the only thing that moves regularly is completion date of the various sub-projects.  Of course, even that doesn't happen on a timely basis - they didn't change the completion date from end of April 2011 until mid-May.  They finally gave up specificity and went with \"End of Summer\"  We'll really be chuckling about that one when while we shake the snow off of our boots, won't we?
