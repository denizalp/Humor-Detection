If you're anywhere near the area, you need to stop here.  And by \"near the area\", I mean within 30 minutes (having driven down from Charlotte, myself)\n\nFantastic sauces, great people, and usually something new to try every time.  Ended up taking home some of their Lemon Pepper Jelly this time.  AMAZING!
