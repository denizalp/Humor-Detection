Of course I have to review this place since they have such an awesome name.  We had a group dinner for 8 on a Friday night.  The food was fresh, really tasty sushi, miso, drinks, etc.  No complaints.  Atmosphere was really beautiful, as is the rest of the Wynn.  Andrea's had a very 60's Vegas feel yet updated and modern.  Great service, just a great experience from beginning to end.  Loved people watching, despite my husband being very distracted by a likely 21 year old with her boobs literally \"sitting\" on the table next to us.  Great night with great friends!
