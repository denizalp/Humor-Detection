A+ for AAA Army Surplus! You are a fun place to visit, and you seem to be making a comeback. \n\nOnce upon a time when I was doing my undergrad, I would get my canvas side bags (green, not brown) and Doc Martin-like winter boots (black, not brown) here. I've been back a few times in recent months, and it's still a really fun place to get lost in, and the ol' surplus store is again attracting all the cool kids. \n\nWondering where those good looking boys in Parkdale get their Navy pea coats? Here! Wondering where your super-stylish best friend got her long chain with a bullet on it? Here! Wondering where you can get a gas mask for god knows what? That's at The Gap. Just kidding! It's here.\n\nPEPPER POINTS for the service. I was with one of those good looking boys buying a pea coat here recently and the staff was really helpful with him (I was less so), they even cut open the pockets and back threads before we left so he could wear it out of the store. Fine form.
