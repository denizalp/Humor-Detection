They must have gotten our address\/phone by purchasing the data or open source because they called us initially for a promotion and we had never contacted them before. However, they had an address for us from 3-4 years ago. \n\nThe first appointment the technician couldn't wait 15 minutes for me to pick up my kids from school despite the fact he was early. Understandable, so we rescheduled.\n\nNext appointment, they went to our old address from 3-4 years ago (not sure how they got that address; bought the data?), even through I confirmed our new address when rescheduling. They were pretty late for even that appointment so we rescheduled the next day. \n\nThen the final appointment they called me back towards the end of the appointment window and asked to reschedule for later in the afternoon. After taking time off work, rearranging my schedule for these appointments and standing by at home for 2-3 hours at a time, I was done with them. \n\nI can't speak for the service or technicians, but there seems to be a major dispatching\/scheduling problem. To their benefit they did offer a free service after the first missed appointment, then offered free one year service for second missed appointment and after this third appointment issue I decided I couldn't waste anymore time and declined everything. Friendly enough people on the phone though.
