Dear Roka Akor, \n\nIs it ok if i just call you Roka? I feel that we are on a 'first-name' basis now. It was just recently, that I met you...but you came into my world like a whirlwind...i hope you can look past the fat rolls that are inevitably going to form. \n\nEvery meeting has been amazing, but the last time was unlike anything I've ever experienced. \n\nIt was Valentine's Day and you had a romantic evening planned for me. Even though I've had experiences with tasting menus (wink wink), yours was by far the best. \n\nButterfish Tataki with White Asparagus \nKumomoto Oyster with Yuzu \nSashimi Selection \nLobster Miso Soup with Wakame \nYuzu Marinated Black Cod w\/ Robata Grilled Asparagus with Sweet Soy \nCreekstone Prime Filet and Chili Ginger Sauce w\/ Robata Grilled Mushrooms with Soy Garlic Butter \nJapanese Wild Mushroom Risotto \nDouble Chocolate Ganache Cake \n\nEverything was delicious. You even made me like mushrooms! \n\nI was full, content and happy. \n\nThen it happened - you wanted me to pay?! 79 bucks? AND I had to tip you? I thought I was special...that we had something!!! \n\nIt's ok though. You were worth every penny. And even though you make me feel a little dirty and very guilty, I can't wait to meet with you again. \n\nPassionately, \n\nJana
