After a morning of fun, Sylvia Q suggested that our group should go to Kathy's. At first I was thinking she was talking about going to my place to eat leftovers from Thanksgiving. Oops!\n\nI really wanted to try the chicken but Sylvia said the ribs here are good too. What a dilemma! Good thing I was able to negotiate with a good friend for us to share the chicken dinner and the ribs dinner...the best of both worlds. Then there was a debate as to what sides to get then my tastebuds told me I should have fried pork chop instead. After all that, I got so thirsty for some sweet tea. The dinners come with 2 sides and cornbread for $11-19.\n\nDespite the starvation, we were laughing and telling jokes the whole time we were there until the food came. The whole restaurant got quiet quick. The food was THAT amazing.\n\nCornbread:\nThere's not too many places that wowed me with their cornbread. It's up to you to put butter and honey on your cornbread. It was cornbread...nothing unusual. 3\/5\n\nMac n Cheese:\nI dislike runny and soupy mac n cheese. Kathy's wasn't. It was thick, creamy and the cheese sticks to the macaroni. 4\/5\n\nMashed Potatoes and Gravy:\nMade with real potatoes. You'll come across some bits of potatoes. The gravy was pretty tasty. 4\/5\n\nRibs:\nThis is the wet saucy kind and not the dry-rub kind of ribs. A little spicy and a little sweet. The meat was easy to get off the bone with my fork and knife. 3.5\/5\n\nFried Chicken:\nYou get 3 pieces of breaded and fried chicken. They're not heavily-breaded and are seasoned well. No salmonella-scare here either as each piece is cooked to perfection until the breading\/skin turns golden brown. You get a leg, thigh and breast. The skin...oh my! I had to close my eyes and savor how good it was. 5\/5\n\nThe food is made fresh and you can tell that it was made as if they were feeding their own family. So, the food takes a while. You don't rush good things.\n\nTuesday to Friday you can get their fried chicken sandwich until 5pm but on any day you can get fried catfish, fried pork chop, hotlinks or BBQ spareribs. The dinners are fried catfish, fried chicken, smothered pork chop, fried pork chop, smothered chicken, oxtails, chitterlings, meatloaf, chicken fried steak, shrimp etouffe or gumbo. The sides you can choose from are cabbage, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, black eyed peas, rice, coleslaw, red beans, fries, potato salad or peas. They have family meals with 16 pieces of chicken and sides to-go only. They have chicken fingers. For dessert they have banana pudding, peach cobbler and sweet potato pie.
