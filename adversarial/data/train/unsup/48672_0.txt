Incredible. The food was really good, maybe the best lentil soup I've ever had. It was made fast and looked just as good as it tasted. We liked the the place right away when we walked in. Very clean and their core values are written right on the wall. After we left we looked the place up online to learn more about them. This is where we fell in LOVE with Choolaah. And they are doing just what they are setting out to do. I hope and pray others follow their example. Thank you Choolaah!
