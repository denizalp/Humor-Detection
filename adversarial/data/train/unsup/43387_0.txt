Deer Garden used to be my favorite noodle place.  I think their soup bases are better than other noodle places of its type (make-your-own noodle). Since it's a fish soup base, do expect a slight fish smell and flavour.  The other options such as pepper soup is really peppery - almost too much.  I really like their pumpkin soup variation.  Also, I like that noodles by default already come with cabbage and greens.  \n\nHowever, I cannot bring myself to come here as often as I'd like due to their bad service. This place is very busy and very little staff.  You will never get any staffs' attention - getting extra napkins, ordering extra sides, wrong drink, getting the bill.  With the amount of business they are getting, I hope they can afford to hire more staff.
