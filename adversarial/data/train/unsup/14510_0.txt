i dont have good things to say about them... i had a salesman come over and tell me all the things that were wrong with my a\/c and then give me a proposal for 7 grand.  the funniest thing was that it was my a\/c was only 4 years old.  i was trying to figure out what i could do in order to be more efficent for the summer.  \n\nso as to keep them in check i asked my normal a\/c guy over to let me know what i can do.  turns out that i re insulated parts of my cealing... put in fans and added some shades... all much cheaper then a whole system.  i feel that the person i dealt with only wanted to sell me something.  by the end of the hour that i dealt with him i realized that he was taking fake measurements in order to kill time and act like he was doing something.\n\nif you are gullible don't use these guys.  they will try to take advantage of you!
