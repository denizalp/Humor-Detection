Not only is Maria the BEST tailor in town, she is simply a wonderful person. You will not be disappointed.\n\nI brought my very expensive chiffon bridesmaids dress in to her that needed to be taken in about 4 inches around the bust\/hemmed. While I realized the dress was way too big, I didn't realize that this was probably a mistake on the company who provided me the dress. Long story short, Maria advised me to contact the company and have them pay for the alterations - her logic was why take the measurements if they're not going to follow them. She was right. I was able to get the company to cover some of the alterations.\n\nOnto the dress - I actually received comments at the wedding that my dress was clearly altered the best in comparison to the other bridesmaids. Honestly, you couldn't even tell that anything had been touched. I highly highly recommend bringing in any and all of your clothing that needs to be altered. She is truly amazing!
