How strange is this place? Very.\n\nHas an empty, half-finished feel, despite being a month old or so. They sure have their priorities straight, tho: dripping with TVs, every angle, every corner. \n\nChimay's on tap here, but it's 7 bucks, so most are ordering the 2 dolla Bud Lights. And poking at the non-functional slot machines. And making jokes about the mirrored trays, snort snort. \n\nService was a tad icy, but efficient. No idea who the imagined patrons are - some Vegas ex-pat in need of a good beer while basking in the lights of the slots? Whitecaps on game night? Mysterious.
