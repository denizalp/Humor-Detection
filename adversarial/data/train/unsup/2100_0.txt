The first time we came here I was astonished. The food was great, service was on par and the atmosphere was good enough. Now....I'd rather spend my money elsewhere. \n\nThe second time we came in for some drinks and appetizers with my parents the service was so bad that I had to put away my OWN menu..after 30 minutes of it sitting in my face and taking up all my space when there was food to eat, I was sick of it. So I put it back...during that entire night I had to round up our server 3 times in order to get her to do anything. Either they were understaffed of she just didn't care...either of which I could believe. The drinks were weak, but the salsa was good so I continued to give it another chance.\n\nThe last time I went in I was disgusted. We sat again in the dinning area and underneath my place mat was old, dried up food from someone else. I didn't order a drink as I have found that the drinks just aren't made correctly. I ordered my favorite from the first time, the chipotle chicken nachos. It was DISGUSTING this time. Some of the chicken was cold, the sauce was gloppy and all together it just didn't taste right.
