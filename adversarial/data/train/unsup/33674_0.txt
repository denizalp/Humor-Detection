I ordered my daughter's birthday cake a week before her party via phone.  The order was for a barbie cake where the barbie was vertical and the cake looked like her dress (a pretty standard cake, they said they do all the time).  Everything seemed great.  I went to pick up the cake and the doll in it was not barbie.  It was a mini knock off doll of some sort.  I asked the girl why it wasn't barbie and she seemed confused.  She called Yvette who told her that I knew it wasn't going to be Barbie.  We went back and forth over he said she said with her convinced that I agreed to a non barbie doll.  This was absolutely not the case.  By this point, we had been arguing for 10 minutes when I finally asked to speak to Yvette myself.  she got on the phone and was instantly defensive.  She did not display an ounce of customer service I would expect a small business to have.  She said that I had been into the bakery and approved this cake myself.  I told her that was absolutely false as I had never been in that bakery before.  I told her I wanted a discount on the cake as it was not what we had ordered.  She told me \"no, don't take the cake if you don't like it\".  This was 2 hours before the party!  She knew I didn't have a choice in the matter, I had to take the cake.  She eventually gave me $10 off (oh wow, a whole $10!) but it was not without 15 minutes of arguing and horrible customer service on Yvette's part.  All in all, my bad review is not because of the wrong cake (mistakes happen) but it's because of Yvette's completely rude behavior, unapologetic response, and her unwavering belief and false information that I had come in to her store and approved this mistake myself.  Unacceptable in my opinion.  \n\nJust be careful when you order there.  The cake was good, but it wasn't what we ordered and they did nothing to remedy that.
