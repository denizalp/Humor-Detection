My friends\/coworkers arrived here around 12 (right when it opened, we were literally waiting for the open sign to light up) and were seated immediately since we were the first ones there. Echo Sushi has not adopted the iPad ordering system so we used paper to record what we wanted. All the rolls and tempura were delicious. The food came out quickly and surprisingly (contradictory to other reviews), there was not a ton of rice with the sushi.\n\nOne note is that the potato and corn cake will catch you by surprise. Try it and you'll understand what I mean.\n\nThe desserts are limited, we were the first to order our ice creams but they already ran out of the red bean flavour for the day (which is a staple for all you can eat sushi restaurants)! I do like how they incorporated fried bananas and kiwi which I haven't seen before. Makes your dessert a little more fruity.\n\nAlmost everything was delicious and it was around $24 per person with tax and tips for their lunch AYCE menu.\n\nNote: they only accept cash and credit, no debit. If you have debit, they'll direct you to the nearest bank\/ATM and trust that you come back. I say if you don't have a friend to help you out, definitely bring cash\/credit!
