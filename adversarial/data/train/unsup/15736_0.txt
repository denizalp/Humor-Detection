So, I recently get an e-mail form Miranda at Yelp. She informs me that my recent review of this Mr. Hero restaurant had been \"removed\". The reason why? \n\nTheir \"Support Team\" \"determined\" that my original review \"lacks a substantive firsthand experience.\"\n\nMy original review, censored, but unedited, read as follows:\n\nHIM: \"You want some cheese sauce boss?\"\n\nME: \"I don't need your f*****g sales pitch.\"\n\nHIM: \"I'm just doing my job, boss.\" \n\nClearly, Miranda from San Fransisco has never visited this particular Mr. Hero restaurant in beautiful Strongsville, Ohio. But, since I want to give Miranda as ultimate an experience as possible, allow me to reciprocate with an updated review that possesses a little more substantive firsthand experience.\n\nNothing beats a Romanburger. Nothing. And, when I am back home I always need to get me a couple. So, I go to the Mr. Hero on Pearl Road.\n\nIt was late. The maniac that appears to run the place is a rotund, foreign man. He is dark with even darker bags under dark eyes. All I wanted was the biggest Romanburger they offered. I made it as simple as possible for him, but he insisted on calling me \"Boss\".\n\nI hate that.\n\nHis every move was aggressive, but I kind of understood it. He was, after all, about to serve me a 14 inch Romanburger sandwich. Sure, currency had been exchanged, but in the end, he was doing me the favor. But he keeps calling me \"Boss.\"\n\nAnd then the bird gets burned. Hence, the original review.\n\nHIM: \"You want some cheese sauce boss?\"\n\nME: \"I don't need your f*****g sales pitch.\"\n\nHIM: \"I'm just doing my job, boss.\" \n\nIf you've ever eaten here, you understand. So, as far as \"substantive firsthand experience\" is concerned, I hope you love me now, Miranda.\n\nFor those who have never visited the Greater Cleveland area, a (7 inch) Romanburger is this:\n\n\"Two juicy grilled burgers topped with melted Swiss American cheese, grilled Genoa Salami and Italian Luncheon loaf served on a bed of shredded lettuce with tomatoes, onions, a sprinkle of Mr. Hero's original oil'n spice and topped with our own special recipe mayonnaise - served on a hearth baked Italian roll.\"\n\nThe cheese sauce is actually a great dipping side for the Wafer Fries they offer. \n\nFirsthand. Substantive. Miranda.
