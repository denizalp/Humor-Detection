I stopped in here just before the week of Christmas. They surprised me with quite a few really fresh options.  I ended up buying a chicken Cesar Salad, as well as a flourless Chocolate cake. The Salad was amazing. I am not one to say that about a salad. But, this one was great. It could of had a bit more dark green lettuce, as well as a few less spines in it. But, the cheese was really good, very flavorful. Plus, it had shredded Chicken in it as well.  \nThe Chocolate cake was rich and very good. I could not even eat it all. Great food, they have really upped the ante as they say.\nGreat place to stop into in Terminal 4.
