I'm ecstatic! I found my new go to restaurant!!! I loved the casual atmosphere, the friendly staff, the prices and of course, the food here is delightful!!!!\n\nWe came early enough to take advantage of happy hour and I first ordered the Strawberry Bellini. It was sweet and perfect! Then we ordered the bruschetta board: the one with the avocado, the one with the ricotta and the one with the goat cheese. It was really good and I enjoyed every bite. Then we shared the Cavatelli Carbonara and that too was delicious! We were so happy that we wanted more! \n\nSo we decided to order shishito peppers and one prime rib slider. After a few bites, we were stuffed and completely satisfied. When we finally received the check, we were surprised to only spend around $50, which included two alcoholic drinks. We will be definitely come back! This is a great place to bring a group of friends and hang out!
