I am in the process of switching from Skank of America so I opened an account here. The service here is very friendly and personalized and unlike a big corporate bank, most of my requests are greeted with a yes and more often than not, are handled and carried out by a friendly associate as opposed to being told how I can go home and do it myself online.\n\nAlso, there seems to NEVER be a crowd at this location so I am usually in and out in 5 minutes instead of waiting in a long line for one of two tellers to look after me. A very refreshing banking experience
