Easily one of the best cheap meals involving chicken I've ever eaten. \n\nThere are two lines, one for order and the other was for pre-order. I had to use Google translate to figure that out. My gf and I got there around 7PM and the line up was long but moved steadily, took about 15 minutes to reach the front with around 8 people ahead of us.\n\nOrdered the half chicken(spicy) with fries and salad for $9.75. Got to the hotel and opened up the container and was in shock at how much fries there were. The chicken was moist and flavourful and the fries were a bit soggy but pretty good over all. The hot sauce was not spicy but had a nice taste to it.\n\nOverall we were very pleased with the meal and would definitely go there again when we get a chance.
