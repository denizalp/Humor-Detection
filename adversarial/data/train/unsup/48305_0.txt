Angel fixed my sons car when it was broken down in front of our house. He was able to tow it himself and get it back on the road for a good price.  He also just replaced my timing belt on my Toyota.  Excellent work, honest and hard working guy. I've had trouble finding an honest mechanic since moving to Vegas six years ago. If you've had that problem too, this is your guy!
