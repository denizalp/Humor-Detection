I absolutely love places that cater to a healthy lunch crowd without the lack of menu creativity. And ChopShop does it just right. \n\nJuices, smoothie bowls, rice bowls, salads, wraps, whatever you want, they have! I opted for the raw vegetable salad, which is just PACKED with, you guessed it--veggies. I also loved the salty crunch of the pistachios. I also added shrimp on top, which was a delish addition. All the veggies tasted fresh, minus the tomatoes. But those are fruit anyways, right? Haha. The dressing was just okay. I feel like I make better vinaigrettes at home, without the punch of sweetness. \n\nChopShop is a fast\/casual concept. You order from the menu, sit down, and they'll bring you your food. Which such a vast menu of options and ability to customize, I would have liked the opportunity to sit and look at the options a little more--especially for the first time. So my tip would be to step aside to pick something before you get in line.
