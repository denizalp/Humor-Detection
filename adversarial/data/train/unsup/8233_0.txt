Pressure sales tactics and totally overblown assessment and costs. Contacted them to do a maintenance check on the Central AC before summer. Serviceman was nice and was willing to talk to both my wife and I on the phone. Over the phone he was incoherent at times in his explanation and was unwilling to give simple options. His range was from a $600 patch that \"could fail within a month\" to a full replacement quoted at minimum $7,000 (which is insane compared to other companies). I clearly told both him and the manager who called later to give me until the following Monday to review the options and crunch the numbers. The next day I had another call from the office pressuring me to schedule the repair. Again, I said call me Monday. Within 15 minutes the same person called my wife's phone and tried pressuring her to commit to a service. The caller then said that I was being very inconsiderate when I got on the phone and said not to call again until Monday, as I told them 3 times before and that it's totally irresponsible when she just got an answer from me to try to circumvent me.\n\nBy the way, it's Monday and they never called back. I've already had another company come out and find none of the issues Gillece identified were problems, but did find another part that was clearly in need of replacement. Fun fact, as soon as I told the other guy the story he immediately knew it was Gillece without any prompting.
