I just recently had my wedding at Wedgewood Stallion Mountain on October 12, 2014 and I can't say enough good things about this place. Kendall and Megan were amazing to work with. They made everything so simple and worry free. Kendall really went out of her way to make my wedding day special. The vendors are out of control phenomenal. DJ Murphy will seriously blow your mind with his incredible DJ skills and entertainment. He played ALL the songs I wanted and always followed up with me about what I wanted to happen during the wedding, he even took pictures for us and gave us the SD Card. Exotic Florist did an incredible job with the flowers. They even spray painted my vases gold for me to match with my colors. You could tell how much work they put into the flowers, the details were outstanding. The owner of the shop was even there setting up my flowers the day of the wedding which shows their true dedication to making your wedding personal. Now for Freed's Bakery - Although I didn't really eat any cake at the wedding, when we went tasting, it was SO delicious. They didn't just make us pick 1 flavor, we got to choose 3 flavors with choices of fillings. If you get the package that includes honeymoon suite, DO IT! The view was insane and the room is huge with a Jacuzzi tub right in the middle. It was so nice to soak in the tub after the wedding before we flew to Cancun the next morning for our honeymoon. Like I said earlier, I really can't say enough good things about Wedgewood. My wedding day was perfect and yours will be too!
