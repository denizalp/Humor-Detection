Very professional and very affordable!\n\nI called Dodge Electric 2 weeks ago because I needed 3 new fans installed. 1 of the 3 fans I need a whole new box installed where there was never a fan before. \n\nWhen I called, they actually answered their phone and were professional. They quickly sent an electrician out to our home and provided a firm quote.\n\nMy Expectations: I don't just hire a company, I hire people who I expect to be professional and skilled. \n\nMy Experience: Today 2 electricians showed up (on time as promised) to install all 3 fans which took about 3 hours. Both the men were actually friendly, professional, and clean cut. I was impressed that they were so clean on the job and did not give me any regret on allowing them into my home. I've hired contractors in the past that were trashy and unprofessional.\n\nDodge Electric actually understands how to hire QUAILTY PEOPLE who you can trust in your home to get the job done right... the first time. \n\nPROS: Very affordable. Very professional. Licensed, Bonded, and Insured through the Arizona Registrar of Contractors.\n\nThank you and I'll be referring others your way!
