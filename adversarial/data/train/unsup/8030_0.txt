Ordered a pizza for delivery using their online ordering system. 2 hours went by, and no pizza came and no one called. I finally called them, and they said we were out of their delivery zone and that our order would have to be refunded. (We are 1.3 miles away.) That would have been great to know 2 hours ago.
