Happy Dog was probably the ideal spot for a college student--open late, fast, filling and cheap, and they serve alcohol. This is not to say that only college students can enjoy it, but it definitely accompanied me many times when I was craving food in the AM.\n\nThe Food:\n+Dogs ($6): even though it is technically a hot dog, it really doesn't feel like you're eating one after you add all the crazy toppings you want. Despite the seemingly random mix of toppings to choose from, somehow it never seems to really clash in a bad way. I would hesitatingly suggest that sometimes less is more, and not overdo the toppings. Also, try to add some of the fresh toppings, which help your food from getting too heavy.\n+Tots\/Fries ($4): as a french fry lover, it is rare for me to say this, but skip the fries and stick with tots. They are hot and crispy, and they give such a generous portion that it is sometimes hard to finish it off, even when you're sharing.\n+Sauces: Get as many as you want on the side for both your dog and the tots! It can be hard to tell which is which since they come out all at once, but that just adds to the fun. I just tend to stick with the Roasted Garlic Aioli.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that they often have bands playing here, so you'll have to pay a cover charge to get in. You can still order to-go though.\n\nOverall, Happy Dog isn't any mind-blowing experience, but it is fun, and so affordable too. Definitely check it out if it seems like something you're interested in!
