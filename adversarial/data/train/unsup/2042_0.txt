Went here a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised! I didn't think it would be so nice. A cute patio, perfect for an October evening. Service was good, and lots of vegetarian options I could have! The entrees were a little pricey, but the appetizers weren't bad, so we got appetizers as our meal! I got a cheese plate and omg so good. It came with noble bread, 5 different cheeses, honey, and grapes. I couldn't even finish it haha but I loved the variety and you could tell all of the cheeses were great quality. I'd love to come back and try a drink sometime. Really awesome place!
