Bottomless brunch!  Very cute place to have lunch\/brunch.  Food was great: we had the cocoa puff French toast and the breakfast sandwich.  Surprisingly, the French toast was not as sweet as I expected, which was perfect for me.  The food and service was great and I would highly recommend this place.
