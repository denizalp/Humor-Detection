I was unsure when I first saw the place--I mean, from the outside it doesn't look like anything special.  Going in didn't change that impression.  And Asian Mexican fusion? But one bite of the jade red chicken and cuban beans and I was hooked.  I love this place.  The atmosphere is cafeteria type but  the food and  the snickerdoodles more then compensate for that.  It's all good.
