I recently went here to see if I could swap my newish car in for a newer car.  I didn't have much of a wait to talk to a salesperson.  Plus what's the harm at just looking?  \n\nThere must be something in a car salesmen that they are able to ignore everything you say.\n\n\"I like the Cruze.\" translated to \"You should try the Sonic.\"\n\"I want power windows.\" translated to \"$2,000 extra.\"\n\"I don't want a higher payment than what I already am paying.\" translated to \"Your payment will be more.\"\n\nI feel like I need to take a negotiator with me in order to get my point across at a place like this.\n\nPlus I didn't want advice on my credit score, but thanks for making a pitch for your buddy's debt reduction program.
