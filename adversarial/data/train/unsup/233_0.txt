12-30-2017 UPDATE\n\nWell it's the next day and the car they said they  sold 2 days ago is STILL on their site. I work in digital media and know it takes about 30 seconds to remove an item from a website. So I leave this question. If this was an \"honest mistake\" then WHY is that car still on your site now that it being 3 DAYS from when it was \"Sold\" and more than 18 hours after the manager stated he would pull this car off their site immediately. I ask you to read NRS 490.410 which covers this topic about misleading or inaccurate information \"ie. Bait and Switch\" is prohibited in the State of Nevada and anywhere else in the USA for that matter.\n\nAll I wanted was to get a nice and good priced car for my wife. I didn't cause this... Findlay Kia of Las Vegas did.\n\n12-29-2017\nTerrible. Tyler neglected to tell us that the car we wanted was sold 2 DAYS ago. I'm guessing that is his standard practice to lure people and then bait and switch. The management was very apologetic but seriously after Tyler's dishonesty I cannot continue my purchase process there. I'm a kia owner too. What a shame. I'd fire him if I was in charge as I'm 100 percent certain this is his method
