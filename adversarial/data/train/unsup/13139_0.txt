This is the worst pizza I've literally ever eaten. The worst. The crust tastes like a dry biscuit from KFC that someone put some old tomatoes on. I honestly would rather have Domino's or Pizza Hut.\n\nI think I know the issue, though - they are one of very few pizza places that have truly gluten-free pizza, and we have a few folks in our family who are gluten-free, so I totally get it that those folks need pizza too. But the issue is that gluten-free bread of any kind just doesn't usually taste very good. Ask any gluten-free person and they will tell you the same. And even the regular pizzas here taste like they're gluten-free! It's like, listen folks, when I want pizza I want literally all the gluten you can throw my way. Bring on the week-long bloating and the tummy troubles!\n\nSo to sum it up: this place is a solid one star for anyone who is not gluten-free. It's probably a lot better for people who are, and who don't have the option for real pizza deliciousness.
