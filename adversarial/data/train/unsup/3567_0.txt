I said let's go somewhere else but I wasnt buying so I had no choice. Ahhhh TGIF on a Saturday night about 8pm not too bad we got right in w a party of 4 +2 kid's. Our server Morgan did a great job considering the kids bothering her every min and my hub being a complete jerk. He was kidding but not everyone knows his humor and usually its not very funny. If I was his waiter I'd be pissed luckily my generous friend made up for her hassle in the tip. \n\nFood is consistently good here I have been maybe 3x all not my choice. Eagc time has been a pain free experience. The men seem to like the meat in the Jack Daniels sauce. I tried the Ahi Tuna burger's they are cute little burgers it came w some salad and some funky sauce that wasnt too memorable. See pics. Great place to take picky kids they will even serve them baby ribs can you feel the excitement of how fun this could be!?!?!
