Having not planned on Guy Savoy being quite as expensive for bar bites as we thought, we popped in here for dinner instead.\n\nThis place is around $13-$25 for entree, and $9-$16 for appetizers.\n\nThe portions are HUGE!  I mean  EPICALLY huge!\n\nWe ordered normally, Appetizer for the table.  Either two appetizers or an entree per person for main eating.  We could have easily ordered 2\/3 less food and still had left overs.\n\nBest Free Bread Bowl-Pretzel bun, cheesy bun, zucchini bread.  All warm and delicious.  \nWhopper Milk Shake-To die for.  Balanced candy + milk shake perfection.  Comes in oversized glass for maximum calories.\nOnion Rings-Mountain of Beer battered, pipping hot, perfectly salted, oniony goodness.  Came with great dipping aolis.\nFrench Onion Soup-big enough to swim in.  Not overly salty, good onion flavor, high quality cheese and crouton on top.\nCrab Cakes-Liked the avocado citrus salad with the cake.  Went together great.  A bit to dense though.  Could have done with one not two cakes.\nClam Chowder- A little bit off.  Definitely too sweet.\nPrime Rib- Came with so much fat it needed lipo.  But other than that, this half a cow looked fantastic. \n\nService was good, though unusually slow.  Good thing we left early for dinner, since we would have been late for our shows otherwise.\n\nThis is some solid and GIGANTICALLY portioned Vegas eats.
