The employees here are a bunch of idiots. Not very helpful at all. I had a 20% off coupon that I received in my email and the cashier refused to honor it. It says spend 10.00 and get 20% off. The cashier began to argue with me and said it's 20.00 tell me where it says that cause it clearly says 10.00. Didn't get my discount.
