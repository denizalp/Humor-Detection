Want to shop local and appreciate the Mexican culture? If so, you have to shop here. I was referred by my neighbor after noticing her bright and colorful light switch covers. Don't underestimate the shop when pulling up. It's chock full of gorgeous pottery, metallurgy, clothing and blankets, etc.  If you're in town looking for a souvenir of the Southwest, you have to stop here. Or if you're wanting to add color and splash to your indoor and\/or outdoor environment this is your place. Skip the big box stores. They do take credit cards. I recommend carrying cash and use your bargaining skills to negotiate the best price. Easy to find and to park in front of the store. Take advantage of the other Guadalupe restaurants nearby while in town. It's just like going to Mexico, but in a Phoenix suburb.  Not to mention that they had a pic of Ronald Reagan at the check out. Heading back next week to pick up a few other purchases.
