Small menu, but quality eats. I had the turkey sandwich and my date had a Reuben. I preferred the turkey sandwich, but that's because I don't really like Montreal Smoked meat. My main complaint is the price. Two sammys and drinks came to $32 for lunch - a little steep for a sammy lunch in my opinion. \n\nAlso,  on a bit of a tangent - we went to another deli in Marda Loop a few months ago, that is exactly the same - I had the chicken pesto sandwich there and my date had the grilled cheese. While we were eating at Myrhe's Deli we were talking about how we had already had this before, hadn't we? But looking it up I think the place in Marda loop is called \"Avenue Deli\". Its exactly the same: same menu, same slaw, same pickle, same chips.... A quick look at Myrhe's website reveals that it must be. On the bottom of the page, there are links for: Belmont Diner, Avenue Deli ,Chuckwagon Cafe, Galaxie Diner and Island Cruising. I imagine that they are all connected\/related!  Makes more sense now - also makes sense that Belmont diner is well known for their smoked meat breakfast dishes. Actually, their website is pretty awesome, you should take a peak. I also learned that the meat they use is supplied by Montreal-based Quebec Smoked Meats...and that concludes my trivia tangent!
