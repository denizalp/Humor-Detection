Don't know why it took us so long to try Roamin' Dough, but I'm glad we finally did!\nThey happened to be at the Gourmet Food Truck Block Party this weekend, and Wifey\nthought that the Southwestern pocket pie sounded delicious, so we got one of those along with an order of Bacon Wrapped Dates.\n\nWOW! Nothing but good flavors and textures in the filling paired with the dough which seems like a cross between a very flaky pie crust and puff pastry-SO TASTY!!!\n\nLooking for a hot date? You can find 'em here! These bacon wrapped bad boys pack such a flavor combination that you can't eat just one! Roamin' Dough's version definitely\nranks up there(I think it surpasses them) with Twin Creek's and Firefly's ones.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you haven't tried them yet...ALOHA!!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(277\/365) \"Pocket Pies...The NEW Hot Pocket!\"
