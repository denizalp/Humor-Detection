Damn Good Burger! (I appreciate the load your own toppings and the variety of burger sizes and cheese options)\n\nSuper onion rings! (SUPER ONION RINGS!)\n\nLimited but fresh salad bar. (Iceberg, onion, bell pepper, cucumber, broccoli, shrooms, shredded cheese, bacon bits, hard boiled egg, croutons. Can grab tomato and hot peppers from the burger topping side.)\n\nGreat prices! (My 1\/3lb really good burger with no cheese was $5.29. Choice of white, wheat, onion bun.)\n\nCrappy draft\/draught selection - which is the hold back from the 5th star. (I prefer something a bit more...ummm, well, more beer like than Michelob's Amber Bock.)\n\nI will be back!  Damn, that was a good burger!
