Located in Town Square, the Container Store has every imaginable container or organizer to organize every room in your house from the bedroom, kitchen, office and the bathroom which you will not find at your local hardware store. So if you are a very organized individual, this store is for you.\n\nUnfortunately, the down side of this store is that a lot of their containers and organizers seems to be overpriced.
