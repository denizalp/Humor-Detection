Overall opinion: just average (more like 3.5 stars though) \n\nMy fellow Yelpers are right - Cibo is quaint and a good date night spot. My boyfriend and I shared the caprese salad and the Prosciutto Crudo pizza. They were both good, just nothing I would rave about. \n\nWhile the service was prompt and friendly, it seemed like the servers were all racing through the restaurant without regard for the diners. It made for a hectic experience every time you got up from the table, especially with the close corners of the restaurant. Our particular server was nice and attentive. Something a little weird though, he was wearing a blue jumpsuit reminiscent of a prison uniform or a house painter. Kinda strange. \n\nI would be happy to dine at Cibo again in the future, especially due to it's close proximity to my office. But I'm not jumping at the chance.
