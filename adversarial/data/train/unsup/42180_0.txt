James did an amazing job with my realistic monarch butterfly. He had a light touch,  I didn't feel a thing. He's got great bed side manner, good conversationalist while working. He explained the difference between a tattoo with skin breaks versus solid color,  this was my first of the latter. It's healing great and I will go back to him for all my realism. Beautiful work!\n\nThe shop is big, has great portfolios and art work on the walls, and is overall a really comfortable place to be. Everyone I've met that works here is really nice, they're funny\/like to joke; I love the environment and the artists.
