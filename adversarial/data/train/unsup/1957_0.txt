This spot brings back memories. First tried their gumbo at home when my mom brought back leftovers and was obsessed. I would come here with my cousins ID before I turned 21 to be able to have the deliciousness served to me...you see you have to be 21 or over to eat at the oyster bar(they will card you). I actually spent my 21st birthday dinner here at midnight because I love it so much. Of course I celebrated with a beer and some oyster shooters. Crazy I know...\n\nThe Oyster Bar is now open 24 hours which makes it so easy to try and a great place to go to when I get off of work at 5am. There usually is always a line since there is seating for only 15-18 people...but that doesn't deter people from waiting...their food is THAT GOOD. The chefs are usually always talking to the guests as he's cooking which makes the experience fun.
