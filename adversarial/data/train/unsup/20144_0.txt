One tip from the locals in Vegas was to go off the Strip, because there are SO many gems just off the Strip as well. And less crowded. But my uncle actually recommended this place to us because of it's yummy specialty udon dishes.\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to say that I LOVE the employees here! They're so nice! And when you walk in, EVERYONE greets you! And when you leave, EVERYONE says goodbye. It's such a nice thing to see.\n\nWe went around lunch time on a Thursday afternoon and was seated immediately. Probably not super popular because it's off the Strip. But it's definitely worth it to go.\n\nThe Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps were great! I was also able to impress the Boyfriend because I could handle the spice - it's the kind of spice that stays in your mouth and you can't feel it in your throat. The lettuce was fresh and crunchy. I'd take off some of the fried rice noodles though.\n\nFor the main dishes, Boyfriend ordered the Miso Carbonara and I ordered the Seafood Tomato. Both were AMAZING!!!!!!! As someone else stated, the Miso Carbonara does taste like Bacon Mac N Cheese - which isn't a bad thing. And as you can see, the bacon strips are pretty big. And you can taste bacon in every noodle. The Seafood Tomato was great as well. I thought it would just have a seafood flavor in the creamy tomato sauce, but it definitely had seafood in it! And bits of tomato. It was served HOT and uber delicious. But I definitely regret not getting the Sea Urchin udon. If Boyfriend let me, I think I would've ordered 2 udon dishes for myself...\n\nI'd also skip the Beef Tataki. It was a little too dry, with minimal sauce.
