Let me warn you, these beds are dangerous... And by dangerous I mean you won't ever want to leave it. Seriously I find myself thinking about crawling into bed the minute I step into work, and not because I didn't get a great nights rest (which i always do with a t&n bed) but because it's so freaking comfortable. My back is all out of whack and I can NEVER be comfortable on a bed it's always either too soft or too hard and I can't find a medium. My husband and I are newlyweds, struggling ones none the less, so I figured we'd be stuck with our hand me down hard as a rock mattress for a good while seeing as how traditional mattresses cost a good 2-4k... I asked for a temperpudic mattress for my upcoming birthday and was gifted a Tuft & Needle mattress.. BEST GIFT EVER!!!!!! It says in the pamphlet when you receive it expect about 10 days for the bed to completely air out to perfection.. It's been a week now, and if this bed gets any more comfortable I might have to find a reason to be bed ridden... Forever. All in all, tuft and needle is the best choice if you want the best nights sleep & at an extremely affordable price. Thank you mattress God's.
