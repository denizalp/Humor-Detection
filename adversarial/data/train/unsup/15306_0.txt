She's baaayak Hookers! Dixie's Tupperware Party is ON like a Donkey Kong wearing Brownie's thong.\n\nDixie's. Tupperware. Party.  You will never look at Tupperware the same again; actually, you'll think of many new and creative ways to utilise your Pepper Keepers, Sipper Seals and Shape-O Toys after Miss Dixie tilts a few from the 2qt. Pitcher(s).\n\nLost my Tupperware virginity four years ago at Chick's  Chicago plastic crap party and came back for more so what does that tell ya? (OK, maybe not THAT but either way it'll make your neighbours Pampered Chef Party look about as exciting as corn night at a nursing home)\n\nDixie just keeps throwing better parties and this latest is no exception. \n\nIf you go to one Tupperware party in your ADULT life (this one isn't suited for kids) it should be to the one thrown down by Miss Dixie Longate; The Beyonce of Burpables.\n\nI think girls liver is actually made from Tupperware. \n\nI've got that Tupper feeling up in my head....\ndeep in my heart...\ndown in my toes....\n\n\n**This Tupperware Party is Dude Approved and bears the official Dude Approved Seal to ensure no testosterones were utilised or lost in this traditionally (until Dixie) female-centric gathering.
