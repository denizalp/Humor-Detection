I'm not big on chain stores, but this Target does a lot to serve the community.  The cashiers have a wonderful sense of humor, and I generally feel welcome in the store.  It's easy to park, and there's a cool escalator that carts can ride.\n\nExcellent prices, a well laid out store.  Plus a good selection of ice cream.
