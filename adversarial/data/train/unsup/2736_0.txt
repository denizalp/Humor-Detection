So I never ate at Chick-fil-a and started hearing about all the hype about this place.  Then driving through town I see people waiting in line with police oversight and just waiting for the day that I would have time to give this a try \n\nWell that day came.  About a month ago I noticed that the lines subsided and there was no wait at the drive thru.  Like a little kid, my anticipation of tasting something new was beyond belief after people went hysterical over the opening of Chick-fl-a\n\nI ordered the chicken fingers and have to say I was so disappointed.  When I bit into the chicken it tasted like regular chicken and to this day I don't understand why people went ape shit over a piece of chicken. \n\nIt's regular chicken with decent tasting sauces.  And this is what the mass hysteria is about???\n\nI guess now I know why I don't follow the masses.
