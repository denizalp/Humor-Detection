Want to go to a free show?  Honestly, I was asked that at least 50 times in two days.  It was so bad that I had to find a different casino to gamble.  The rooms are alright, but I wasn't planning on being in the room that long anyway.  Food was good at the steak restaurant .  \nCharges for room is misleading.  Huge resort fee above the advertised price.\nNext time to Vegas I plan on taking myself and my gambling to another hotel.  They made an extra $40 on bogus fees, but lost out on the $1000 I lost at a nearby hotel.\nWon't be going back to what use to be my favorite hotel in Vegas.\n\nPs. Do not do a late check out.  Something like $20, so u think.  Then u get ur bill and see resort fees tagged on.  My previous day room charge was cheaper than My late check out.\nSad things are so corrupt!
