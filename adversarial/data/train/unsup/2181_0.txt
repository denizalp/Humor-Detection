We came on a Friday morning and ordered \n1. 2 eggs special: 1.89\n2. Four deuces: 2.89\nfor $7 \n\n- We literally only had time to eat there for 40 minutes max. We came at 940 and left at 1020. Perfect! Probably a 5min wait time to be seated, then less than 15min to get our food. Once you get the check, you pay up front. \n- 2 Eggs: with 2 bacon or sausage. \n- Four deuces: Pancakes or French toast w\/ 2 eggs, 2 sausage and 2 bacon\n- Each special comes with hash brown, toast or biscuit and gravy. \n- Service was standard. Nothing too special. We seemed like outliers being that everyone there was probably Medicare age. \n- Hard to mess up a breakfast like this. \n- Can't make an over-medium egg. \n- Hash browns not as crispy as Image at Rainbow Casino. \n- Sourdough bread was very buttery! yum!\n- Tasty French toast! love it! \n- Cheapest breakfast meal I've ever eaten! Best deal ever. Regular for sure. \n\nTables open at 4:15pm daily. \n- $1 outside roulette, 10cent inside\n- $3 DD blackjack
