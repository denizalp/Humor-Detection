Every other city in the US has tons of places like Simple Ingredients, and it is really hard to get a great salad in this town.  Simple Ingredients fills a much needed hole in the Pittsburgh lunch and dinner scene, and it is a few doors down from my new job.  Perfection.\n\nThe options are very simple.  You can get a wrap or a salad.  I ordered a Caesar Salad ($6.99) from the Make-Your-Own Salad, and I added some cucumbers and tomatoes as well.  The ingredients were super fresh and wonderful.  They will put the dressing on the side or on the salad, which is great.  Additionally, the salad comes with two small slices of whole grain bread.  The bread wasn't anything special, but I really enjoyed the combination.  Great quality and portion for the price.\n\nThe best part is that they give you plenty of napkins and decent plasticware.  There is nothing worse than to-go places that don't automatically put this in the bag for you!\n\nCredit cards accepted.
