I met Kenny over a year ago and I can say that after using several life coaches in the past, Kenny provided a new approach to healing my issues that I hadn't used before. There were underlying issues in my life that were causing stress, and anxiety, and he was able to pinpoint those issues and offer a path to clarity. Kenny's approach is different than most self-help books because he gets down to the deep rooted issues that drive all of our decisions - and that's where you have to go to get results. If you're ready to make a change in your life and really understand how to embark on a journey to success in any area of your life, I highly recommend Kenny!
