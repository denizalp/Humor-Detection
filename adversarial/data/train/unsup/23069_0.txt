VPN-Vero Pizza Napoletana,,,,,Thats what sets Settebello apart from all the other pizzerias in town. It is the stamp of approval given by the pizza making authority in Italy, and only a handful of establishments in the U.S. have been given this distinction, so if you come across any of these establishments sporting the VPN signage on their front door, you know its the real deal like you would find in Naples, All you pizza snobs stop comparing it to NY or Chicago style, because it doesn't even compare! They're trying to keep tradition and integrity by following the traditional pizza making ways as they do IN NAPLES! If you want Pepperoni or Pineapple, CALL DOMINOS!!!\n\nOkay, done with my rant...on to my review. Been going to Settebellos ever since they were first located on Valle Verde and Horizon Ridge. It was hidden away and not too many people knew about this place until they made the move to The District. The ingredients are top-notch, and ALL their pizzas are the BOMB! I've tried everything- Margherita, Carbonara, Ripieno, etc. and my favorite, The Settebello. The ONLY way to devour all this goodness is the minute it is placed in front of you and there's no better way to finish with an Affogatto,Double espresso with a scoop of gelato. Looking forward to return again soon,,,ALOHA!!!
