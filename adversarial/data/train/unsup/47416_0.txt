Came here on a Thursday night around 6:30 pm; our party of 3 was seated right away (no reservations needed). We shared 6 dishes family style and left full and satisfied.\n\nFood:\nMy favorites: Pan seared ahi tuna (nothing too unique but it was executed SO well. The tuna was fresh, seared and perfectly rare in the middle and the wasabi aioli, a delicious complement), and the baked potato croquettes (4 perfectly battered and fried baby potatoes served with scallion sour cream).\nWe also tried (in order of preference): the roasted garlic hummus (comes with a pail of pita and a hummus spread, half covered in crispy chickpeas, half in olives), pan seared scallops (comes with 3 scallops on a bed of sweet potato puree -- this dish included everything that I loved, but I wasn't blown away by the execution; it didn't have the nice sear that I was longing for, was slightly overcooked, which didn't go super well with the texture and thickness of the puree), dando brussel sprouts (I wish they were more crispy and carmelized than they were!), and grilled steak skewers (comes with 2 skewers; this one was super underwhelming, very generic).\n\nService:\nThe service was awesome. \n\nAmbiance: The interior is dimly lit, with exposed brick, and nice big, rustic wooden tables. \n\nWill definitely be back to try out other options on their menu and another round of the ahi tuna and baked potato croquettes!
