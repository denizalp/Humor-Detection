I'm definitely a fan of Marco's Pizza because they're priced right and the pizzas are very good. Out of the major chain pizza restaurants out there, Marco's is my favorite. Now, I don't claim that they're better than some real local pizza spots like Lorenzo's but this is my go to when I want something fast and fairly priced.
