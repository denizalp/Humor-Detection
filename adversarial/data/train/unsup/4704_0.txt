I only go up in tall towers because boyfriend hates heights. I kid, that is not the only reason why. \n\nGo early, we went when it opened and did not have to wait in any lines. It  was a tad pricey for the amount of time we spent up there. We walked around the tower both inside and outside and even stood on the glass floor. The staff members are very friendly and will take your picture. If you want to pay more you can get a ticket to visit the SkyPod. Or, if you are an adrenaline junkie you can do EdgeWalk. \n\nI will have to admit, I really liked the gift shop. We were able to get all of our gifts here. I even found my new favorite magnet, a plaid beer opener.
