Pretty dated hotel...$2.00 margarita, will give it a try!\n\nNo No No!!!  Do not waste your money on the the $2.00 margarita.  It gave me an allergic reaction to my throat.  I started off with Margaritaville margarita and it was great.  When I was done I bought the 2.00 and my throat was getting scratchy and felt like a sore throat.  My nurse friend said it might be the bad tequila as that can tend to happen.  \n\nThis was the start of the Vegas trip.  I had to start drinking water to relieve the pain and disgusting taste!  ugh :P
