If Rene Magritte were here, he would say \"This is not a beach.\"  Yes, it's not a beach, BUT it is the ultimate pool party thrown Vegas style.  There is a pool and a jacuzzi, but you'd hardly know it was there since it's crammed full of bikini clad ladies and male bronzed bodies.  You don't come to this \"beach\" to relax, but to \"see and be seen.\"  This is your chance to show off all of that time at the gym!\n\nIt's quite possibly the only place to go \"clubbing\" in the daytime as there is a poolside DJ spinning some beats and hip hop jams.  The dress code (and believe it or not, there is one since I saw the bouncer turn away a guy for wearing basketball shorts) is swimwear with a \"less is more\" attitude.  Heels, dangly earrings, and jewelry are accessories that many of the females sport at Tao Beach.  \n\nThe place is surrounded by canopies with orange drapes and brown wicker lounge chaises, a Moroccan inspired vibe.  Grab the complementary towel on your way in and use it to claim yourself a seated area.  A full bar is located on one end of the place, with frozen margaritas and lemonade concoctions on a hot day.  The lemonade was on the crazy sour side, so I asked the bartender to add some juice.  $9 for a that drink ended up giving me a brain freeze, along with an even more parched mouth.\n\nTao Beach is nestled in the corner of the Venetian's rooftop, but you have to bypass the folks checking guest passes or room keys to enter the elevators.  Try the elevators on the lowest level, since it didn't look as restricted.  Worse case scenario, just tell them you're there to dine at La Bouchon, which also requires an elevator ride.  A little tricky to find, but worth the effort to check out!
