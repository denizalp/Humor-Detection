[Michelin Stars #13-15]\n\nI decided to treat myself to my first three-star Michelin dining experience in honor of celebrating...well, life. I did not, however, take the gold limo that other Yelpers have mentioned;  Aimee P is far too classy for gold limos. No, I'd much rather roll up in a yellow taxi.  \n\nSo what makes the meal of a lifetime?  \n\nLet's start with the bread cart. My eyes lit up and my inner carb fiend was in full effect when I that cart came rolling toward my table.  Rosemary brioche?  Saffaron bread?  Basil bread?  Ementaler bread?  Bacon brioche?  Milk bread?  Yes, please.  Of course, the basics were there as well, and Joel makes an exceptional baguette.  The rest of the bread was also amazing:  flaky, crusty, chewy, deceptively light.  I could have a meal consisting of the bread alone.  \n\nBut let's not forget the butter cart.  Oh, that's right:  even the butter has its own cart!  Well, there's some sort of fancy olive oil there as well, but why on EARTH would one get the olive oil when underneath a glass dome is a block of the richest, creamiest butter you've ever seen?  Watching the waiter shave off a piece was like watching him scoop ice cream.  Smooth.  \n\nI wasn't sure what to expect of a 16 course tasting menu with wine pairings (offered in three tiers, with $295 being the lowest tier);  at the very least, I expected to be very, very drunk.  But the sommelier came by and explained that most of the wines were meant to be paired with several consecutive courses.  There was a total of 6 wine courses to go with my 16 food courses (+1 amuse bouche).  \n\n16 courses of love:\n - (amuse bouche) caviar, fennel cream, lobster.  yum.\n\n - (1) foie gras and potato carpaccio, with black truffle shavings.  A very well balanced dish and remarkably, the part that impressed me the most was the perfectly cooked potato (but perfect like I've never had it before!).  \n\n - (2-4) three courses of black truffles prepared in different ways (the French seem to be huge fans of those trios, huh?);  my favorite was Robuchon's take on scrambled eggs and toast:  crispy truffle tart with onion confit, THE richest scrambled eggs I've ever had, and of course, black truffles.  \n\n - (5) deep fried frog leg\n\n - (6-8) a seafood trio consisting of lobster, an interesting take on sea urchin with wasabi emulsion, and langoustine ravioli.  I was impressed to see sea urchin on the menu, knowing its...unpopularity.  Props to Robuchon for taking that risk anyway!  The langoustine ravioli was also wonderful:  I wasn't a big fan of langoustines, but having them prepared by the Robuchon kitchen has made me reconsider.  \n\n - (9) kabocha pumpkin veloute with ginger foam.  Ahhh, gastronomy in the works.  This was a welcome break from the previous heavy courses.  \n\n - (10) bone marrow and sweetbread ragout with truffle jus.  \n\n - (11) olive oil poached sea bass with lemongrass and leeks, with hints of curry.  This was possibly my favorite course.  It was a nice, light dish with incredible aromas and flavors.  I rarely see French restaurants willing to dabble into the realm of fusion, so I enjoyed this one a great deal.  \n\n - (12) duck and my second course with foie gras, as well as some sweet and sour fruits.  A more traditional course, but executed wonderfully nontheless.  \n\n - (13) farrow risotto with gold leaf\n\n - (14) pear and almond milk emulsion\n\n - (15) chocolate and fruit confit\n\n - (16) dessert cart\n\nThe dining room was decorated with large vases overflowing with gorgeous large, white orchids fit for the hairpiece of a bride.  Up till this point, the most extravagant floral display I've seen is the bushels of beautiful red roses at Bouchon;  Robuchon's orchids put these to shame (I guess that's what a $400 meal gets you!).  The motif was purple:  large, plush purple velvet chairs, purple walls, purple accents.  Even the gift bag I received at the end of the evening was tied in flowing organza lavender ribbon. (Yeahh, I know nobody cares about the color, but purple happens to make Aimee P very happy)\n\nService throughout the evening was impeccable, from the elegant hostess who held the tall glass doors open for us and then graciously seated us, to the waiters who were on point in bringing out each course with flair, to the server who was gracious enough to allow me not one but TWO plates from the dessert cart (what can I say, I struggle when too many OPTIONS are put before me!), and to the half dozen waiters and busboys who seemed always available to satisfy my every dining whim.  The attitude of the servers was unpretentious, unlike some other fine dining establishments I've visited.  \n\nI had my Robuchon meal at the end of a three-day Vegas Michelin binge.  It turns out that this is my only regret.  An experience like Joel Robuchon deserves to stand on its own, not immediately following two other great meals.  Next time, I'll know better.
