This review comes a bit late but it's well deserved. I'm kicking myself because I can't remember my bartender's name. I think it was Morgan? Like I said it's been a while. So my friend and I came one early evening I think it was a Friday afternoon and it wasn't packed for the night yet of course. I'm not going to lie. I sort of judged especially it being by\/on frat row. My friend and I sat at the bar and Morgan was super nice and suggested food for us. We ordered the sliders and boy were they amazing. We asked her where they would be showing the Mayweather McGreggor fight. She said right there! Of course right?! So next day rolls around and we get there super early to eat beforehand. Oh yeah food was super good. Beer, good!!! Lol. Morgan was very attentive as well as Chloe. So if you remember the Mayweather McGreggor fight took forever to start so we were literally there for hours. By that time our asses were sore from those seats at the bar. My friend and I were expecting to pay $50 to watch the fight and they didn't charge anything for females! Sweet! Pays to have a vagina! Lol. Had a fun time here with good service. Will be coming back here when I visit!
