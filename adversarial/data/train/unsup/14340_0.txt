They have Pre-Check, however I didn't know until I was through the slowest TSA checkpoint ever.\n\nSomebodies great grand mother was checking ID's.\nPretty sure she couldn't see the ID through the cataracts.\nIt took twenty minutes to funnel the ten people in front of me through the line.\nThere had to be fifty people behind me when I made it to her.\n\nThinking she needs to retire.
