All I have to say is WOW! What a great company! Our 19 yr old ac died on Sunday morning. We called a few places for quotes over the phone and to have someone come out early Monday morning. We got a referral from my father in law to also call Penguin Air.  I am very glad we did!  We spoke with William (the owner) late on Sunday evening about replacing our unit.  He was very knowledgable and patient with all of our questions.  He gave us a VERY fair price compared to the other quotes.  We decided on a 5 ton 14 seer Trane. \n\nThey came Monday morning with EVERYTHING...CRANE AND ALL. The team was very clean, courteous, thorough, and worked very hard installing our unit as quickly as possible. We had COLD air blowing through the house by 3:30 pm the very next day!  William also stopped by as his team finished up to make sure everything was going perfectly and to go over everything with us to ensure we were satisfied. We were very impressed to say the least.\n\nHaving your ac go out really is a stressful and (hot!) situation to be in, especially in 105+ AZ summer weather.  It is refreshing to deal with such an organized, professional company that gets the job done right!  I highly recommend them for your future ac needs.  Thank you for the stellar service Penguin Air!!  A++++!
