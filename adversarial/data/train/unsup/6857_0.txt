Why is this one so much better than the Oakland location?  I don't really know, but I can say that I'm happy about it.  I put my previous two terrible Oakland experiences aside, braved the new location in Downtown Pittsburgh, and walked away a changed man.\n\nFirst attempt:  late lunch, 1:30 PM, mid-week.  The place was a ghost town (awesome!) I walked right up to the counter, ordered a Rachel burger, and was promptly delivered my burger in a few short minutes.  The burger was good, if not messy, and my only gripe would be that the turkey-burger patty is clearly from frozen.  Nonetheless, still a tasty meal and the place was really clean with super friendly employees.\n\nSecond attempt:  Noon, mid-week.  The place was packed and there was a decent sized line.  Service was still prompt and while the Salad Bar Engineers did look a bit frazzled, they handled my requests promptly.  Minor disappointment was the meager topping rations provided when I asked for a) chopped eggs b) bacon c) croutons.  If all salad toppings are free, why are you skimping on these things? (And I do mean skimp, like teaspoon size serving.)  Next time I'll be \"that guy\" and tell them to double up.  \n\nWhen I finally made my way to the Cold Stone Creamery-esque salad amalgamation station, I was presented with two options: \"Big bites or little bites?\"  Unhappy with such restrictions, I countered with \"medium bites?\" to a non-plussed chopper.  She did, however, comply with my clearly ridiculous request.  \n\nIn all, the salad was very good and I'll definitely go back (only to this location).  Oakland-location still needs to learn that avocados aren't supposed to be dark brown when placed on salads and that sweaty forearms are not an appropriate salad tong resting station in-between grabbing items from the salad bar.
