This place is everything you'd expect from a fine steakhouse.  I was blown away.  Took my nephew and his girlfriend for an experience, \"that they will never forget.\"  That's what was said when we were done.  Absolutely top notch phenomenal!\n\n\"Dressy\" for attire I marked on this rating, but we were casual and did just fine.  We didn't get thrown out.  MICHAEL is an outstanding server and the sommelier took care of our wine selection.
