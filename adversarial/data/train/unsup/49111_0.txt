This shop is amazing! Coolest, chill guy answered all of our million questions and gave us great recommendations. We are newbies to vaping and currently had just the starter, 35.00 starter vape. We upgraded to fancy vapes :) and he gave us his honest opinion regarding products. Which was much appreciated. Didn't try and up sell us on junk whatsoever. Try the town drunk juice, its pretty epic. We bought 2 bottles worth. If you like their Facebook page you'll receive a 10% discount on your first visit. Even better, they have a veteran discount, you'll receive 15% off!! Highly recommend this shop. Honestly, one of the best we've been to.
