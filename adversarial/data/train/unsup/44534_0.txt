The perfect end to a great night. I think it was -24 and we had just left a great pizza place. Walking back to the vehicle trying not to freeze to death. Analog which is usually super busy appeared fairly quiet (except for the dozen or so students on their laptops) \n\nAny I asked for  mocha which could not have been prepared better. Service was super fast Nd the coffee as always was delicious. The atmosphere is hipster with great music and plenty of seating.
