I arrived at Chez Boris at 9am with my kid in his stroller, and was delighted to find the place almost empty. When you have a toddler, you're always fearful of crowded places where your little hellion is going to wreak havoc and get you kicked out, or at the very least, scorned for all eternity with the burning stink-eye of the proprietors. \n\nNot so here. We went to the counter, ordered a coffee, two donuts, and a glass of milk, and pulled up to the big, well-worn couch to enjoy. I plopped the kiddo down and stripped off the ten million layers of outergear that one must dress your child in to avoid hypothermia in this city, and the barista\/donutmistress brought us our treats. Fantastic. Crispy, hot, tender donuts with sugary topping, a nice drip coffee, and the milk was a hit with the kid. \n\nWe sat there, eating our donuts, drinking our beverages, and giving a last read-through to the books we planned to return to the Mile-End library down the road, and I thought, this is as close to perfect as it gets. Afterward, we looked at the Snakes and Ladders game they had on the table, and studied some of the old maps plastered on other tables. Great atmosphere, great space (enough room for a stroller! hallelujah!), and great fare. They even open early enough to enjoy a treat before the library opens. Fantastic.
