I'm loving this place. Came here for the Opening Weekend with the Jays and Yanks 2014 season. \n\nThe room is huge and comfortable. The bedding are the best I've ever had on the road. Oh so comfortable. I've never slept better away from home. \n\nBut the best is being able to sit in the bar \/ coffee shop \/ restaurant and see the entire Rogers Center ballpark. It's a joy to watch batting practice while having breakfast or lunch. You can sit here for the entire game if you wish, as long as you order a meal. And the staff is so accommodating. It's become one of my favorite places to stay. I will return!
