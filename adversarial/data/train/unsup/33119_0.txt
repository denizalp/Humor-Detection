My husband and I came in for couches and the entire team was amazing, especially Paula she was our main sales woman she is such a sweetheart and she went above and beyond to help get the best deal we possibly could and with that we where also able to afford a bedroom set. So we highly recommend you visit Paula and the rest of the Ashley furniture team.
