I stayed here for a weekend. The rooms were very pretty just like the pictures. But it smelled terrible in our room. The AC was leaking all over the place including onto the bed. The AC did not really even make it as cool as it should of with all the leaking it was doing. The hot tub was a great add on to the room until we turned the water on and it didn't come out hot at all. Tried three different times thought out our stay. Also why is check in so late in the day ? At 4pm we got there at 3:45 and was told it's gonna be another half an hour. She said she would call us when it was ready. We returned and ask us our names again ??? How were you going to call us if you couldn't remember our names ?? But still check out is at 11am.
