It is rare for me to pen a bad review on any restaurant, however this one needs to know how horrible their service is.  \n\nAfter ordering online, I decided to pick up (or carry out) the pizza since I was relatively close by.  \n\nWhen I entered the store I was immediately greeted by the staff member behind the cash register.  He asked if I was \"carrying out\" an order and I said \"yes\" and gave him my name.  He looked puzzled while scanning the screen and asked my name a second time. Again i gave him my name to which he responded with somebody else's name.  I said no and a third time gave him my name.  He then said \"ohhhhh, there you are man....sorry.\"\n\nHe told me the price and I gave him cash.  He then gave me the change and closed the cash register. At the same time, another customer entered the store behind me.  The staff member immediately greeted the second customer and asked for his name to look up an an order. I interrupted him and said \"may I have my pizza now please?\"  And he said \"in a second, I want to help this customer first.\" Puzzled, I said, \"excuse me? I just paid you and my pizza is behind you on the rack.\" And he said, \"yes, but let me take this guy's order first...\"  I stopped him short and said, \"wouldn't it be best to complete service with the first customer (me) before you begin on a second customer?\"  He responded, \"um, oh yea man....I see.  Here's your pizza.\"\n\nI took the pizza from his hands and looked at the second customer behind me who shrugged his shoulders as I walked out the door.  To top everything off, the box was cold and so was the pizza inside.\n\nThis bad personal customer experience now tells me I will never order from here again.  Sad, and I really liked their pizza...when it's warm at least.
