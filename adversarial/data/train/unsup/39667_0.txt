We recently purchased a used vehicle, and the day we bought it we brought it into this Goodyear Service Center and asked them to check it for any obvious issues which we might want to consider before buying the car. Specifically, we knew it had a minor oil leak, and knowing that the car in question (a Subaru Forester) is known for having head-gasket problems, we asked them to make sure that the head gaskets that were not the culprit (which would result in a VERY expensive fix). They told us that the oil leak was absolutely not related to the head gaskets, and that the head gaskets were without fault.\n\nWe purchased the vehicle and found out shortly afterward from our trusted Subaru mechanic that the head gaskets did in fact need to be replaced (and were the source of the oil leak), costing us thousands of dollars. We have to believe that this shop was either negligent or purposefully dishonest (they seemed to know our used car dealer) in their assessment. We would not recommend them to anyone for this reason.
