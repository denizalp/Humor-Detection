After reading about PastaBAR on yelp- I had to go see for myself what the heck is going on here!\n\nWalked in--- liked the seating situation and the ambiance.  Had the nicest server ever, his name was Nick.  He talked about the menu and answered our questions.  Brought some really great tea and tangy lemonade.  \n\nWe ordered the fried mozzarella, they make the cheese there-- it was so good.  But not as good as my entree!  I ordered pappardelle and it was possibly the best pasta I have had at a restaurant ever.  It tasted just like my Nonna's homemade pasta, the perfect texture, cooked the real Italian al dente way and I was in heaven.  It was the special and it sure was special.  The portions were good too.  After reading everyone's reviews about portions, I was scared I was going to have to pick a sandwich up afterwards, but no-sir-ee.  I was happily full and planning my next trip!!!
