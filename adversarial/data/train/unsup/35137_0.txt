So a while back, I had a semi not so good experience with this restaurant.  The lack of service was my issue, the first time in years a Sierra gold did not conform to my standards. \nToday I gave in and came back to see if it was just a hiccup or if I should just boycott it completely. \nWell, let's start with, I didn't even get the chance to walk up the steps before I  was greeted by Claudia\nThat was a great start to my experience.  As I am a creature of habit I always order the grilled chicken sandwich, add bacon minus onion. \nThe sandwich came out piping hot with all the condiments just right.  \nThe server was the same server who greeted me at the steps.  \nAs I was unaccompanied, she made my experience enjoyable with the small talk above the normal server\/guest conversation.
