beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you don't drink tea?  really.\n\nThe crazy thing is, i'm sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill?\n\nWhen I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  \"oh, is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill\"\n\nI said forget it, keep it.\n\ni usually tip 20-30% but i'll just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.\n\n  yeah, really worth losing a customer for?\n\nmy 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water.\n\ngone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?)\n\n$2.35 PER so now they're no different from the rest of the dim sum places.\n\nas sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers)\n\nso in a down economy, you're supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges?\n\nit's the chinese way i guess\n\nback to china king for us.  sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace.\n\nwill you forgive us? haha
