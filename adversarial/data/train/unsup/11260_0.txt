So far I've enjoyed my stay at ST in South Scottsdale.  The location is very convenient.  If your preference is the indoor high rise condo type living than definitely pass.  \n\nInside the unit the distressed HW flooring is a nice touch.   The two pools and hot tub are very clean.  The gym is fantastic.  The cardio machines are near top of the line and kept very clean consistently.  You've got access to the Pandora hook up and can play what ever tunes you want while working out.  If your a Prime customer the Amazon locker is right there by the mailboxes for your convenience.  \n\nThe only minor issue I've had was the exhaust fan in the laundry room kept constantly going on like 10 minutes after you have turned it off and it  drove me freaking nuts for a minute!  It took 1.5 weeks to address this which was frustrating.  So response time could be better.  But overall the staff are friendly when you have questions.  If you really need to be in the quietest part of the complex.   I would recommend you don't get a unit really too close to the pools.  \n\nAdded bonuses.  Its close to the Hayden Ferry Building off Rio Salado Pkwy and shared office spaces in the area if your in startup mode.  \n\nParking for your guests can be tough most of the time on weekends.  Keep that in mind if you have lots of visitors.  4 stars overall for the location and decent amenities.
