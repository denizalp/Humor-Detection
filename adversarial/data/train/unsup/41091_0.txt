I chose this place because of the reviews.  I'm glad I did.  The food was incredible.  I had the mixed green salad and steelhead trout.  The salad had great bold flavors and the steelhead was cooked to perfection and very yummy.  The service was excellent.  With all the great places to eat in Las Vegas, it's hard to decide but you can't go wrong with Roy's.
