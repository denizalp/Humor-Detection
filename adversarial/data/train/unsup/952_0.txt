Was here for Smunch.  Let me get the one bad thing out of the way: the parking lot stinks.  While there are lots of fake meat options, which several in our party had, I went with stir fried vegetables and fried tofu on rice. It was really good.  Nobody in our group disliked their meal.  The people are really friendly and the service was good.  It is fast casual so you order at the counter.  Because it is not standard fare for most folks they can all answer questions about what ingredients are in each dish.
