A Nitty-Gritty Layman's Guide to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant\n\nReservations:  A must, particularly if you'd like to be seated during pique lunch or dinner hour.  If you're flexible, i.e. supper at 9:45, take a chance and walk in.\n\nAttire:  Business casual. (We were somewhat dressier.)  I witnessed a couple being turned away because of their jeans and tee shirts.\n\nService:  Spot on.  Our server, Michael, was friendly and helpful.  We never wanted for a thing.\n\nWine:  If you're a connoisseur, I suspect you'll delight in the wine list.  If you're like me, a person who appreciates a California red, but doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg, your choices are limited.  You can order Shiraz at $12 a glass, or go for a bottle of Rodney Strong Merlot @ $59, which is what we did.  Over-priced, but less money than virtually everything else.  By the way, if you choose to bring your own wine, expect a ludicrous corkage fee of $75 per bottle.\n\nPrix Fixe: The six course tasting menu is $125 per person.  Wine pairing is an additional $79 and if you'd like a soufflé, tack on $8 more.  Two things to note: 1) if one person wants the prix fixe, everyone at the table must be in accord and order the same. 2) There is no flexibility in the  menu. Courses are as presented with no choice or substitutions. (Based on reviews of the venison, we decided to order a la carte.)\n\nOur Meals\nAppetizers:   Of the appetizers, two were particularly good:  the casco bay sea scallops and my cold foie gras which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I could have done without the accompanying fig compote or toast points.  (Make your selection from the bread basket instead.)\n\nSalad: My husband and daughter ordered the market green salad, which appeared unremarkable.  Better choice may be what's called the  \"non-traditional\" Caesar salad with warm anchovies, capers and garlic vinaigrette.\n\nEntrees:  Perhaps the best received dish was T's roasted rack of lamb and tomato tart.  He thought it impeccable.  My Muscovy duck breast was good, but not as tasty as duck I recently had in Atlanta. My daughter enjoyed her filet mignon, but again, there was nothing extraordinary about it.  You'll find that meats are high quality,  and cooked to perfection.  If you want it rare, you'll get it rare.\n\nDessert:  Curious about the \"acclaimed\" soufflés, we ordered two.  (Note that the order must go in, early on.)  None of us were bowled over.  The chocolate soufflé was ordinary, the caramel somewhat better.   Perhaps this is petty, but coffee at $7 per person seems excessive.....\n\nIn Summation: I vacillate between three and four stars.  We spent $500 for dinner that was indeed good, but hardly stand-out.  I'm happy for the experience ; the view of the fountains, as everyone points out, can't be beat.  Am I glad we came?  Sure!  Will we return?  Nope.
