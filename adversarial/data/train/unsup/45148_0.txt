Very nice, though the pool could be larger. It's always packed. At night its the outdoor area for Surrender and they do nighttime pool parties the same way XS does. However due to the smaller pool area, it's not as fun. The inside area is rather small - you better hope the DJ is not playing inside and everyone wants to see them, because the dancefloor is very tiny. Drinks are expensive of course - but it's Vegas, so what do you expect!
