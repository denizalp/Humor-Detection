For all the social media hype and long line, I was expecting a little more flavorful meal. After waiting in line for a good 20 min or so, I ordered their sausage, egg and cheese sandwich on a gluten-free bun. The turkey sausage was decent and the size was alright, but I think maybe the gluten-free bun killed it. I should've just stuck with the original brioche bun, dang it.
