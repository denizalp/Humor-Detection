Nice apartments but has the WORST office and maintenance crew I ever dealt with in my life. They almost always \"forget\" when you make a maintenance appointment and rarely ever bother to show up even if what is broken cause a hazard. It's gotten so bad that people have begun withholding rent until maintenance requests they've had in for months are finally taken care of. The latter is not the best tactic but totally understandable given the piss-poor job this place does with keeping up with maintenance and how often the front desk lies to you. Can not wait for my lease to be up.
