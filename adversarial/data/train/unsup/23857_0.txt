This is one of PF Chang's top restaurants!! Great service awaits you at this location each and every visit. We even book our annual night before Super Bowl dinner here for over 30 friends and these guys rock it every time!!  Excellent management, great servers and bar staff!  My favorite PF Chang's in the country. I strongly recommend reservations!! Also for large parties though do have 2 private dining rooms available!  I highly recommend both.
