We have taken our cars to Oscar for 3 years now and each time we are treated like family. He has always been up front with us about costs and if anything changes while he is working on things, he lets us know before he continues. He has even ran across town for parts last minute. Cars are expensive to fix and the bottom line is that you want someone you can trust. I completely trust Oscar and his family and will continue to use his shop and recommend it to my family and friends.
