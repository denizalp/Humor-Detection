First time to Heritage and loved it. Doesn't look like much from the outside but once inside you are greeted with warmth and respect. The apps are very good, the entrees are even better. The service is top notch and the pricing is not expensive at all. We eat out alot and this gem has just become our new mainstay. Fresh, local farmer ingredients and a creative chef lead to tasty food.\nThey also have great desserts and they have a full bar as well.as outside, streetside dinning.
