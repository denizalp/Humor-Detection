Best haircut experience in years!  As a frequent patron of Pint Central and resident of PM, I had walked past Salon 1226 quite a few times but it finally clicked after a couple of bad haircuts at other places that I should give them a try.  I'm glad I did.  Ace gave me a great haircut yesterday  ( I had been told by more than one stylist in the past that due to a crazy cowlick my hair should be the final exam at every haircutting school) and he was great to talk to.   Everyone there was very attentive and the cost was very reasonable.  A great value on top of everything else. Plus, you can go next door and grab a beer at Pint Central before or after (or possibly during).  I will be a regular from now on.
