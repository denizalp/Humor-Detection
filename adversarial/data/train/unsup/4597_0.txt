I don't know why it took me so long to get my butt to FABO. Maybe it's because I kept calling it FABU to myself instead of FABO or that I didn't know what the name was all about? Well, I found out about the name today--Fabulous Art Buying Opportunity. I saw a post from them saying mention you saw on Facebook that they are offering free coffee today and you could get a 12 oz cup for free. Free java? On it like cream and sugar!\n\nCute place full of natural light, decent amount of seating, local beers, wines (saw some from Napa) and an abundance of drinks to make any coffee and tea drinker happy. I had to whole devil and angel on my shoulders thing going on in regards to buying one of their turtle brownies or not. Ok....regarding all of their pastries. I love that they have art that is drinkable, edible, hangable and wearable!! I perused their art area checking out the headbands, hats, earrings, plates, chairs, etc. They have a number of unique items that would make a great gift if you are looking for something fabulous and different! Now that I know they have free Wi-Fi, I will be back for sure.  I was the only person in there but hope more people check out it, I want this place to succeed! So tasty treats, variety of drinks, art, free Wi Fi, booze and showing themselves via social media? Five stars indeed!
