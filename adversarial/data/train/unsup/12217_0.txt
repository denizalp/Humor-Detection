This spot is lauded as one of Vegas' best Thai restaurants, really? My experience was average, bordering on dismal. The menu mostly consists of classic dishes, priced on par with other Fremont St businesses. Unfortunately, the flavors aren't there. \n\nTRI COLOR CURRY: Tasted like a panang with extra veggies thrown in. Chicken in the dish was minimal. Curry was very creamy, but ordering a 3\/5 was considerably more mild than expected. I do appreciate that brown rice is available without a surcharge. Portion was ample for lunch. \nPAPAYA SALAD: $10 for a salad without any protein or flavor. Lots of shredded papaya, but the clearly-frozen-from-a-bag green beans were a complete turn off. The dressing lacked the acidity and pop to make it add anything other than moisture to the salad itself. \n\nI did not experience the service issues that others mention, but didn't see our server much to begin with. I was a little put off by their lack of a public bathroom?*- guess it's lucky I didn't get my curry as hot as I'd wanted, which would have made my guzzle down more water. \n\nProps for having bottles of San Miguel available, and the various outdoor seating areas with misters are a nice touch. But I've had better Thai from takeout spots that are half the price.\n\n*EDIT: I've been corrected that there is indeed a bathroom here, apparently it's outside? Perhaps the exterior signage should say \"bathrooms for customers only\" for clarity, as the sign was my only cue given that my server was only around for the ordering and check and we dined inside where no possible bathroom door existed.
