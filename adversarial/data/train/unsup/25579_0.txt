I had to visit yelp to see if I could have been forewarned how the bubble tea is NOT good. Granted it was my first time here and I only ordered one thing,totally ruined the mood for laying out in the sun, sipping on a cold bubble tea while reading a book. I ordered the pink rose tea - if ur a bubble tea fanatic (I'm from LA) definitely not what I was expecting. I can't really put into words what is this hot pink neon drink with only eight tapioca balls in it :( I'm too disappointed with this one to see if the green tea or taro tea would be any better...
