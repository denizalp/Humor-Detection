The food here was absolutely wonderful. My husband and I had breakfast here and just enjoyed everything that we ate. He ordered the Chorizo and loved it. It came with an amazing side of potatoes and roasted vegetables, tortillas, and beans. I'm fairly sure he nearly licked his plate clean!\n\nI ordered the chiliqueles with chicken which was an odd offering. I've never had chicken in chiliqueles before. Next time I would have ordered it with the vegetables. We also ordered coffee and it was fantastic. \n\nI would highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast, which is served all day.
