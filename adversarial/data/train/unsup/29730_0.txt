Fantastic place that I highly recommend! The owner\/operator provided excellent service and their menu is quite extensive.  We had a hard time choosing but both finally settled on the Applebutter Ham sandwich, it just sounded so unique we had to try it, what a wise choice! The sandwich is the perfect combo of sweet and savory and the spicy mustard and apple-butter combine for a taste explosion. The bolillo roll was lightly grilled so a perfect texture of slightly crispy edges yet still warm and soft. I had the side salad, awesome portion size with very fresh greens plus cucumber, tomato, onion, cheese and croutons with the homemade roasted vegetable vinaigrette, out of this world. My companion had the onion rings and there was a mountain of them with just the right amount of batter and crunch. Everything was so fresh and obviously made in-house. Staff was attentive and friendly, we had a great visit with the chef\/owner. Ambiance is so cute with fun signs to read and even purchase if ya want; everything was very clean and well maintained! We will definitely be back to try breakfast as that menu was quite tempting as well. Don't pass this place by!
