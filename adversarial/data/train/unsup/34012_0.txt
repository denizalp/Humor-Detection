This place is absolutely out of this world!! Stopped in as I was in Charlotte for the weekend and looked up vegan spots around town. This place popped up and was so delicious! We had the buffalo cauliflower and rodeo burger. The buffalo sauce and the dill dipping sauce were what set this place apart from other vegan joints I've eaten at. Such a pleasant visit and amazing service. Next time I'm in Charlotte this place is happening again!
