This is a truly excellent doctor but his office needs major help. The doctor really cares about his patient and wants to help but the office is poorly runned. Plus he's so booked its very difficult to get an appointment and they never answer the phone. The only reason I got in to see him was because I was very sick and another doctor I was seeing called to get me in to see him. Otherwise I would have had to wait months to see the doctor. What a shame because he is truly an excellent doctor!
