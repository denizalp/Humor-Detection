You wake up one morning and realize you have no breakfast food. In fact, you go look in your refrigerator and you realize all the cheese has become a science project and you have no cream for your coffee. Crap. You go sit down at the the table and ponder what your next step should be...do I go to the store and buy everything I need and try to assemble a half decent breakfast? By the time I get to the store, get back home, cook, eat, clean up, my morning is gone. That seems like too much effort on some days, doesn't it?\n\nThe answer?\n\nDrive to Chompie's. \n\n*By the time you put your baseball hat one, brush your teeth, get dressed and open the garage door: 10:15 a.m.\n*Go out to the driveway and pick up the weekend edition: 10:16 a.m.\n*Have a conversation with your neighbor about the irritating HOA rules and regulations and all the neighbors that don't pay attention to the HOA: 10:24 a.m.\n*Pull your car out of the garage and head to Chompies: 10:26 a.m.\n*Drive to 92nd Street and Shea, park and enter the restaurant: 10:40 a.m.\n*Wait for a table: 10:50\n*Your order a beverage while you browse the menu: 10:55\n*You realize its almost 11 a.m., which means that you can have breakfast or lunch and be within very good boundaries on either option. Should you have a 3\" High Reuben Sandwich on an onion roll, or Bagel and Lox? French Toast? Eggs, Bacon? Pancakes? \n\nThe possibilities are endless, the service is efficient and you didn't have to go to the grocery store.
