Been to the Saigon Kitchen 3 times now.  Once with a friend, another with my teenage daughter and other on a lunch date with my husband.  Will have to say have been absolutely pleased each time.  I ordered the Shaken beef (diced Filet Mignon) each time.  Husband ordered the Chicken Curry (which he liked) and we enjoyed egg rolls.  \n\nThe food has been hot, tastes fresh, excellent presentation and absolutely delicious.  Portions, in my opinion, are definitely a good portion---just right.  Entree is served with white rice, soup\/broth, and a tasty shredded side salad with a great Asian dressing.  \n\nStaff was polite and attentive, food came out in a timely manner.  Have thoroughly enjoyed my experience each time.   They play nice \"Global Ambient\" music, the restaurant is somewhat small yet cozy.  It has a nice \"grown up\" simple Asian feel.  Definitely a great place to meet a significant other or good friend to lunch.  \n\nNOT a place I would recommend for children; tables are somewhat close together and it has a relaxing feel.  Menu seemingly NOT designed with kids meals etc.  Also a bit expensive if considering price.  Hubby and I each had the Shaken Beef lunch with egg roll appetizer and drinks, it came out to $39.    Worth the money, but if you are watching budget on a lunch date, just something to consider.\n\nWe definitely have listed this as a favorite place for us to dine sans kids!
