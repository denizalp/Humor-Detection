Came here for the Meat Jun and left with so much more.\n\nFirst off, the banchan consisted of the standard cabbage and radish kimchi PLUS boiled peanuts! The boiled peanuts were delicious and complimentary! I had to refrain myself from eating too much so I still had room for the meat jun.\n\nI got the combo, which had the chicken teriyaki, galbi (short ribs), and meat jun. The chicken and galbi is juicy, tender and flavorful, but the meat jun was the real centerpiece.\n\nMeat jun is a fusion dish originating from Korean immigrants in Hawaii I believe. It's basically a tender piece of marinated beef pan-fried with a beaten egg. The marinade is a little sweet and has some soy sauce flavor. It compliments the tender, juicy beef perfectly. Add an egg and it's a unique and tasty dish! Highly recommended!\n\nThe tea they serve is very good too. \"Polygonatum tea\" apparently.\n\nLastly, the service was amazing. The waiter\/owner was very attentive with tea refills. He also told us about his experience in Hawaii, the special tea, and the meat jun. \n\nOne of the greatest restaurants in terms of food, service, and even artwork on the walls! Try the meatjun! You won't find it anywhere else!
