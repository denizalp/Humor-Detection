Body English is one of my favorite clubs in vegas. It's such a fun place to get hammered!! The music on friday nights are so good and the drinks will keep you going all night long. The dance floor is huge and there is a lounge area near the entrance. There are also small stages for the girls to dance on. If you are a guy and you try to dance on it, you will be asked to step down. Sorry, fellas. It's off the strip but worth a drive. The guys are pretty good looking too. ;)
