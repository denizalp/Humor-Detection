Sorry Crawford you kind of suck. And not because of crap management... its just one of those spaces that no matter what has an awful layout.\n\nOk so they have music here and djs... dj booth in the upstairs is in the front behind the door people.... the wall across from the dj is tables... beside the dj booth is tables... the only other open space is in front of the bar where everyone crowds around to order drinks or just stand because there is NOWHERE TO GO. \n\nOk so now you're sick of the upstairs and want to go downstairs... excellent... oh but theres a huge line and you need to wait to go downstairs. Super. Did I mention that in the back where you go downstairs theres like a balcony type thing overlooking the floor downstairs... oh its also a real pain to stand anywhere back there.\n\nThe only real tollerable place to be in this bar where you don't feel like you're in anyones way is in the basement.. everywhere else people are walking past you all the time.... I get annoyed when I feel I am in peoples way... because I like to move to a place where I am not constantly being walked by or pushed through and Crawford is one of those places where its almost unavoidable no matter where you go.\n\nAlso the bathrooms... there is one bathroom for the huge bar and has 3 stalls in the womens... its a nightmare if you need to pee. Oh also... yeah the bathrooms are in the BASEMENT. So enjoy lining up to go  downstairs then line up again for the bathroom.\n\nThis bar however has consistantly good nights booked at it, good bartenders, and friendly staff... it just sucks that this space is crap.
