When my refrigerator went out - I spent some time pricing new refrigerators and searching for comparable used ones on craigslist.  I determined it would be much more cost effective to have mine fixed and avoid the hassle!  I looked on yelp to find a repair company that had good ratings and found Phoenix Appliance Repair Services.  I contacted them on the phone and indicated what the problem was.  I talked with Vladimir.  I texted him my address and manufacturer name.  He was able to get to my house the same day, as well identify and fix the problem for an affordable price!   It has been several weeks since the repair and my refrigerator is working great!  He is a family man, very personable and professional.  He does have a bit of a accent so there were some communication issues, regardless I'm overall very satisfied with the service and would recommend him\/Phoenix Appliance Repair Services to all of you Yelpers!  The visit is $75 and that is wrapped into the repair cost if you move forward.  His direct number is: 602-330-6920.
