If you are a fan of Middle East food the menu here will please you. Be careful of the hot sauce because it is quite hot. For vegetarians there are a variety of tasty dishes especially the chili soups. Be careful not to look at the beautiful cakes in the display as you will gain weight just looking. Can be quite crowded on weekends with long waits. Try the sampler plate to acquaint yourself with the foods they serve.
