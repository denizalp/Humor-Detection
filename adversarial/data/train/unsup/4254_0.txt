I was actually really happy with my visit here, the minute I walked in, the workers were nothing but sweet and very informative on everything. I was only brought here by groupon though because I felt the need for a microdermabrasion so I gave it a try because it was $16 so why not? The inside looks very nice and cozy and welcoming and they do offer free water. I had Veronica and she was awesome, basically gave me a facial for $20 extra and even gave me great information on how to take care of my skin. They do facials here for $40 the facials come as a full package with a peel and some other stuff. Afterwards my face looked a little gross but I mean after 3 days it'll heal and she also told me about using Apple cider vinegar as a toner and I definitely recommend! It actually works, but anyways I'd recommend. The Place is a little far though, I stay in the southwest side and this shop is in Henderson so it's quite the drive. Try this place out you won't regret it
