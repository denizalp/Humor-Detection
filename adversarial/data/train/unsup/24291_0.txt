Ok so I'm not a sushi expert or anything but to me the place was average. The service was excellent but we were the only ones there. The price was great for rolls and sashimi but selection was average. \nI wanted the sashimi salad but don't eat salmon and the waitress said couldn't have it then as it's premade?!?!?! Premade sashimi salad???? So I got the screaming O and I've had better... Ok you can insert your own dirty joke but the tuna sashimi had a Cajun rub on it which wasn't great. The dish seemed skimpy for double order and the sauce was a little runny. I'm not into fried sushi and no real unique spicy tuna rolls it seemed..... Everyone else had good things to say so maybe it's just what I ordered. \nSo I'll maybe try it one more time but I won't rush and I don't think with all the other places it would be a fave. It didn't help either we had to call to find it as the sign still says kabuki.... But the great company made time fly by!
