Want to hear something funny? I went to the Vintage Chophouse full well knowing that they have nothing vegetarian on their menu and guess what? I had one of my all-time favourite vegetarian meals here. Weird eh?\n\nA bunch of friends and I went over this weekend and when the waitor came by and found out I was a vegetarian, he just smiled and said no problem. He went and talked to the Chef and they custom-made me one of the most delicious meals I've ever had!\n\nWhat I noticed most was that their ingredients were ridiculously fresh, and the fact that the service was some of the best I've ever experienced, made Vintage one of my all-time favourite fine dining experiences in Calgary.\n\nI know it's funny, but the next time your vegetarian friend says 'Yes, Vintage Chophouse is one of my favourite restaurants in the city', you may want to laugh, but trust me, I'm right there with 'em.
