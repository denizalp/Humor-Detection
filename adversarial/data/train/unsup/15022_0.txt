Best theme park we've ever been to. We are coaster whores and they had a great selection to choose from. Caught a $30 promo online for our tickets, can't go wrong at that price. Considering the number of coasters and our limited schedule, we got on board with the Fast Lane Plus. Not cheap for sure, but we had more money than time and were very happy that using the lane put us within five minutes of launch every time. Most of our wait time on our visit was with the four or five 2nd and 3rd tier coasters that didn't have Fast Lanes yet. \n\nFood prices were fine, but we didn't sample much as the Fast Lane Plus had us in and out in less than five hours. The refill drink deal was most of what we needed. Behemoth and Leviathan were huge and fantastic. The park was clean, people were nice and all the rides were open all day. They also had a lot of fun looking thrill rides for us to try on any future visits. Parking was easy and cheap and traffic in the area was fine. This park blew away most of our Six Flags visits. Cedar Fair lack the hype, but are always a great experience.
