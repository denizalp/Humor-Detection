came here for lunch today had their combo meals with free soup. Taste is ok not outstanding. had the grilled fish and stuffed bangus.both were dried out on the inside.Its a turo turo style so there was no service whatsoever except for them getting the food you picked.\nThe place could be cleaner.\nWe saw a whole lot of other filipino fast food style restaurant. Would try it out
