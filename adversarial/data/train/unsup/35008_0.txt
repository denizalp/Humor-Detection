Where do I even begin? Fast, simple and delicious! It took me merely seconds before I decided on what I wanted to order. I simply had to choose a topping of my choice along with a type of noodle. Within a few minutes (exactly 2 minutes), I received my bowl of noodles. If you're looking for a quick lunch, this is the place for you! You will be out the door in less than 20 minutes. \n\nFishball Noodle in Soup ($5.00):\n\nMy meal was a combination of a clear and well-seasoned broth, a generous amount of silky-smooth Chinese rice noodles and 4 chewy and spongy fish balls. I like adding a few drops of the complimentary hot oil to my bowl of noodles before I indulge in it. Do you know that thrilling feeling when you eat hot and spicy food? I'm obsessed with it. \n\nMoreover, I love the open concept of the kitchen - you can watch the chefs prepare the fishballs and cook your meal right in front of you. This place reminds me of the noodle stalls in Hong Kong -  the restaurant layout, customer service and most importantly the food!
