This DMV location has gotten more efficient since I first came here to get my learners permit...about a million years ago. But having to deal with this place still warrants a deep belly groan.  \n\nIt's true, going to the DMV is pretty much is the last the thing anyone ever wants to do, but just plan a head and be prepared to wait. I'm sure most of you reading this right now know and understand the trials of dealing with the DMV, so instead of tips I'm highlighting a DMV survival kit that will ease the pain of this adulthood task. \n\n1) Get here early! Seriously, wake up before the crack of dawn and get here. This will cut down on your time spent in this den of despair. \n2) Have all your paperwork organized and in-hand. \n3) Prime seating. Somewhere near the bathroom (damn Starbucks) and within sight of the numbers being called. D-485, Now Serving D-485.\n4) Bring water and snacks. This will come in handy when you get that prime seating location. Because If hunger pains beckon you to the vending machine, you might return to find your seat taken by an overtired mom and seven screaming kids.  \n5) Headphones! Video games, music, Netflix. This also drowns out the white noise of the DMV.\n6) Last, but not least...extra funds. You never when that speeding ticket from 6 years ago, that you forgot about, will pop-up! \n\nBONUS ITEMS:\n* Pillow and blanket\n* Portable, but still ridiculously big TV\n* Margarita Machine\n* Full desktop computer w\/ tower\n* Kimchi & Onion\/Garlic based sub-sandwich\n\nHave fun!
