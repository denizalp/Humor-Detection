I'm not sure why I never reviewed Well & Being at Willow Stream ... Oh .. right... I want to keep it a secret.  \n\nOk... so .. Spas are great... and most are focused on relaxation...regrettably, it appears that spas have now become the \"springboard\" pre-marriage or pre-baby \"fun spot\"... BLEK!!!!!  \n\nThank god this place is upscale, extremely professional and does not seem to encourage a \"party\" environment.    Although I loved Joya back when... however, it soon became abused by the \"1st time spa\" groups.. This type of behavior is not conducive to a relaxing experience.   None-the-less I try and avoid weekends at any spa primarily for that reason.\n\nWell & Being has the best layout in the valley..  Tranquil, multi level, professional ... and great hiding places if you want to avoid over-hearing true life comparisons to the \"fifty shades of grey\" book.  (Side note: .. after overhearing so many of these stories... it's clear people are sheltered and not well traveled).\n\nThe Men's facilities are modern, masculine & very clean.  Grooming amenities are not highly scented or offensive.  Full services include swiss shower, steam, jacuzzi, cold plunge, sauna and eucalyptus inhalation room.  The \"shaving bar\" turns a chore into a pleasure!  \n\nThey have an awesome custom designed co-ed hydrotherapy \/ waterfall area, which has about 5 different waterfalls.  Each one is specifically engineered to provide focused \/ defined pressure and therapies to the guest... unfortunately some people don't realize the engineering marvel and tend to \"linger & chat\" thus delaying others from using the therapy for its intended purpose. \n\nThe entire staff is always professional and inherently willing to go above and beyond. I have never encountered a rude or condescending staff member, which is so common in that industry.  I've only booked the same massage therapist and that's Dan... I have no reason to see anyone else; he is a true professional, with the skill and background to ensure a truly effective session!  \n\nThe lunches are always good...but I have to thank god that the cob salad is on the menu, That's my choice to ensure I get a good sized meal, that is not completely \"spa stripped\" of the typical manly enjoyments of fat and flavor.   \n\nI hope that this review has both interested the serious and frightened off the groups of loud, obnoxious people that want an inexpensive avenue to recognize a special someone.
