Pretty darn impressed. \n\nThe interior is old, drab and clean! \nThe food is hot, yummy and great. \n\nDo not let the exterior fool you this is legit food. \n\nWe had Sun devil Chicken....spicey \nChicken fried Rice... perfect \nSteamed dumpling.. i swear they are homemade \nSesame chicken... great flavor and nice chicken, not shitty stuff here. \n\nThe service is amazing, they packed all the food into a box, taped it all down so it didn't move and gave all the extras you need to enjoy a nice take out. \n\nWay to go Tam!
