Im sad that my daughter has this condition and that she has to see many dotors but I'm happy that Dr. Nelson was helpful and honest . I had to wait 3 months for my appointment and i was in the office for about 4 hours but I had no choice. The wait was not horrible everyone was nice even the other patients which made me think that it was worth it. The front desk asked me for a referral and i didnt have it so she ask me to call my doctors office to fax it over to them and it was sent  right away. Luckaly I had my insurance card. There is a childrens waiting room that was full but the kids were behaved. They had cartoons and books with a bench. My daughter was treated sweet and they answerd all her questions and mine. Also when my daughter was leaving one of the nurses gave her a prize and rememberd my daughter mentioned her brother and gave him a prize that was also sweet. The only thing is that the waiting rooms feels dingy I know that a lot of kids go there and  kids are messy and dirty but maybe clean the carpets more often or add something colorful in the front, maybe a hanging plant. There are companys that take care of them for you. :-) but I dont know the budget  blue is more relaxing then grey
