Seriously amazing! Not only is the food great, but the staff is really friendly as well. I tell myself that I'll try something new every time I go, but I typically always end up ordering the original g po-boy because it's that good. I managed to get all of my friends hooked on it as well. If it's your first time at Green, you have to try a tsoynami for dessert. I just recently had the pumpkin pie tsoynami (seasonal I'm assuming), and it's hands-down my favorite so far. If I lived closer, I'd be here way more often. They should definitely consider opening another location.
