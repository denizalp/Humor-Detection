This is my favorite non-chain breakfast spot and that's saying a lot because I would normally pick sleep over waking up for breakfast. It would take a lot for me to sacrifice an extra few hours of snoozing - this place is THAT special. I actually look forward to eating here...well, once every few months.\n\nThey have eggs benedict and a variety of omelets hence the name \"Omelet House\". Don't bother getting toast, make the right decision and pick the banana bread. It's delicious, warm, buttery and it's huge. It's like having dessert for breakfast - what a treat! My favorites are country club\/ sparticus\/ 38 special...in baby version which is still quite big (3 eggs). Your omelet will come with a side of potatoes. They're like thick freshly-made potato chips and oh-so good! You're off to a great morning and nothing can ruin your day.\n\nAside from omelets, they also have pancakes, waffles, sandwiches and burgers - I haven't tried them. With omelets served here, I don't need to try anything else. But I would imagine they're good too.
