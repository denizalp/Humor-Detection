This is an excellent place to visit on a hot summer's day, wether it's with your family or friends. Everything they serve is very fresh, from the slushes to their unique diamond bars. They have nice walls you can take pictures by as well. The staff are very friendly and help out with whatever you need. I 100% recommend this place to anyone that wants to cool down from the Arizona heat
