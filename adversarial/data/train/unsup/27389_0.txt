My husband and I purchased granite for our kitchen remodel. We wanted a central local owned business for our project. We selected Choice Granite and Marble. Choice Granite and Marble had a very nice selection of unique stone so we could customize our kitchen. The sales and installation staff was excellent. We can recommend this company.
