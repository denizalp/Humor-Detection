I love the dowd y . Love that it is so close to my office  making it easy to fit into my day. My favorite class is the roc it circuit training class. My goal is to do 3 supersprint triathalons. Just started the master swim  and I am learning lots. Great support for whatever you do.  Only down side parking if you go between 5-6  although I just received email  that they now have extra parking at surrounding office and church. I like checking in with Bryan on second floor if I don't see him in a while he notices and it keeps me accountable.  Great people working there keep me feeling like I belong  and supported in what ever my goal.
