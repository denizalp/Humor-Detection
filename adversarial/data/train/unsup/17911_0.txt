The  part of this airport I visited was extremely dirty. They had construction gogimg on at the time that was not secured up properly anyone walking fast could trip and fall before they even realize what's going on!  I didn't really notice anything else after that, The corridor we had to walk through to get to our connecting flight was half the size because of the construction, it was very cluttered with people going to and fro trying to get to where they were going. Hope it gets fixed soon!
