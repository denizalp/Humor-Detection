I just arrived.  The cart crew was very friendly and took my clubs and answered any questions that I had.  I then proceeded into the pro shop and met Tom.  Right off the bat he could see that I did not owe anything because I paid it online at a pretty good discount. The way he spoke to me and treated me was very unprofessional.  I indicated that I've heard of him by the reviews on yelp which were not and his favor to say the least.  Tom's comments back to me were I don't read those reviews and I don't care about those reviews.  I then told him if someone is going to take time to write a review whether it be good or bad, I feel it comes from the heart. He said again that he doesn't care. I am giving it 2 stars and I have not even played yet.
