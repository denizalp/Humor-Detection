I have been to the Yonge and Bloor location many times, but have decided to try this location which is close to work. Restaurant is very spacious and it is one of the better Chinese restaurants downtown that's not really expensive. They have lunch specials that range from $10 to $15 that comes with rice, a spring roll and a salad. My recommendation is the spicy beef noodles from their regular menu - it's actually not that spicy, just has a bit of a kick - and the beef briskets are quite tender.\n\nWas going to knock a star off as we had to ask our server several times to bring us cutlery for sharing the food, but the free dessert at the end made up for it.
