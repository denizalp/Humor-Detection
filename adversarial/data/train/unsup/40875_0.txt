The hubs and I visited for lunch over the weekend. We started with white queso and added ground beef. The chips seemed very fresh and like most queso, we made it disappear quickly. The salsa was excellent. We both ordered enchiladas. His were \"de Dennis\" and looked a lot better than my run of the mill cheese enchiladas. Service was prompt and friendly. We will definitely give it another go.
