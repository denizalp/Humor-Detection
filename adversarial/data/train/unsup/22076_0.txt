Attention Women Yelpers! \n\nDr. Edward Spoon....\n\nSpoon was referred to me by my boyfriend's childhood friend whose wife has been seeing Spoon for  many years now. \n\nI always have had bad experiences with OB\/GYN's and I change doctors yearly because I feel uncomfortable with them, given the fact that it is an uncomfortable situation already. I am just so fed up with these doctors who just looks at my chart, repeats everything that is written and when being asked questions, they put the chart down, take off their reading glasses and look up at the popcorn ceilings as if they are trying to memorize a speech from college! And yet they have not given any eye contact for a professional ease that they are about to perform a procedure that should make me feel comfortable at the least! Instead, they rush the procedure like, BAM WHAM THANK YOU MAM!! NEXT CATTLE, PLEASE? \n\nOh no!! \n\nOn the contrary, when I went to see Dr. Spoon for the first time.  He took me into his office for a one on one consultation. Never in my life, I have had a doctor take me into his office and sat down to talk about my medical history and any of my concerns that actually listened thoroughly and answered all of my queries in a softspoken and attentive manner!!! The consultation occurs before he even examines you and I must say....all doctors in the world should take notes from Dr. Spoon! He is amazing and even though my new insurance changed and Dr. Spoon's office does not take new insurance, I will still go see Dr. Spoon and pay in full!  It took me 14 years to find a very good Gynecologist and a las, I found someone who is professional, attentive and makes their patients feel comfortable to say the least!!! \n\n5 Stars for Dr. Edward Spoon and staff!!!
