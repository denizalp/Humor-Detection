I was disappointed, the food is just too bland!\n\nMy husband and I ordered a variety of food to get an idea of there food spectrum: Garlic Chicken Kabob, Lamb Vindaloo, Palak Paneer, Garlic Naan, Gulab Jamun, and Rass Malai.\n\nThe only positives I saw was that the meat was cooked well...that's it! The sauces for each dish lacked flavor and spice. My husband even requested Indian spicy and it wasn't even spicy...it tasted like a mild. The Garlic Naan was decent.\n\nAt this point we were going to give it a 3...barely! Then the desserts came...\n\nThe gulab jamun was firm and frozen and it seemed like they added extra butter\/ghee to the syrup. The Rass Malai was too thick and creamy, it seemly like it was soaked in heavy cream, which messed up the texture of the paneer. And after we saw the bill, their score plummeted to 2. \n\nIt was not worth it. So many of my classmates have gushed about how great the food is, but I realized, they probably dont know any better. I grew up near Little India around LA where good Indian food was no hard to find, so I could just be spoiled.
