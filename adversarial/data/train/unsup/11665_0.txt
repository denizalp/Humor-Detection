This was a really delicious pizza, fast paced, a little loud, but superbly organized place.\n\nGoing in for the first time and not knowing what my options were, the staff person was super friendly and had me select what base pizza and toppings I would have. They did speak really fast though, and so for a loud place like this, realistically, I saw their mouth movie and heard sounds but couldn't exactly make out what they were saying.\n\nWell anyways, this pizza store is an order and sit down kind of restaurant. It reminds me of an upgraded subway type order with a pizz upa upgraded twist to it. You can order a half or a full pizza slice, with your choice of sauce (tomato, pesto, etc.) and the cheese slash toppings you want. If you don't want cheese on your pizza, not a problem, blaze pizza will alter that option for you.\n\nThe pizzas cost a little more than $10 for a size of about a small or medium if you order from a place like pizza pizza or one of the chain restaurants, but its definitely worth it. There's gluten free options, salad choices and yes, it's fired up for you! \n\nThey also have additional boxes on the side if you can't finish your pizza!
