I have been \"testing\" different hot yoga studios around town to see which one I would like to join full time. After attending Bikram yoga for two months, I tried 103 hot yoga and it was definitely a different experience. \n\nThe room is not as hot or humid as Bikram which is a plus for me. The humidity always makes me nauseous so I felt like I was able to push myself a little more here. During the 75 minute class, there is music playing in the background. I am sure I will get used to this but it was weird. It was nice to hear a little Elton & Beatles though. :) I had a hard time hearing the instructor over the music at first but she was very helpful when it came to poses I was not familiar with. \n\nMy biggest downfall was the chitter chatter amongst attendees. I go to yoga to de-stress, relax and unwind and the talking was distracting. Especially when it happens in between poses and at the end of class. The end of class is important to soak up all the benefits of the class and it was hard with the noise. \n\nOverall, I would like to try more classes since there are many more on the schedule. I will be giving it another try.
