Best breakfast in Rock Hill hands down. Wait staff is quick and efficient. Food is delicious! They have all the basic breakfast items you'd expect but with a modern and southern twist. There will be fire (brown butter biscuits with chicken gravy and jalape√±o jam) is worth the trek alone! Not a fan of their chili.  But for such high praises on the food, there are some definite downfalls. There is a community table running the full length of the restaurant, so if seats open up its best to grab them. The wait for tables is ridiculous. Coming on a Sunday morning? Forget it. Wait times vary from 40 mins to over an hour. If you have a party over 5 they don't have the tables to accommodate. Also, they run out of basic breakfast staples often. More times than not they will run out of biscuits! That being said the food alone means you have to try it out (just not on a weekend).
