Greyhound in the Sky!\n\nAnother under whelming trip with WJ. Yes, again late departures on both ends which is caused by their denial that you cannot turn a 737 around in 10 minutes after it arrives. The quick turns are very apparent when you have a flight near the end of the day and see all the particulate on the floor and who knows what caused the smudges on your pleather seat - bodily fluids?\n\nDurfy talks a good story but all you have to do is fly and WJ and remember: \"You get what you pay for\". Slag AC all you want but it is a more professional atmosphere than WJ.\n\nCookies or pretzles? Peanuts? No, we have to be politically correct and appease the nut allergy freaks. But, one row ahead of me on the flight from YYC to EWR was a dog - give me a suitcase of peanuts over a mangy mutt anyday.
