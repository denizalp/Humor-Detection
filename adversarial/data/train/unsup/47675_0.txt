My wife would give it a solid 5 star, cause she doesnt eat much red meat but for me it is one of the best part of the japanese kitchen. The service there is better than an avarage sushi place. Selection of food is just good enough. Only one thing is missing for me that is the red meat that they use is not that great but other than that thay are simply one of the best sushi place in toronto.
