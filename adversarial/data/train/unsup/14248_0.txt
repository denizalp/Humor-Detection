It is really hard not to love a place that kept throwing money at you.  Now I never stayed here in the hotel.  I will just tell you my experience.  I was walking across the bridge to cut through CVS and I saw the Treasure Island(TI) sign for blackjack.  I love blackjack but of course had a yard of margaritas with me and decided to give it a go.  It was easy to find the blackjack tables and it was $10 a hand in the evening. All I was doing was winning. from 70 - 500.  SIgn up for a players card if you feel like you might be at the table for a while.  I will be back, love treasure island, they just throw money at you.
