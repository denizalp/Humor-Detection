I was having problems with my transmission so I took it in with a coupon for a tune up. The problem I was having with the transmission was more than a tune up. The owner Jason which is the person that greeted me. Told me what my issue was and that he wasn't going to charge me for or do the tune up. Reason being was, there would be a tune up with the repair to the transmission. That was 2 years ago now. I've been going to him ever since. This shop is very honest.  I went to them for a second opinion. After going to the dealer. They gave me the same diagnosis but a cheaper repair bill. I would highly recommend this automotive repair shop to anybody even my grandparents.
