Total garbage. Its irritating that they have absolutely no problem taking advantage of the hard working Boeing employees. Mostly fried bar food, and anything that isn't unhealthy shit is ridiculously expensive. I made the mistake of getting 3 sausages (plain with mustard), a banana, and a diet coke. Any guesses on cost? About $19. Wow. Same with breakfast. 3 eggs? About $2.10. Not too bad. Throw some tomatoes and onions on? Now it's a $4 veggie omelette. Seriously, fuck this place. Boeing needs to fire Aramark. We're a Fortune 500 company. We can afford to take care of our employees. If Intel can do it, so can we.
