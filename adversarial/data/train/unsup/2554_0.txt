We finally booked our room at the Nobu.\n\nThey have their own Valet section which is basically part of Caesars. When I stayed it was free.\n\nIf your not familiar with the Nobu it may be a little difficult to find. We know our way around Caesars so it was a snap to get two with minimal luggage.\n\nThere is a small check in area and since we normally check in early, we were waited on right away. Everything was a snap including the early check in for free. \n\nIf your looking for a secure hotel this is one of the best. You need a key card just to get intro the hotel and there is always someone watching the elevators.\n\nThe room was a little small but most boutique hotel room are just that. That make up for it in it's uniqueness. It definitely gives you the Japanese vibe especially in the bathroom. \n\nThe views are not like the Augustus room views, so don't purchase these rooms if you expect a grand view. Ours wasn't bad. Unlike others we did not hear any noise at all. Our room was super quit and comfy. No complaints at all really.\n\nWe were invited to the 50th anniversary party that night and had an amazing time! Gordon Ramsey came out for a bit and set the stage for an unforgettable fireworks display!\n\nPros: Quiet\n         Security\n         Secure elevator. No weirdos following you around your floor. \n         very friendly staff\n         Nice clean rooms\n         \nCons: Views from the room.  \n\nWe will be back!
