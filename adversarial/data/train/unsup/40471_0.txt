Food and service were great. I got the Attack of the Green Tomatoes as an appetizer and couldn't have been happier. \n\nFor my meal I got the Corney Beast. Other than being a little heavy due to the cornmeal better the sandwich was amazing. Also had a chance. To try the Chicken and Waffles and was fantastic.
