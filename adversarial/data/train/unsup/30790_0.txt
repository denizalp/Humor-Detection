LVCC prepared and delivered the wedding cake for our September 2016 wedding reception.  Not being a LV resident, we were so happy to have a communicative and responsive bakery through email.  They were willing to help refer us to a reception venue as well.\n\nOur cake was the perfect size, color, cuteness....pretty much everything.  Coming from a chef\/baker family, I could not imagine a more perfect cake for our special day.  THANK YOU SO MUCH LVCC.  If you are looking for a bakery that will make you the cake you that want, please, look no further!
