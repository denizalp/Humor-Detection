I would love this place alot more if i could ever figure out where to order or where to pick up my food.  Super disorganize layout.  The food is average for the aiport, but decent coffee.  Its definitely a better than the  taco joint next door.  However, your best bet at sky harbor is to eat on the main concourse in terminal 4.  Once you get past security the selection of food drastically narrows.
