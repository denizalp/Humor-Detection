The atmosphere on a spring break Saturday night was electric. Televisions showing March Madness And USA  baseball. The bar tenders served drinks quickly while we waited to be seated. We sat within 20 minutes. Ordered Carne Asada and Mahi Mahi tacos. Also ordered chips salsa with guacamole. The food was delicious and the service was prompt and friendly. Recommend this place when in Tempe.
