Food was absolutely horrible ! Never had tacos like these before ! The taste was just undelightful. The meat my tacos had was not fully cooked so it still felt gushy. I also had a michelada which I've ordered before and it tasted nothing like it. The place is really nice though. Love the atmosphere just would never recommend to eat here. Oh and make sure you bring MONEY; everything is charged even hot sauces !!!!!
