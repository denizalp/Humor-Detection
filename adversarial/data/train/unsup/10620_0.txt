I love the food here....\n\nThe food is order through stations. Their Street Corn is mouth watering. Their nachos are the bomb. Their tacos are so diverse. Their bowls are great. Their quesadillas with steak are addicting. Anything I've eating here is worth coming back for. That's why this place gets five stars, their food is fabulous!\n\nSoooooo what's the problem....\n\nTheir service sucks! I always feel like they serve the spanish speakers with better service and respect than those who speak English. Every single time! If I ask for extra cheese or no avacado or anything to peronalize my dish, all I get are eye rolls and they ignore my requests. If I want my order togo, they suddenly become extremely rude. They are stingy with their sauce caps, they don't want to give me a togo bag. \n\nOverall....\n\nLove the food, hate the service. So if you can ignore the rude attitude and enjoy your food. This place is perfect.
