On one of my adventures into Kensington market, I decided to go try out some of the new mexican restaurants that have popped up.  Seeing how this place had people almost out the door (and it was 2PM) I had to see what all the fuss was about.\n\nThe little shop is just that... little.  It seats maybe 8 people and that's about it (there's hardly any standing room).  Apparently they just opened there the day I went as they told me they had just moved from their old location.\n\nThe menu is pretty simple, you'll notice a very seafood orientated theme (although there are non-poisson options).  I personally got the Gobernador (how can you not? It's on the window!).\n\nHoly mackerel!  or rather marlin!  The Gobernador is probably THE BEST FISH TACO I've ever had.  I wish I was eating it right now while writing this.  The Gobernador is a smoked marlin taco with shrimp inside; It's absolutely ridiculous.  Make sure you're packing some napkins because it won't be a clean fight with this taco.
