So I went to Douches on Wheels. \n\nAnd I feel as though I'm doing the general population of Toronto a huge injustice by giving this place one star; I apologize because there is no option to give it simply one or none.  \n\nI walked into the store and all I could smell in the air was a very strong scent\/cologne on the employees, a cologne that they probably purchased from a sample sale that you probably weren't cool enough to have heard about, a scent that just screamed \"ugh-I-hate-all-these-customers-that-are-walking-in-ugh-I don't-want-to-make-eye-contact-ugh-I'd rather-be-home-listening-to-dilla-and-reading-pitchfork\".\n\nSo I approach an employee who works there, oh yeah sorry, I think he'd rather I address him as a \"bicycle mechanics enthusiast slash part time blogger, and he converses with me in a manner that makes me feel as though I failed grade 2 twice and am being given a monotonous and phonetically broken down dictation about a general tune up.\n\nThen another overly animated bicycle mechanics enthusiast directs me to the counter where the pedals are on display in a fashion that would make many think that I was directionally challenged and he was just a very helpful and enthused and excited to help a girl understand which way is left and which way is right.\n\nI explained to the bicycle mechanic at the back that in addition to a general tune up, I'd like these new pedals I just had purchased to be screwed in (very IKEA-esque type of installation labour was required to do this). I could have done it myself but hey, why not just get the fella to screw them in while he is operating on my ride? \n\nThat was all.\n\nI get a call a week or so later from a dude and he lets me know that I can come pick it up.\n\nSame service \/ feel \/ambiance as last time.\n\nAnd the bill? It was a magnificent total of fuck-this-place-never-coming-here-again dollars & suck-my-dick cents.\n\nThere are approximately 9,248,783 other better places for your bike in this city.
