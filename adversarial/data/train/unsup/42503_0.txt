First time going here and this place was awesome! Mike was our server and service was excellent. I got the 3lb stuffed lobster and this was my first lobster and it was fantastic and they crack it for you! Atmosphere is really cool being under ground and they had the best crab cakes I've ever had. Would for sure recommend.
