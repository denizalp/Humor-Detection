I have called the referred number 3 times. 3 different days. The phone has been answered but never any communication. We exchange 5 \"Hello? Anyone there? HELLO?\" Before she hangs up on me. I arrived 11:30 am to the referred address. The front door is open that leads to a corridor. Theres a boom box radio and magazines, the next door is locked. I knocked hard enough to hear twice and no one answered. The heck is going on???? How does this woman Colette even get business...????? WELP!! Im on my way to another salon to spend my money. Booooooo
