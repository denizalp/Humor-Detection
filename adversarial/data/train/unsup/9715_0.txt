If you need a good laugh, go next door from the Scottsdale Gun Club to see this store. When I went in on a Saturday late afternoon,  it was run by a bunch of kids(I'm thinking 18 ). While this isn't necessarily funny ,watching these stooges definitely was! One kept pulling out his gun and cocking it (who knows where all those bullets went.. or if he caught them all). Two of the employees had a conversation like this: First employee:\"So,  how's your AIDS coming along?\" Second Employee\" You know I'm telling -insert girl's name here- that you want to screw her.\"  As I walked around the store,  no one asked if I needed assistance,  but  that one guy sure was becoming an expert on pulling his gun and cocking it. Hmmm. hopefully they all have a family business they can fall into, otherwise our tax dollars might be supporting these fine young citizens in the future.
