Unreliable, I've had a cough that lasted for almost a week now, the doctor quickly listened to my breathing and said I'm fine it's just a sinus infection. Even with the green and brown phlegm. He prescribed me a steroidal nasal spray. I knew something wasn't right due to me coughing all night. I went to another walk in for a second opinion, she actually said I'm developing bronchitis and needed antibiotics! That's why I've been coughing so much. I've been here a couple times before (barely any waiting time) but I find myself doubting their diagnosis and going to another walk in to find out it's something else. It's always unreliable. Also they had a child working at the front answering phone calls. I called regarding some samples and all he could say was \"oh I don't know.\" Seriously?! Never going back again. I would give 0 stars if I could.
