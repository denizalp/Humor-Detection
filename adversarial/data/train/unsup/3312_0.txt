Thank you all the Yelpers for leaving useful reviews on this place because I would've never found this place without Yelp since it's not advertised on Review Journal and kind of hidden next to Shabu Shabu Paradise. Solid five star!!\nCame here for Sunday lunch. Had to wait about 20 min. I usually don't like to wait but it was worth the wait.\n\nChopped salad... Ordered this dressing on the side. Very flavorful and tasty even without the garlic vinaigrette dressing. \n\nCrab avocado dip... Delicious!! They put a lot of big chunks of crab meat in it. Nice and creamy taste comes with chips. Must try if you are not watching calories.  \n\nFrittata... I asked the waitress what's healthy and she recommended this. It was egg white and lots of veggies. Loved it! Maybe they forgot to put salt?? But it was good since I'm trying to be on low salt low sugar diet when I can. Plus you can always add salt yourself anyways.\n\nNote: I think it's cute to use tin laundry basket as a trash can in the ladies room but the used paper towels and trash was piling up like a mountain (on the floor, too) and I saw some disgusting stuff in there... I thought using the cute tin basket as a trash can for place like this (busy and packed) was not a good idea.
