Bought floor sample on assurance of next day delivery as I was leaving town for 2 months. Next day no delivery and when I called it apparently was never scheduled. Huge waste of time and they expressly misled me to purchase based on delivery promise. I have cancelled and they agreed to refund. We will see if that comes through by email as agreed or whether there is yet another problem.
