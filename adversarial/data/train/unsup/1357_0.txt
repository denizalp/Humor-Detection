Shame shame. I've been with barefoot pools for well over a year and I've never had a problem until a few months ago. I had noticed a new pool cleaner was coming out every few weeks and had thought nothing of it because the pool still looked great, but then one day it didn't. In fact, it looked like someone showed up for 5 minutes and cleaned a few leaves out of the pool and left. There was still dirt at the bottom and on the stairs and overall it looked really bad. This continued for a total of about a month and I confronted the pool cleaner about it, to which he replied that a lot of wind was blowing things into my pool. I pointed to the trees to show him there was no wind and no way (in this particular instance) that this happened. Ultimately, I requested someone else to come service my property and they kept sending the same person. Oh, but I was told he was now being supervised which is why the pool looks better. If you have to supervise an employee to make sure they do their job then they shouldn't be working with your customers or with your company. PERIOD. \n\nI finally decided to leave barefoot pools today, after speaking with the manager, Brandon. I simply asked for the month to be comped and to ensure the job was done correctly moving forward and he said he would only comp 2-weeks of service. Personally, I think if someone has been a long time customer and they are upset that you do what it takes to make them happy, especially when it simply involves righting a very wrong month of service. Sadly, I was told my request couldn't be met and \"Barefoot pools just isn't a good fit for me\". \n\nCan't remember the last time a company showed such little regard for their customer relationships, or how they speak to customers. I'll sure miss the good times.
