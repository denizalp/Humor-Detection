I ordered a custom cake with one day notice, and was very happy with it. The black forrest cake was delish! I will definitely come back. I am from the SF Bay Area, and have been unimpressed with bakeries in Phoenix until I found this place. It was a nice dense cake that was not overly sugary. All the ingredients tasted fresh, and the service at the bakery was wonderful.
