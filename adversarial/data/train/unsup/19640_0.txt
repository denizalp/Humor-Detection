The thing I love most about brunching in Montreal is the variety you'll find in the restaurants and the unique offerings of places like the Burgundy Lion. \n\nAdmittedly, I'm a little biased towards anything that'll give me a nice cut of beef before noon, but their bubble & squeak is just one of the awesome offerings on their menu. Ranging from about $7 to $15, the prices are really reasonable and the food is well worth it. \n\nIf you're heading there during the week, the English-inspired lunches and dinners (including Indian curry dishes that add some extra English authenticity) are also a treat, with extra points to the chocolate-chip bread pudding for being CRAZY DELICIOUS (in all caps). \n\nAdorned with posters for London events, cricket and football gear and photographs of Michael Caine and David Bowie to watch you while you eat, the decor is just as fabulous as the food. Service is great, too, but if there's a football game on, you might want to expect a wait or at least some very close quarters.
