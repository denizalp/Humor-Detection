Going to five stars!  I was excited to find a real butcher, but was not solidly sure just how real this butcher was until my last order:  ox tails.\n\nFor those of you who know, ox tails are somewhat regularly available at super markets in small quantities.  In some horrid cases, they are vacuum packed and look totally awful. I never bought those, but did some celo packed tails.\n\nWell, I ordered 3 pounds.  Lots of bone, so wanted more so I could accommodate the fat and waste usually found with them.  \n\nI was stunned, absolutely blown away when I duped out my 3.23 pound order and found the ox tails absolutely clean, dressed and ready to be seared and cooked!  Not only were they uniformly cut to 1 - 1.5 inch segments, but the bone dust had been rinsed off by the butcher, and this is the difference between a meat cutter and a butcher, but he had run each segment around the band saw so as to cut off the fat!\n\nAmazing!  This brought back fond memories from growing up in the 1950s when we had neighborhood butchers who did everything custom and bakeries what cut and boxed your bread, tying the box with string.  Professional was the word over mass production.\n\nWe have loved their hot Italian sausages and a variety of steaks, so have found our meat supplier going forward.\n\nYou just have to try these guys.  The owners do the work and run the shop.  They can order whatever you want and have it in within a couple of days, or sometimes the next day.\n\nTreat yourself and enjoy quality for a change.
