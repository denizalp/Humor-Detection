Love the choices on the menu. Golden shrimp, steak, baked seafood & avocado (some people don't like it but I just do!) \n\nBut the real winner at this place are the desserts! Love the mini desserts in shot glasses! We can eat a lot of theeese! yum! \n\nIt is a lil bit on the expensive side though. And watch out for the parking. I've seen a lot of people get bumps and scratches while parked in this area. :(
