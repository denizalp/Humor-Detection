Love the first Body Blitz...great place for a hydrotherapy wellness day with friends, so *had* to try their newer East end location.\n\nThis new location is still very central and the service was as friendly and helpful as the first BB... great to see consistency, and a second BB was needed based on the popularity of their first.\n\nThe whole experience is unique and needed in Toronto, and love that smoothies are available and a host of other health treatments (like massage), but you can also keep it simple and just enjoy the water therapy treatments. \n\nA great business, and helpful to maintain my healthy new year's resolutions! \n\nHighly recommend BB for a therapeutic day to manage your stresses and treat yourself in a serene beautiful venue!
