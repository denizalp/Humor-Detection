*free cookie for military* \n\nWent on Saturday 9-26-15 around 8PM because I had a hankering for a dole whip.  This store is located in the Wal-Mart shopping center north of the 215 on Decatur.  When you enter the shopping center take a left and it's in the cluster of stores with Dickey's BBQ, Cuigino's, etc.  \n\nAs soon as I walked in and saw the automatic doughnut machine I got excited!!  Lots of shiny machines behind the counter...and loads of toppings for ice cream!   And then I noticed their case full of Thrifty ice cream and got immediately bored.  I don't know what I expected.  But with U-Swirl in the same shopping center I thought they would step up their game.  \n\nThe menu is pretty huge-not everything was available yet but it looks like in the future they're going to have breakfast and french fries. The menu is expansive and you can get everything from waffles to cookie sandwiches to a \"lime rickey\"...whatever that is LOL \n\n$2.16 got me a small pineapple\/strawberry dole whip swirl in a cup.  The owner guy made a big deal out of telling me that he made it too big on purpose like \"wink, wink, you're welcome, sugar\".  While it was definitely the cheapest dole whip I've ever had it was also the most disappointing.  It was missing that pineapple punch-in-the-face that I'm used to and wasn't the right texture.  If you've never had a real dole whip before you might like it though.  Teddy Roosevelt said it best with \"Comparison is the thief of joy\".    \n\nI'll come back when they have poutine because I've always wanted to try it and I'll grab some mini-donuts!!!
