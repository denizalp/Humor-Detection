Corky & Lenny's is an Eastern Cleveland institution, credibly \"New York style,\" while at the same time being \"Cleveland style.\"  Tomato and lettuce on a corned beef sandwich might loose some style-points in Manhattan, but at C&L's it's simply part of the experience.  Their sandwiches are very large (not huge), contain a good quality of meat and are, at $9-11, fairly priced.  Most offer cheese as either part of the sandwich combo or as an option; another localism.\n\nAuthentic to the style, C&L's offers deli-style smoked fish, and their smoked whitefish is often what drew me here (or to the now-defunct Cedar Rd. location) during my college years.  Their chicken in a pot is decent, as well.\n\nService has that true-to-form grumpy exterior\/soft heart which has become an icon of New York delis.  Make the effort to connect in a genuine way and you'll find warmth and personality.
