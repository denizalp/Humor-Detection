Items Selected:\nChef's Platter - Olli Fennel Salumi, Prosciutto di Parma, House Cured Pork Loin, Barely Buzzed, Sea Scape, Rogue Smokey Blue, Pickles, Crostini, Calabrian Pepper Spread\nEgg Panino with Spinach, Roasted Peppers, Goat Cheese, Potato Bun and a Side Salad\nShort Rib Lasagna with San Marzano Tomatoes, Onions, Ricotta, Mozzarella\nNutella Panino with Dulce De Leche Cr√®me and Grated HeXX Chocolate\nBrioche French Toast with Smoked Maple Syrup (+ Sweet Buffalo Milk Ricotta with Pistachios)\n\nRecently expanding an already impressive lunch and dinner menu to Sunday Brunch it was much to the surprise of the waiter when a request was made for the Brunch Menu on Saturday at 11:00AM, but confirming with Chef Carlos Buscaglia that the five extra items had indeed been promoted for both weekend days by Social Media another great afternoon was spent at the oft overlooked gem on Town Center Drive just South of Downtown Summerlin.\n\nRecently informed that Pizzas are made by gas ovens and not wood, something few would have ever guessed given the perfect crust on his Pies, those familiar with Chef Buscaglia's history in Las Vegas kitchens will probably be surprised by the fact that Due Forni has now been open for over five years and, despite the small size of the kitchen, that the menu continues to evolve seasonally with the team going so far as to craft some of its own sausage and charcuterie.\n\nUnable to pass on the Chef's Platter, on this day three Domestic Cheeses including a personal favorite in the Espresso-rubbed Barely Buzzed, Carlos' House Smoked Pork Loin dazzled alongside imported Prosciutto and Salumi from Olli and whether eaten solo or stacking on grilled crostini the flavors of each ingredient met high expectations with a truly generous portion for just $20.\n\nTaking notes from the lunch menu by offering a new Sandwich at Brunch the Egg Panino shines by way of a tender Omelet of Spinach and Goat Cheese that seems to have smoky Peppers infused into it rather than being dotted with diced vegetables, and although a scalding cast-iron skillet of Lasagna is obviously a much more decadent concoction the result is perhaps even more impressive as the edges are charred dark and crunchy with vibrant Tomatoes more than capable of standing up to the shredded Beef and two Cheeses.\n\nHaving seen Facebook posts of the French Toast, Brioche brought from Bon Bread, it was with delight that Chef Buscaglia also announced a new dessert offered by way of a Nutella Panino made from similar, the decision between them largely a matter of preference, and to which \"both\" is a perfectly acceptable answer as the Panino is rich with Hazelnut Spread and delicious when dipped in the creamy white side car while the former offers a good sear overlying soft custard center with even more intrigue added by adding a small order of Due Forni's Sweet Ricotta in order to create a truly decadent breakfast Cannoli.\n\nContinuing to evolve and improve in a space many seem to have forgotten as 'newer,' 'fancier,' or more trendy places have opened around town, Due Forni is that 'neighborhood' place that you always pass by but rarely think to visit...perhaps something worth considering next time you get hungry shopping up the street instead of spending more for less at some mediocre burger joint or imported 'theme' restaurant.
