I decided to go here versus the other places in Boca Park and as a first timer I was impressed.  Good beer selection...Unibroue is one of my favorite breweries.  Lots of seating and a friendly staff.  A nice outdoor section too.  Really can't find anything bad to say.   I was kind of confused when looking at the menu online...the server did a good job explaining it.  This is a good place to go whether you're with a date or a group of friends.
