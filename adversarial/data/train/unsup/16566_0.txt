Okay so went here based on a long well written four star review and come to find out it sucked. Well to be more specific I got a hot towel shave and a hair cut. The hair cut was very good hence two stars not one. however, the hot towel shave was HORRIBLE!. Russell was my barber and he had no clue how to do a shave. I just had a two day stubble kicking and he used an electric razor first.then he used a different electric shaver to get it even closer. The hot towel was on my face for under two minutes. It felt like my hair was being ripped out slowly as he shaved. he said he couldn't do all my neck because it would leave razor bumps. \n\nAfter he finished he didn't put anything on and my face was on FIRE!. He also had to do touch-ups with the electric razor again. What a waste of time and money. \n\nI get hot towel shaves usually once a week and this was by far the worst. I live in NY  and am used to much better and longer pre-shave treatment. Before anyone says \"well of course, you live in NYC\", I live in rural upstate NY so should be better here. I lived here for six years and just moved this year....luckily my hair looked good so give him props there. \n\nCaptain D
