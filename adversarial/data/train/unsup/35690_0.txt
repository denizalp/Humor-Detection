I had no idea there was a regular sit-down restaurant version of this mall-food-court favorite.  The place was absolutely packed and so many were waiting patiently!\n\nI took a seat at the bar and was greater promptly.  I ordered my \"mall\" fav salad...the Mediterranean.  It was delicious but looked like a smaller portion...could be because of the larger plate.  \n\nCan't say it was worth $14.00...$10 something plus tax and gratuity.   I'll definitely come back to try something else though!
