Came here for a date with my fiancé because nothing is more romantic than her watching me get drunk. Luckily they also have a kitchen and while she does not drink, she has been known to eat food on occasion so we could both be happy.\n\nWe both got the grain bowl salads. I did it because I felt guilty about what I was putting in my body and my fiancé did it because she is a small white woman. It was surprisingly fine.\n\nWe did salt and vinegar wings to share. I love fried chicken and my fiancé loves salt and vinegar flavor things so we thought this would be perfect. Unfortunately it was more like salt and more salt. I still ate it all since I have the heart of a champion but definitely required generous gulps of beer to wash down.\n\nWe also got the corn dog. It was a large Weiner. It was not making up for anything though by being so large as it was actually quite tasty too.  \n\nThe beer selection here isn't super huge but I'm for it. They have a mixture of very traditionalist beers like altbier but also do some interesting stuff like dry hopped pomegranate sour. Something for everyone.
