We have had great communication and service from Dean at Brown Roofing.   We had a leak recently during heavy rains and they were responsive and came out quickly.   They fixed the areas and made recommendations for other improvements but it was very low pressure and useful information to have.   We will be using them to do the additional work and I would recommend them and use them again for any roof related work we need done.
