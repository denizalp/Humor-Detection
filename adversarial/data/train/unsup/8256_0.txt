Dear Lord, please let my childrens soccer games be near Matts Big Breakfast and far, far away from any of the awful chains on Bell.\n\nDo you want to throw away a chance at an awesome Saturday breakfast? Come on down to corner bakery. God knows why I would ever return to this place. There are so many great bfast spots out there but even crappy Denny's is better than this. My wife asked for ice for her not fresh lemonade And was told they don't know if they have any. This is Arizona a freakin desert for Petes sake. Then I asked for my potatoes to be extra crispy b\/c I remember the last time they were cold and undercooked then she pointed to a metal bowl on the counter and said they are already cooked. Yuck! Who the hell doesn't cook when you order? Even fast food does that. I should have turned around and walked out but we were running late for our nephews soccer game. Not that this place is even fast. You would think with their precooked food I would have my meal by now as I am writing this with their wifi. \"Do you think our eggs will at least be fresh?\" My wife asked. I was thinking the same thing. \n\nThe food came out and it was disgusting as predicted. The potatoes tasted like they were a week old and ran over by a dump truck. The egg scramble was edible but I could have cooked a better one after drinking a fifth of tequila. Even the bread was cold and stale. That takes some serious technique. \n\nThis place is neither a good meal, quick, a value, or even worth the plumbing in the building. If we all stick together and never return they will be forced to shut down. I know I won't be back. Ever.
