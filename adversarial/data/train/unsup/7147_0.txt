Not bad but not that great either ...\n\nNot quite as bright, cheerful, and clean as T & T and no pre-cooked\/ ready to eat foods.  \n\nHowever, the ways in which it wins over T & T are:\n\nThere is a huuuuuge selection of yams and root vegetables - the most variety I've seen at any store.  My mom would love this place.\n\nFresh and reasonably priced lemon grass ($1\/ bunch)\n\nTop Food is another alternative for asian groceries but I don't quite like it as much as Lucky Moose but will most likely stop by if I am in the area.
