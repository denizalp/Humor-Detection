While trying to order, I watched one of the dry cooks drop a spatula on the floor.  Then he picked it up and put it on the grill. I told the girl who was taking my order about it.  The other fry cool started flipping burgers with the dirty spatula.  She went back and talked to cook #2, who said it didn't happen.  She came back, I said 'it was the other guy'.  She didn't turn back around to take care of it.  I canceled our order.  We're now at Islands.
