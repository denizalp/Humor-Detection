ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! Excellent service. The manager, Steve, gave us great info about all kinds of local things to do when we asked. All the rest of the staff we encountered were awesome. We have been twice and will go back. Every dish served has been amazingly good!\nOh.. and the Blackberry Lemonade is a MUST have!! We got it without alcohol at lunch. Best lemonade we have ever had!
