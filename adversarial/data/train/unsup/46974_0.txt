We tried this restaurant yesterday. I admit, as a meat-loving carnivore, I was a bit reluctant to purchase what is essentially a $16 salad. Boy was I wrong!\n\nI ordered the chicken poke bowl with the Honi Honi sauce. It was fully loaded and super healthy. It consists of a large variety of vegetables, chicken, and rice. My wife and son ordered the tofu and salmon bowls, respectively. They loved their meals as well, but we're unable to finish them due to the large quantity of food.\n\nApparently, the food doesn't keep very long in the fridge. My wife put hers in the fridge for a few hours to eat afterwards, but it wasn't as good at that point.\n\nOnly order here if you've got a large appetite and you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe young lady who took our order was jovial and helpful, especially since we've never ordered from there before.\n\nIt may seem a bit pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. Bon appetite!
