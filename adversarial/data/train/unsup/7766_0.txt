On an errand at the CMU student center, I decided perhaps a quick convenient lunch in the Schatz dining hall.  I took a look in and memories quickly returned to answer the question: \"Why has it been so long.\"  I suppose this is better than hospital food, nevertheless I was able to just say,  in the word of Marcel Marceau, No!  Off to Craig Street for something better to write about.
