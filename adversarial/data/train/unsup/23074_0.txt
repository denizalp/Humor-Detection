Best battered fish and shrimp we have ever had.  This tiny spot located next to the Linq makes all your food to order.  The batter on our fish and shrimp was crispy perfection and the fish and shrimp were fresh and cooked perfectly.  The chips were just okay for me we upgraded to truffle and pork belly chips, but I think  regular fries would have been fine.  I think the 3 piece fish was $14.95 and the 5 piece shrimp was slightly higher at $15.95.   \n\nOn top of the fantastic fish and shrimp the Sticky Toffee Pudding Shake was to die for!  I guess since Gordon Ramsay opened up this fish and chip shop and re-branded Gordon Ramsay Burgr to Gordan Ramsay Burgers you can no longer get pudding shakes at the burger joint.  Needless to say it is worth a trip just to try this super delish shake for $6.95.\n\nI highly recommend this spot, it did not receive five stars because it is way to small and there is not enough seating.
