I purchased a 3-day VIP ticket and was not impressed. You received nothing special for VIP at the event. Sure, there was a \"special\" area for me but it was only at 2 of the 4 stages. The areas were located to the side of the stages and not a direct view, the \"lounge\" was facing the same direction as the stage so you could not relax and see the stage, it was very hot all 3 days and the \"A\/C\" that was promised was no place to be found, and the staff was poor at their service. To have paid over $600 for a VIP pass that were being sold on the corners before the event for $100 was insulting. I would never go again.
