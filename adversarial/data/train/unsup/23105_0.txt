So, let's start out with a little context. \n\nExam: Check.\n\nAbsurdly long study sesh: Check.\n\nBroken Spirit: Check. \n\nHunger due to induced absentmindedness (see points 2 and 3): Check.\n\nFear not, fellow members of the intelligentsia (and all you other 'schmos' who actually have some clink in the back account). Apparently, such conditions call for the sweet pick-me-up of Nepalese cuisine. And apparently, that dish is set to stun - my mouth that is, with an appropriate but not taste-bud melting amount of delicious spiciness. \n\nNow, shame on me. Why? I was not privy to the decision to order, and therefore merely partook like a surprised and greedy but very satisfied beggar, all the while taking little notice of the actual items being consumed. Review = undermined. Safe to say specificity is not the strong point of this assessment. But hey, there was naan bread. \n\nNevertheless, the unknown foods were so mouthwatering and the prices so (apparently) reasonable and the man on the phone so (apparently) helpful and the delivery guy (definitely) so friendly that this ridiculously vague review simply needed to be written, and the embryonic legend of the Himalayan propagated to the fullest extent of the interwebz.\n\nSo in summary, this place made my pants tight.\nBecause of how full my stomach got. Godspeed.
