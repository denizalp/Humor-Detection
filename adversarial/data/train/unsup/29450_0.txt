3.5\/5, +.5 for service\n\nWe want to Grazie for our company Christmas lunch after a recommendation from one of my colleagues. I'm not too familiar with Italian food, but I do love me pizza and pasta!\n\nI won't comment on what my coworkers ordered as they all seemed to enjoy their food regardless. For me, I ordered the Napoletena, which was linguine with tomato sauce, shrimp, and clams.\n\nThe linguine was cooked perfectly and I found the shrimp to be very good. The clams, however, had minor sand in them. The tomato sauce was also quite well done, although it felt a little watery at the bottom. The parmesan cheese added to the food was a wonderful attention; gotta love cheese in general!\n\nService was excellent. We had to wait a good 30 minutes for the full party to show up, but the server was very appreciative and told us to take as long as we need. The restaurant in general was also very accommodating of the fact we had a wheelchair coworker with us.\n\nI was told after there were a lot of great Italian restaurants around the Vaughan Mills area...should come back here more often!
