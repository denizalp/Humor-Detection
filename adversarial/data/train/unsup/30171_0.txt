Filibertos has some good food for breakfast and dinner. My favorite is the breakfast burritos (steak and egg, bacon, chorizo, etc.). They also have some solid entrees for dinner available, and the pricing is decent.\n\nThe negatives are that the drive in is slow and service is slow at times, and some of the meals are kind of greasy and messy. But if you are hungry for Mexican food it's not a bad choice.
