I've gone to the Rail on and off over the years, first because I had a friend who worked there, then because of various stags (I swear). The place is loud and obnoxious and stuck in the eighties, but it is what it is. You pay $10 for a beer and four sips in the server's back to ask you if you want another. You can't use the washroom without some guy turning the taps on for you and wanting to douse you with eau de toilette, for a tip of course. And if you've had too many drinks you might succumb to the lap dancers who prowl the joint. I've seen too many go to the back and not come back for a half-hour or more and then big arguments with the dancer commanding hundreds of dollars for \"dances.\" Still, that's probably what you want if you're here. It is higher end as far as peeler joints go, from what I understand, but hit the bank machine before you come--you'll need the cash.
