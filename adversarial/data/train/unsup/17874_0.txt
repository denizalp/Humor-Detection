These guys are scam artists...had a terrible experience and hoping this review would help make sure someone else doesn't have the same experience.  Our car set on fire and this was the closest place to take it to.  When I got there, I was \"convinced\" to keep my car there and NOT have it towed to the dealership and that it's an obvious write off and they'd get the \"best money\" from insurance.  After over a week of BS and being given the runaround and their mechanic having \"looked at the car\" and giving me a false report on what he found, I told them to just release the car to the dealership. When the dealership showed up (from Kitchener) this place wanted $1500+ ... they never once even HINTED there were be a fee, let alone such a steep one. I was furious. Needless to say, the car was 1) NOT a write up - was actually an easy fix and 2) The fire did not start because of what they told me (they were trying to say it was the typical jeep problem... when it was a faulty part that was installed).  These people just wanted to keep our car to make money off it once it was written off... absolutely disgusting in my eyes and I don't think they deserve anyone's business!!! Avoid at all costs.  The headache they caused me was awful... if I could give them 0 stars I would.
