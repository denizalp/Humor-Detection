Okay, I've gotta upgrade this one to five stars.  I was here on Friday thrifting with my friend Maryann.  We were going through the racks of used clothes and other assorted consignment goodies, not having much luck, when he happened upon some used DVDs.  And there it was. \n\n\"Parker Lewis Can't Lose, the Complete First Season.\"\n\nHolee Shite!\n\n\"Parker Lewis Can't Lose, the Complete First Season\".\n\nOne more time...\"Parker Lewis Can't Lose, the Complete First Season\"\n\nI'd nearly forgotten all about that show, but I used to watch it all the time when I was a teenager.  I didn't even know it was on DVD and I wondered who the hell would be getting rid of such a treasure.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, \"Parker Lewis\" was an inventive early Fox TV show that paved the way for such later fare as \"Malcolm in the Middle\" (only without that show's nastiness) and \"Scrubs\".  I remembered how it was primarily a single-cam show with lots of fast edits and sound effects.  I remembered how it had odd colors in places and its quirky humor.  I remembered that Parker Lewis and his buds Mikey Randall and Jerry Steiner used their wit, some gadgetry, and their general cool to negotiate the world of high school.  Parker would pull some stunts on the show, but they were generally out of kindness and a desire to help his fellow students.  And if he just happened to promote himself doing so, so much the better.  \n\nBut what I'd forgotten was how it was an important bridge between the 80s and 90s.  It went from pastels to grunge.  And it's a riot seeing some of the gadgets they used--VHS tapes, two way radios (remember, no cel phones), analogue TVs, cassettes and reel-to-reel tapes!  Doesn't make the show any less enjoyable watching it 20 years later.  Oh yeah, and the catchphrases:  \"Not a problem\", \"Mental note\", and my favorite, \"Synchronize Swatches\"!\n\nCoolness!
