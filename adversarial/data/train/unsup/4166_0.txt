We came on a Sunday.  This place is packed, thank goodness we got there early.  I loved the environment, food, and service.  EXCELLENT!\n\nEggs Benedict - Muffins, sauce, eggs, spinach, and Canadian bacon - they all blended together and melted in my mouth.  SO SO GOOD!\n\nRoasted Potatoes - Roasted to perfection and seasoned just spot on.  \n\nChocolate Parva - Flourless chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream.  HELLO!  Melt me, I have tasted a slice of heaven!
