If you're trying to get your Fat Joe on (lean back), then the seating here will disappoint.  But that's about the only disappointment at this bar.  The people watching is worth the price of admission alone--that's a figure of speech by the way, there's no cover at this casino bar.\n\nYou're in the middle of the action at the Cosmopolitan when you're drinking at Queue.  The later the night the better, because the people walking by just seem to get better looking, although I'm not sure if that's due to the drinking or just the type of clientele that the Cosmopolitan Hotel attracts.\n\nIn any event, this is my go-to pregame bar moving forward.  Give it a try and you'll agree; there isn't a more beautiful casino on the strip than the Cosmo.\n\nYou'll get in sync here...
