We had dinner here the final night of our vacation and it didn't disappoint.\nWe  tried the Prix Fixe menu with wine pairings and everything was delicious!\nThe steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly, the mash potatoes and asparagus\nwere spot on, and the dessert trio was the pefect ending to a wonderful meal.\nDewy was our waiter and his service was top notch and superb!  Our water glasses\nwere never empty and he took the time to explain each wine pairing which was so\nenjoyable.  Overall it was a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend this\nrestaurant to anyone who wants to experience a great steak dinner on the strip.
