This place rivals tacos el gordo... what stands out for me is the menu.  It has more of a variety that most taco shops and the condiment bars is pretty darn good too.  Both establishment met expectations and both serve BEER!!! They have elotes too... that a plus for me.  Check it out might like it!!!
