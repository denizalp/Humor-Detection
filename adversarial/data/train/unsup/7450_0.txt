Whenever we're in Phoenix we love to stop at Arizona Mills, a massive mall composed of outlet stores. So many stores. So many discounts. So little time. \n\nWe love to stroll the beautifully air conditioned halls checking out the deals at Marshalls, Macy's, Bath & Body Works and the Perfumeria.\n\nWe also enjoy checking out the kids stores like Oshkosh, The Children's Place, and the children's section of JC Star (formerly JCPenney outlet).\n\nWe nosh our way from Wetzel's soft pretzels to the Rainforest Cafe.\n\nAnd move over Mayor Bloomberg . . . don't try to cut down drink size in Arizona cause it's just too hot hot hot in this town. Big gulp drinks are mandatory tools of survival. Anyone riding around town without a 16oz bottle of water, soda, or ice tea is delusional or soon to be delirious.\n\nArizona Mills is a great place to get much needed exercise (you sure can't walk out doors). And it's a place we visit with great joy and enthusiasm whenever we're in Tempe.
