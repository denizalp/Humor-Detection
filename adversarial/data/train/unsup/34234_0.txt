Came here for lunch on a weekday. Place was packed. Definitely attracts more customers than it used to. Two years ago when I came for a weekday dinner there wasn't as many people.\n\nFish was really fresh and sliced to a adequate thickness. Lunch bentos are definitely worth it. $10 and you get a box enough to fill you up. Dinner is a bit more pricey with similar stuff. So maybe lunch is more worth it.\n\nService was close to none. The bare minimum. Servers are not attentive and walk by you when you try to say \"excuse me\". Sometimes I just don't like having to wave my arms in the arm for an extended period of time. That would be its main downfall. Maybe there just wasn't enough servers? \n \nAll in all I wouldn't come back unless someone suggested they specifically want to go here. Worth a try? I guess so if you're in the area! The lunches are worth it.
