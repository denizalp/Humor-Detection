This new location (to me at least) is great. Clean and more open than the OG. When I arrived in the early afternoon there was not a soul in line. I was greeted at the counter with a friendly welcome and even invited to make myself at home. However I did not feel comfortable in my undies in public so I just found a table and behaved myself.\n\nI ordered the \"Biggin\" because I do not recall this from the OG locs menu and it sounded awesome.  This sandwich stuffed with a hot link and topped with pulled pork and chopped brisket.  The trinity of BBQ! GREAT MEAL! Huge portion of meats cooked perfectly and I topped with all the sauces. Damn Spicy definitely had some burn to it. \n\nI definitely recommend this new location, all the great food of the other location however it lacks that Rollin Smoke aroma where you want to lick the walls. I will be back.
