Although Orvis doesn't really doesn't have many clothes suitable to wear when the temp is 106 outside, it is my husbands favorite and we make a point to stop in whenever we spot one.\n\nI need to sing the praises of Orvis's wrinkle free long sleeved shirts.  I have fallen prey to the wrinkle free claim by many menswear clothiers and still end up having to take the shirts to the dry cleaner. The Orvis shirt, although not inexpensive at around $100, is truly wrinkle free right out of the dryer. My husband added another shirt to his collection from this store. \n\nThis Orvis is smaller than stores that we have visited in other cities but it still manages to contain a lot of the fishing stuff and all of the new Fall styles for both men and women. \n\nGuests of the Westin Kierland  receive a 20% discount off of regularly priced merchandise by showing your room key.
