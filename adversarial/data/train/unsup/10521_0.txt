Take me to the place I love, take me all the way. \n\nExceptional service and great food that will blow your mind, located on Southwest of Vegas. We came here on a Wednesday night after seeing some great reviews on Yelp and this restaurant had exceeded my expectation. \n\nThings we tried:\n\nGolden ocean trout- Ordered based on server's recommendation off of appetizer and this was my most favorite dish out of everything I tried. It was ocean trout cut up sashimi style with ponzu and pop rocks drizzed on top. Yes, pop rocks. It added to an interesting sensation that kept me wanting a bite after another. Refreshing and interesting appetizer that I would highly recommend for everyone to try. \n\nToro\/otoro- It was off of their menu board by the entrance. You can order this in either nigiri or sashimi style. We ordered this in nigiri style and it came with gold flakes on top. Thick cut of toro\/otoro with just enough rice. Simply delightful dish and easily one of my favorite. \n\nTuna lover roll- One of their specialty rolls that comes with crispy kanikama, avocado, passion fruit soy and roasted spicy aioli. It was on the spicier side with their spicy aioli sauce that tasted like sriracha. It wasn't mind blowing but still was good and filling. Based on other reviews\/photos on Yelp, seems like the firecracker roll is a popular choice for specialty roll. \n\nCrispy brussel sprouts- I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts in general but this was fried very crispy and cut up in small pieces which makes for a great appetizer to share in groups. Just a \"ok\" for me. \n\nHydro bibb sea bass- miso-marinated sea bass served in lettuce cup. I'm usually not a fan of lettuce cup just because it's usually messy to eat but this was different. I ate it like it was a taco...haha. Sea bass is marinated and cooked well. One of my favorite dish. \n\nGreat restaurant for quality Japanese food. First time here and I can see myself coming back here again and again.
