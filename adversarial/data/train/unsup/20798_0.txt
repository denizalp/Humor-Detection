Short and sweet, my third 3 Brewers visited in less than a couple of months - I think I might have a small addiction going on here folks.\n\nTheir local beer to this location is Strawberry Saison, I sampled it and found it to be a tad on the watery side. Typically I like my saisons to be a little more full flavour, however their feature beer (an amber) was 6.2%ABV of golden amber glory. Loved it!\n\nI had plans to try something new on the menu but then I saw the French Dip and game over. Long story short, they've added mushrooms to it... so I ordered it, ate  it and then drank the gravy at the end. Game Over.\n\nSmaller bar set up than other locations but still amazing!\n\nEatcrest Out
