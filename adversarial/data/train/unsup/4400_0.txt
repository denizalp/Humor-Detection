Built by white millennials for white millennials. If you're in some other demo, they will make your visit unpleasant enough to ensure you don't return. That was my experience, this Sunday morning at 10:45AM. I sat at the bar for 10 minutes and was ignored while the Brunette behind the bar cheerfully poured drinks for the pretty millennials while trying desperately to ignore my presence.
