A group of friends invited me to go out to Liaison over the weekend and I was excited to see what a new gay club on the Strip would have to offer. Instead of anything new, or even a cool atmosphere, it was just a hot empty room in the front and a half packed room in the back. We got there before midnight and got in for free with our local ID. \n\nIt is bad when one of the employees prefaces your entrance with, \"Don't be surprised that the room is empty, there are more people in the back\". Okay... I guess I should be going somewhere else. In fact, I was at a gay bar near university and left for this club. The only difference was the previous place was jamming. \n\nOf course, the booze is expensive. Of course, it is slightly uncomfortable. It is not as dressy as people has been reporting. It was an awkward mix shorts and flip flops, bow ties and button downs, khakis and polos, and various other states of dress. \n\nBesides being with friends, I can't say I enjoyed the experience there.
