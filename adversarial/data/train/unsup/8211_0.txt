I was really impressed with Zuma but must acknowledge it's an expensive meal, especially as all the small-portioned plates start to add up. We sat right next to the robata grill so we got to see a lot of the dishes being prepped and even chatted with the chefs, which I suppose is part of the experience. I liked the scallops and pork belly skewer a lot. We also got the rice pot with shaved truffle that was heavenly and the tempura was juicy and crispy. The steak was another solid dish. The only dish I could've done without was the corn as it really just tasted like corn on the cob that I could've made at home (with a better sauce). My cocktail also tasted like an upgraded version of a fruit juice so I wouldn't get that again, but all in all I would come back for another visit.
