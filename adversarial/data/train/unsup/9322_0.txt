Dear beer snobs,\n\nI am one with you. We are one. I have been devouring delectable and delightful beers at this very dark, sexy, and locally owned establishment for 3 years now. Ever since I first laid eyes on this place after moving here from the East Coast 3 years ago, I have grown more and more in love with the rotation of beers that are readily available via tap and in bottle. I take almost everyone I know that is a beer snob here. Happy Hour blows my hair back and when they have their Holiday beer specials and stout day specials, I get readlly giddy and tipsy. They do not serve food, but that is fine, some of their 11.5 % stouts are thick and yummy and boozy enough to be a meal replacement.\n\nLove,\nThe East Coast Foodie and Beer Snob
