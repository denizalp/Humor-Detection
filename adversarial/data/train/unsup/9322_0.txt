I had the Gyro salad in a shell. The salad itself was great. Wasn't a fan of the shell. I would come back for the salad and to try the fish. My friends swear by the place which i dont get but I am willing to try again. My friend had the chicken pita with onion rings. She wasnt a fan of either. The onion rings are pretty bland (or maybe Ive just had much better onion rings).
