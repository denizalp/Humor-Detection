Some friends are having their wedding at the Phoenician.  They are thinking about having one of their \"wedding weekend\" festivities at Relish so my wife and I joined them there for dinner to try it out.\n\nThe inside\/outside of the place probably hasn't changed much since it was a simple \"19th hole\" bar and grill for a decade.  I think they just changed the name to something trendy and updated the menu a bit to appeal to the young\/hip folk.  Anyway, the weather was perfect so we sat outside to enjoy the view.  It is just a small balcony with 5-6 tables and not much decor to speak of.  It was nice though.\n\nI wasn't expecting it, but this place has about a zillion tequilas as you will see when you first enter the place.  So if that is your thing they definitely have something for you.  Another thing they had which I thought was quite unique was a tequila flight.  You choose a few of them and they give you a shot pour of each.  I ordered a 3 tequila flight and it came in a pretty cool tasting tray thingy which was neat.  Each one was very good and it was a great experience overall.  Tequila isn't totally my thing but I love to drink and learn about new stuff so I had to try it.  Our waitress and the manager  were like tequila sommeliers and knew about every one of their tequilas on the menu and provided great recommendations.\n\nThe food:\n\n* Wedge Salad - this was just ok.  It was just your standard wedge.  Nothing special.  Just eh.  I love love love wedges but not this one.  I think it needed more dressing or something.  I would try another salad next time.\n\n* Mushroom Cheese Burger - Excellent!  It was juicy and delicious.  The Kobe was perfectly tender and not overly salty as it sometimes is.\n\n* Tater tots = Sooo good.  Enough said.\n\n* Adult Milkshakes = Very good and very unique.  The manager guy took his time and crafted a very attractive sampler with 3 milkshakes on it for each of us.  I was especially a fan of the Reese's one but it was very very rich.\n\nThe best part about this place was the service.  Our waitress, Jasmine and the manager (looks like Ryan Phillippe but I didn't get his name) were both excellent and made our dining experience excellent.  Maybe it was because our friends are getting married there, but I like to think that they are awesome to everyone.\n\nAnyway, I hope to return soon.
