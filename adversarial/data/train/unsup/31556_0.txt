The place wasn't very busy, but the two servers were all over the place. The portions were much smaller than another location I usually frequent and done somewhat carelessly (e.g. the toast has a small patch of butter in a corner, fruit badly cut, almost no hollandaise sauce on the small crepomelet).\n\nUnlikely I'll go to this location again.
