i wish i could give zero stars.  all these social leagues have their issues...but my god xtsc is winning the race to the bottom.  i will never be giving my money to this league again.  ever.  after years of playing with them, i've had enough.  if you ever meet the owner you'll just know what I mean, and won't want to give him any more money.  and he actually is pretty bad at soccer, which is the most hilarious part.
