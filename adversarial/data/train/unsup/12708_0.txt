We had a drink at the bar before dinner and played a little video poker.  When I ordered a second drink the bartender informed me, in an extremely non-friendly manner, that I was not spending enough to get a free drink.  Um, I wasn't looking for anything for FREE.  That ruined my whole experience.  \nThere are literally hundreds of other places to go with better service.
