First of all, I am a huge fan of Thai food and have visited Thailand several times. We come from Chicago to Vegas every year for a trades how and this is our first stop. It is my favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas. I don't understand the excitement with Lotus of Siam. The quality of the food and flavors here are true and some the dishes are very innovative, you will be thinking about them for weeks on wards.  All the salads, nua nam tok, panang curry with salmon and pad kee mao.. the curries are all off the hook! Highly recommended..
