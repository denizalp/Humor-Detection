The ultimate throwback sweet shop. Chagrin Falls Popcorn Shop seems to be keeper to a whole assortment of candy, popcorn, ice cream, coffee, as well as fond memories of many a Cleveland native. \n\nI didn't have the glow of nostalgia to accompany my visit, but still appreciated the cozy clutter filling the walls of the shop. The walls are stacked floor to ceiling with bright bags of popcorn and shelves of candy, some of which are actually hard to find nowadays (like Sour Punch Straws). There are only about 10 ice cream flavors (including the seasonal ones) so it's difficult to get overwhelmed. And yes, they'll let you try before you buy. If you prefer to sip your dessert, you can indulge in a smoothie, milkshake, or coffee. \n\nNone of the ice cream flavors really piqued my interest. Maybe it was the old school allure of the Popcorn Shop, but I had the strong urge to get a Root Beer Float. When it came time to pay, I was told (a little rudely) that at $4.95, my tab was 5 cents short of their credit card minimum. So we picked a random candy off the counter. The prices were actually higher than I expected. No, I wasn't expecting a nickel candy store, but for all the complaining about Jeni's prices, they're only pricier by about $1 per size. In case you were wondering, the Float did satisfy my cravings. \n\nThe walkable space within the store is an L-shaped corridor maybe 20 to 30 feet long with only one small table beneath the window. Be careful squeezing your way past other customers to grab a napkin or straw lest you spill something cold or hot on each other! The porch outside would have been an adorable place to sit had it not been 20 degrees outside. In flavor and presentation, I think Jeni's has the Popcorn Shop beat. But I'm sure summer time will still see crowds flocking beneath the bright awning to get a taste of their childhood.
