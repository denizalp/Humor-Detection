Before writing a 1STAR review I will usually revisit the establishment to give them a 2nd chance. But this will not be F@$&:NG happening in this case. Ok, 1st of the service was horrific, and they were so unorganized. I promise no pun intended, but \"chickens w\/ their heads cut off\". Just eww, then waited 30mins for a damn grilled chicken salad.\n\nNow you may ask: \"Demetria, why did you not just walk out?\"\n\nThat is a good question indeed, and the answer would be: I wanted that salad for 4 days and I was finally on a side of town that a el pollo loco. FUNK that, I was getting my salad.\n\nWell guess what, I got my salad and has UNCOOKED chicken on top. I couldn't drive back, but he time I made it home, they were already closed.\n\nI called the next morning and got no answer, just the answering machine. So after calling for 2days w\/o a response I called corporate. These mf's didn't do $h!t, I was told: \"all we can do is contact the owner and its up to him to call you back\". Are you serious???? So what you are telling me that you're cool w\/ one of you franchise is serving RAW F@$&:NG CHICKEN??? \n\nSo I'm so cool on el pollo loco, make sure you food is COOKED FULLY before you walk\/drive away.\n\nIf I could give NO STARS I would, b\/c that is not f'n. The health dept. needs to make a trip down there and I no longer eat at ANY el pollo loco, I had to cancel them out.\n\nBut that's just my experience, it could be different for you
