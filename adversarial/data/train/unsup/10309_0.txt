This is a huge mall that is one of the malls that is still surviving the age of online shopping. It's not Sawgrass Mills Mall in Florida by any stretch of the imagination, but it does have a certain charm, especially when it is full of families out for the afternoon because there are a lot of things for kids to do here.\n\nThere are, however, times when the mall is empty and rather depressing as the echoes of what it could be bounce off the walls.\n\nHow could this mall be improved in a time when not many people now go to the mall to shop? It needs to have more places that offer a unique experience that you can't get online. What are they? I have no idea, but the person who figures out how to save the American mall may become a billionaire.\n\nI'm not sure what the pull of this mall is, but I hope that it has a great Christmas season and survives for years to come as a pillar to American consumerism.
