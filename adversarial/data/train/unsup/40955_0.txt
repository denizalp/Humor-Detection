I've been coming to this location for years. The barbers here have always been quality all the way back to when I first started coming, when Jorge was still at this location. It is a busy shop so expect a bit of a wait, usually it's a good idea to arrive early, drop your name, and go get breakfast and come back. However, out of several other shops I've visited over the years when I couldn't get in here they are the only ones I wholeheartedly trust with my hair. Now having left Henderson, and moved to the Southwest I find myself trying to find a good barber or scheduling time to make it over to get my hair cut. Downtown Vintage Barbershop does great work.
