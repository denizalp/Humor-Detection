And they have a drive through, whaaat?! haha!\n\n\nOk so this one is going to be short.\nLocated in the Home Depot plaza on the corner of Tropical and Centennial, this spot has plenty parking. Didn't know it was a fast food joint, then there was the order at the counter set-up. Greeted as soon as we entered, we noticed that the staff was very friendly and inviting. (really friendly) Servers constantly talking to customers, making sure they are taken care of.. Oh and clean. All table tops were wiped clean soon as customers left. The drive thru was steady, didn't see it backed up.\n\nThey have a great variety on their menu ranging from breakfast bowls, salads, and omelettes to burgers and fried fish. What is really neat here is, next to each menu item is their calorie count. This is for all you health nuts.\n\nWhat ordered: \nFarmers burger with fried zucchini \nCalifornia omelette \n\nSo I was thinking, awesome customer service, awesome food. We were brought our food after about a 15-20 minute wait, and the first thing I noticed was the gigantic zucchini. Probably the only thing I loved fro my order. Food was great in portion, not in flavor. Your better off at a Carl's Jr. or better yet Shuck's Tavern for their juicy Shuck burger for $8 rather the $10 combo here. The burger here was dry. Fresh onions and tomatoes though. The omelette was ok. Wife was not wowed, meaning not amazing or unique. It's fast food breakfast though right? I'd come back for those monster zucchinis, and maybe to try their fried fish which boasts a wopping 2000 calories. It's better than Mcy-Ds, is all I can say.
