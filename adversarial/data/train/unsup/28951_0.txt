Currently the coolest beer bar in Toronto overall - for selection, plus the look and the vibe of the place. The bouncing energy of Bar Hop is invigorating as if the location was always meant to be there, and yet it's completely comfortable with amenable service.\n\nLike so many tap houses in T-Dot the price gouges are running near ten bucks a pour with tip (worth it or not) and there's no easy place to park, so I imagine a dinner out for two would be a little pricey here. I tend to go places that are cheaper and more accessible. I haven't eaten at this bar yet, people tell me the food is good and the lunch specials are affordable (burger).
