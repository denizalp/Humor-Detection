Cool Spot, Friendly Staff, Good Treats...\n\n5 star Clean atmosphere!\n5+ star Super friendly staff! \n5 star display\n3.75 star taste\n3 star serving size to price ratio\n2 star parking\n\nI felt like the treats were good and I would probably return, but smaller servings is my main turn off, and I realize I am bigger than most people and thus require larger servings... I felt like I had $12 into 2 gelato popsicles that were 4 bites each... \n\nAll in all I think smaller people and women will like this place more than I did...
