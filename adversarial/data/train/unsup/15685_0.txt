I purchased a Groupon last week for this company. I tried to contact them to schedule an appointment and they stated they can only accommodate me for Thursday late afternoon. I let them know I have a gender reveal on Saturday and it would be too late to order supplies and asked if they have any other times this week earlier than Thursday. Here's their solution. I'll look for a different company then, thank you for your time.
