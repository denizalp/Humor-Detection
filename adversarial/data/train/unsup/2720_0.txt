I honestly cannot believe that anyone in their right mind would rate this chocolate highly. Incredibly expensive for terrible chocolate.\n\nI stopped at Divine Chocolatier after trying a few other shops, such as Juliette & Chocolat, in search of some gifts to bring back home. We were offered a crispy rice milk chocolate which was fine. The chocolatier and the other person working at the shop were very kind and attentive. But the chocolate itself is terrible.\n\nThe chocolates come with a card which states that no preservatives or artificial flavors are used. One chocolate we chose, the chocolate covered cherry, was a cheap maraschino cherry which is literally bleached. Feel free to research online how commercial maraschino cherries are produced--I guarantee you'll never eat another again. You can tell they are not produced in-house because of the bleached stem. A far cry from \"no preservatives or artificial flavors\". Another chocolate, called the \"Bella Rose\" was meant to have a rose-flavor. It tasted like shampoo! I would highly recommend the shop to increase the quality of whatever extract they are using. We tasted about 5 other chocolates.\n\nThe actual quality of the chocolate is mediocre. No better than a Lindt chocolate bar one can find in the supermarket. I feel bad posting a review like this one, but it is how me and my partner feel (both of us have worked in the restaurant industry for a combined 20+ years, and my partner has extensive training in pastry). A very fancy place that is excellent for those that are looking for that particular chic ambience.
