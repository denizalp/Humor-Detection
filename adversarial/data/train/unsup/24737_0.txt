Meh. There was nothing really special here. We got some breaded mushrooms to start and those were mushy little grease bombs. The burger I got was incredibly overcooked and lacking in flavor. \n\nWhat I witnessed among the staff and customers was a little offputting and made me uncomfortable. Some of the staff were joking around with each other and getting pretty physical in the packed bar for all to see (goosing each other and making inappropriate comments) and some of the same was happening among some regular customers and staff. My food wasn't very good to begin with and this didn't help at all. When I saw the lack of professionalism among the staff, I began to wonder about the kitchen and what horrors happened there.
