Date of visit: 16 Nov 2013 @ 1:00 pm.  \nFirst thing...the only Ford Dealership I know in America that doesn't offer Military Discount.  GAUDIN IS ONE CHEAP S.O.B!!!  \nSecond thing....outrageous auto service center prices.  Being in the military, I travel a lot and have been to a handful of Ford Dealership up and down the West Coast, and never paid more than $75 for a Works Package, but this dealership charged me $90.  \nThird thing....customer service in the Auto Service Center was average, the advisor seemed more worried about answering his text messages.  Also, wasn't that knowledgable when asked simple questions about service involved with requested work.  The customer service at the cashier desk is horrible.  The lady working there makes it quite obvious she hates her job and that every customer that approaches her is the biggest inconvenience of her day!  \nForth and last thing...service completed took over and hour!  At most I've seen it take is 35 minutes at dealerships 3x busier then this place.  They washed my truck...which I normally like, except the fact that it looks like they washed it with a floor broom and now i have hairline scratches everywhere in my clearcoat.  Looks like I'll be spending a weekend with a buffer and wax trying to remove them....cause based off this visit, I firmly believe that this place wouldn't even acknowledge my presence If I went back and complained about it now.\nSo....spend the extra time and gas and visit the Ford Dealership in North Las Vegas, even though they are much busier, their customer service is top notch and their prices are much more reasonable...plus, they support the troops and offer military discount!  WHAT EVERY YOU DO....STAY AWAY FROM THIS AUTO SERVICE CENTER!!!!
