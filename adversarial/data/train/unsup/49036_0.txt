I called St Vincent and arranged a pick up of several large items like a sofa bed, a rug, a bunch of clothes and shoes as well as some household items. I was told they will pick up between 8:00 and 4:30, but do not give exact window. I arranged for my mom to wait for the pick up. I called twice to confirm and was told both times they were coming. Alas, no one showed up and no one called to say they were not coming. I'm taking my donation somewhere else where it is actually needed.
