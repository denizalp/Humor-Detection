I guess I just don't get the fro-yo craze. \n\nThis is the first time I've been to one of these newly established frozen yogurt places that seem to be popping up all over town. Menchie's has a unique exterior compared to the rest of the brick facade laden storefronts in the Eton shopping plaza in Woodmere. The exterior is lined with flashy, glittery, purple mosaic tiles. Inside, it's like stepping into a Hello Kitty lunch box. Cramped, way too happy, too much pink and an anime-esque logo stamped throughout.  \n\nThe ordering process is unique in that it's completely self-serve. Choose from a variety of flavors, pull a lever and fill your cup. Next is an assortment of toppings available buffet style. They have everything from traditional condiments to captain crunch and apple jack cereal to spoon onto your frozen yogurt. In the end, you pay based on weight. \n\nI wasn't too happy with my creation. It looked and tasted like a complete mess. The whole process was just too overwhelming for me. Since it was so crowded, I didn't really have time to figure a proper mix of yogurt flavors to complimentary toppings. At the time, I just felt rushed. Kids all over the place, fairly crowded and it was loud. There were no recipe cards to follow which would've been helpful. I like more structure and order and this place just didn't do it for me. Perhaps the whole, \"here's a cup, now go have at it!\" approach works for some. I'd imagine kids love it here. But it's just not for me. \n\nAnd besides, good frozen deserts don't need condiments to mask itself. Frozen yogurt, I'm told, is supposed to be a healthier alternative, but for me, it'll never replace custard or ice cream in my preference of tasty treats. It's just too bland and watery in my opinion.
