Three of us came here recently after dinner plans at a nearby restaurant fell through.  We had the following:\n\nSmall plain hummus served with pita\nSmall babaganoush with pita\nSide falafel\nSide gyro meat with pita bread\nGreek trio Ã  la carte\nBaklava\nRice pudding\n\nThe hummus was good but was surpassed by the babaganoush.  I liked the thickness of the babaganoush.  I thought the pita was mediocre.\n\nThe side of gyro meat was my other favorite of the night--not counting dessert.  There was a $.50 charge for the pita that we ordered with the meat.  The  meat was tender and flavored nicely.  The Greek trio was good with the mousaka being the stand out.\n\nBoth desserts were very good.  I liked that the baklava was not drenched in honey and nuts as many places do and the rice pudding was quite good.  Prices were good for the meal.
