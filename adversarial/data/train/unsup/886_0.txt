As a person who hates to dig through random shit to find what I am looking for, I had avoided this Home Goods that is only a couple of miles from my house.  I was wrong!  While this is a Marshall's\/Ross kind of place, I have made several visits over the past few weeks and have found some great deals. \n\nThe store is clean, well-stocked and the employees are very friendly and efficient.  I found a set of two kitchen towels (I keep setting them on fire...) for $4, a three-pack of bamboo cutting boards for $10 and a small ice pack that was pink with cows on it (totally didn't need it, but it was $7).  \n\nThe stock is kind of hit or miss and I am waiting for them to get some new stuff in.  They had a lot of home items for not much money.  There is a shower curtain for $15 that I think I need to go back to get and there is a plate with a wedding theme that I want to go back and buy just so I can break it.  Great store!
