Really good hot dogs. The buns are nice & fluffy & he wraps the weiner in bacon. \nHe puts beans in them that are really scrumptious.\nThe only thing I would advise to those interested in coming here is to make sure you are not overcharged. I have been overcharged twice! Only by a dollar or so, though.\nAlso, it is really rare to find my favorite soda (Sangria) anywhere let alone find the authentic Mexican bottle. They have those here as well as many other authentic mexican sodas!
