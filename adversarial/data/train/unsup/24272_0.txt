Alas, I confess: this is my favorite Starbucks. Alas, I declare: this is the only one I pretend to like. Alas, it's true: I've been converted. \n\nI used to hate Starbucks. You know, it was the \"Big Man On Top\" disgust. But, given some time, this Starbucks has won me over. Maybe it's the cute red head behind the counter who always flirts with me. Maybe it's the breakfast sandwiches, the relaxed atmosphere that sparks my creativity, the clever marketing pitches and the cheese platter with pesto jack and apple slices. Or, maybe, simply, it's the coffee - like the Christmas blend or the double espresso shot mixed with milk. Whatever it is, I'm a believer. \n\nThis Starbucks is about 2 miles from my office. It's my escape sometimes, my light at the end of the tunnel, my rescue from groggy mornings and afternoon fatigue. It is, let's face it, the only java mecca within a 5 mile radius. \n\nSure, Starbucks may still be the \"Big Man On Top,\" but I'm okay with that, finally. I think they won me over with Bob Dylan tunes, casual flirtations and a hot peppermint soy latte. (Although there's some rebelliousness still that prevents me from giving this place 5 stars.)\n\nStarbucks, I'm smitten with you. Act nice and gentle to me, please.
