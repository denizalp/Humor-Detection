Went on Saturday 10-10-15.  Drove 30 minutes to get here and see what all the hype is about.  I had been reading the glowing yelp reviews for months and was very excited to finally try their drinks and especially to try their sea salt creme that everyone was raving about.  \nI ordered a hokkaido milk tea with boba and sea salt creme and the young man behind the counter looked up and shot an eyebrow up at me and said \"Are you sure?  The hokkaido is already really creamy.\" so I went with his suggestion.  \n$4.32 got me a hokkaido milk tea with boba (regular size).  Absolutely wonderful.  Right up there with kung fu tea in my book.  I wish I had another one of these right now!!!  \nNext time I go I will get something I can add that elusive sea salt creme to.  Maybe an iced coffee?
