In the four seasons the Niners have played football I have attended all but four games. Jerry Richardson stadium is nice, clean, and no seat is a bad seat. \n\nThe flaws lie in the lackluster football team and the shotty AD in charge of everything. Change is difficult and the inability to innovate seems problematic. \n\nOverall great facility and great service. Cheap food for college football and short lines for everything. If you live in Charlotte or the nearby areas you should definitely check out a game! Go Niners!
