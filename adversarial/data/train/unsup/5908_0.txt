So we are still avid visitors and since my last review we have received pretty great service. Today's visit was just as great. Brittany was patient with my son, suggestive as to how to get the look he wanted, she even explained what she was doing and checked in with me to see what I thought. \n\nThe friendliness of the staff is great from the moment you walk in to the moment you say good bye.
