So, let's be frank, Sunwing flights are cheap as dirt in comparison to all the others, and you cannot expect to be treated like the Queen when you've paid a joker's price. For us jokers this means 2 vacations south a year instead of one.  I've been to Manzanillo, Puerto Vallarta, Huatulco and most recently Ixtapa with Sunwing and it's gone smoothly every time with minimal delays and no big issues. Why have we been lucky with Sunwing? Touch wood partly and partly because we know what to expect. We measure and weigh our hand luggage and personal item at home to make sure they meet the limits. We never check luggage, traveling light is very freeing. We don't expect to sit together on the plane... and end up meeting fun people on the plane as a result and\/or sometimes we get 2 or 3 seats each because we just move after take off to any empty seat. We later use the $40 we saved to buy a good bottle of tequila or rum. We pack gourmet sandwiches for the plane ride and avoid the gross Lynn Crawford food, yuck. Oh yeah and we never arrive 3 hours ahead, like 1 hour max and we're just fine. We always check in online on the outbound flight, but usually not available on the return. At the destination we'll sometimes forego the bus and hop in a cab to our hotel arriving first and catching the desk staff in good spirits before they are hit with an entire busload. We also never ever attend the Sunwing \"info session\" the first morning after arrival, it's just a big 'ole sales pitch. If you're extra tall, wide, or otherwise physically unable to fit into the tight Sunwing seats then you might need to spend the extra money on booking a regular airline that can cater to your seating needs. Fly budget, expect budget. But judging from all the bad reviews, it's more like pay budget prices expect top of the line. I love the person who expected Sunwing to come around with bottles of water when the plane was delayed. Really, you can't buy your own water at an airport?
