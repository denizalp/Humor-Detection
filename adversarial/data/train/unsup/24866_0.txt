I found this place to be a decent Mexican restaurant. The decor threw me off a bit as the outside looks like a tavern, yet the inside has some weird modern vibe. Can't put my name on it but was cool never the less. \nHonestly, I wouldn't have thought this was a Mexican place due to the \"O' Brian\" clueing it up as am Irish pub, if it wasn't for my dad bringing home leftovers of Mexican food pine day. \nI love chips and salsa so there's that. Hard to screw that up and they are the thin and crispy chips. \nThey have very generous portions as well. I ordered the chicken taco and chicken enchilada plate. I could only get through the taco. Their chicken was flavorful and not bland. My mini tried a bit of the enchilada and surprisingly actually liked it - he's very much a bean burrito kind of kid. Which is what I ordered him. We both tom food home and left satisfied.
