Really disappointing, based on the amazing franchise Disney\/Marvel has created...fell way under the bar of the standard set by even the least successful areas of the franchise. I've given it a 2 instead of a one only due to the subject matter. But it is hands down the worst element of the franchise I've ever been exposed to.
