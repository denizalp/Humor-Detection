DO NOT SEE DR FREEMAN AT THIS OFFICE! I was left in a exam room completely undressed in a paper vest and wrap for 35 minutes! I got dressed and went to the counter where it was apparent they forgot all about me. This lady walks up to the counter without introducing herself and states she can see me now! What? The way I was treated in this office was worst experience ever. I will continue to spread the word to stay away from this doctor and this practice. It seems apparent now why they have to advertise so much. STAY AWAY
