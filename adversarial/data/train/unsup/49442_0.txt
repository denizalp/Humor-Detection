Loved this place. This is exactly what we expected a Vegas nightclub to be like! Jeremih performed while we were there and it was a lot of fun. DJ was great before the performance, good dance music. Drinks were reasonably priced too. $15 for a jack and Coke and $15 for a gin and tonic with tanqueray. Pool was awesome and they had heat lamps throughout. I would party here every night if I could!
