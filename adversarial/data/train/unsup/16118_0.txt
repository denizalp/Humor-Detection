5 STAR* 5 STAR *5 STAR\nI came in here yesterday just to check things out and it's so super cute in here, I booked an appointment for myself and my sister, Jannette L. Let me tell you, you gotta to to Summer. My hair is amazing, well it is now thanks to her. I got a cut, $40 and a Brazilian blowout $250. Pricey? A little, but I can say she's found a long term client. I'm so done with my frizz, and all the product I have to use to get rid of my lion's mane. I was going to get the permanent straightening system but she recommended the Brazilian blowout saying that it'd be healthier on my hair. I walked out so extremely happy. My sister and I both like the fact that she listens to your wants and needs, gives her opinion and finds a middle ground on what's best for your hair, face shape etc. She doesn't just hack your hair off but asks if you like it as she goes. Try her out guys, you'll have no regrets and I promise it! Plus, the store is so cute, and everyone is so friendly. They get pretty packed so make an appointment!
