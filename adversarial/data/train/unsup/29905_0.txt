DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS JOKE OF A COMPANY\n\nPlaced an order for Valentine's for guaranteed delivery for my wife and it never arrived.\nI spent nearly $200.  There has been no customer service along the way to help out.\n\nCompletely ruined Valentine's day.  \n\nMy review is not an anomaly.  I already see another similar reviews on the site here as well as on their facebook page.  \n\nI called throughout the day as I began to get nervous.  There was no answer.  The message tells you to email an address if help is needed.  That was completely useless.\n\nDO NOT USE THIS COMPANY\n\nOh and one last thought.  I know it's a busy day and time.  But this company took orders up until a certain time......even had a countdown clock as to when you needed to get your order in by for same day delivery.  Complete fraud.
