This was not our first stay at the Silverton but this stay was not good. Our a\/c was making a rattling noise the entire time. We called maintenance three times the first time we were told oh yes it shouldn't be making the moose he \"fixed\" it and then a few hours later the same noise again. We call maintenance a second time they came back and said yes that's not right let us fix it, they \"fixed it\" and within a few hours it was doing it yet again. I called a third time and the man comes in and says oh that's just the sound they all make it totally normal. I tell him what the first two people said and did and he said they were wrong. After all that now it's been a week since we left and they still haven't given me by deposit back but they definitely took the money for the room.
