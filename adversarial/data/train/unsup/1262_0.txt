As soon as we pulled up and parked our car in the parking lot, we were greeted by a homeless couple pushing a stolen shopping cart (unless Wal-Mart gives those things away) and parking it right next to the entrance.  This should have been a sign to not go inside but we went in anyway.  Yep, big mistake!  We paid $14 each to get the buffet, and let's just say we should have taken that money straight to the homeless couple outside and said \"here feed me whatever you got in that fancy cart.\"  Of course, they probably would have whipped up something better than what we found inside at the buffet.  \n\nFood selection was all over the map, and everything had the lovely after-taste of stomach acid.  For being called \"Old Country Buffet\" there was a complete lack of \"country food\" options.  Most of the food bins were empty and at the carving station it looked like they were cutting up something that could only be found in small third world countries.  \n\nI thought to myself, \"well the food is bad, but I'll fill up and get my moneys worth form the dessert bar.\"  Wrong again!  The ice-cream machines were empty and the slice of carrot cake that I got had the texture of shag carpet ripped out of an old porn store from the 1970's.  The pictures shown above should be classified as criminally misleading, or the marketing team at \"Old Country Buffet\" is playing a prank on all it's customers.  A really good one too, cause it fooled me.\n\nStay away from this place unless you like playing russian roulette with your stomach.  Eating here felt like going back to High School and being pantsed at an assembly, while some clown juggles tennis balls and gives the students advise on abstinence and safe sex.
