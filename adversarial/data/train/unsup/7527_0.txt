While in Vegas my friend and I usually go to Bachannals for our traditional buffet visit but this time we decidede to try something new. Wicked Spoon is located inside of the Cosmopolitan but they are charging for parking now so we parked at Aria and walked over. \n\nFor Saturday brunch it was $36\/person but Wicked Spoon had a long line to get to the cashier and an even longer line to wait in before you can get seated. Since time is money and we were on vacay mode, we splurged and got the VIP line pass which was an additional $15\/Person to bypass both lines. It was WORTH IT!! \n\nDuring our brunch, Wicked Spoon had an innovative selection of pastries, cheeses, meats, fruits, traditional American breakfast items, pizza, pasta, sushi, Chinese food and an amazingggggggg dessert section. I really liked the fluffy scrambled eggs, bacon, prime rib, bone marrow and eggplant parmesan. On the other hand the food in the Chinese section was very oily and I couldn't force myself to finish the food and the fruit was very tasteless and bland despite how nicely it was presented. \n\nAs for the desserts I found the pretty looking ones to taste the worst. The tres leches and the strawberry cheesecake were the only cute ones that I enjoyed eating. The most disappointing one was their panna cotta. I finished my meal at their astounding gelato bar with a scoop of white chocolate coffee and balsamic strawberry gelato. It was perfect! \n\nI know I did not eat my money's worth but it was a nice experience. I still prefer the Bacchanal at Ceasar's Palace but I would not mind coming back here to try their dinner one day.
