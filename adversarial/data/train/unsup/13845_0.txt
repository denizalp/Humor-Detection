I recently decided to check this place out being around the area. Unfortunately I cannot say I will be eating here again. I came on a Friday night with a party of 4 and it took an overly excessive amount of time for our drinks to even get to the table. By the time our food had arrived to the table it had been an hour of sitting down waiting.\n\nWe started with the calamari which was actually really good, but for the price point and quantity delivered to us, it did not seem reasonably priced. For my entree I had gotten a cacciatore pizza. I was very displeased that the pizza was already cold by the time I had started to eat it and requested it be placed in the oven to be heated up. The pizza was delicious though once I had gotten it back! I would say the quality is almost there but still a bit quite overpriced for what was received.\n\nLong story short, I feel the restaurant has plenty of potential to be successful. I feel where they have went wrong is trying to overdress basic quality pizza to the extent that they advertise it to be something extravagant which sets the expectations a little too high. Still a great place to try and would recommend giving it your own try.
