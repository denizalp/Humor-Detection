The reason: daughters 21st birthday\n\nThe Goal: Bar hop and PARTY!! \n\n2nd Stop : Whisky Row\n\nIts 10:30ish on a Sunday night and man can this place bring you down, this is not a hot spot yall. Maybe had 10 people in there, but for my daughter's 1st night out clubbing she liked the relaxed pace.\n\nBartenders are friendly and easy on the eyes, small dance floor, drinks were strong and just what the night needed.  We had fun here but lost  1\/2 her party, something about having to work on a Monday haha.  \n\nI wouldn't mind coming back and checking Whisky Row out on a not so slow night, seems like it to could be fun place.
