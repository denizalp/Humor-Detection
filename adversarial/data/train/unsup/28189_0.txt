Wait for it.... ok don't! Now run to Nook Kitchen! I already enjoyed this place and I decided to do something special for my wife's birthday. I bought tickets for the ballet and made reservations to stay the night n Phoenix and then while on a business trip I was in Nook and decided to ask the staff if the chef could maybe prepare a special meal for my wife and to top it off she is vegan! They were all willing to help me out and the chef was going to make something that wasn't the standard plate of pasta or a bowl of veggies. I left it up to the chef entirely and OMG he did not let me down! Chef made a grilled portobello mushroom with a ratatouille with pears poach in red wine with sun choke chips and a little hummus with ribbon cut carrots. This was AMAZING!!!! I don't know if I've ever had food that good in my mouth ever! I ordered the Salmon which was amazing but had I known I would have ordered a second of what the chef made for my wife! I can't say thank you enough to the chef and the manager Nick and all of the staff at Nook Kitchen my wife was floored by the effort and instantly fell in love with this place. You will not be disappointed and I am a lifelong customer after this amazing experience!
