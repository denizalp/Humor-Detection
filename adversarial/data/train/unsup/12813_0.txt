Milk- It does a body good.  Now when it's combined with flour, sugar and eggs... I still count it as good! \n\nIf you happen to be in or around the Cosmopolitan Hotel, stop in Milk Bar for a tasty treat we all deserve.  Their infamous Bday Cake is now being served by the slice.  There seems to be a slight citrus flavor which I couldn't quite nail down but really gave it a unique flavor.  The cake itself was moist even for a slice.  We were there when they opened up for the day so that might play a factor in how moist the slices will be.  It was the perfect treat for us to share.  \n\nMilk Bar is located on the second floor near their other restaurants.  The staff were friendly and quick to serve. Thank you for the treat and I hope to return soon.
