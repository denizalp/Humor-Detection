Finally made it out here. I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted with a warm welcome and all the menus. Ordered hot sake since it was -140548^9 degrees and it hit the spot. I was really craving sushi. and ordered a spicy tuna roll and the pan fried dumplings.\n\nMy roll came out first and was presented very well. and was on par with any other sushi i have had might now have been the best but it was still very good i ate all of it. The Dumplings however were nothing less than exceptional. i nice crispy outside and a very flavorful inside. i recommend getting an order to share with whom ever you are with.\n\nMike the manager came over and introduced himself to me. I enjoyed a pleasant conversation with him while i waited for my food. after i ate he checked back up with me and see how everything was, I said i might get another roll as I was still a little hungry. I told me not to, order anything. He sent me out an order of the Udon noodles. \n**(he doesn't know about my obsession with Asian noodles). But let me tell you this was one of the best noodles i have had the please of tasting, no pun intended. the broth was to die for. I would come back just for this dish.\n\nAll in all, I had a great meal here. The service was exceptional. With that said, the price point was a little high for my taste. Was everything good? yes it was. but the price was little high for a sushi dinner. But this is my opinion. I will be back, but prob with a date. which make it tough because the food is damn good.
