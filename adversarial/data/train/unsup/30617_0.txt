Came with a group of friends and ordered the ros√© seafood topoki and the bulgogi kimchi cheese rice. It all tasted pretty good and we liked that we could choose the spice level of the topoki. The kimchi in the rice dish was a bit more spicy than we expected but other than that it was great! We would come back!
