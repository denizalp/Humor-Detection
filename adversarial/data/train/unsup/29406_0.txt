So normally this is my favorite place to eat but the past 2 times I ordered take out it was wrong and the guys taking the order were really rude. He took my order and when he read it back it was wrong. When I corrected him, he waved his hand at me and walked away.  Another employee had to go talk to him and explain he was wrong. Not cool
