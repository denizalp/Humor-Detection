This Starbucks is on the second level of the New York, New York, and inn case you are too lazy to walk here, they are building on on the first (casino) level.  They make their drinks very hot!\n\nVegan Report: I don't drink coffee. Starbucks is my favorite coffee house chain for getting a hot chocolate with soy milk (no whipped cream).
