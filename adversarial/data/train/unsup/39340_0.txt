I was really looking forward to meeting my girlfriends at DVG for lunch. There were ups and downs to my experience.\n\nUp: Service was great. Even though you order from the counter, they bring the food and silverware out to you with a smile and check up on you. And they're quick!\n\nUp: The veggie spring rolls. The order contains four spring rolls and it's $3.99. Despite the price tag, I would say the roll + sweet and sour sauce is worth it.\n\nUp: They have Hawaiian juices and cookies for sale from the Kauai Cookie Co. - my friend was overjoyed to see the cookies, and I was very happy with my strawberry-guava juice.\n\nDown: The only one, and a significant one. My teriyaki chicken was terrible. The mac salad was decent, but, and I hate to say this, Ono's is better. The chicken was drizzled with a tiny amount of sauce (but the sauce was tasty). The biggest problem was that the dark-meat chicken (I'm not a snob, I like dark meat), tasted like ham. It was like they sauteed the chicken with ham, or spam, and then picked out the pork and served the chicken. I've never been so repulsed - except the time I bit into a Milky Way thinking it was a Snickers. \n\nI might go back to try their Kalbi short ribs, but the teriyaki ham experience will ensure that my next visit will be a long ways off.
