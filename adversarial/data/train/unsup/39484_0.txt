They were cool about giving me a free dessert at the restaurant because they hadn't cleaned my room yet, and I had to wait.  I arrived at ~4pm, you'd have thought they would have had that done by that time in the afternoon, but they gracefully handled their shortcoming.  The room was pretty nice.  The bed was comfy, and I loved the pillows.  There are 2 decent tvs which would have been good if I had brought kids.  The bathroom is enormous for some reason, in case you want to dance around in there.  In general everything is in good shape, clean and well kept.  The decor is not bad.  The location is pretty decent too.\nMy critiques: \n1. It's a suite and there isn't really even a mini fridge, just an overstuffed minibar with no room for anything of yours, not to mention the other ridiculously priced items sitting around trying to tempt you to eat or drink them $7 for a bottle of water.  Really Sheraton?  Isn't it ever enough that people are shelling out $300 just to sleep in a room every night?  How about a complimentary $1.50 bottle of water???\n2. The layout kind of feels like you're in a closet anywhere in the suite, the bathroom is actually the most open room in the place.  Suggestion, make the bathroom smaller, get rid of the 2ft thick wall in the middle, and make it a little roomier.  Oh and while you're knocking out that wall, might as well scrap the popcorn on the ceiling, so 80s.\n3. Laundry people, you could cut the amount of bleach in the towel laundry by about 2\/3 and you'd be in the reasonable range.  The towels were ruined by overbleaching to the point that one of them ripped while I was using it, and not because it was so worn out from use\/rewashing, it was still very full of fabric fiber, it was just brittle and abrasive from over bleaching.\n4.No free internet?  Really?  Again, is all of this nickel and diming necessary? It's not fast enough to bother charging extra for, much less $14\/day.  The crappy value extended stay hotel I lived in for $30\/night had $10\/week internet that is twice as fast.\n5.Restaurants are overpriced and not that good.  ~$25 for an ok $10 breakfast buffet? Don't eat anything that isn't bar safe at Finn McCools.  If it isn't simple as a burger, don't risk it.  Just walk across the street to Joey's instead, you won't be sorry.\n6. Constant banging and popping of pipes and vents?  If you're sensitive about odd noises it could be annoying.\nOverall it was nice.  I'd give it 3.5, but it wasn't an option.  If you can handle the goth atmosphere of the Arts hotel it's cheaper, and still pretty nice.
