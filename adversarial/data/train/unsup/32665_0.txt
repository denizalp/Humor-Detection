I came in with a slew of issues that were non-vital - oil leaking (older car), clicking when the car turned, and and electrical problem. Oil pan gasket was replaced and no longer leaks. Clicking is still there (couldn't find the source). And the electrical problem was fixed. Decent prices. Liked the offer to see old parts that were taken off and point to where the problem was  on the car. Gives you a better sense that good work was done.\n\nThey do offer a discount for making a review. However, the discount is only for the next visit. I wish that I would have known so I could have saved a bunch since this bill wasn't all that cheap.
