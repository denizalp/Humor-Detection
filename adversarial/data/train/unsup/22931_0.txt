I had a great experience with Uber this week. With one dead car and one working car, I opted to leave my car with my wife and let Uber bring me to the airport. With several cars not too far away, it was pleasant to see my driver on the way and a perfect ETA. He showed up right on time. Nice clean car, nice polite drive, we chatted while he drove me safely to the airport and dropped me off. No money changing hands, no problems at all. As soon as I got out of the car, I got my emailed receipt. $12 for a ride to the airport. AWESOMEsauce.
