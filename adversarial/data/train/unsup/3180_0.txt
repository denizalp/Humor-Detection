**GETTING HOT UP IN HERE**\n\nA generous friend reserved and paid for a table during Super Bowl. $250 worth of buffalo wings and drinks.\n\n2 bottles of Grey Goose later, we were dancing after every Green Bay Packers' touchdown.\n\nLots of YOUNG good looking people here. Likey lots.\n\nThe back bar was nice; friendly bartenders and customers.\n\nThe real party was with the DJ and the people sitting at the booth tables. Enjoyable fun.\n\nMargaritas were weak-sauce and so was the service at times. Our waitress forgot some of our orders, but the place was packed and busy, so somewhat understandable.\n\nThere was a fire truck in the middle of the place (where the DJ spun), a front patio, and numerous televisions.\n\nRECOMMEND for your next Super Bowl party needs.
