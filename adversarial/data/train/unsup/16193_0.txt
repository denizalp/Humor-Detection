I am looking at these reviews and realizing that people, perhaps new to the business world do not understand how business credit works. \nI've used quick spark to get equipment for multiple new business i started, which quick spark also helped me incorporate a few. And then used said equipment to make profit in both the short and long term which i used to pay back my loans? \n\nIf you are not turning enough profit then something is incorrect with YOUR business model, not with the people who financed your equipment. \n\nIf you need $500 bucks go ask your grandma, but if you need $5000 go with quick spark. I have used them to scale up multiple locations and they really work FAST! which in a deadline oriented industry such as mine has been a live saver!
