This review is NOT for Dr. Webb - he is amazing, as is Janice. This is for the way I was just treated on the phone; didn't catch her name since I was so distraught by the way she spoke to me that I hung up. If this is the way Burt's former patients get treated, I'm going to have to say STAY AWAY.\n\nI was a patient of Burt and Janice for years when I lived in Arizona. Burt did multiple procedures on me and always made me feel comfortable - he was an amazing gyno.\n\nI now live in California and called Burt's office for a quick question regarding PARAGARD, a new birth control method I am looking into trying (the IUD.) I wanted his, or even his nurse Janice's professional opinion on the safety of having a PARAGARD put in considering my medical history.\n\nThe lady at the desk told me, extremely rudely, that I would have to come in. I explained that I don't live there anymore and that I just needed two minutes on the phone or even an email correspondence. She reiterated, very coldly and with a serious attitude, that they don't do phone or email consults and that I would have to find a way to come in. Her tone was SO condescending and mean. Beyond that, this \"policy\" is appalling. So I can't talk to my doctor who has performed multiple procedures on me, the ONLY gyno that knows my medical history, for two minutes? Not even an email?! I have never in my life experienced something like this. I am literally in tears right now and have no idea what to do.\n\nBottom line: I would have recommended Burt to anyone and everyone before this experience, but if this is how former patients get treated then I will warn everyone to stay the hell away.
