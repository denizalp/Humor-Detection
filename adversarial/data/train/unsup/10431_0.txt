2.5 stars \/\/ I've heard many great things and seen many enticing photos of food from Hash Kitchen but unfortunately my experience didn't meet expectations. \n\nIt started off with one of the hostesses quoting me a 30-45 min wait without getting down and of my info or giving me a buzzer. It wasn't until I realized it 10-15 min later, I went back inside to follow up. A different hostess apologized and added me to the (end of the) list. Annoyed, but it's a busy Sunday, mistakes happen. \n\nI ordered the Herb Fried Chicken Hash with a pancake substitute (instead of a biscuit). \n**** ASK FOR HOT SAUCE!! The food had no flavor whatsoever. My chicken was so sad. No hints of herb - let alone any seasoning. KFC or Popeyes would've been better. Potatoes could've been cooked a bit longer to get a crisp. The best thing on my plate were the fried leeks. That I originally didn't ask for but they made it to the plate anyways - kitchen probably knew I needed them. *shrug* \n\nI suppose this place is cool if you're here for their Bloody Mary's but I personally will not be making this 30 minute drive again.
