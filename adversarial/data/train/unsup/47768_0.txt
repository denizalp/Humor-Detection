I really enjoyed this place! I was visiting Toronto with some friends, and we were looking for a good pub, and kind of just stumbled upon the town crier. I was amazed by how many beers they had available on tap. I didn't try any of the food because we ate before going there but all the alcohol I got there was great! They had some really great ciders there as well as beers, so there is something for everyone. The staff was all really friendly. We sat at the bar, so we were right next to the bartender the whole night, and he always gave us samples of things we wanted to try, and recommendations for what he thought we would like based on what we were ordering. Later on when we were tipsy we ended up having some good conversations with him, and the guy who was seating people. The place has a rather laid back atmosphere which is nice, and I thought that the old pub kind of decoration seemed fitting. I really loved the place, and plan on visiting it again the next time I come to Toronto!
