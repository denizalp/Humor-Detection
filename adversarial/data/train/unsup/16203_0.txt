Stopped by this spot with the bf for brunch on a recent Sunday afternoon.  Had been meaning to try it for a long while since it seemed to have vegan options and positive reviews, but I always prefer being able to scope out a menu before making a trip.  This \"blind date\" was most definitely worthwhile though!  \n\nVery small\/intimate space consisting of a long bar area up front, a small seating area a few steps down in the back, and a slightly larger back courtyard patio.  The bartender\/server was very friendly and came out shortly after we grabbed a table on the patio to give us menus and ask about drinks.  Grabbed a $5 mimosa and bf got a pint of something tasty and local, which I think was equally well priced.  \n\nPretty well everything on the menu could be made vegan, but non-vegetarians don't fret...there are options for you too!  I got the vegan breakfast burrito and it was deeelicious!  Tofu scramble, sauteed veggies, vegan sour cream and melted daiya cheese.  I was also really amazed by the unique dressing on the accompanying green salad, and the house made hot sauce.  Bf had the granola bowl with yoghurt, bananas and quinoa flakes.  It was quite a large portion, filling and also tasted great.  Our meal including drinks came to about $33 with tax.  Very good price to quality & portion ratio.  This spot is ideal for grabbing food, a few drinks or both with a small group of friends. Will definitely be back soon!
