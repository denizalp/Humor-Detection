I love this place!!! My best friend and I go so often! \nThe owner, we think, is this cute petite woman who is always in a great mood! She is always laughing and enjoying the place! We love how much she likes being there!!\nOur favorite cocktail is the ginger, ginger! My girlfriend and I just can't get enough! I'm a beer drinker more often, but if I get a cocktail - that's the one! \nThe edamame is hands down the BEST in town! It's my favorite to the point that I craaaaave it! We love the garlic noodles as well! So so good! Sometimes it's hard to not order two orders of each!! \nOf the rolls, we always get the sunshine rolls, with chicken!:) mmmmm! Now i wanna go!! \nThe outside is really cute with the pretty outside lights!!! I come here all the time, I'll continue to come, and I'll always recommend! Stop by soon!! :):)
