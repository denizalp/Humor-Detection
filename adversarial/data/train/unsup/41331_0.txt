Excellent!! This is a superb pitstop if you're passing through on the highway. It's like a five minute drive from the exit, nice restroom facilities, very nice trails and boardwalk to the waterfall.\n\nNot for sure why it says Brandywine Falls tour- it's just a free self-parking explore type of place. Rick in wildlife and peaceful sounds of the stream and waterfalls make this an exceptional place to hang out.  \n\nThis is a prime example of a, \"Hidden Gem.\"
