Like what some other reviewers have said, service here is pretty spotty. We were only a party of 2 so as long as we had our waters and orders correct, that's all I cared about. Pretty much you come in, place your order, they give you your food, you eat, pay for your bill and leave.\nSure, the spicy tuna rolls and this other sushi roll my friend and I ordered were delicious but damn...the price was pretty expensive. $10-12 for spicy tuna rolls!? Come on now.... Then again...look at where Momo Sushi is located at: Henderson. There are plenty of other sushi places especially on the West side\/Chinatown that have better prices.\n\nThe only reason why we came here for lunch was because we were in the area and we were craving for sushi.
