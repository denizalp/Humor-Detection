This place was pretty amazing. The owner (?) has great customer service, honestly, better than most full-fledged restuarants. The food was A+ so if you're ever at the food court, stop by. You definitely won't regret it.\n\nI got a chicken gyro and mozzarella sticks (the marina sauce was AWESOME) and my husband got gyro fries. He's usually pretty stingy on giving compliments but he had nothing but praise for both the service and the food. Come check it out, seriously!
