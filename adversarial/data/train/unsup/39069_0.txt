I had heard a lot about this place before going. I was kind of turned off by the hipster feel and after eating at Franklin's in Austin, I assumed Little Miss BBQ couldn't add up. Having said that, this restaurant started off from behind. However, despite my preconceived notions I was knocked out of my seat by the burnt ends, sausage and sides. I've returned many times since then to eat the best brisket in town.
