Just called and spoke to \"Jasmine.\" I asked to reserve a limo for my 12 guests for Saturday May 21st. She said \"no, the 21st is a Thursday.\" I said no, it is a Saturday and it's my wedding, I think I know when it is. She continued to argue with me about the date and said the 23rd is a Saturday. Then I corrected her and told her that she was looking at the month of APRIL NOT MAY like I asked. Then after getting the price she asks to put me on hold. OMG no thank you. I hung up. If you cannot get the day correct over the phone especially when I am telling you the DATE OF MY WEDDING then I worry you will mess this up for me. No thank you.
