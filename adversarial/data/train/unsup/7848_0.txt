Oh Raku.\n\nSo simple. So straightforward. So much about the quality of the simple star ingredient, whatever that may be. So delicious. Nearly every single thing of the 12+ things I tried was good.\n\nNotable favorites include the pork cheek, kobe beef fillet with wasabi, foie gras, pork belly, bacon enoki, pork intestine, and sea urchin. The green tea creme brulee was also delicious.\n\nWhat you shouldn't fail to order is the cold and creamy RAKU TOFU. We even ordered seconds of this.. (Along with some of the others mentioned in my notable favorites.) Those of you who don't like tofu: my husband isn't a fan of tofu either and he LOVED this.\n\nI liked Raku so much I went back the next day.\n\nThe dining space is very small so make reservations!\n\nMy only gripe is that both days, the foie gras chawanmushi (egg custard) wasn't available! *tear*
