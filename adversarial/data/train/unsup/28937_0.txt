The best move of all time - a happy hour with the coworkers at Sienna Mercato's rooftop bar, Il Tetto. The atmosphere up there is so lively. Although it can get loud, the deals are great, the wait staff is fast and friendly, and everyone always enjoys themselves. I have to say, Sienna Mercato is not light handed when it comes to their drinks (which is a good thing!). Two Froze Ros√©s will definitely do the trick. Also, I want to add that the appetizers are delicious, but the pretzel takes the cake. For $5 dollars, you can get two huge, dense pretzels with some of the best beer cheese you've ever had. I 100% recommend Sienna Mercato to anyone, and I can't wait to try out the other levels (Emporio & Mezzo).
