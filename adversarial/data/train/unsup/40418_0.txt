Came here with my mom after dinner as the desserts at the restaurant did not appeal to us. There were about 6 different specialty cakes on display, and we went with lavender with strawberry buttercream (based on other reviews, I believe the flavors regulary change). We were given a generous slice and they also gave me a candle since it was her birthday. \n\nCute coffeeshop\/bakery with Victorian plating, decor and furniture. Would be a cozy place to spend an afternoon or have a date.
