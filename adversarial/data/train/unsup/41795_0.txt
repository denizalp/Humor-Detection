I love eating at egg works! I never have to wait long to get seated. The waitresses take really good care of you. I've been here several times already and I've never been disappointed with anything. My favorite thing to get is the banana nut muffin. Oh my gosh it's the Best banana nut muffin ever and it's super moist and soft. Also, you can get one by checking in on yelp. So far all of the Dishes that I've tried here are very good, but my absolute favorite one is the spinach Benny. It's so delicious and also healthy and not too heavy for breakfast. I usually get that with a side of fruits. This place is Bomb And I just love eating here because they have so many different choices!
