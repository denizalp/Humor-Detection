Ok food, if cooked as asked. I ordered Philly cheesesteak, no onions, peppers on side. Came out with onions. Sent it back, came back with no onions and no cheese. I mentioned it to our waitress and she said, yes there is. There wasn't. Just mayo. She asked if I wanted her to take it back. I just said no, just bring me the cheese. She had an attitude the rest of our visit. My friend had the pulled pork. It was wonderful. I only ate two bites of my cheesesteak. Waitress never offered to take it off the bill, and no manager ever stopped by the table. Could be a 5 star with better service, or at the minimum, an apology.
