Me:  \"Do you mind if we just spend part of a day in Montreal eating croissants and macarons?\"\nHim:  \"That's fine, but I'm going to want to eat REAL food at some point.\"\n\nEnter:  St-Viateur!\n\nI'm salivating right now thinking about the Rosemary & Sea Salt bagels.  When in Montreal, you are a fool to not try at least one bagel.  The only exception is if you have a gluten allergy, but it still might be worth it.*\n\nThe Rosemary & Sea Salt bagel, served with a generous cup of plain cream cheese, is something I thought only existed in the dreams of people who love cheese + carbs.  The bagel had a much more crunchy and chewy texture than lame American bagels, which are often too dense and bread-like.\n\nThe Sesame bagels are also good.  My husband ordered the Omerta, an Italian sandwich on a bagel, and that kept him full awhile as I cruised the area later sampling croissants and macarons.  The bagels with cream cheese are perfect for breakfast, but the sandwiches are definitely ideal for a substantial lunch.\n\nThe Caramel Praline coffee is as good as it sounds too.\n\nSt-Viateur sells bagels and cream cheese to-go, but like other fresh bakery items, the bagels won't last forever.  Since we were on vacation, my storage options were limited so they sat in the paper bag on a countertop.  I purchased four bagels to go (figuring breakfast for the next two mornings), and the last two were hard and difficult to slice.  We still ate them, and they tasted good, and obviously the staleness was MY fault.  \n\nThey also take orders online and will ship to your home, how awesome is that?  Seeing as they will hold up during shipping, ask them at the shop how to best store your bagels.\n\nThe service was fine.  It was very busy, so we weren't doted on, but we weren't completely ignored either.  We were able to enjoy our meal without feeling rushed.\n\n*I'm not a doctor.  Choose wisely.
