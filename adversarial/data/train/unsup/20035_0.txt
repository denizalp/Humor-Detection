Half an hour wait to check in.\nElevator that literally moves side ways.\nLate check out noon for $5, $50 for 3PM.\n$40 resort fee, but pool under construction!\n$4.50 for regular sized bottle water.\n$10 to park in their lot even if you are a guest.\n$11 for a burger that looks like it came from a hospital cafeteria.\nNo refrigerator in the room.\nA\/C whirling sound keep you up at night.\nVery far from the popular parts of the strip. Walked 15 miles in one day and didn't even make it past The Linq.\n\nAlways told myself, ever since I was little, man I really would like to stay in that cool pyramid hotel. What a let down.\n\nMGM master of bloodsucking guests and killer of childhood dreams.
