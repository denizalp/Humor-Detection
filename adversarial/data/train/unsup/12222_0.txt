While I cannot blame them for their ridiculous policies or costs as they simply charge the national average I've never once been here to find more than 2 clerks working, whether it be a weekday during normal hours or early on a weekend when he line extends to thirty.  Sure I realize cutbacks are ongoing, but there is clearly a reason more and more people are using FedEx, UPS, and other carriers these days.
