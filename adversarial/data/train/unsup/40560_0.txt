I researched about twelve different companies and initially selected StorAmerica for it's competitive pricing.  Further dealings with them proved to be immensely satisfying.  There is no question they want to earn your business and take good care of you. District Manager Clarissa and Maria (not sure her title) were impressive.  Caring, friendly, fun, organized; and the facility is clean and cool, and very security minded.  I recommend StorAmerica to anyone looking for affordable, safe storage.
