Polo Towers is my Vegas hotel equivalent of a \"booty-call\".\nIt's never the one I WANT to end up spending the night with but in a pinch (or when booking late notice on a busy weekend) they always come through and I always have a great time!\n\nI book through a time share and have never paid more than $110 a night for a 1 bedroom, full kitchen, living and dining room suite. The hotel is also directly ON the strip (the good portion of the strip too, not the boonies) and it's centrally located. \nIt isn't going to wow you with artsy architecture and flashy gadgets but it's as clean & comfy as you're going to get for the strip w\/o lowering your standards (i.e. Circus-Cicus, The Stratosphere, etc, etc). \n\nI don't normally frequent Walgreen's, McDonald's and 7-11's but they are all within walking distance as are a few other liquor & convenience stores and in a pinch they are LIFESAVERS!\n\nDefinitely take advantage of the full-sized fridge and bring your own beverages! You most likely won't be cooking large meals but snacks and frozen appetizers are always a good idea (yes, there is an oven & microwave). \n\nIt's Vegas, so a penny saved on food, drink & room can be a penny spent someplace far more fabulous!
