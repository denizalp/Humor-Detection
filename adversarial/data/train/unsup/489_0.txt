There is a real frozen yoghurt craze going on in Toronto right now. Everywhere I turn, there is a new Yogurty's opening soon.  Personally, I love  yoghurt. I eat it everyday. So when the possibility came up to \"spruce up\" my regular non-fat yoghurt routine, I decided to go and venture into Yogurty's on Eglinton West. \n\nThis place is teeny-bopper and mommy central.  We decided to go late at night just before closing, so it wasn't very busy then. \n\nI'm so intrigued by these self-serving machines.  I personally went crazy.  I didn't realize you didn't HAVE to fill the whole cup with the yoghurt.  A smaller portion would have been perfectly fine; but-I was feeling gluttonous.  The flavors are great, you really can't go wrong with peanut butter and vanilla.  Add all the toppings, and this could get expensive really fast.
