Today was my colleague's last day at work so I HAD to get her donuts for breakfast. As I didn't have the time to drive to my usual spot - Pink Box I decided to come here as it was on my way and someone else had brought a box of these to work before so I remember them being decent. The service was alright only because unfortunately I do not do well with those who speak with thick accents so I couldn't understand a thing the employee was trying to say or ask me so I just finally said \"give me all the blueberry flavors and whatever else is the most popular\" so she finally shut up, filled the box and cashed me out. For $14 I got 12 gourmet doughnuts and 3 donut holes, not too shabby if you ask me. My colleague appreciated the blueberry choices and it made her farewell, bitter-SWEET :)
