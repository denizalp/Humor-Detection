Nice convention\/conference hotel! Clean rooms and friendly staff. The outdoor pool on the top floor is refreshing and offers a nice view of Las Vegas. (There aren't any poolside umbrellas, though, so it's hot most of the day during summer months.) The free breakfast buffet is a good one, as far as free breakfast buffets go, and the small restaurant has good Happy Hour deals. I 'd stay there again.
