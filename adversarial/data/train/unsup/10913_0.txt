We've had nothing but positive experiences here. The office staff is friendly and attentive. The doctors and nurses are professional and knowledgeable. They've made a huge difference in my son's life. \n\nThis office is unbelievably busy. I've never seen less than ten people waiting but it moves smoothly and efficiently. They bill my insurance without problem. They do have a new patient portal system that wasn't the smoothest transition but now that it's done- the new system is great. Easy access to all of my son's medical records and upcoming appointments and prescriptions. \n\nThe only down side I can see is in calling them. There is always a huge wait and multiple holds and usually more than one phone call to get anything done. \n\nI highly recommend Dr. Bhadawaj and her PA, Kristin.
