Incredibly rude employees who shouldn't be allowed to work in customer service positions. I heard them arguing over which one \"had\" to take my special needs family member. If I knew it wouldn't absolutely ruin his self esteem I would have called the ignorant workers out on their blatant discrimination. I will be contacting the corporate office about this awful treatment. I'm absolutely appalled by this behavior.
