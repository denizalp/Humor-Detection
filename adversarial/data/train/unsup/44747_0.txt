Fried chicken was awesome!  Dear hubby said his burger was \"all right,\" but it looked good as well & the bite I had was delicious especially due to the pork belly rind.\n\nWe didn't order drinks; so we cannot speak to that.  The service was excellent!\n\nHighly recommend.  We didn't have reservations, but we came at an odd hour.
