When it comes to junk food, I'm usually quite loyal to the big Ps, pizza and poutine. Yesterday, though, I had a hankering for a burrito. Honestly, nothing else would do, so at 9pm I scrolled all of my gimme.food.com apps, and joyfully discovered Burrito Boyz on Colllege is in my delivery zone on JustEat.\n\nI ordered the best order. A small chicken burrito, medium spice, with everything and extra cheese. It was perfection. Absolute fucking perfection. Some people, like my know-it-all husband from California (via Indiana, sigh) go on and on about the lack of good Mexican in Toronto, but whatever. I'm not sure the authenticity level the Boyz dole out, but I am sure I love it.
