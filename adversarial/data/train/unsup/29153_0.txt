My husband and I were really looking forward to trying this place out but were sadly disappointed. \n\nThe burger patty was extremely thin... each bite was all bun. My husband's bun appeared to be stale. You'd be better of going to in n out nearby if in the mood for a burger. A burger should leave you full when you're done... We left feeling like we could eat more. \n\nI also find it necessary to note that when we left, there were no employees in sight, no cashiers, cooks, no one. They must have all been in the back. \n\nFor the price and quality or lack thereof, we wouldn't be compelled to go back.
