At times can be one of the busiest airports in the country.  Fly in here on a Friday night or leave here on a Sunday morning and it's mad chaos!!  Lucky for me, I've experienced that before so I now fly in on a Saturday morning and leave on a Monday morning and it's perfect.  I like this airport because they plan for large crowds.  TSA checkpoint takes a while but they have a lot of lines open to get you through quickly.  Unlike some airports that will have only a few lines open no matter how crowded it gets.  Kiosks for check in is always available at most airlines.  And where else can you play slots while you wait to catch your plane flight how?  This is one of my favorite places to fly in and out of next to the Tampa airport.
