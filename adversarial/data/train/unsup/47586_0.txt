Second time having dinner here and it was just as good as the first time. This restaurant\/bar has great cocktails and southern inspired tapa-like dishes. It's great for sharing. Ordered my favorite crispy jambalaya. It looks like large black matte marbles, and tastes like creamy spicy rice on the inside with a crunchy exterior. The texture has a nice contrast. Also ordered my favorite southern grits dish, but this time it was updated from last visit. Today, there was a chilled prawn mixture on top of a fried grits patty. Loved the creamy cheesy grits as usual. Next up was the duck and dumpling in a broth. This is shredded duck with something like gnocchi in a soup, very enjoyable if you like duck flavors. Also tried the new pork and coleslaw, and it wasn't what I expected. It came out looking more like a salad than an entree, very creative flavors of thinly sliced smoke pork layered with tangy coleslaw and roasted pine nuts. It reminded me of both Asian and southern influences. The ambiance is soft, chill and romantic. To make the experience even more relaxing, the service is great. The wait staff are very attentive and the chef will chat with you if you sit at the bar.
