I don't know what all the hype is. I went there the other day and tried some of the food, and was straight out unimpressed. It could have been an off night. It seemed busy, but it was not crazy busy where the service and quality would have been compromised. There was a Pens game going on at the same time, so the bar was a bit full with people watching the TV's.\nItalian is one of my favorite types of food, and I don't consider myself a snob at all. However, of the three appetizers ordered between my friend and I, not one was finished by the time we left.\nOn a plus note, the drinks were decent, and the service was ok.
