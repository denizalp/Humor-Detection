I have come to realize over my Vegas trips that you are probably never going to be blown away by a Vegas buffet (or any buffet anywhere really).  The Buffet at Treasure Island fit the bill of your average, run of the mill buffet.  \n\nI would suggest ordering your food from the pasta station.  That way your food is freshly prepared and exactly what you want.  The gentleman working the pasta buffet when I was there was very talented and whipped me up a tasty seafood ravioli dish and made sure I even got fresh bread on the side.  \n\nI did really enjoy the dessert table.  Everything I got was tasty--and I got a LOT of dessert!  I had to grab a thing of cotton candy because it would make a cute picture (think of me how you wish, but what is more adorable than a cotton candy selfie?!).  Anyway, the cotton candy was grape flavored!  I am normally not a huge cotton candy person, but we ate the whole thing!  Try it out for something different :)
