I said yes to the dress today and I am still in shock and awe (the good kind) of what an amazing team there is at Brilliant Bridal! I was lucky enough to get a same day appointment and my stylist Kate was AMAZING! She is so genuinely sweet and very knowledgeable about the entire process, fabrics, alteration options, and most importantly making nervous wreck brides to be like me feel like princesses! I tried on close to a dozen dresses I'm sure and she never once made me feel pressured or rushed. And she knows her way around a dress! She made it so easy to visualize what it will look like when altered with her clipping and was very straightforward and realistic with alteration turnouts. I am so grateful! Me and my sister had so much fun and the entire staff (I don't remember everyone's names!) were so welcoming from start to end. Usually you can expect to have some sort of bad vibe almost anywhere you go, but the atmosphere is incredible. These ladies do an amazing job and if you are looking for your dress, definitely make a stop in here, it may be your first and only like it was for me!
