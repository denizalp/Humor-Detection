The Spicy Peanut Curry makes me happy.\n\nCurry is a beautiful form of comfort food, but when the curry broth is largely composed of peanut butter you've got a whole new level of comfort food. Rich, warm, and bold in terms of flavor, the Spicy Peanut Curry at Lao Laan-Xang is genius. \n\nThe reality is that once you've had a dose of fantastic curry, whether it be Japanese curry, Indian curry, or Thai style curry, there is no going back. You're a curry fan for the long haul. That curry has deviously snuck its way into your life and before you know it, you'll be dreaming of the lovely simmering of coconut milk and peanut sauce for days. \n\nLucky for you, the Spicy Peanut Curry at Lao Laan-Xang offers the remedy, so go ahead and feed that crave.
