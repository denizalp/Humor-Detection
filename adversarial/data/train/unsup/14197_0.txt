Every time I go to this Zabas there's always something that smells in here compared to the other Zabas I've been to. It smells like a dirty towel....\n\n\nTonight I went here to get my usual a steak salad. Guacamole always comes with it and when the girl was finishing with my bowl. I asked her for some guacamole. She says that they're completely out! Absolutely none left -_- wish I would've knew from the beginning so I could go to chipotle instead and get a bowl with guac over there. I absolutely love guac! \n\nSo after leaving Zabas, I decided to drive to the grocery store to buy some guac. to eat with my salad. When I come home I can't believe how cheap they are about pouring the salad dressing!!! Wish I would've saw it when she grabbed it out of the fridge. It's like seriously whoever poured it has never eaten a salad or something cause it was not enough. -_- from now on I think I'll just avoid going to this location. There's always some type of issue with this location whenever I get my food
