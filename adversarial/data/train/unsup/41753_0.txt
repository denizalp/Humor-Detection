For those now aware, there are no rental cars available right at McCarran airport. Instead, the bulk of the rental car companies are all housed here - a short shuttle ride from the airport. It's a nice, well-maintained facility - restrooms, drinks, etc. are all available. And it's relatively easy to navigate. Compared to most other rental car areas I've been in, this one is top-notch.
