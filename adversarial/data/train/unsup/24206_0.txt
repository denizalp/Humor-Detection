If you are looking for a good workout that's more interesting than just running around a track, Camelback is a great option. If you are looking for a chance to get outside to experience Arizona's natural desert beauty then Camelback is a very poor choice. We did the Echo Canyon Summit trail and I really am surprised that people call the views amazing and breathtaking because the views are just urban sprawl & fencing. Yes, there is actually a large portion of the hike that is FENCED IN - I felt like I was in prison. The only 'breathtaking' part about it is the lethargy I feel when surrounded by ugly urban sprawl & large high rises & too much metal. Sure there is an expansive \"view\" from the top but the view is ugly buildings that were not built to blend in with the landscape. Also parking was impossible. There was actually a giant line of cars just parked & waiting in line for a parking spot in the tiny lot for much much longer than it would take to park somewhere else further and walk to the trailhead...which makes me think that at least some of the people coming here must not get outdoors very often.\n\nBasically I was really disappointed by Camelback as an opportunity to get out in nature & enjoy the desert. I definitely would recommend against coming here for anything other than a quick workout.
