My gf and I had a romantic weekend here.\n\nYes, the room is very stunning and took a hole out of our pocket.  The hallways itself was already making the walk special.  Once inside, wow.   Bed and pillow were very soft, probably egyptian? 800 tread? Obviously, better than what we had at home.  If you have kids, don't let them play around the mini bar.  Everything is weight sensor on there.  I like the set up, L shape couch with a flat screen that turns to view on the bed or couch. \n\nLadies, my gf loves the bathroom.  Very nice and roomy.  Has a little seat that you can sit on and apply make up with a circular lite mirror. Duel sinks.  Your welcome.\n\nWe had a deal on the booking.  2 night stay, $50 in gaming, 2 tickets to Le Reve = $500.  Not bad since one night at Wynn is around $299?\n\nHospitality is very wonderful.  They assist you the moment you come into the lobby area.  Checking in is simple and you can hardly call it a line since we only waited about 3 mins.
