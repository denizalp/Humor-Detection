By far the BEST gourmet restaurant in town and in such a discerning area. You would never believe South Point Casino, home of the cowboys, carries such a delectable eatery inside.\n The service is top notch! \n We went all out and ended up spending about 1200-1300 not including tip here. (I know it sounds nuts but it was a very special  occasion)\n About 500 on special aged wine & aged scotch\nStarted off with some oysters, escargot, beet salad. Then we had veal, filet mignon, sea bass, lobster (all cooked perfectly per our request). Sides were carrots, mushrooms, creamed spinach, asparagus, mashed potatoes, more oyster!!\nToward the end we were so stuffed but I could not pass up the Bananas Foster. Now, it's tough to compare to the way my husband makes banana foster but Michaels comes in as a strong competitor! \nA one job Michaels!! \n We first went there 8 years ago & recently went again, nothing has changed. We love you!!
