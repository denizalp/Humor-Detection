It's a church... yes. It's a Catholic Cathedral... yes. It's a gutted Roman Catholic historical landmark made into a brewery\/restaurant ... yes. \nThe crucifix was hauled off and brewers were put in place. Soooo sinister.\nFood was 3.5 but i really just wanted to come here because it was so awkward. I'd prob come back just because it is unique.
