Beer! (Lots of them!)\nWine! (Great selection!)\nGames! (For your imbibing entertainment!)\nGrilled cheese sandwiches! (GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES!)\n\nOverall, I prefer the ambiance of Whining Pig more (It feels like a real city bar), but prefer the Pig's Meow because I've never had to wait to get two seats together.\n\nThis is a great place - the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and it's a great environment to escape the real world for just a little bit.\n\nDid I mention grilled cheese sandwiches?
