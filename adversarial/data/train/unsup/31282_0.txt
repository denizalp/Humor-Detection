I use to love Walgreens. It was my go to cosmetics and photo place. Not anymore. Their rewards program leaves much to be desired. It never adds up to anything. Nothing compared to CVS. They always misplace my photo orders which is annoying because I always and I mean always have to wait forever at the counter waiting for someone to come over to help me. The cosmetics lady is really sweet though. She always goes through a box of coupons trying to get me a discount. Kudos to her. This a clean and organized store. But if you offer a rewards program make it worth my wild to continue to come back. \n1\/28\/2017\nTruly is annoying that you always have to wait for an employee at the Photo Booth. There is no convenience and having to wait five minutes or more for an employee to come grab your pictures and ring you up. It never fails. Then only to have another item that you are purchasing ring up incorrectly.  So you have to go back in and wait some more, so you can get a return handled.  The whole rack of leggings are right by the register with orange tags plastered all over it. You would think the products by the register would be in the system correctly.
