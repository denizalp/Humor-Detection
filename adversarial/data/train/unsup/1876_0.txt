after attending day club we walked up to the second floor of cosmo and walked down the hallway and reached a long line. i overall wouldn't come back because i didn't find anything particularly special for the price. but worth to say you tried the hype.\n\nPROS:\n-good crust (crispy and thin)\n-really accommodating staff (changed my order to go)\n-packed to go slices well\n-no wait on them making pizza. very efficient in having all the slices prepared\n-HUGE slices (i ordered two)\n-cool space\n\nCONS:\n-over priced (about $5.50 for a basic slice... get whole pizza for about $30 if you're sharing)\n-VERY oily... i usually don't care about oil\/grease but this pizza had too much\n-nothing special about the taste (at least for pepperoni)\n-too long of a line (30-45 min wait) wish they went a little faster? but i guess its a small shop so they can't really do that
