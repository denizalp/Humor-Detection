WOAH.\n\nYou tell me: Are not \"cookie\" and \"outlet\" the best two words that could possibly be combined on a huge sign?\n\nYES.\n\nThis is a place worth the drive, even if you live on the west end. We don't - we're East Yorkers... I'm just sayin;... it's amazing.\n\nMr. Rosie S. and I spent $15. Here is what we left with:\n\n1. Two boxes of Fruit Creams - $1.50 each\n\n2. Two trays of Oatmeal cookies (without outer box) - a la Dad's - $1.50 each\n\n3. Bag of Ritz Chips - $2\n\n4. Jumbo box of Premium Plus crackers - $2\n\n6. GIANT bag (think half-size garbage bags) full of 4-packs of Chips Ahoy! cookies... there must be a couple hundred in there... HALLOWEEN treats, anyone??? We'll be returning at the end of October for suresies. And it was $5. For reals. Five bucks. Bring this to a party and you have instant popularity... AND you only spent a fiver. Awesomesauce. Sac o'cookies!!!\n\nThere are even bigger bags full of messed-up cookies, but they looked a little gross, and we could never in a million years eat them quickly enough that they wouldn't go stale!\n\nThey take all forms of payment and will help you out to your car if you are buying enough cookies to feed your small village... which some people were totally doing. \n\nWe went on a Saturday, early afternoon, and it was busy. It was also two weeks before school starts again, and there were clearly lots of families stocking up on school lunch supplies. (Another great use for this place!)\n\nLocation has moved from the factory proper (off of O'Connor) to a plaza across the way off of Bermondsey. There's a sandwich board sign with a map to the new location if you can't figure it out - but it's just south of O'Connor on Bermondsey, one of the first driveways on the east side
