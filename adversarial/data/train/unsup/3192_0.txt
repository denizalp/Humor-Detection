We had a very good experience with Arizona Painting Company, We hired them based off of Rosies House, KTAR, and Yelp. We had our 2,600 sq ft two story house painted. This included the exterior of the house, the back yard wall, and two interior walls. They did a great job, it took them 3-days to complete. My wifes expectations are very high, so she pointed out a couple of things she wanted to be taken care of. And they had no problems meeting her demands. Both of us are very satisfied with the work, and definitely would recommend them.
