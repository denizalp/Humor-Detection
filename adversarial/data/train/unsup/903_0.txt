This place is the original Sin Club but Penthouse took over. New makeover. Nice pole. The girls are hit and miss. Sometimes it's good. Sometimes its REALLY BAD! I like the seating but if you wanna sit by the stage it's like 100 bucks for you and your buddies. For locals they have a 702 room. If you're vip you get a free drink everytime you come. My room mate used to work here but she wasn't making shit because people started to die out from coming here. I dunno why. It's a really nice place. Maybe the girls? When I first came out after the change it was really laxed and people were cool. I liked the bartenders. Except one tried to change the price of a skyy cocktail for me - charging me 11 bucks instead of 9. Stupid bitch. I read the menu. I know the price and I speak and read ENGLISH! Sigh....Whatever. I think I'm just numb from strip clubs. Someone should start like a mindf*ck club. Maybe I'll get wood?
