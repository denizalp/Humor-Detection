The softshell crab burger is really really good! I also had the fish & chips and its very pleasing as well. The batter wasn't too thick, the seasoning was just right for my taste. The place is small inside,  but it still had a big size table that fitted me and my 6 other friends. I'm sure on a good day they would be jammed pack, but we were lucky when we went and there was room.\nThe fries is the reason that made it a 4 and not 5 star. It wasn't fresh and a bit over fried. They are very generous I think because they give free water with lemon. Where a lot of other burgers\/hotdog\/fastfood would only sell bottled. this is a place that I'll definitely hit again when I'm in the area because I really like seafood and fry foods...so the best of both worlds.
