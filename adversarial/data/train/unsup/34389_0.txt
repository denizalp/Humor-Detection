Dropped in for dinner last night and ended up staying for the live music. I had the Southwest burger which was delicious.  The patty was well cooked with a nice smoky flavor. After dinner I migrated over to the bar side of the building just as the band was getting started.  The music was eclectic and fun and both the staff and guests were friendly and fun to be around.  Tried a Coffee Kolsch from Hess Brewing and it was awesome, tasted just like iced coffee. Great visit, can't wait to go back!!!
