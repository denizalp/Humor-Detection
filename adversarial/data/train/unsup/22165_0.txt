Samosa Factory ha being reborn with a savior fare in their dishes that have me dreaming of my next meal there, the food is flavor-full yet light on the stomach  unlike typical Indian cuisine that tends to be way to greasy and the spices seem to hit your stomach and make u want to fall asleep with nightmares. I will be coming back more often now specially for lunch since their prices are as good as any joints around town. Make sure to try their rice pudding it is so simple and so delightful makes me have daydreams on how good it is, but try for yourself and enjoy the rebirth of this great local spot....Njoy
