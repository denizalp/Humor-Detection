Happy Hour! My coworkers organized a happy near my home. I was ecstatic it was going to be at the Yard House. Why? Truffle fries, of course. Because I had to pick up children, I sadly could not get an Angry Orchard Hard Apple Cider on draft. I settled for their perfectly balanced virgin strawberry lemonade. I had 2 glasses. Of course, I had my delectable truffle fries. Shoestring fries, perfectly fried, crispy on the outside with a little soft on the inside, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, parsley, drizzled with a touch of truffle oil. My coworkers looked like they were enjoying their chicken tenders. For $1.30 more, you can convert the fries to truffle fries. Their Margherita pizza looked okay with whole cloves of roasted garlic. The portion for the chicken nachos was enormous. Wow! However, glancing over the spread, I still stick to the truffle fries because they are head and shoulders above everything else! \n\nP\/S Arizona's beautifully cool November weather made it amazing to dine on the patio. It was truly a lovely evening with a few of my favorite educators.
