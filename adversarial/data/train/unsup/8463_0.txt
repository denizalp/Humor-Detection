Ciros has the absolute worst men's room in the city.   When given the choice between using these washrooms or being forced to go on dialysis, it's pretty much a toss-up.   Arguably you'd be better off hitting the hospital, because at least those rooms are sterile and you might get a free cookie.\n\nSure, it's off the beaten path.  And by \"beaten\" we mean 'physically swarmed by the teenage street gangs who seem to live in Landsdowne station' and by \"path\"  we mean 'the spooky stripclub and social-club alleys' surrounding this notoriously sketchbag stretch of Bloor street.\n\nBut, aside from that... it's truly a wonderful spot.\n\nOne of the best beer lists in the city.... including items that you won't find anywhere else.   A knowledgeable and friendly staff.   A selection of interesting patrons who are all there for a similar urban experience.  Great post-modern decor.   Spectacular corn bread.\n\nA great surprise on a Friday night.
