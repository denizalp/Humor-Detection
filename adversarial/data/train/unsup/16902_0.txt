If you're a MUA user (http:\/\/www.makeupalley.com) you'll know that the Queen Helene Mint Julep mask is one of the best, cheapest and most reviewed face products you can buy. And so far the only place I've found it in Toronto is this store. \n\nToronto only has two Sally Beauty Supply locations. There's this one and the other is in Scarborough. It's a bit of a trek to Keele & St. Clair, but worth it for a seasonal re-stocking of Mint Julep tubs and Ardell lashes (super cheap here). They also sell cheap beauty supply standards like salon hair clips (good for sectioning the hair while drying or flatironing) and Clairol Shimmerlights shampoo for highlighted hair (the best anti-fade\/brightening product for blonde hair, ever, and very hard to find).\n\nTake the #41 or 89 bus from Keele Station (~8 minutes) to St. Clair and walk west a block through The Stockyards shopping complex. Or take the 512 streetcar across St. Clair (oooooh, syke - St. Clair is a shitshow due to construction! So just take one of the buses).
