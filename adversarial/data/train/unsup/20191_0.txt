A family favorite since they were located on Buckeye...I will always love the Balaton. Also, this is one local Hungarian restaurant my Grandmother did not get into an argument with the cook over authenticity. A story for another time...\n\nAs far as Hungarian meals go there really is no question that this is the best you will find in Cleveland. Portions are huge and easy to share or take home for tomorrow's leftovers!! I'm skipping right to the main dish. Sure the Potato Pancakes, Goulash Soup and the Cucumber salad are good, but you know you are going there-for one thing and one thing only. The main attraction. The Wiener Schnitzel is on the House Specialties list for a reason. It is battered and fried to perfection and the speatzels don't come in some wimpy portion size. Comes w\/the perfect amount!! The Chicken Paprikash...tho isn't my grandma's...is pretty darn close and the dumplings are a must. My 3rd pick would be the Hungarian Goulash. Really you can't go wrong here!! WAIT! Did you save room for desert?? I think over time I have had almost everything on the dessert menu. Can't seem to remember a miss yet...\n\nA family run establishment since the 1960's will soon win you over. Oh! Don't forget to say hello to the owner...who is usually seated in the back.
