We will never go to this place again.  Horrible, slow, rude service.  We were in there just under an hour.  That is ridiculous for an airport restaurant.  The food was barely okay.  What they called peameal bacon, was just thin ham.  There was no peameal on the edges.  Neither my husband nor I finished our meals.  My husband thought the hollandaise sauce tasted funny.  An hour later he hearly threw up.  \nAwful, awful, awful.  Never again. Stay away.
