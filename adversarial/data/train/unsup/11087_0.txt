I've been religiously going to Nailsense for the past year and absolutely love this place! This place offers nail and waxing services, facials, spa parties, tinting's, and massages. \n\nNailsense is calm, modern, extremely clean, shiny, and has a super- friendly staff that are excellent at what they do and make you feel amazing. Tien, the owner of this place truly cares about his customers and is completely professional.\n\nBrazilian wax: ($30)-\nThis is the best place to get a Brazilian wax! I've received my brazilians from both aestheticians at Nailsense (Thuy & Kim) and they both do a quick and extremely thorough job without having you go into very awkward positions. They are gentle and help you get through the entire procedure while offering breaks if you need them. Both aestheticians wear gloves and never double-dip into the wax to ensure cleanliness. I have absolutely no pain tolerance and getting brazilians from here is not that scary since both Kim and Thuy are amazing at what they do and really know how to ease most of the discomfort by using their techniques.  \n\nManicure: ($15)-\nGetting a manicure here is so relaxing. You're placed in front of a huge flat screen TV playing cute movies while your nails are being done. The manicurist opens a new and clean package in front of you that contain the utensils that are used on your nails. Each nail is done with extreme care and precision, the hand massage will make you melt, and the hot scented towel used to wrap your hands feel amazing and help your hands absorb the moisturizer better to make them look soft and supple. I love their nail drying station and the overall results- so pretty!\n\nOverall, Nailsense is a great place to get pampered by a caring and friendly staff for a reasonable price. Highly recommended!
