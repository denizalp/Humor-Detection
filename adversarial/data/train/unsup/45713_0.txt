If you're really craving Chinese or Sushi and don't have time to visit another place, then sure, come here. The food is just okay- it won't blow you away and everything I've ever tried here and is just missing something. Their chicken lo mein is meh- even with taking it home to doctor it up, it still just didn't impress me. Their sweet potato tempura sushi is ok, but it sure isn't memorable. There are a few things to like about this place: 1) it's affordable, 2) it's convenient for college students to get to, 3) there's always outside seating available. Overall though, if you are looking for delicious Sushi or Chinese, I would recommend not coming here.
