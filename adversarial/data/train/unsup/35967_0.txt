You need to know all of your possible deductions.  YOU have to tell H&R Block the deductions you're eligible for.  They will not suggest or explore any possible deductions you're eligible for.  They forgot to do my education deduction and said it was my fault because I didn't ask them to include it.  What good is that? They should have thought of the education deduction.  I do NOT recommend their services. i now have to do a 1040X to correct their mistake.
