A big group of us decided to make another stop for a cold creamy treat. We weren't even finished with our cup of gelato but the line was long enough for us to finish our gelato before we got to the front of the line. A friend pre-warned me about this place as he is also lactose intolerant and he knows I can get very pissy if I spend half of my day dealing with the painful effects of lactose over subpar dairy items. I figured, I already had gelato today so, I might as well have ice cream too. They do offer soy ice cream but what's the fun in that?\n\nWe tried the banana walnut fudge ice cream on top of a brownie, chocolate ice cream sandwich, pistachio ice cream, and green tea ice cream.\n\nBanana Walnut Fudge Ice Cream:\nThis is one of the best banana-based ice creams I've had. Great banana flavor with perfect amounts of nuts and fudge. 5\/5\n\nBrownie:\nThis was hard. I almost broke my spoon. The taste was average. 2\/5\n\nGreen Tea Ice Cream, Chocolate Ice Cream:\nThese were very generic. Nothing to write home about. Tasted like something you could just buy from the store. 3\/5\n\nChocolate Chip Cookie:\nThey reheat the cookies so, they're nice and warm and the chocolate chips melt. Ooey gooey goodness! 4\/5\n\nPistachio Ice Cream:\nI absolutely did not like their version. I had 2 whole pistachios in my cup and the flavor was definitely lacking. 1\/5\n\nThey have a few tables and chairs if you wish to eat your ice cream inside the store instead of eating and walking. I don't recommend eating an ice cream sandwich while walking. We met the owner and he was nice. We stood outside while eating our frozen treats and he went outside to thank us for the business.
