So I've always passed by this restaurant on my way to the gym and I've wanted to try it. I like my high end restaurants, this is no secret...and last night I've finally got to go! Yay!\n\nGood : My side salad and the salmon was really well cooked. Decor is nice, the plating was excellent. \n\nBad : I'll start off with a really awkward seating arrangement. I had to squeeze through a tight space of two other tables to get to my seat by the wall. Fine, I can put up with that. Bread took 20 minutes to arrive. Okay, let me just carb up now because if it takes that long to get bread, I can't imagine how long the appetizers will take. When my sardines appetizer arrived, it came with a weird jelly\/fish paste thing on the bottom that looked like smoke salmon. I took a big scoop of that deceitful smoke salmon jelly looking thing (in my defense, I thought it was smoked salmon) and it was probably one of the worst decisions of my life (besides art school). I've ordered the Churrasco style cornish hen as my main course...and quite frankly, it was really dried. Maybe I came in with really high expectations, but I've had better chicken at Romado's for half that price. \n\nBottom line : Water will cost you $5 and it won't come in a Fiji bottle either. Not exactly a good experience, not quite the best Portugese food, not likely returning either.
