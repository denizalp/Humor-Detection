I love to eat dim sum so we decided to try Ping Pang Pong inside the Gold Coast Hotel & Casino. Everything we ate was delicious! My sister and brother in law who drove from Flagstaff, really enjoyed the steamed and baked char sui bau. Ladies come around with their carts full of \"small plates\". When asking what the items were, I personally had difficulty understanding what they were saying. Just pointing at the dish seemed to work. Egg tarts and sesame seed covered \"donuts\" were the perfect end to this great meal.
