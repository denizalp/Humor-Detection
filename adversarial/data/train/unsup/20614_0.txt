It may have been a sign that I'd overstayed my welcome, but IMO there is no acceptable reason to EVER play Feist's \"Let It Die\" more than once through - even once is pushing it (you're looking at a staunch foe of Feist here - I know some people would insist that I renounce my 416 citizenship after admitting that fact, but I'm not ashamed). No word of a lie, it was played for four hours straight at Red Rocket. No other music (or even album) was played. I wanted to shout \"LET IT DIE, for real!\" a few times but instead I just pushed my earbuds farther into my ear canal. I don't know how the baristas didn't lose their minds (or notice the repetition). \n\nAs others have said, there's an influx of \"yummy mummy\" types (ugh, that term is in my head no thanks to Erica Ehm) and babies here but soon they'll have migrated to the new \"mom and tots\" coffee shop that's opening across the street, so not to worry. As always, headphones are a godsend. \n\nThey have cool beverage names like \"Moon Landing\", \"Dirt And Worms\", \"Hot Blond\" and \"The Green Bee\". \n\nI ordered  a \"not so small\" (its actual name) chai latte and the barista was quick to ask me about my milk and sweetener preferences. This is a customer-oriented and sensitivity-conscious group of people who cater to that peripheral segment of people who prefer soy, stevia and honey to traditional sweeteners and creams. My chai latte was expertly sweetened and topped off with a smidge of butterscotch (yum). I also had the house-recommended iced tea - a combination of black and green tea, sweetened with honey - but you can choose from any of a selection of ten looseleaf teas for your brew. There's also a kickass lemonade that can be heightened with flavour shots like watermelon, lime and mint.\n\nSolid, reliable wi-fi, ample electrical outlets and decent food options (I heard a few people order a roast beef sandwich, various bagels and I also spotted a hard boiled egg baked into a piece of cornbread). All in all, a relaxing atmosphere for getting work done.
