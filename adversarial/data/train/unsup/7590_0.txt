It is difficult to not compare the Tempe location to this new San Tan location, but one must keep in mind that Gilbert has a much more conservative population of diners ( uber conservative would be more accurate).  I think the smaller venue will ensure success for many years to come.  The food is great and the selection of brews and wines is considerable.  Forgive the Grand Opening  issues that always arise and enjoy a liberal dining experience.
