Nothing against this specific furniture store but I just hate when people maul you as you walk in the door.  I completely disagree with the fact that someone gets a commission off of me because they happened to be at the front door when I walked in.  How about a list of questions?  Favorite movie, song, food?  Go.  Sorry, don't like you.  Next.  \n\nAnyway, we have a set of living room furniture (couch, loveseat, end tables, coffee table) from Ashley that we have loved for the past 4 years.  It's worked well, was a nice price, and it's still comfortable.  However, my wife wanted to upgrade to leather so we stopped on it.  We were hounded by some guy named Herb or Bill or Clyde or something.  We left.  \n\nWe decided to come back the next week and were lucky enough to get a sweet old lady, let's call her Flo, who was lucky enough to be at the front door when we walked in.  We bought a leather sectional and it was fairly cheap.  I didn't feel bad that Flo got the commission because she was nice.
