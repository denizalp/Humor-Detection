OK so its an Old Country Buffet.  That pretty much sums it up.  Never been to OCB?  How about Golden Corral? \n\nThe food comes from a food service and is heated back up... how else could they serve so much for so little?  You can get a pretty good bang for your buck here.  TIP - sign up for their emails, and you'll get some BOGO coupons.\n\nWe go here a few times a year when we feel like being fat and eating nasty food, its a guilty pleasure.  Really what we go for is the entertainment.  Trust me - you will be the skinniest person in sight.  There's always something fun to keep you entertained, last time there was a woman (mother?) who kept putting her hands up her (7ish year old?) daughter's shirt, and down her skirt.  Something was probably up.  The time before that, the hippo family (really just the mom and dad) kept burping as loud as they could throughout the meal.  It must have been a contest.\n\nOK, food:  They usually have a guy at the grill cooking steaks.  Not bad steak for a buffet.  Pot roast is usually a safe bet, as is baked chicken.  They have all the usual canned, salty veggies as well as a lackluster taco bar, average salad bar, and enough desserts to keep the kids screaming.  Unfortunately they lack what every good buffet should have - good, fresh rolls\/biscuits.  Don't bother.  \n\nService: Pretty good, they come by pretty often to clear dirty plates and offer drink refills.  Overall the servers are probably a lot happier than they should be for working here, but just as well that way.\n\nShould you eat here?  Of course!  Go on a night you feel like gorging\/heading for a heart attack.  After a glance around the dining room you'll feel a lot better about your figure!
