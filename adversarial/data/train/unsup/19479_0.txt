Yes, I'm a fan of Milk Bar!\nI didn't know too much about the desserts here when Milk Bar creator Christina Tosi opened up the first West coast location in the Cosmo.  Then we got to meet her at a Yelp event prior to opening and try the birthday cake and truffles that are signature items as well as a few of the cookies. That's the first time I tried the birthday cake and from then, I've been a fan.  Yes, the cake is on the pricey side, but it's great for a special occasion when you want to treat yourself.  My friends and I ordered one for our July birthdays and shared it with a group of other pals because sharing is caring. The item that I've had multiple times is the cereal milk soft serve.  My favorite flavor is the Fruity Cereal Milk soft serve because it really does taste like the milk at the bottom of a bowl of Fruity Pebbles.  Apparently, this flavor is only available at the Vegas and Toronto locations so lucky us!  The soft serve melts very quickly so have napkins ready. The cake truffles are tasty little nuggets of goodness and I've bought them as gifts for friends.  I'm glad that we have this location here in town and look forward to another birthday occasion (mine or someone else's) for more cake.\n\nYelp Review #800
