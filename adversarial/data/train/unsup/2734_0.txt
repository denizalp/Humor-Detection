Burnt my hair!!\n\nI don't know how to keep this review short, but I will try. I made an appointment for a haircut (a trim) and to tone my hair. \n\nThe stylist \"Sandra\" was very nice and tried her best, but her best is less than mediocre. She was supposed to just trim my hair but instead she chopped it. It was the worst haircut ever. The back is uneven. \n\nAs far as the toning, She was told to tone my hair. NOT BURN IT. She decided that 35\/40 developer and bleach (for an hour) was the better alternative. I've been bleaching my hair for a while, I didn't think it would be THAT bad. \n\nShe should have checked on my hair every few minutes to make sure it would not burn. But instead, she took n another client simultaneously, semi-ignored me, and let my hair burn. \n\nI should have  known better than to come here. I left semi annoyed but the following days were devastating. My hair didn't stop falling out. \n\nI can go on but I said enough. Just don't go there.
