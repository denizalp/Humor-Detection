Had Smashburger a few weeks ago with my coworker.  It was my first time having anything from there.  Not one of the best burgers I've had and certainly not in my top 5, but it was good.  So were the Smashfries. The cashier, Nancy was nice. Although the restaurant is small and was pretty busy considering it was noon, our food came out rather quickly.
