I finally gave this place a try and I absolutely love everything that I ordered.  The Druken noodles is delicious! I've ordered it at yuphas, Thai basil, and Swadee Thai and this place by far is the best.  I also ordered the colorful vegetables with shrimp- Thai hot which was tasty but I wish it was spicier. Their cream cheese crab was good as well.  I will definitely be coming back to try the other dishes!
