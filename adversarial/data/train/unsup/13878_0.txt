I love the Thirsty Beaver for everything that it is! It is a neighborhood spot with a come-as-you-are atmosphere and some damn good drink prices. Don't expect craft beer or $15 cocktails-- this is not the place for that. Charlotte is full of overpriced bars and this is a breath of fresh air. Bartenders are nice, drinks are good, and decor is on point. It is quirky and they have a pool table in the back. They have a patio out front too for drinking and smoking. Definitely check this place out!!
