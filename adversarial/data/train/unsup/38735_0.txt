If you have one of those $10 for $20 coupon from Team Buy for Wagjag, you cannot use it for their specials and you don't get drink with set meal.  \n\nWe ordered 3 set meals, and we showed our coupon at ordering time, the waiter did not mention any restriction about the coupon. When come to paying our bill, we were told to pay extra $9 for the drinks because when  using coupon drinks are excluded.  They wanted us to pay $9 extra or use the coupon next time.  I said no way I am paying for you mistake.   We walked out without paying a tip.
