Some mediocre worker named Ron (black guy with RJ on his shirt) had the audacity to say \"these motherfuckers don't know how to tip\" when we walked away after he served us. Number one tipping is something you earn for giving good service. Number two its never mandatory. And third, you and your sour ass attidue isn't worth a fifty cent tip. I'm sure your poor customer service is the reason why you're working at midnight serving drinks. This guy is a complete joke and so is the woman who also worked there that I informed. She can take her fake apology and shove it.
