Went back to America's Taco Shop last night for my fourth time. I used to think it is over-rated and too expensive, and after last night, I'll just say that it truly isn't very good. $20 for dinner for two is reasonable enough, but the food is absolutely the blandest, most americanized, excuse for Mexican I've ever eaten. I grew up in Phoenix, in a hispanic neighborhood, eating Mexican for almost every meal every day. This place is not the least bit Authentic... it's just a gringo excuse for mexican food.\n\nThe patio out front looks like some amateur do-it-yourself'er made a trip to Home Depot and built a budget enclosure. Seriously? you put plywood up in your parking lot... that's not really a way to make a proper patio. I can't believe the city allowed this debacle. \n\nThe kid who took our order on our last trip didn't know what was on the menu and repeatedly asked the woman there what was included in our meal. Learn the menu before you go up front and start working... this is not his fault, it's poor training and management. \n\nPlease boycot this restaurant so it can go away and the building can be used for something useful. There are a lot of great places up and down seventh street, but this piece of crap brings them all down to a lower level.
