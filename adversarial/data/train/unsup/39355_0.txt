Have been here several time and on my last visit it was as good and consistent as my first time.\n\nFirst, kudos for having fresh squeezed orange juice, not to many places take the time and this one does.\n\nSo Fiancee had the crepes and I had the crab and cheddar omelette.  We did share as the crepes where huge!   The crepes had ham, mushrooms, spinach and cheese.  Very impressed, the crepe was perfectly done and beautifully presented.  There was the right amount of balance between the eggs, spinach, mushrooms and cheese.   Did I mention the portions size was huge??  Not kidding as we took a whole one home and I have a good sized appetite. \n\nThe omelette contained crab, cheddar cheese and had ritz crackers on top.  Couldn't understand the ritz cracker thing until I started eating.  Fluffy eggs cooked perfect with a rich cheddar throughout with a good size helping of crab.  Now this is where the Ritz crackers come in- as rich as the components are, the crackers provided just the right balance and saltiness to the dish.  Who would have thought.\n\nAt this point, anything you could have done to the hash browns or pancakes that came with the omelette wouldn't have mattered, but hash browns cooked perfectly and the pancakes I was again impressed.  Light, almost buttermilk but something different and by different I meant delicious.  \n\nService prompt and polite.  Remember to come early or late on weekends as there sometimes is  a small wait\n\nOverall, a great breakfast with a great atmosphere.  Probably my favorite place in AZ so far.
