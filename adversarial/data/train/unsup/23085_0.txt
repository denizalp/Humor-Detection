I was finally able to get a reservation at Yours Truly after hearing so much about it. Unfortunately, they got rid of their snack menu, so I was dissappointed that I didn't have the chance to try their infamous duck fat bread. The space is not overtly complicated looking--I would say pretty minimalist with the bar being focal point of the room. The drinks were really good so they're a must-try.\n\nWe got the $45 tasting menu, and the courses are designed after a specific ingredient.  I chose beef, egg, chicken and berries. Do not expect big portions. I typically hate people that complain about portions at fine dining restaurants, but do expect really small portions.  You're not going to leave Yours Truly being satisfied, but you will acknowledge that it was a good tasting meal. The food was great, I just wish there had been more.\n\nThe beef was a tartar.  What I liked was that it had chunkier pieces of beef which gave the texture an extra kick, as opposed to other tartars. The egg dish was the star of the whole course. It was served in a concave dish and truly undescribeable in taste.  Truly genius. The chicken was not memorable, but the dessert, which were liquid nitrogen berries was delicious--i just wish there were more berries.\n\nOverall, it is a great spot to come and grab a great drink. Unfortunately, my bill exceeded my level of satisfaction.
