Stayed here last weekend while in town for the Steelers game and was pleased with the room and helpful staff.\nSuite was nice and spacious with 2 beds and a couch that doubled as a bed.  I like the idea of having the shower and toilet in separate rooms with them both having their own sink.  Nice size closet with ironing board and iron provided. Mini fridge and microwave were also on site.  Nice selection at the complimentary breakfast with plenty of helpings. Shopping within walking distance. Only con was the $16\/day parking which may be on par for the area? Overall very pleased and would stay here again .
