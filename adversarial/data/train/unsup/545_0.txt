I got food poisoning from here but the food was so good I'll still give it 2 stars.  It was tasty enough that I'd even consider going back again despite the painful and unpleasant 36 post-dinner hours.\n\nThe prices are super reasonable.  Even with the cost of a round trip cab ride you'll save money over eating dinner on the strip.  Also, when they say spicy they mean it.  It was perfect for me but some things were too much for my wife.  She can usually hang too.
