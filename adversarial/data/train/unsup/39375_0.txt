Came here on Sunday for an early dinner. We were immediately greeted and had the freedom to choose wherever we wanted to sit. We sat down and menus and a jar of lemon water was brought to us immediately. My partner wanted gyoza so we ordered the pork gyoza as an appetizer. Our waitress asked us if we wanted to order now or if we needed a minute, we told her we needed a minute and she went ahead and put our appetizer in the computer and told us she'd be back in a couple minutes to take our order. I decided on the Tonkatsu ramen and my partner decided on the miso. We both ordered extra noodles cause the pictures online didn't look very big, it was later found that one order of noodles is PLENTY.  Our waitress brought out our pork gyoza and it was the best gyoza I've ever had. Just perfect. Our ramen came out not long after and they were SO GOOD. Mine did not need any soy sauce or salt or anything. It was perfect. My partner added chili powder in his miso but that's because he likes spicy food and he loved his as well. Great place and will definitely be coming back!
