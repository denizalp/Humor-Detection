WELL VERY BADLY organized! The receptionist was a total mess couldn't even find the patients folder and waited well over 2 hours had an appointment at 10:30 AM IT IS NOW 1:21 and still no assistance. It wasn't mentioned if it was a first come first serve because another person also had a 10:30 AM appointment like what in the hell is this ORGANIZATION worst communion till date for this so called mental health assistance we'll plan to get more headaches never coming back.
