Ate here last on December 23rd, 2012.  I visit this location a few times in a year, and was completely surprised that they served delicious lobster (chick size) thermidor that evening.  That was my highlight for the evening!  Pretty much devoured 3000 calories worth of lobsters that evening.\n\nI go back to Mandarin at this location for their wide selection of both Asian (friend noodles and rice; sushi; mussels with black bean sauce, egg rolls, spring rolls, etc)  and Western savoury food (eg. roast beef, crab legs, salads,  fried chicken wings, chilled shrimps, deviled eggs, etc). Their dessert selection is pretty wide too - creme caramel, tapioca pudding, bread pudding, ice-cream, brownies, cookies, choclate dipped strawberry, seasonal fresh fruits, cakes, tarts, fried sugar balls, honey cruellers, etc.  Soft drinks have unlimited re-fills.  Mandarin has consistent attentive and friendly service. \n\nHot towel service and fortune cookies are provided to all guests at the end of the meal.
