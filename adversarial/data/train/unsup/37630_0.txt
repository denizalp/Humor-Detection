We had a rain check on a sale item and tried to use it yesterday and were told, \"We don't honor those kind anymore.\"  What?  What do you mean?  This particular Harris Teeter must have the worst management team ever. There are very good Harris Teeters in Charlotte, but this is not one of them. Ever since they opened they have been a disappointment. They are rude, unhelpful, and I can tell you this, unlike Publix, shopping is definitely NOT a pleasure here. I think I'll drive a little further and spend my money somewhere else.
