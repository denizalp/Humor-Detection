I have to agree with most of the reviews. It's average at best and for a few reasons. \n\nWe came on Friday night after trying to decide where to go. We had received a coupon (ha!) in the mail and thought really this is the only way to justify overpriced Mexican. \n\nThe bar was really bright and they had a cover band  singing  80's\/90's rock which was very odd. We opted not for the bar and sat in dining room. It's actually really pretty inside with palm trees, string lights,  fountains, and Spanish tile. \n\nThe salsa was good. The guac is 14.95 which is a joke. We didn't receive it after ordering so we canceled it and saved ourselves 15bucks. The food was good enough and decent portions. Still hard to justify 20 bucks on menu items like quesadillas and burritos. \n\nGlad I gave it a try since I see it so often, it's close to home and I love Mexican. Prob would go back to try happy hour (maybe) but def not for regular priced entrees. With so many other great places in the area, it feels semi insulting to offer average food at such a high price point in an inauthentic atmosphere. Esp when there's Roberto's around the corner ;)
