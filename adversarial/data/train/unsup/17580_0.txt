I had seen the building from I-15 and wanted to stop in.  They have free tours at 10:30 and 1:30 to learn more about this amazing upgrade to vehicles.  \n\nThe new location is great!  You first walk into their 'store' area with plenty of Shelby branded clothing and items.  You can look or drool, in my case, at plenty of vehicles parked in their showroom.  Cobras, mustangs and a few other odd vehicles Carroll Shelby did upgrades to.  Being from the Motor City, Detroit area, I knew I was going to enjoy it.\n\nThe free tour is about 45 minutes long as he walks you through their showroom explaining details about certain vehicles and Carroll Shelby himself.  It's very informative and interesting to those who love some power under the hood.  \n\nA great interesting fact is that the original Shelby Cobra that Mr. Shelby drove built and drove around himself is the very first car you'll walk by inside.  The last time it was appraised....  worth $26 million.   I don't know about the rest of you, but that was probably the most expensive vehicle I've stood by.  \n\nIt's a great place to stop by and tour for any car enthusiast!
