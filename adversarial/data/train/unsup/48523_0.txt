We bought a groupon as we thought it would be a nice place to try. The mini meatballs were truly mini, ...and cold. The  broccoli and fries were cold too. The  Filet was also cold.  However, The New York steak was good and so were the 4 pieces of asparagus. (The waitress told me \"sorry we ran out and that is all we had left\"). When I brought it up to the manager- we had her physically touch the broccoli and fries. She offered to reheat it. Microwave I am sure. Not one person apologized for the terrible food and the  service was horrible.  When I explained they needed to redeem the groupon or else we could use it again, the waitress grabbed my phone and pushed redeem and threw my phone back on the table.  It took an hour to get our cold food and they never once refilled our drinks. I now know why at 6 pm there was only one other table with patrons in the whole place. I will never recommend this place to anyone.
