I was panicked going to get my first cavities filled after hearing horror stories. Pain, hours long, etc. Dr. Kim and his assistant were amazing!!! Not only was I out in 31 mins including wait time (I was 5 mins late) but I didn't feel a thing. He's like the best dentist ever. A month prior for my cleaning, the hygienist was also able to get 6 years worth of stains off in 30 minutes. They're awesome. Best staff ever!!!!
