This is probably the worst Ono location i ever been to. \n\nStaff - they were having an argument that night i went. One of the girls stormed out crying\n\nFood - extremely bland chicken and pork\n\nEnvironment - new modern updated. (Reason for 2 stars)\n\nI wish Ono would better train their staff. Very unprofessional, uncaring and had a lacking knowledge of their menu. Cashier couldn't do substitutions and only until i almost walked out was she able to(I'm on no gluten right now). \n\nI love Ono Hawaiian BBQ and have been a great fan since 2005. However this location sadly put the name to shame. \n\nThe frustrating part is that the location had about 10 or 12 staff members that night yet food took forever to come out. \n\nMaybe its because they are new, maybe its because the owners here just don't care for quality and just the money. There was 3 asians that night that seem to be the owners\/managers yet they ignored and just laughed that a few employees were arguing. Embarrassing. Actually i lm giving it 1 star now.
