Ate here for the first time this weekend despite wanting to check it out from the moment it opened. Maybe I had overly inflated expectations. The food was alright and the typical Anglified Mexican you'll find in any restaurant. Drinks were reasonably priced and the blood orange margarita was terrific. Overall, this is a good place to throw back some drinks and have some light food to sop up the liquor but not anyplace I'd go back to for dinner. \n\nThat said, the bartender could afford to lose the attitude. I ordered my first marg on the rocks and she made a point to tell me with a bit of a sneer that ALL the margaritas are served on the rocks. Presumably, blenders are just too bourgeois. Then, when my friend joined us, he ordered a blood-orange marg and a passion fruit one. When the same bartender set them down, he asked which was which. She sneered again and said, \"The orange one is the blood orange one. D'uh.\" My friend apologized for HIS COLOR BLINDNESS. No apology was forthcoming from the bartender, who simply went back to her friends.\n\nMaybe the service would've been better if we had remembered our mustache wax.
