Best tiramisu ever!!! Had to start by saying that since it had me thinking about their tiramisu for the whole week. \n\nI came here once for dinner as a friend had read good reviews of this restaurant. Food was delicious!!! Service was great!!! It's situated in a little house and so not that very many tables. Definitely recommend making reservations. Food came out in huge portions! We were a group of girls where some of the girls were small eaters so they mentioned they wanted to share their main pasta entree. When the food came, they had already split the pasta dishes for the girls but they looked like they're regular sized portions that you would get at any other restaurant. I ordered their mussels, prosciutto wrapped melon and their daily special which was squid ink seafood pasta which was all delicious!! I didn't think I would have an appetite for dessert but I still ordered the tiramisu since its made fresh daily. Huge portion and it was so good!!! \n\nWould I come back again? Definitely!!!
