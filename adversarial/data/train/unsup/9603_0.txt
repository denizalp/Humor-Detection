We were greeted and served by Diana, who was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  We had the Cajun wings and garlic bread, wings were baked, crunchy and spicy, I love them.  Garlic bread was light fluffy and crunchy served with a fresh marinara sauce.  Blue moon was served with orange slice which not many places do.\nOrdered the meat lovers pizza, medium size on regular crust, similar to garlic bread, crunchy yet light and fluffy.  Fresh toppings make the difference, they use fresh in-house sausage which is yummy.\nLively music and fairly busy place, can't wait to come back.
