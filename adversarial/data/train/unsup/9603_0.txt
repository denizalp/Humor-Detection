Came here with a group of six people and they were really good on keeping our reservations.  Once everyone was there, we were seated right away! They didn't make us wait or anything.\n\nI'm not a great fan of Mexican food but my boyfriend is.  So since it was his graduation weekend, of course, I took him to what he likes best!\n\nWe started off with the blue corn pancake with the duck.  I thought this dish was delicious!  I could go for a little less sauce on the duck but other than that, it was really good!\n\nWe also got the tuna and salmon tartare.  Also very good!  I liked it a lot because it was a bit spicy.\n\nFor the entree, my boyfriend and I shared the veal with the wild rice tamale.  I don't like tamales, but I must say this was pretty good.  My boyfriend LOVED the tamale!  The veal was cooked perfectly! Omg, it was sooo good that we finished every last bite!  We also got a side of the double baked potato!  Also a great side!  The best side though was the roasted corn!  It was absolutely delicious!!!  \n\nThe chicken quesadilla was ok.  This was the only one I was a bit disappointed in.\n\nOther than that, everything here was good.  Nothing that truely wowed me, except maybe their roasted corn. I know! Weird, but omg, so good!
