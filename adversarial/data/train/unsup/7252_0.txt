I finally got to go here!!!! Came around 12:30am on a Friday. It was filled with people and there was only one server to be found. It took 30 min and me asking 3 times where my drink was.. I went to the bar and was helped within 10 minutes. It's unfortunate this place doesn't have food cause I was starrrrrving.\n\nThe prices for the drinks are very reasonable. There's a menu of about 20 drinks and they're all strong!!!! I drank one \"pain killer\" and was pretty tipsy. The staff here are also about classiness.. There was a guy super belligerent, stumbling and touching people so security acted very quickly to escort him out. Everyone seemed pretty friendly. A lot of weird vibes but I will be back soon to try the rest of the crazy, beautifully decorated, and intense drinks.
