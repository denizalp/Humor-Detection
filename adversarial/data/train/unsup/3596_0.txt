I felt like I was in an episode of Portlandia.  We headed here on a Friday night for coffee\/drinks after dinner at Panne Bianco.  I headed to the bar, hoping for a fancy drink.  When I asked for a menu, I was told that they did mixology style drinks.  I still waited for something else...but that was all I was going to be told.  After about 10 more minutes of discussion and questions regarding whether or not I would drink raw eggs (I don't even usually cook eggs, let alone drink a raw one, but sure, I'll try something new...), the mixologist had an idea of what she could make for me.  Overall, the drink was fine.  I wouldn't want to order another and was glad when it was finished so I could stop drinking it.  It kind of tasted like a Christmas tree & pine sol.  And had raw egg yolk in it.  I'd skip the bar portion here - or just get wine\/beer.  \n\nOn another note, the coffee & cookies were great!
