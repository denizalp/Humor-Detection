I have the best French Toast I've tasted in a long time.  Nice family style restaurant with homemade cakes and pies behind a glass case.  I went for the first time with colleges and got the breakfast sampler.  It comes with eggs, sausage, bacon, and French toast. I also go a side of home fries... the kind that are sliced potatoes and saut√©ed onions! YUM!!  Our waiter was soooo friendly!! I can wait to go back.  Oh ya... they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner options all day!! Enjoy!!
