Went with my brother on his birthday for lunch -- and he loved it. He is gluten-free and they made this dietary restriction as easy as possible for him. Our waiter and assistants were very attentive. I ordered the duck ravioli and my brother ordered the portabella turkey burger. The mushroom was ground into the burger and my brother said it was very tasty and fresh. They gave him a side of vegetables since the fries are fried in a fryer with other breaded products (cross contamination). He said the veggies were delicious. I liked my ravioli, the filling of duck was yummy, but the pasta edges of the ravioli seemed a bit hard or undercooked. I also love the bread they serve. I got the pretzel roll and the brioche. My only complaint is they were cold (I think made earlier (or the day before) and then placed in the fridge). I think room temperature or warm would have been much better. And I think at dinner or later lunch, I wouldn't have noticed the coldness. I gave this place a four for my brother's experience on his birthday, and my past visits for dinner.
