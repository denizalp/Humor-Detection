This Pizza Hut is great. For chain pizza this location seems to make it like was back in the day. When I order pan pizza it is thick and cooked all the way through. They always have deals as most pizza places do. When they have the deals for any pizza, any size, any crust, I wish they would honor that and not charge extra for stuffed crust. Any crust means ANY CRUST. Okay... I got that out. \n\nThe wings are bomb-diggity! if you don't know about Wing Wednesday then you should check it out. Wings are 50 cents each. I get an order of 8 buffalo burnin' hot (boneless) for $4 and it comes with a side of dressing. There is a good selection of flavors.\n\nSometimes I order for delivery but usually just pick it up since it is close to my home and quicker. I always order online and never have any problems.
