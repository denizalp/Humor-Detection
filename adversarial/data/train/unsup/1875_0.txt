This business has been around for ages. I took them all the time when I was a student years ago and I don't remember ever having an issue - just follow the rules and know the policy. Buy the ticket, keep the ticket, show the ticket. Be on time. Be polite if you have an issue or question. Don't bring two years of laundry with you and complain about the lack of room. I just took them again a few months ago to head down to UIUC for recruiting. It was great! Obviously prices were higher than when I was a student, but that's to be expected given gas prices and inflation. Also, it was a nifty van, not a bus. The driver was not super friendly, but big deal! He has to drive for hours and keep focused; see how friendly you'll be if you are driving that much and dealing with kids who can be rude. I was comfortable, had plenty of room, was able to charge my phone, and the bus was on time and I didn't have to drive the 2-1\/2 hours by myself. The wifi is spotty, but having wifi on a bus is pretty sweet. People; if you don't like it, don't use it. Put up the cash and open your own bus line.
