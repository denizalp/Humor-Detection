The speedway is fun.  Parking was pretty easy to get in and out of and the racing I got to see last year was a lot of fun.  We sat in some luxury boxes and were served free food and drinks (including beer if that's what you wanted).  I ate until I was full and had a great view of the action.  I do not have any comment on prices of food and beverage because mine was all free since I got some free VIP tickets through my work.
