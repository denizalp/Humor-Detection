I came here to meet up with a friend who wanted to celebrate with some margaritas. Or margarita, to be exact. \n\nAnd because I was semi-hungry, I ordered a shredded meat quesadilla. This stuff was actually really good, and the only thing that I can complain about was that it had TOO much shredded meat inside? It was more like Meat and no cheese quesadilla. But, I shouldn't complain, right? \n\nThe salsa was legit. Really good flavors. Strawberry margarita was too sweet, but the mango margarita was VERY good. \n\nThe place had NO ONE except us two girls, but it could have been because it was 1.5 hours before closing time. I also didn't think it was a great sight to see a kid and mom (perhaps related to the owners or workers) running around in the entrance area and playing on the floor. Let's keep it classy, people!
