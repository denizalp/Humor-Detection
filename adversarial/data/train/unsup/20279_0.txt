So turned off by the rude hostess up front. \nYes girl with the dreads and 3 inch holes in your ears, this review is for you!\n\nCame around lunch time and I must say it isn't too crazy busy.\nWalked in with my coworker and asked for a seat of 5 (lunch time with the office).\nWas completely ignored.\nAnother group came in seconds right after us, asked for a seat of 5, was immediately seated.\nTwo of my other coworkers came in, asked again for a party of 5.. Again to remind you, there were 4 of us at the time because we were waiting on the doctor to arrive! \nWe were immediately rejected and told that she cannot seat incomplete parties.\nWELL DAMN, maybe if you would've said something initially, upon arriving, and actually telling us nicely.. I would've known that information! Word of advice miss, please let \"incomplete parties\" know that such rule before rudely ignoring them and seating the party behind them right away ...\n\nWooooosah..\nNow let's talk food..\nNew thing tried was the Fried Deviled Eggs - fried egg with a creamy yolk center, topped with hot sauce and bacon pieces! Simple yet yummy!\nThen got my usual Shrimp & Grits - always a hit!\n\nService from Gary was great, he has great personality and very tentative!
