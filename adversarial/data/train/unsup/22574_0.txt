I remember being a young and modest college student back in the Midwest, I had a friend that worked at Jimmy John's and would give me free sandwiches. One sandwich isn't enough to fill me up so, I'd pay for another one.\n\nI normally get Bootlegger (turkey and roast beef) and Hunter's Club (roast beef). When I'm trying to eat less bread, I'd get these to as an Un-Wich (instead of getting bread, your sandwich is wrapped in lettuce). I usually hate mayo but for some reason, I don't mind it on JJ sandwich.\n\nI'd still have a JJ sandwich once a year just to reminisce on the good ol' days. But the sad part about this location is that they're not big on customer service at all. They're pretty rude and they mess up your order. The other locations in Vegas has better service compared to this place.
