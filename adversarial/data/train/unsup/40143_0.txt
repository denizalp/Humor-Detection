Hubs-  Was walking and shopping Mill Ave. with the girls on a Sunday afternoon and decided to try this place out.  Kayla A. was our server and was very polite and friendly.  Around 2:00pm the place was not crowded and family friendly.  Ordered an assortment of tacos and all were delicious.  Outside of typical party hours we'd definitely bring kids back.  We will definitely be back to check out the evening hours kidless.
