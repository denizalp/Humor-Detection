I've eaten here many times and had the Pizza, which I rate 4 Stars.  However, this most recent visit I decided to try the Thunderbird Sandwich $8.35 (Baked Chicken Breast, Ham, Pepperoni, Cheese) w\/Lettuce, Tomato, Fries on the side for an extra $1.00.\n\nAfter a short wait, they brought out the food.  The Sandwich was piping hot....and looked so good!  I had to let it cool off for a minute because I didn't want to burn the hell out of my tongue.  It cooled off and I took a bite....WOW!  The combination of Baked Chicken, Ham, and Pepperoni was amazing!  The sharp flavor of the Pepporoni complimented the slightly salted Ham and perfectly baked Chicken Breast.  The Cheese and the Bread put it over the top!\n\nThe Fries were pre-fab crinkle Fries and were nothing special....I'll pass on them next time.\n\nOverall, I was impressed by their Sandwich.  I already love their Pizza.  I would give them 4.5 Stars if I could.\n\nWill I return?  There are a bunch of other Sandwiches I want to try....hell yeah!
