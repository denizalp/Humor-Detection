Christopher Moving is the best in Las Vegas!! We hired Christopher Moving and three of their men showed up on time, even a few minutes early! They came up to our apartment, assessed what we had and got started. They put our small boxes in large wardrobe boxes to make it easier and quicker. We couldn't believe how quickly they worked, the whole move was done in a blink of an eye practically! They provided all the resources to move our TV and large couch over the second floor balcony (the two things we were most nervous about), but they made it look easy! The three men were very friendly and worked extremely hard, even in 110+ degree weather. The only company I will recommend!
