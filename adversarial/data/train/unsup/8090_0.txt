I'm the kind of girl who likes it fast and cheap.  Yes.  That's right.\n  Salad King delivers on both ends.  It's clean, bright, and busy.  The food is spot on for what you would expect.  My doors are hardly blown off, yet, my expectations are always met.  This is never a bad thing.  \n  Without adding to the echo of multiple reviews on this place, I'll simply state that it's a fun place, worth your while if you are in the hood.  The golden curry is s favorite, alongside the chicken satay and various noodle dishes.  Go.  Eat.  Enjoy.
