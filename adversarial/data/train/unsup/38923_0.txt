Excellent little restaurant inside the Luxor Hotel.  We needed something quick to eat before we headed out for the evening but were a little too dressed up for the quick food stops or buffet line at the hotel.  We popped into this place after peaking at the menu outside and decided to grab a drink and a few hefty appetizers at the bar so we wouldn't be delayed.  This restaurant is right next to the casino with an open seating bar area as well as a private room for large parties in the back and a regular seating styled restaurant hidden behind the bar.  It was a nice little stop.  We ordered the charcuterie board which had a nice selection of artisan cheeses and meats, the wedge salad with big sweet flavored slices of bacon on top and the mushroom soup.  Everything was delicious but the mushroom soup was the star of the show.  We enjoyed a nice glass of wine and were not rushed at all.
