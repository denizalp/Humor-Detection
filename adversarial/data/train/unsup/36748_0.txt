Meh.  Came here for a sushi lunch, and it wasn't bad. But that's really about all I can say. Let's be honest, folks:  pretty much any sushi joint in the Valley is going to offer the same things, nigiri-wise. You've got your tuna, salmon, bay scallops (the little eraserhead ones), orange\/red clam, octopus, squid, and eel. There's really nothing more adventurous than any of that. Then you have your makki-menu, in which they have the traditional offerings and then a huge page of locally-named rolls with one or two ingredients switched up for fun.\n\nHad an order of hamachi sashimi, nigiri shiromaguro, escolar, and saba. The pieces were good, and certainly on par with sushi that I've had elsewhere in the area. We ordered two hand rolls, and the salmon-skill hand roll was a little too much on the crunchy side. Ordered two other rolls and they were quite good. But honestly, there wasn't anything that rocked my socks- this is pretty much just your typical Japanese joint with tried-and-true stuff that white people can feel adventurous about eating.\n\n... which is why I'll never be back. If you're the type of person who likes to tell your friends about how much you LOVE sushi, but only order from the all-you-can-eat or dollar-sushi menu, then you'd love this place. It's your type of place. But if you're someone who is fiending for that ethereal uni, or some ikura which just pops in your mouth, or ama-ebi with the tempura-fried head, then you're going to be disappointed- just like I was. Ah well, the search continues...
