Worst customer service ever. I am usually one of those people who never writes a bad review. In my 13 years in this country, this was the most racist and mean guy ( Mitch) we ever met. We bought expensive patio furniture from this store last next in November. The order was placed and it took more than 6 weeks to arrive but with missing throw pillows. It was no big deal and it took another 3 weeks to get them. To our dismay, the pillows were ginormous and then took another  3weeks to get the proper size. This was the first part of experience.\n\nIn addition, we ordered Brown Jordan Kantan chairs with brass finish. When we were looking for chairs, no one mentioned once that these chairs will rust within 2 days. They required maintenance every alternate day with Brasso chemical. It is a beautiful piece of furniture, no doubt. But obviously, we didn't expect that within a week it looks like 5-7 years old piece of junk.  We called them yesterday and they said we can come to their store and we can work something out. We went to the store today and Mitch (within 5 mins) started being abusive to my husband in front of my 4 year old son. He literally wanted us to buy more furniture prior to taking care of the Kantan chairs.  We told him we want to to exchange the chairs first and will buy more furniture for our new home eventually. He started shouting as us that how dare we ask him for an exchange.  Thank god, didn't ask for a refund.\n\nMy 4 year son stared sobbing uncontrollably.  If I would have known, we would get this service would have kept my son home. So to summarize, if you wish to buy patio furniture from a rude, racist, mean person, please go to his store.  \n\nHema G
