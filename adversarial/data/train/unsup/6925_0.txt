Tasty Asian cuisine, in the middle of no where? Yes!\n\nI frequent the tiny village of Youngtown, and to my dismay I can never find a good place for lunch. That's all changed now. T & J is a quiet, unassuming little restaurant with tons of options. I found the quiet, pentatonic music awkward, but it seemed to fade as I browsed through their menu with excitement.\n\nBefore they even hand it to you, there's pictures on the wall of every dish. So, so many options. Roast duck? Chicken prepared in every way imaginable? And just look at those prices! So I ordered some honey chicken for lunch (so much food for so cheap) and it was of decent quality. It came with a crab wonton and an egg roll.\n\nThe reason I'm bumping this place up to four stars is because it has a small bar in the back. Most places like this only serve Tsingtao and maybe some cheap wine. They had some tasty liquors, and even a small specialty drink menu. Including a saketini. Those are my weakness! Time to knock back a few in dullsville.
