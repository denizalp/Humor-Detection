If you're headed to Vegas with a large group of people and actually want enough beds to accommodate at least 8 people w\/o spending a ton of money, definitely consider the Jockey club. By no means would i consider this place luxurious, but it's extremely convenient, being that its on the strip and right next to the Bellagio!! You can even see the Bellagio water show from your window  and pretend you are staying there instead lol! \nThe room we stayed in was more like an apartment. It had a living room\/dining room\/ kitchen\/ two bed rooms, two bathrooms. 3 full beds and a sofa bed. Like i said, its not luxury, but clean and very very spacious. \nBut really, who spends alot time in their hotel room when in Vegas anyway?  Overall, its a great place right on the strip for a large group and its for a great price. Our room for a night was about $114! not bad at all!!!
