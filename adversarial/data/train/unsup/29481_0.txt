Called the pharmacy today.  Was on hold for 47 minutes , the recording kept saying there were 2 callers ahead of me. After waiting for 52 minutes the machine said there was only one caller ahead. So i kept waiting a few minutes more until my call somehow got \"disconnected\" ! When I looked at the time it was 9pm (pharmacy closing time).  RUde.  !! I have tried to call this location multiple times and I have never been able to speak to someone.  I always end up hanging up after a 20 or 30 min wait. This time was almost an hour.  I understand the have people at the counter to help as well but it's hard to believe that no one was able to pick up 2 calls in hour.
