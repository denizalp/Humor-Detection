It's a pretty cool spot. The decor definitely takes you out of the city. I can imagine this being a great spot in the winter. The interior design for the space: windows, seating, the material and the often forgotten bathrooms were on point. Really well done.\n\nI was surprised at the size of the backyard patio - let alone the second floor. \n\nI had the jerk chicken with coleslaw, rice and peas. I don't mind spicy food but I have to say I could not handle the spice level of the rice and peas. Oh my god! It was way too spicy for me. I couldn't eat it.  I wish I had known because it made the experience a little off putting. Make no mistake though the chicken was tasty it was kinda pink inside.\n\nKiller ginger beer to make your eyeballs roll. I'm really not kidding on that one. LOL.\n\nRum raisin bread pudding was delicious. Warm and served with vanilla bean gelato. I so wanted to finish this but I was so full by the end.....saddest thing is to see food unfinished because I'm full.
