It's my 3rd time going here & let me say how happy & impressed I am with the efficiency & timely service of the staff here. I love the friendliness, cleanliness, and cozy atmosphere. Definitely coming back & highly recommended! Miley did my nails & she's so amazing! Miley is so sweet & she helps me narrow down my choices in  nail colors since there's too many! She's so awesome! Thank you Miley!
