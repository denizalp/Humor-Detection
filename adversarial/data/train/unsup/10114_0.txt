DO NOT rent here if you think you might lose your job. I moved to Pittsburgh for a contract job, and the contract was terminated prematurely through no fault of mine. I adhered to the Lincoln Properties policy of providing 30 days' written notice for moving out, but was told I would have to pay a fee of 2x my rent to leave early. I only have two months left on my lease! \n\nI was told by another resident that management was flexible if you provided proof you had been laid off, which I did, but this is not the case. If I do find another job in the Pittsburgh area, I will definitely move to another apartment not owned by Lincoln Properties.
