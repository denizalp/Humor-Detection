$20 for two adults to jump around for an hour is a pretty good deal -- except after ten minutes of jumping it was clear that there was NO WAY we were going to last a whole hour. never have I felt so old and out of shape then when I came here on a Thursday night, only to be surrounded by young children and high-schoolers doing crazy back flips and gymnastic routines. and then there was me, jumping up and down in one place and feeling exhausted!\n\nit was a lot of fun and a great workout, but after 30 minutes we were DONE.  I wish they sold 1\/2 hour passes.\n\np.s. - do not pay the extra $3 to jump in the foam pit, that thing just looks disgusting....
