Every time I step into this place, it smells like a used \"street walkers\" pun√∫ani!  It's cramped, can never walk through the isles with a shopping cart. Not a wide range of vegetables and fruits to choose from. Their sea food looks like it's been covered with ice one too many times or thawed frozen and rethawed! Half their live sea food is swimming upside down dead. It's just a mess!
