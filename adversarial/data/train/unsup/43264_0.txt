Food awful. Two cheeseburgers one fish sandwich and 1 perch dinner took over 30 minutes to get and then it was cold. Cheeseburgers said under the heat lamp until the cheese didn't resemble cheese. Never going back. Waitress was bad. Brought out coffee no cream and then when she finally brought cream the coffee was cold. Don't eat here ever.
