Just getting their feet under them I think.\nNice rye and bourbon list, great local draft beer selection. Joseph James, craft haus, bad beat, sin city...\nThe food still needs some work though. Pork croquette sadly needs more unctuous fattiness, frog legs didn't seem that fresh, but the fried pickles were awesome just wish there was more of them.\n Going to give them another shot in a few weeks...
