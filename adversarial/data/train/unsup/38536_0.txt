The bbq is out of this world delicious and the staff couldn't be nicer. They made sure we were completely satisfied with our food and sent us on our way with a list of breweries and restaurants in the area worth trying. \nThanks for everything , you guys are awesome! You have two more fans from the SF Bay Area .
