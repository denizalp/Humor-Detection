Our second time for eating at Felice.  Patio was full and they let us know as we came in that service would be slow so we were prepared.  We asked to be seated inside, and we were the only group inside.  We were concerned about being forgotten, but the waiter was terrific.  Although it took 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive, our salads came within 10 minutes of ordering, and the entrees 15 minutes after that-a shorter wait than in most restaurants.  Beet salad was amazing-we licked the plate.  I had bucatini with calamari and it was absolutely delicious.  The waiter said it would be messy to eat but so worth it, as I tucked my napkin into my collar.  Better to cut than to twirl she advised.    2 out of party had the duck and it did not disappoint.  The 4th in our party had ribs and announced they were the best they had ever eaten.\n\nThis funky place with the friendly wait staff will definitely be on our list of great places to eat.
