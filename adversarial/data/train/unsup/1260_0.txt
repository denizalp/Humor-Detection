I made an appointment a few days ago for a keratin treatment. My appointment was at 4:30PM Saturday with a lady named Cathy. Showed up to my appointment on time to be told that Cathy was not in and she was on her way.  The owner's daughter  greeted me when I came in. She seemed surprise that I was there, she thought I was a new client. So she told me to wait for Cathy and I did. I waited for 15 minutes and then asked her again if she was on her way. She told me she was and that she was with her mom and she had called them to let them know I was waiting.  So I waited for 25 minutes and no one showed up.  So I asked again if she knew if they were far or close to the business. The next thing she said was interesting \"  Do you have something else to do?. My thought immediately was, why would she be asking me this and isn't my time valuable. I responded that I had a friend to meet that that is why I had made the appointment at that time.  Then she proceeded to speak to another hair dresser and asked her to call her mom to let her know I was there waiting. Something just did not seemed right!!!!!.  The girl did not even made an effort. I then proceeded to tell the salon owner's daughter that I had to go. She asked me if I had her mom's phone number so I can call her to let her know that I was there. This made me angry. I told her why would I have your mother's personal cell phone and need to call her to remind her of an appointment that I made 4 days ago. Isn't that her Job?????  I finally left and told her how unprofessional I thought they were. I told her I was never coming back and that I have traveled from Deer Valley to Mesa and that I did not appreciate the fact that they do not take their business seriously. It was not like they had a family emergency or illness that she could not be there. They were out and about probably shopping or at dinner.  To date I have not received a phone call apologizing for leaving me hanging for 40 minutes.
