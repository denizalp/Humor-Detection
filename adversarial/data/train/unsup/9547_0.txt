I grew up enjoying good shawarma. Every city I've visited has a great place that serves shawarma. It's usually the places that aren't fancy and uppity that has the best version. Sadly, in this town, I've not had a great shawarma. A gyro is not a shawarma! \n\nBeef and Lamb Shawarma:\nThe bread is thin and crisp - not doughy. Hooray!  The garlic sauce was great but there just wasn't enough in my shawarma - I'll ask for extra garlic sauce next time. You can taste mint, cucumbers, meat...mmmm...4\/5\n\nChicken Gyro:\nThey have a special on this for $3.99. So, why not? There was a pickle and a french fry in there - not sure if that was by accident or they're really part of the gyro because that's just weird. 3\/5\n\nFries:\nNothing special. 3\/5\n\nRose Water Iced Tea:\nSome Rose water teas can taste like soap. This was just perfect. 5\/5\n\nBaklava:\nNot too sweet, just right. The natural oil from the walnuts was making the filo glisten a little bit much. 3\/5\n\nThe lady behind the counter was friendly. The place was clean and they let us in a few minutes before their actual opening time which is at 10am.  This location has only been open for about a month. I'll be back...more garlic sauce!!!
