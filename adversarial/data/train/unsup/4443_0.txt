Called to see if they offered a day workout or week trial to try their gym before I make my decision on where I wanted to join. I was told yes we do, its $20 for a day pass and $50 for a week pass. Um okay, so let me get this straight, you want me to pay you $20 to try your gym for the day? Well, thanks LVAC for making things a little easier for me, I can cross you off my list of potential gyms. LA Fitness did the same thing to me years ago and I will NEVER set foot in one of the gyms EVER again......Just saying.
