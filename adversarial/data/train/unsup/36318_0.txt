This is a speedy depot, primarily because it is well staffed (even on a Sunday), and the counting is done by different people than the sorting. Didn't smell raunchy like a lot of depots I've been to.  Parking is right at the door, reducing the likelihood that your returns break through the bottom of your flimsy garbage bags...man I hate that!  What would make a depot five stars?  Maybe someone to carry in the bottles?  Probably only applicable if you don't have a Y chromosome :-)
