Came here during the first few days of opening. The staff were super friendly and I got my poke burrito right away. However, I was very unimpressed with the size of it; its way less than what I could have got for the similar price at other poke restaurants, like Rolltation or even Poke Guys. There was very little fish and very little everything in general. Would be returning after their opening phrase to see if they've improved, but won't be going back until then.
