The Strip District is an old industrial and warehouse area that has become an active street market type district.  Vendors line the street selling produce, crafts, sports team gear and various other products on Friday to Sunday.  Our first visit was on a Saturday morning where we found the place packed with people squeezing their way up and down the narrow sidewalks.  We went for breakfast at a restaurant, but found some cool shops to check out along the way including a pottery shop, kitchen supply shop, Asian grocery store, and a bakery that I regret not buying anything from.  Our second visit was after the market had already packed up leaving the place dead.  It would be nice to see wider sidewalks or perhaps closing off the street to making it pedestrian only during peak times.  Well worth a visit while in Pittsburgh!
