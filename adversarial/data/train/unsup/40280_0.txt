I had an old side by side refrigerator sitting in my house forever. The Freon was out and it would cost as much to fix as to just buy new. I googled free appliance pickup and Shawn's popped up at the top of the list. I called and after giving the nice gal that answered  the phone my address she scheduled me for the very next day. The gentleman picking up came by 9am. He was able to pick up the fridge and load it up and haul away in less than 15 minutes! Thanks Shawn's! I couldn't have done it without you!
