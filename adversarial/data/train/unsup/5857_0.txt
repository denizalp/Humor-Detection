So many things went wrong with my visit here. Before deciding on actually painting a piece I made sure to ask all of the right questions such as when I would be able to pick up my finished product as I was leaving Phoenix for the summer. I was assured that they would be ready right on time. So my family and I picked out our pieces and got to painting. It was fun, but unfortunately not only was our pottery not ready on time, as promised, but they didn't put all of them in the oven at the same time!! Thus delaying the process even further. Unbelievable. \n\nAlso, even though they tell you your pottery will be ready by a certain day\/time they do not call you. You have to call in and check on the status where they will have a difficult time locating it as they do not have a tracking system to know which items belong to the customer(s)\n\nIt's just so disappointing to have had such a horrible experience all around with this establishment. I hope they can get more organized and improve their customer service.
