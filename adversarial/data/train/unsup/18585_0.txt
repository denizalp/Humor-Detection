Heard all of the hoopla over the past few months. And you know, been watching a lot of Cake Boss, so of course I think I am an expert, but whatever.\n\nMy ma bought a dozen of these things for my niece's birthday over the weekend. I got there after they had been gone through. Tasted Red Velvet, Pumpkin and Chocolate. \n\nPretty good. In my opinion, the red velvet and chocolate were a bit dry...but let me preface by saying I got there hours after the box came into the house, and that I am not a frosting person, so I tasted the cake without the frosting first on both of those. I did taste the frosting on all of them after those first bites, and wow, I give them a hand on that, the frosting was incredible.\n\nThe pumpkin was great. The little dots on top freaked me out, and taste like nothing, but I guess they are all the rage, so ok.\n\nIn all, I will try to find an independant that does the same thing better, but that's just my M.O.  \n\nGood enough and I had to try it to see what it was all about.\n\n... my mom told me what they cost, and HOLY CRAP....not happening for me. A cupcake better give me a lot more than a sugar rush at that price.
