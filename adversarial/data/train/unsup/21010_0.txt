BS +++\n\n\"So you fancy huh!?\" \nWow when I talk about high class this is the spot.  I mean for tea and some buffet type of desserts and some more tea and a beautiful view... A party of 14 = $896 (with tips).  I mean that's pricey but you are mostly paying for the experience.  You can't get anymore Vegas than this.  The mimosa was good.  The tea was BOMB! The dessert menu and selection was BOOMSAUCE.  The restrooms are super fancy.  You get the view of the whole strip.  It's just very classy and a perfect socialite venue.  I would definitely come back again.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n* Boomsauce scale.\nBW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended.\nBS = it's just O.K. (experience)\nBS+ = Yo! I like this place.\nBS++= That's Whoa! This place good.\nBS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!
