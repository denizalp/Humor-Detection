I hit Black Dog on the rave recommendations of several friends.  They speak the truth.  Black Dog is the bomb.*\n\nWhen you show up, you'll notice the place is packed.  Walk up to the slab of paper, grab a sharpie and write your name down.  You'll be called when there's room for you to begin your BBQuest.\n\nA sign near the entryway notified us they were out of burnt ends and mac 'n' cheese.  We mourned this loss and regrouped in time to be seated.\n\nLet's start with the cornbread.  You can order it as a side to your main dish or as an appetizer.  The appetizer portion ($2.95) is solid enough for two people.  The cornbread contains green chiles, pit beans, cheese and pulled pork.  Boom.  Regular bread is forever ruined.\n\nIf you like sauces, Black Dog allows you to order a flight of all eight of theirs for just $2.  Milo's Mustard and Carolina Red were my favorite.\n\nFor my main dish, I went with a 3 meat combo.  Ribs, chicken and brisket.  Chicken was my favorite.  Succulent, soft and juicy, it paired very nicely with any sauce, but it was a home run with the mustard.\n\nThe ribs were appropriately soft and smoky.  I really loved these with the Carolina Red sauce.\n\nThe brisket was good, but not particularly outstanding.\n\nI live in Chicago, but Black Dog is good enough to merit a two and a half hour drive.  If you're in the area, you have to check out this temple of meat!\n\n* Saying things are \"the bomb\" was a popular expression in the early 2000s.  Despite its rapid decline in coolness, some people still use it earnestly.  Others use it ironically.  You are free to decide the context in this review.
