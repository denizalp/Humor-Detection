I love Jimmy John's. In fact, it's my favorite hangover food: you can eat a whole sub without feeling disgusting and take a nap with all of that bread settling into your abused stomach. Perfection.\n\nBut, this location is not my hangover location, it's my \"I'm starving and need a quick lunch because my desk isn't going to clear itself off while I get a luxurious one-hour lunch break.\" This location, like all others, can satisfy my need for carbs and some protein or loads of veggies, plus a pickle and chips if I'm feeling the need for more salt in my lunch. It's a quick walk from the office, so I get some fresh air, a tasty lunch and back to the grind before I waste my afternoon away. \n\nThe only problem I found when I came here was the service. The girl that took my order was completely zoned out. Granted, it was during a lunch rush and I can understand that those are not the most fun for some people (I loved lunch rushes when I was in customer service...made the time go by quicker and moved people along faster), but that's even more reason to be on your toes and attentive. She just kind of stared at me with that blank stoner stare, like I was a sandwich or something.
