The transition from Gold's to EOS is complete and I can't say things got better as it went quite the opposite. They changed classes and schedules which I'm not happy about. But they won't do a darn thing to fix the speaker system in the group fitness room. The floors in the group fitness room and yoga room are so gross and filthy.  You'll see dents, dust bunnies and shoes prints. I would always wipe off my space with a wet paper towel because it's just disgusting. There's sand coming out of the weight plates that caused temporary blindness while doing chest.\n\nThey added a supplement store which sells overpriced Quest bars - no, thank you!\n\nI joined another gym as I'm getting fed up with this place. Honestly, if this gym wasn't close to home and if it wasn't for the friendships I've made, I would have left months ago. Management needs a serious wake up call - members and instructors are moving to LVAC that just opened this week and I don't blame them.
