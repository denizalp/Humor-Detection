I bought my Tempur-Pedic here and the sales guys are awesome.\nI was probably the worst customer they have ever had because I kept leaving to check out nearby mattress stores to get the best price. The problem with a Tempur is the mattress is \"price locked,\" but I was atleast able to get some extra stuff at this location that I wasn't at any other location; they for sure were much more willing to work with me on beating others' prices and seemed to know answers that when I asked other salesfolk they were obviously bluffing or straight up did not know.\n\nThanks Joseph for your charisma and smarts and Marcus for your scientific explanations!
