This place is great, my 2 girls came out really happy and they look awesome. One of them normally rushes to me when I get to the groomers and the day we came here she was so calm and happy to interact with all the girls. Definitely felt more comfortable having them groomed here vs the other place I used to go to. The Bandana was a really nice touch. Thank you and we will def be regulars
