Celiac and Gluten intolerant BEWARE. This is NOT a GF establishment. My husband and I went because of the reviews and GF option for me. They do not have a dedicated prep area. The sauce is spread by the same ladle as the regular pizza (directly from the regular to GF and back again). The flour flies everywhere and got on the so called GF crust \/ pan. I had to cancel my order. The staff was great about it. The pizza my husband got was really good and he enjoyed it. Great staff and pizza. Oh and for celiacs, beware of the flour in the air. My eyes and lips are still burning.
