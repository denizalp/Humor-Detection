At one point a few months ago my husband was considering bankruptcy. We had gone and spoken with an attorney at Haines & Krieger and had a less than satisfactory experience (see my review on them), so we searched high and low for a great quality bankruptcy attorney for a second opinion. My husband found Schwartz law firm and from the get-go, we were extremely happy. Bryan Lindsey was the individual who spoke with us upon our free consultation. He was extremely helpful and patient, and answered every single one of our questions. They had allotted us 30 minutes for the consultation, but it ran over by approximately 15 minutes, but he didn't seem to mind. Overall, Bryan helped us decide that bankruptcy just wasn't worth it in our situation, which is something we really appreciated, considering the other attorney was pushing us into doing it, but was not answering our questions. If you decide on bankruptcy, I highly recommend this law firm. They were very professional, and understanding.
