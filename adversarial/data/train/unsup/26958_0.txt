4 Stars.\n\nI have reviewed the College location already, so I will keep it simple.\n\nGreat food.\nCheap prices.\nNo frills.\n\nExpect more and you will be disappointed.  Expect less and you will be blown away. I have tried to go to other burrito places across the city and in other cities, but every time I always conclude, no one does a burrito better than Burrito Boyz; they have it down to a science.\n\n\nThat's it.
