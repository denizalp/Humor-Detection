I woke up on Christmas Morning, with a deep craving for Ramen.  We parked the car and were walking towards another Ramen place when we stumbled upon Kenzo Ramen.  Since I was super hungry and couldn't wait to walk over to my original destination, we decided to walk in. I was grateful that they were open on Christmas Day.  \nHOWEVER, our waitress did not have the best attitude.  I was hoping it was a Japanese owned place, but it was not :(  I was excited to see takoyaki on the menu but when I tried it, I was disappointed.  They used the wrong sauce and mayonnaise ( it may have been just some white sauce and not actual mayonnaise).  But I think if you don't really know what takoyaki is supposed to taste like, you may enjoy it.\n\nRamen itself, was just around average.  I ordered the Sapporo MIso Ramen.  It wasn't disgusting but it wasn't good.\n\nWill NOT be going back.
