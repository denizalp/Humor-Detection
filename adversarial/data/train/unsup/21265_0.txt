Still one of my favorite pizza and chicken wing spots. Located in the good ole EASTCYDE!   There used to be Tropicana Pizza joints all over the valley. Fortunately this one is the last one standing.  YAYAH!!! I've move away from the EASTCYDE but still find my way back to my roots. You can take the boy out of the EASTCYDE, but you can't take the EASTCYDE out of the boy. \n\nThis pizza always scratches that pizza and wings itch whenever I start to fiend.  I always get an X-large pepperoni with a bucket of plain wings w\/ hot sauce on the side. They have always been on point. The pizza is always cheesy and  ALWAYS satisfying.  They're also open late until 2 am. FOR SHEEZIE! I will always support this EASTCYDE pizza joint. Thanks Tropicana Pizza!!! \n\nI've got a pretty good munchie pallet. This place definitely places in my top 5. \n\nEYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!
