Peeps, let's get real for a second:  when I go thrifting, I absolutely hate how dirty some places can be.  This place is like a beautiful, sparkling gem. I mean, reallllllly clean!  Off to a great start, if I do say.\n\nThe ladies working that day were all very nice and helpful, as I had several questions and needed to use the toilet.  Clothing is nicely arranged, and all items and pretty easily accessible.  The day that I shopped there, all blue tag items were a whopping dollar!  Score.\n\nWhile I didn't find anything on my first trip, I am happy to say I will be heading there soon to try and find a glorious Christmas\/Hanukka\/Kwanzaa\/other this-time-of-year-holiday sweater.  \n\nSee you soon, Flo!
