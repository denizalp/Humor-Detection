This place is a tourist trap, be warned. Everyone tells you have to go here so you go. You can expect to be given a 1-3 hour wait time no matter when you go, even if you go solo. So, this is where the fun comes in-- hang out at the bar for a bit and drink! It's a fun bar scene with very little seating, so standing is to be expected. They have tons of great brews on tap for a decent pint price. This place is always packed, so standing in a tiny bar with people all around you can feel stressful, especially when the kitchen is on the other side so the servers are forced to wade through a crowded bar area with trays of food constantly. That being said, we had fun drinking here.\n\nOnce we finally sat, we all got cheese curds and BBQ plates with our beers. The food is 100% average, exactly what one would expect at a tourist destination. I would never return here for food. I feel like once you experience this place, there's no reason to ever return really.\n\nThe BBQ was generic. Nothing to write home about. The cheese curds were good not great. This place is hugely overrated and probably not worth the wait honestly, but if you need to experience it because people talked it up as THE place to try, don't go into it with high expectations.
