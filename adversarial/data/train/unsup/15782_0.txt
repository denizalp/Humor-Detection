I needed a cab service on Friday 8\/15\/14 because my car was in the shop, so I called A Cab Service for my ride to work and things worked out fine. I decided to call them again for a ride home from work and I had the WORST customer service experience I've had in a very long time. Her name was Teresa and if I were over their quality dept I would send her back for re-training. Actually this company can't have a quality dept because she would have never been hired. She was so rude and condescending, then she hung up in my face. I decided not to give that company any of my business or hard earned money, so I called Western Cab Co at (702)382-7100. They arrived quick, the rate was fare and the driver was kind. Finally, thanks to Teresa I will never use this cab service again and if I could just have one person read this post, and not give business to a company who doesn't appreciate good paying customers, I've done my job. These companies need to remember it's the customer that keeps your company a float, and we do have other choices, without us you would be out of business, SO TREAT US RIGHT!!!
