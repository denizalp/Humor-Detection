Sls,  the old Sahara,  sucks, elevators to the garage don't work, had to walk up six flights of stairs,  the line for slot cards was a mile long. Granted,  it was the first day open, but the system that they have is old and and inefficient. Won't ever come back to the SLS.\n\nWhat's SLS stand for ? Stupid Limousine Service ?\nAnd the dealers have monkeys on their backs,  no, they aren't junkies.
