Very disappointed with the food. \n\nI had to comment after my last  two experience. I ordered a small jerk chicken dinner and received a large container of mostly rice and dry tasteless burnt chicken.  The large container was used, but the portion size of chicken very minimal.  I received practically no chicken.\n\nI purchased the jerk chicken special on Tuesday.  The chicken was so dry and seemed as though it was cooked the day prior.  We tried to eat it, but we could it and had to return it.  It was awful and they knew it.
