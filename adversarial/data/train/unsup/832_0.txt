So I've ordered from here a few times and I must say i have never been disappointed with any of the items Ive tried from here.\n\nIve tried several different items from there huge menu the funny part is Ive never tried there pizza but here are a few items I have tried...\n\nThe 1st thing I ever was the Fettuccine Alfredo it was generous portions of saucy creamy goodness I was surprised at how tasty it was being that most pizza places don't have the best tasting pastas.\n\nNext time I ordered from here I tried the wings i got half Garlic Parmesan and half Hot wings bone in and they were very tasty and delicious, not to mention I must say they have the best ranch dressing Ive ever had in my life so i really enjoyed dipping these tasty critters into there wonderful ranch dressing. \n\nnext time i tried the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich which was very yummy how can you go wrong with a good quality chicken patty hot sauce and mayo hmm hmm good.\n\nLast but probably my favorite item Ive tried at this place was their Philly Cheese steak OMG juicy, flavorful, cheesy goodness this by far is one of the best cheese steaks Ive ever had I could of sucked down 2 of these tasty things my mouth is watering just writing about it. This is definitely a must try if you go to this place.\n\nI absolutely love this place Ive never found a place where everything Ive tried on the menu is truly delicious and i must say they are reasonably priced. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because when I order from here I do delivery and it takes about an hour for me to get my food, other then that there is no going wrong with Angelina's.
