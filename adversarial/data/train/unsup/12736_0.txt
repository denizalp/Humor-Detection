We arrived approximately 15 minutes early for our 8:00 PM dinner reservation at Bradley Ogden. We had a small, private dining room reserved for our group of 11 and we ordered straight from the menu. \n\nI started with a glass of Perrier Jouet champagne while we waited for the remainder of our group in the lounge. The lounge was very comfortable with large, over sized chairs - almost like a living room. \n\nI started with the foie gras. 1.5 oz of sonoma foie gras seared with sea salt sprinkled on top.  It was served with a peanut butter mousse and pomegranate gastique on top of a peanut brioch toast stuffed with pear jam. It was delicious and very unusual. \n\nFor my entree, I had the scallops with golden raisin with baby cauliflower confetti curry, flat top seared with sea salt and black pepper. The serving was a great portion, not too large but I was left very satiated. \n\nWe had Quintessa Cabernet and the Grgich hills chardonnay with dinner. Finally, we finished the night with a glass of Patron aged in cognac barrels. \n\nMy only reason for not giving 5 stars is because of an inappropriate comment the server made.
