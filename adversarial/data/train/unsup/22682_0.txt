WOP, is a racial slur for Italo-Canadians, which is a short form for Without Papers.  \n\nItalo-Canadians use the word 'wop' among themselves as a playful putdown. They are a bit edgy about non-Italians employing the term, as it is generally held to be a racist slur.  Here's another opinion and controversy around this slang.

I got my answer.  In case any of you were wondering, that was the answer I received.  \n\nI met my friend Heather there at 5:30 on a Tuesday night and it was quite busy.  We were able to get a seat, but by 6:00 p.m. it was packed.\n\nWe ordered the warm olives as an appetizer, and they were fantastic!  I am a huge olive fan to begin with, so a mixed tray of olives made my heart sing.  This was admittedly the first time I had olives warm, and my opinion is that it is a very nice touch.\n\nFor dinner, Heather and I each got a beet salad, with arugula and goat cheese. I liked the flavor of the beet salad, but I honestly found it a bit salty.  Heather, who LOVES salt, found it perfect!\n\nThe pizza we chose was the Baby Doll, which is Roasted free-range chicken, eggplant, artichoke hearts, cherry tomatoes, goat cheese and tomato sauce.  Since we chose such a low fat option, plus a gluten free crust, it wasn't the yummiest pizza I ever ate.  However, it was really good, considering there was no mozza and no gluten.  The crust was extremely thin, and almost crispy, and the toppings were all healthy, yummy options.  I was admittedly getting a bit of plate envy from the folks on either side of me, ordering a cheezier option.  When I hit my weight loss goal, I may need to come back and celebrate!\n\nWhat impressed me about this restaurant was the vibe.  It has that hip, trendy feel, and I am also thankful that I went to a pizza place and did not have to resort to salad due to my diet restrictions.  I was able to participate with a healthier option and not feel like I was totally cheating myself.
