I was a little nervous to use a carpet cleaning Company that was not truck mounted. I have put off having my carpet professionally cleaned since I live in Buckeye and water rates are so high.  Having said that I have a back ground of 32 years in property Management.  I have hired and fired many carpet vendors in my career.  I had this Company clean my carpet and they brought and used their own water.  The job was amazing!  The owner was very knowledgeable.  I loved the citrus aroma and the results were indescribable.  He left my house with a clean fresh scent and a noticeably raked finish.  Most important the chemicals used left my carpet angora soft.  I have been used to carpet looking clean but felt stiff and very wet when completed.  Amazing carpet professional and I recommend using this company 1000000000000000000000000 percent.  It is truly HEAVEN SENT.  Thanks so much!!!  Keep up the great work!!!
