Best meal I've had in charlotte in a long time. And the best service too. Not sure where to start because everything was amazing. We had the cauliflower, quail, mussels, lobster pasta, mahi, oysters, and the berry crisp. Each dish was perfectly balanced and flavorful. Our waitress was amazing which made it so much better.
