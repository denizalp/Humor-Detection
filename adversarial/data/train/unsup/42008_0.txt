This is such a lovely theater to spend an evening at with family and friends!! I have been here many times and every time we go we have such a great time!  The actors are fun and energetic, the shows are amazing quality, and you really feel like a valued guest here.  Plus the owner is Don Bluth, who made the movies Land Before Time, Anastasia, Secret of Nimh, and more.  You will have a wonderful time if you come see a show here!!
