Let me clarify very good service and very bad service!! Do not take a delivery from them if they are not clear on the facts. My wife went to blue diamond got good service upon arrival buying to good size trees explaining different trees and good for sun etc,, , and 2 big pots. She made it clear they needed to be potted and delivered, $500 for everything, ok cool!! then doomsday arrived for a tuesday delivery!! I was expecting these trees to arrive they did not!. As i was leaving i saw on my front lawn!! 2 massive potted trees weighing 200 pounds each , and empty can, and empty soil bags,, Ok how the frig do i move these to the back patio? by the way when they delivered my car was out front and the gate was open, Holy cow knock on the fn door?\nDo you think maybe upon buying and setting up delivery the clerk would say \"Hey by the way, the driver is going to come to your house pot these trees on your front lawn, Leave his garbage and then whisper good fucking luck moving them!! are you kidding me!! we called they said we'll get back to you tomorrow. i guess when you pay $45 for delivery don't expect much
