This little Asian store is not as comparable as already established stores such as Tokyo Discount. They have yet to expand their inventories to compete with the ever growing number of Asian supply stores here, but there's definitely potential.\n\nFor me, this store has the basic necessities that I need without being overpriced. I have many cell phone cases I have purchased simply because I change my cover often, depending on how I feel that day from expensive bling to cute Asian designs. Although they have limited selection of cases for my phone, I still managed to purchase some.\n\nThe other thing I was thrilled about was the snack aisle where I found my favorite Japanese brand Tohato and saw the matcha flavored caramel corn which I have not seen in Vegas. If you like matcha and a touch of sweetness with a crunch, you will like this puff of goodness! And the price of $1.50 per bag?!? I took half a dozen home! Hahaha! They even have matcha green tea cough drops and other unique flavors. \n\nThey offer selections from kitchen supplies to beauty supplies, and for \"everything $2.50\" unless marked. They have a small section dedicated to Daiso Japan items. Your Yelp check in will give you a free drink under $2.00. This place is a bargain especially for college students. You can easily miss this place. It's located by the Cafe Rio Plaza across UNLV. The plaza also has a selection of restaurants and a chewy boba place that had an awesome sea salt coffee boba. This store to me is worth the drive. I can see myself coming back for more and with a friendly staff around, I can't wait to see this place transform to a full bloom!
