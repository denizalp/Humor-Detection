I'm giving 1 star for bad business practices. I brought 2 daughters and myself for 1 hr massages. They refused to use the 15% offer on yelp - Told me \"not today.\" I decided to stay anyway, as it would be the same price elsewhere. While we were happy with the massages, the next day one daughter realized she left her necklace. I went back for it a few days later, and the guy pretended he didn't understand me. I asked to speak to the owner or manager and the guy said he was the owner. While my daughter accepts responsibility for leaving her necklace, It's shady for them to not give it back.
