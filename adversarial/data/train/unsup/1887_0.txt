This is a straight to the point kind of joint. The menu is the menu, no substitutions, no hold this or add that or sauce on the side. Just order and eat. That's it. \n\nBest parts: Cadillac Margarita, strong yet tasty. Meatball, GREAT flavor. House made mozzarella, yummy. Light up menu, nice touch. Bussers were nice and efficient. \n\nDecent parts: Everything else. Cesar salad, nothing special. Calamari, nothing special. Veal Marsala, below average. Spaghetti pescatori, lots of seafood, but just good. Gnocchi, bland.\n\nBad parts: Over priced, shoot em up movie playing on the tvs, no outside drinks allowed (not even cocktails from the casino bar). Not offered fresh Parmesan cheese and no salt or pepper to be found. \n\nWe would come back for meatballs at the bar but that's about it.
