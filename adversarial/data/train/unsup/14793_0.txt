Husband and I have been to Pittsburgh a handful of times now.  After our last visit Moms asked me, \"Haven't you exhausted that city by now?\"\n\nYeah, no.  Pitt is chock full of awesome things to do.  We've only just scratched the surface.  Every time we visit we try to do something new and different.  \n\nKnow what we do *every* time, tho?  Visit The Strip.  Usually more than once.\n\nOn the weekends, The Strip District pulsates with activity.  Brick-and-mortars throw their doors open, street vendors set up shop, local produce markets thrive, and artisans sell their wares.  Throngs of people swell the sidewalks and streets.  Tourists and locals abound.  It's the most vital and exciting place in the 'Burgh.\n\nWalk here if you can.  If you must, park early (I'm talking the crack of).  Pop in anywhere that looks good -- don't miss Wholey's, Pennsylvania Macaroni Company, Penn Avenue Pottery, DeLuca's, Mancini's Bread or In the Kitchen. \n\nYou haven't visited Pitt until you've strolled the Strip.  Trust me on this one.
