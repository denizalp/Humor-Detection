I am beyond happy, you could say THRILLED, that I found this place. Oh Em Gee! I ordered the lemongrass coconut curry shrimp Pho, shrimp spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce, and salted edamame Togo through Uber Eats even though I'm right down the street, suuuuuuper hungover. It arrived within a half hour and was still hot. And phoking deeeeeliiicious as phooooock! I was worried the lemongrass would be too overwhelming, it's not! Goodness gracious, the flavor was out of this world. SO good, people! Spring rolls were dank. Extra fresh. Like SUPER fresh. The freshest. Edamame was perfectly steamed, very edamame-y. Lovely food. Just lovely. I am stoked to go back and get the phorito burrito, tacos. Or anything else. I only wish they had wings because I KNOW they would do 'em right. Oh man. What are you waiting for? Tryyyyyy it!
