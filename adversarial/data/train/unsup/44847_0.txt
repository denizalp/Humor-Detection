Just moved here from Philly, and the steak sandwich I had was pretty good. The meat, onions, and prov were all as they should be, but the roll was either not an Amoroso's or they get soft on the trip to AZ. Overall it was pretty good-- similar to Jim's on South (but without the cocaine). The photos on the wall were cool and reminded me of home.\n\nI wish you guys still sold soft pretzels! I'd be in there every week.
