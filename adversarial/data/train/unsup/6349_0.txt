Second time here and it was just as good as the first time. The first time I wanted to try everything and ordered way too much! We tried the bento box which had an assortment of everything delicious, green tea buckwheat noodles (yum!), fresh tofu which was excellent and made my hubby who doesn't like tofu actually like tofu. The waitress was so kind she took half of the tofu I ordered and turned it into agedashi tofu. Both versions of the tofu did not disappoint. Tuna poke, I would say I was the least impressed with this dish. I love tuna poke too but not this version. Too full for dessert.\n\nSecond time around we tried the kaiseki with friends. I enjoyed everything we had and it was lots of food for $30. Something new I tried was the hamachi collar which was a generous portion and very tasty. The black sesame pudding was so light and delicate. \n\nTheir flavors are subtle but great for me. I don't like thick sugary or fattening sauces poured all over my Japanese food or any flavor that overpowers a food too much. \n\nService is outstanding both times I came. The waitress that is regularly there when I went both times is too cute. She welcomes you like you are entering her home and when you leave she waved goodbye and held the door open for us. I feel like I'm in eating in someone's home and I love that.
