Fuggetaboutit!\n\nThis is pretty much the only reason to go up to this pub-invested neighborhood.\n\nHollywood Gelato makes some of the creamiest stuff in the city. If you're like me, and you don't really dig the milk, then you're stuck with sorbet at 31 Flavors. Ironically, there is a Baskin Robbins down the street that also does well in the summer.\n\nIt's over run with children, so just grab your cone and go.\nThey also sell it by the tub to take home with you.\n\nAny flavor, any time.\nabsolutely delicious.
