So I called and got the owner who I've been told is an old crank.  And true to form I asked if he had Italian squash in his veggie plants and he said in a very heavy southern accent \"we aint gots none of that stuff ere. ,,wees is old country folk and we aint got none of that eye-tallian stuff youze aint gonna find that ere and then he just hung up the phone and not even a good bye.  Very odd man to say the least!
