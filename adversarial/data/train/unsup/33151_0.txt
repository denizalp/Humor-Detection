My husband and I went to Onda for dinner...unfortunately it did not live up to expectations.  The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and has a great atmosphere. We had a booth tucked in a corner and there was no one next to us (we had 6 pm reservations), so it was romantic and cozy.  Our server was very nice...attentive without being pushy.  The best thing that we ate was the bread and dipping mix that other reviews have raved about...it was delicious.  If we had just stopped with that, Onda would get at least 4 stars from me...unfortunately, we had an appetizer and dinner.\n\nFor an appetizer, we had the calamari.  It ranks as some of the worst calamari we have had...the breading was overpowering and I am not sure the calamari was cooked perfectly.  I ordered the capellini and scallops...big mistake.  The pasta flavor was incredibly bland and the scallops were super rubbery and did not have a good flavor at all.  They were so poor that I could barely force myself to eat two of them.  My husband ordered the garlic crusted sea bass which he said was just OK and there was nothing special to it.  We certainly did not feel that the quality of the food lived up to the amount we paid, which is why Onda only gets 2 stars from me.
