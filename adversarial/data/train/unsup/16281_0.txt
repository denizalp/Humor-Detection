A bit odd to be reviewing a cemetery but I could get why it's an attraction. \n\nOld cemetery founded in 1869; despite the number of the buried there are plenty of open greens. It's a nice, quiet area for anyone looking to take a stroll. Would recommend doing this during the day to avoid being surprised by unsolicited company from down under. B00. Ok bad joke. \n\nThere are quite a few mausoleums but the most notable one is Garfield's Tomb (yes, the president). Ascend to the top for a nice view of the cityscape and Case. Descend to the basement for a view of the caskets. \n\nBTW not sure if posted hours of operations are accurate, Google said it's closed on Sunday but...it wasn't.
