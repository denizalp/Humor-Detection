I was looking for some tasty snacks and we ended up here (the name was the deciding factor for me)...it's a very cozy restaurant with a main seating area and an outside patio complete with waterfall. To get your food, you must first place your order at the counter and they take the food out to you...there are sandwiches, quiches, desserts and coffee. I ordered the apple pie with vanilla ice cream $5.50 and a cup of coffee $3. The view of the waterfall had us sitting outside, although the inside was very inviting with the very cool air condition. It was 100 degrees outside but I couldn't resist the man-made view. My apple pie with ice cream was delicious and the gigantic cup of coffee a delight. \n\nI really liked this place. It was cute, cozy and i liked the ambiance inside and outside.
