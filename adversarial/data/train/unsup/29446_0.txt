I come here all the time after work for a drink with my coworker. I'm not a huge fan of beer, so I won't mention anything about that but the fact that they have an incredibly long list of different beers. I prefer to drink wine, and they have a nice selection. The gentlemen at the bar are always willing to give samples to try before you decide. My friend and I usually order a bottle of wine, as single glasses are no less than $9 each. The bottle we order is usually around $36, which I find a bit pricey, but not surprising seeing as we are in Downtown Summerlin. I absolutely love the fiery fried calamari, it's a must have every time I come. I've also ordered the cutting board which comes with a selection of cheeses and meats with bread, great pairing for wine. I've ordered the sliders, margherita pizza, and truffle fries... all amazing. I have always come in and sat in the bar area, and service is great. Food almost always comes out quickly. Things are a bit wild during Happy Hour. Waitresses take ages to come to your table, and takes longer to get food. You only receive happy hour specials at the bar, and the bar area fills up very quickly as it's not too big. I don't know much about the service at the tables. I love the atmosphere, the music, and the whole vibe here. One of my favorite bars in downtown Summerlin. My only reasoning for the 4 stars are the prices. If they knocked a few dollars off, this place would be perfect.
