The store itself is beautifully decorated, with some designs that I can see being implemented in my own home.\n\nThe sales associates do a good job of keeping a distance and asking for help unobtrusively. \n\nHowever, the prices are higher than what I expected for name brands that I've never heard of. I was with my interior design friend and she did not recognize the names of the manufacturers for their living room furniture.\n\nThey do offer bulk discount if you say, spend over $2,000 and up.\n\nI can't see myself actually buying anything here but it's a good store and just walk around to get some ideas without being hounded by salespeople.
