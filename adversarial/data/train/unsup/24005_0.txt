Nipa Hut is a full-fledged Filipino grocery store. It has everything a Filipino needs... they even sell Magic Mic karaoke sets! Naks! Need halo-halo ingredients? You're set. Craving hopia? Otap? Pastillas? Sky flakes? Look no further. They even sell San Miguel and Red Horse beer, ay sus!\n\nYou can find some of these items at the Asian stores downtown, but this place is probably the most comprehensive of Filipino goods for your convenience. Expect items to be a little bit more expensive here, though. You're paying for the convenience and exclusivity. You can't get Red Horse anywhere else.\n\nThey also have a restaurant on the side, but I haven't eaten there so I can't comment on it. I can only say that it definitely passes the look and smell test. Sarap naman!
