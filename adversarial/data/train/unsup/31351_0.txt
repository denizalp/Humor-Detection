*******Timeshare Presentation******\nDo not RUIN your vacation by agreeing to do this presentation.  They did not hold on to their promise by taking only 2-3 hours.  It was up to 5 hours!!!!!  The manager Ali was unprofessional and took over 35 minutes to get our \"exit\" paperwork done for us to go into another room for our gifts.  I have been to other timeshare presentations but this is the worst of them all.
