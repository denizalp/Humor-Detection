Oh man is this place overpriced.  I love chandeliers.  I need one in every room in order to be happy.  So, I shop a lot for chandeliers and I feel I have a good guess on what they should be priced.  As I walked up and down the aisles, I was shocked by how overpriced everything was.  They do have beautiful fixtures but you have to sell a kidney to buy one.
