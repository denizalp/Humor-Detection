Wow! That is literally all I can say. We've been coming to this location the past 4 or 5 years and have a plethora of servers - from good to bad.\n\nTonight, we had the best experience at a restaurant ever. From the server, Robert, to the manager Brian\/Bryan, they absolutely knocked it out of the park. \n\nTo start, Robert was very kind upon greeting us - he had a great upbeat attitude. After going over beer options with us (Robert, great job on describing the beers), we had our salads within minutes. Shortly after, he checked in to ensure everything was okay. To follow-up that, he let us know an approximate ETA of those sweet, delicious steaks. \n\nFood was killer! Great job to the cooks in the back. My girlfriend and I are in food coma's. Steak were juicy, bloody, and just the way we wanted. \n\nShortly after our meal, Bryan\/Brian the manager, came to check in on us to ensure everything was satisfactory. We informed him how great our experience with Robert was, and he seemed incredibly appreciative of the kind feedback. He chatted with us, asking where we were from and showed a genuine interest in us. After, he wished us a happy holidays and to take care. \n\nI'm sure I've been rambling on for a while, but the crew here deserves high praises. It felt extremely home-ey, we felt welcomed, and we felt valued as a customer. \n\nKeep it up Bryan\/Brian and Robert! We hope to see you two when we're visiting Vegas next.
