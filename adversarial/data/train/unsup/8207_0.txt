Writing this review truly breaks my (cold) heart. Century III Mall in the '80s was THE place to go. I can remember so many weekend's taking the drive up to the mall and spending hours here, perusing all the stores in this three story complex, now all these years later, I felt like I was walking into a horrorr film as I walked down the empty hallways.\n\nI think there are about stores total in the entire place and I think I'm being generous when I give that number. Every store here has pretty much gone and left. The water fountain doesn't even run that's in the middle of the mall. There is a two story carousel there that's truly beautiful, but while it was open, had no children to ride it. I mean, why would there be any children there? There hasn't been an open toy store here in years!\n\nThe food court- empty.\nThe third floor- closed off.\n\nIt's truly nightmarish here. I kept thinking at any moment the entire building would go dark and I'd never be found again.\n\nWorking bathrooms? Who knows. I wasn't risking going in there. Who knows what I'd find. I think I saw 5 people inside the mall walking around and one was security.\n\nThere is a Bath & Body, Game Stop, and a few comic books and gaming stores. To be honest, I can't remember anything else. \n\nLike I said, it's heartbreaking. Where did they all go? I never wanted to see something from my childhood end up like this but unfortunaely, Century III Mall is all but gone.\n\nDo not go there unless you want all of your childhood memories to be destoyed.
