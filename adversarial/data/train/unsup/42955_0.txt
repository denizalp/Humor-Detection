Wow, Jodi was so incredibly knowledgable and informative throughout the entire process! The encapsulating of my placenta was so quick, I loved that she comes to your home, sets up shop and goes straight to work! How convenient?!! I've been open to encapsulating my placenta since before I even got pregnant, I loved that I actually had a few friends visiting myself and baby when Jodi was in our home and she was able to completely open their minds to the process and I believe she gained yet another customer!\n\nAnother thing I loved about this experience, I was able to text her questions I was having about breastfeeding and latching, she answered them right away and her advise helped immensely.\n\nMy girlfriend got me the encapsulating as a baby shower gift, how convenient?!!! She even has the ability to be added to your registry!\n\nI HIGHLY recommend Jodi and her services.
