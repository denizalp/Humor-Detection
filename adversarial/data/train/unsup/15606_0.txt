STAY AWAY!!  We paid over $7000 for two custom built pieces (fire pit table and Utility Bar.  The table arrived and was not built to the specs., it was too high.   Aaron (the owner) wanted to charge $1800 to pick it up to fix their mistake!  Thinking we could just return the chairs we purchased and find new ones would be easier, however that was not the case.  Eventually we did find some higher chairs, however now the table was too short, so we had to have a contractor raise it a few inches to make it work.  That labor costs us $350 (not to mention the chairs were more expensive) and we asked Aaron to please reimburse us for their mistake (just the $350, not for the more expensive chairs).  He would not.  Said that custom orders can vary from 4-6 inches!  REALLY??  No where on their website, brochure or contract does it state this, nor did he ever mention it when we placed the order. \nCHOOSE WISELY - IT'S COUNTY FAIR SEASON IN CALIFORNIA!\nThere are more than one vendor at your local county fair -  Backyard Accents does not back their product!!!  We were fooled by his nice personality, etc.  Please learn from our misfortune.  Whomever you purchase from...ask about variance on custom orders!
