This is a nice cocktail bar in Old Montreal, and the Sailor Jerry and green tea cocktail is truly delicious. It looks a lot like other bars that have popped up recently with the same vintage raw bulb chandeliers, big wooden tables, metal, warm light, levels and space. It's a nice aesthetic, just feels a little copy paste maybe, but I'd rather we be copying this than other vibes more flourescent and plastic I guess. Higher up on the up side, the staff are nice, and good at what they do, and as my friend who should know pointed out, many look like male strippers. I think that means attractive and clean cut? I dunno. Do with that what you will.
