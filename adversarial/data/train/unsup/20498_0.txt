Spectacular and dynamic night view over the strip and city lighting. It's pricey for the 30 minutes ride itself, day ticket valid before 5 pm is cheaper than all-day ticket which can be used at night, but it's still totally worth seeing for the once in a lifetime experience, one of the world's tallest ferris wheels, very smooth ride and you could barely feel it's moving when reaching the highest point in the sky.
