This restaurant is such a find!!! Everything is freshly made, even the salad dressing! The veggie salad was tangy and delicious. The garlic knots come out in a pool of luscious, warm garlic butter. The pizza is to die for (we had the meat lovers and the sunshine).  The greatest surprise of the day was the warm, fresh zeppole. We will be back again and again. Fantastic!
