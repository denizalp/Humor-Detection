New to this side of town so when our doggies needed updates on shots we decided on Craig Rd. Animal Hospital because our old vet recommended it. \nLike most animal hospitals now days you can make your own patient portal to access your pet info online which makes staying updated easier. \nTheir hours of 6am-10pm make scheduling an appointment a breeze. \nThis place can get busy and the check in area can get full of pets and their owners so make sure to keep your pet on a short leash and hang out in the waiting areas on either side of the entrance. \nThere are plenty of exam rooms that are comfortable and clean. Each time we have gone, the visits have taken under 30 minutes. The staff is thorough and get the job done which is to take care of our fur babies so they can live healthy lives.
