You had me at \"lobster poutine.\"\n\nDuring a recent trip to Calgary, I made it my personal mission to sample as much poutine as possible (being a clueless American who had never before tried this Canadian delicacy).  When I saw the lobster poutine on Briggs Kitchen's Yelp page, I knew I had to stop in for dinner.\n\nThe restaurant space is really nice - there's a huge bar in the center of the room and plenty of surrounding tables.  I was digging the background music - I think they were literally playing the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack, lots of 80s songs.  Nice ambience.\n\nObviously, I ordered the lobster poutine, and also a bowl of their \"Paella Royale.\"  I also got some smoked mushrooms on the side because a growing boy's gotta have his veggies.\n\nThe lobster poutine was just as excellent as I was hoping for!  Perfect amount of cheese curds, crispy fries that weren't soggy, and some nice chunks of lobster meat.  The gravy was really tasty as well - it seemed kind of like a melted cheese\/gravy hybrid and really tied everything together.  Worth every single calorie.\n\nThe Paella was not very good.  I felt like they skimped on the seafood and meat pretty badly.  The flavors were fine and the little bits of seafood that were there tasted great.  But you're paying a lot of money for essentially a glorified rice bowl.\n\nAt least the smoked mushrooms were a hit!  They came with a perfectly runny egg, chunks of bacon, and melted parmesan cheese.  Nice smoky flavor too - glad I ordered this as a side.\n\nThe service was pretty solid and everyone was very friendly.  I think I had 3 or 4 people check up on me throughout the night.  Definitely very attentive.\n\nOVERALL: 4\/5.  Didn't really like my paella, but everything else was wonderful!  That lobster poutine may have been my favorite out of all the different poutine variants I tried during my trip.  Great restaurant for dinner and drinks.
