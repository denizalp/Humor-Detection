Another adventure for the International Supper Club UYE! I've never tried Cambodian food and upon walking in instantly enjoyed the coziness, the decor, and the soft music playing in the background of Reathrey Seykong! We had a full table of yelpers, and only one server but he let us know service would be slower than your usual restaurant. They have only one cook but everything came out and he handled our table along with the others with perfect timing! I ordered the ginger beef that came with white rice which I enjoyed almost every tasty bite with my chopsticks, and so not to miss a drop finished the last few saucy bites with a spoon! No room for dessert, or any that made me push my boundaries or stretch my waistband to indulge in, I'll definitely return to this delightful hidden jewel for more of their delicious ethnic flavor!
