Meeting a couple of people here for a Yelp gathering, I was impressed. (Strangers are just friends you haven't met yet!) Comfortable neighborhood style restaurant with great pub grub style food and an extensive selection of beers, local and faraway. I don't know if our service was typical - our Yelp status was common knowledge - but it was good. The waitress took great care of the table and was very helpful with beer selections.\n\nI had the hummus appetizer and really enjoyed it. Lots of garlic in there and good amount of pita pieces and tortilla chips for scooping it up. The beer was cold! Other selections at the table looked good too and the jerk teriyaki chicken wings smelled great!\n\nPlenty of parking with such an urban location. Out front and out back. Prices were pretty good, especially if you stick with the specials!\n\nWould I return? Absitively! I am considering volunteering the place for our Tuesday night guy's outing.
