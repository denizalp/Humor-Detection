I have taken my dogs here for ever and loved the vets and staff. \n\nMy dog suddenly became very sick on a Wednesday ,morning and I knew that the office opens at 7:30am. \nWe got there early and waited. The receptionist opened the doors on time and I struggled to get my 100lb dog into the building. \nMy dog collapsed on the floor barely breathing and she tells me that the vet will not be in for another 30 min!!!!! \nWhy would you open a veterinary clinic without a vet present!? \n\nI had to have someone help me get her back into the car and by this time my dogs tongue was blue. \nWe got to emergency and she died less then an hour later. \n\nThanks Prestige for the help on one of the worst days of my life. I hope it was worth sleeping in...
