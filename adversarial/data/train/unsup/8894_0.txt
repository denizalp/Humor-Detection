Sin City Burger, I've missed you.  Just a little over 2 years ago, the Smashburger was a wee tot and had just opened up.  I had the pleasure of dining here twice before I moved back to LA.  So, while visiting Vegas last week, I relished the chance to go back, eat, and have an opportunity to look at it anew with Yelper eyes.\n\nLots of tasty choices from burgers ($5-7, offered in 2 sizes), to salads ($6), to grilled chicken sandwiches ($6-7), hot dogs ($5), sides ($2-3), haagen-dazs shakes ($4), and chili ($3).  The prices are really reasonable, and if you don't fancy any of the selections, you can create-your-own anything here.\n\nRe-living a not too recent favorite, I chose the Sin City Burger (american cheese, fried egg, bacon, grilled onions and served on an egg bun, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=aXY6Ejxdb1RpLzp5Q4COVQ&userid=ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A).  Instead of glorious fries, I chose the veggie frites (flash fried carrots and green beans).  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#ejIvLEaxT5wsCd_UvtQRSQ\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#afd8gM9iwR4AZ1mcdECpyg\n\nI think for the price-point of a $7 burger (1\/2 pounder), it's very good and very messy...couldn't eat the whole burger without it breaking into pieces.  Taste wise, it's in the neighborhood of a In-and-Out, Johnny Rockets, or a Fatburger.  The meat is hand-formed, but thin and larger than the bun.  Seasoned lightly (I remembered it differently from before), but the quality of the meat is less than a gourmet burger (many which are found in my \"Berger knows Burgers\" list, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/list\/berger-knows-burgers-los-angeles-2).\n\nThe Veggie Frites, great choice to save on carbs, and a unique offering at a burger place.  Green beans and carrots, flash-fried, sounds great. Unfortunately, I found them really boring, really oily, and with no pizazz or seasoning.  I ended up adding a ton of salt to it, so sure, no carbs, but now -- not even healthy.  And, WTH -- are you flipping me off?  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#P-k5gqRqkCBad8G2rw9WRw\n\nIn summary, while the price-point for individual items seems reasonable, they didn't offer a combo price, so my tab (with a soda) ran over $12.  Not an inexpensive burger lunch adventure by any means.  Would I go back again, absolutely.  The food is fresh, the decor is contemporary in red and white (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ) with big painted words of \"Smash\", \"Sizzle\", and \"Savor\" --- and if you know me at all -- I love a good burger fix, and I'll find one in any city across the country.
