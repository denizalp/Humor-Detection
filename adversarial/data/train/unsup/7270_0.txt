I have only been to Dutch Bros a few times... I've never been so annoyed by a coffee person before in my life.  Simple order: 2 Giant Iced Coffees, no junk (read: milk, sugar).  At first the quirkiness of the barista and cashier were fine... then the cashier just kept prying into my life and the life of my passenger.  We tried to provide her with quick one-word responses to her questions but this did not stop her.  She was actually so annoying we went elsewhere to drink our coffee...\n\nOn a side note- they would have gotten 5 stars for their iced coffee alone- it was fantastic.  It wasn't like Starbucks or CoffeeBean- it tasted like actual coffee, not cat pee.
