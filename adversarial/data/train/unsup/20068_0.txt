I really want to write a 5 star review for this cool, funky, full of \"love\" downtown establishment but being the Yelper that I am, several factors prevent me from doing so. \nThe first & foremost is the choice of music that the DJ played on the chosen Sunday afternoon when my son & I were there. \nIt was a beautiful afternoon, perfect weather as Phoenix can be in January. Glorious, in fact.  My son (who is 8) and I had just finished volunteering at a nearby community garden, was starving and walked over here around 1pm to have lunch. \nThere was loud music playing, the patio was filled with diners, everything was picture perfect. \nThen I asked my son if he wanted to sit outside or inside. He chose inside which was odd since the weather was so nice out. So we sat inside for a bit then I convinced him to go outside which he begrudgingly did. He kept fidgeting on the bench- finally I asked him what was wrong and he blurts out- \"Mom, are you listening to the words to the music???  It's sh*t this, *uck that and I'm going to kill this person or that person.\" \nMy mouth immediately formed an \"o\" because I had not been listening to the words as I had processed the music into background noise. \nOf course we moved back inside right away where the choice of music was much more suitable for all ages & genders. \nPretty poor choice by the DJ I would say and pretty poor selection by the management for picking aforementioned DJ!\nThe other issue I had was I had ordered the crepe w pulled pork shoulders. When the dish came, the pork was not pulled but sliced. It was also very dry- served without any sort of sauce. And the red cabbage\/ cilantro salad so beautifully described on the menu was just some chopped up red cabbage. \nThe server was very nice and brought me extra salsa & extra lime\/cilantro dressing to make the dish taste less dry. It was still a disappointment. \nMy son was also disappointed with his cheese\/chicken quesadilla saying there was not enough cheese (truth- it was very skimpy) and some slices had cheese and chicken while others barely had any fillings. It was uneven. \nI would come back here again. I do love the vibe and would give this place another chance!
