Solid three star dinner experience at The Henry. My friends and I decided to grab dinner here before heading out on a Friday night and although the drinks were fantastic, the food was about average. \n\nI really enjoyed the Ros√© All Day cocktail that I ordered. It came with cantaloupe vodka, strawberry rose syrup, elderflower liquor, and sparkling champagne. It was sweet and bubbly, just the way I like my cocktails. I also took a sip of the Champagne Supernova my friend got which was also a wonderful cocktail. \n\nMy group decided to get a few appetizers for the table including Mac and Cheese, Warm Pretzel Rolls, and Burrata Crostini. The Mac and Cheese was alright, although not as cheesy as I would have liked. I tasted more noodles than anything. Both the pretzels and Burrata Crostini were great and appreciated by all.\n\nAs for my entree, I ordered the Cobb Salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Although the chicken and bacon was good, the veggies were fresh, and the portion was gigantic, I was underwhelmed. I don't know whether they forgot to add dressing to my salad or if there just wasn't enough, but either way, I didn't taste it at all. Unfortunately, our waiter never came back to check on us, so I just ate my salad sans dressing. \n\nSpeaking of our waiter and service, although he was very nice, he wasn't very attentive. The customers seemed to be piling up as the night went on, so perhaps he was busier than usual.\n\nAll in all, although my experience wasn't a complete disappointment, if given the option, I wouldn't go back to The Henry. I'm sure there's other places on The Strip where I'd have a better dining experience.
