What is SWIHA? \nSouthwest Institute of Healing Arts\nMassage School, Life Coaching School, Intuitive Studies, etc..\n\nThis place gets four stars because of my personal opinion, i love the intuitive nature and the peaceful environment. The welcoming peace that encapsulates your soul once you walk in the front door is amazing. \nWhat I am concerned about is a certain Licensed Massage Therapist, Odette who conducted herself in a less than professional manner outside of the walls. Unfortunately she is associated with SWIHA as I met her there, therefore she is part of this review. \nInside the walls of SWIHA she was helpful and very talented at what she does. Outside the walls she made choices regarding an appointment we had scheduled and I was put aside despite my already having made the commitment to the appointment. Needless to say, I will never be receiving her services, inside or outside of SWIHA. \n\nOne of the best Licensed Practioners at SWIHA Massage School is Ann. \nShe is very skilled and does everything from deep tissue work, Reiki, Swedish Massage to a gentle Lymphatic Massage. Worth the money and definitely worth the time!!
