After a very filling and delicious dinner at a nearby restaurant, nothing sounded better than a nice big bowl of ice cream.\n\nEi's is a cute little ice cream spot. The owner's really paid a lot of attention to detail. Decor, murals, tables and chairs are absolutely adorable with a sparkly ice cream motif. \n\nThe menu is pretty diverse with options of ice cream, sundaes, kronuts, macarons and ice cream sandwiches. I was tempted by the kronut sundae but opted for two scoops in a bowl. I got taro and green tea, while my friend ordered the tin roof and coffee in a bowl. \n\nThe ice cream was creamy and refreshing. According to their website all the ingredients are natural and they ship their product in from the Bay Area. The ice cream is tasty, but on the overly sweet side for my taste. I'm a fan of more subtle flavors, so if I returned I'd likely stick to one scoop orders to try other flavors. \n\nThe location is a little hard to describe and I hope it doesn't dissuade people from visiting this hidden spot. They are on the corner of Silverado Ranch and Eastern.\n\nI would have no qualms giving this place another shot when I'm in the area.
