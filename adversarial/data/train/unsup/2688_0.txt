I've been here before on a Monday, and that was tight. The boneless buffalo wing dip deserves sonnets to be written about it. It's nearly orgasmic. No, really , I think I did leak a little eating this dip. It's just that good.\n\nToday, I experienced brunch at Maizie's and it was pretty solid. The four of us all ordered the Classic brunch--two eggs, breakfast potatoes, bacon, toast. Props to the potatoes, as they were delicious and garlicy and crispy and perhaps the most lovely potatoes I've had in such a long time. The mimosas were great! Get the bottle of champagne with a carrafe of orange juice. Have fun; don't drink until you're drunk and drive recklessly.
