If you like Chef Boyardee-style pasta and Red Baron pizza, and love absolutely wasting money try Il Forno today. \nYou can't beat their overpriced entrees, and leaving still hungry with a significantly depleted bank account is my idea of a good dinner. \nOf course, I am insane...you may be too if you like this joke of an Italian eatery!
