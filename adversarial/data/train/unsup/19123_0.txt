Let's play a game. It is called, \"that sounds awful ... But it's awesome!\"  \n\n1 - let's go to this downtown Phoenix bar I know. It is down an alley, behind some dumpsters, through an unmarked door attended by a seated bouncer (yeah, the guy just sits by the door down an alley and behind some dumpsters), and down into the half finished basement of some 40's era building.\n \n\"That sounds awful ... But it's awesome!\"\n\n(Truthfully, the basement only looks half finished. The bar is dark and has the low ceiling you'd expect of a 40 's era building basement but the bathroom is clean, modern, and well lit, exposing the charade). \n\n2 - I know! Let's have drinks named after Arizona illuminati together with a spicy dog on flat bread dressed with barbecue sauce, crumbled bacon, Gouda cheese, cracker jacks, and peanut butter.\n\n\"That sounds awful ... But it's awesome!\"\n\n(Truthfully, the mixed drinks are awesome. I recommend the Stanton though the (Rose) Mofford was also very good. That dog? That was the truth already. It is a Short Leash creation served up by Short Leash Kitchen up above ground. Don't think about it, just order it. It is so much better than you'd expect and pairs well with a bitter Stanton (OK, a negroni made with rye)). \n\n3 - I know, I know, let's hang here longer and check out the live music in the small live music room that is mostly just standing room but books awesome acts. \n\n\"That sounds awful ... But it's awesome!\"\n\n(Truthfully... Yeah. That was pretty much it above. But really you are way too cool to watch an awesome act (David Ramirez) sitting down, right? Damn the crowds, there is too much awesome here not to enjoy. No, really, stifle the \"hey kids, get off my lawn\" deep inside and hipster up. This is an awesome live music venue). \n\nTake it from this old man, The Valley Bar is both super cool and awesome.
