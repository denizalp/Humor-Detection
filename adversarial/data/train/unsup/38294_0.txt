Pretty average restaurant. The price is expensive and the portions will leave you hungry in an hour or two. There is not a lot of vegetarian friendly options on the menu either, really not a whole lot of variety in general. They forgot our deviled eggs so we never got to try those and the waitress seemed like she was rushed. They got our food out to us quickly and did take a small amount off of the bill for forgetting the deviled eggs so that's why I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 3. I don't think I'd go back here or recommend to any friends and family who aren't obsessed with friend chicken.
