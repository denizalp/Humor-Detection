Anyone who has ever bought a mattress knows the drill.After 2 days of visiting different stores,umpteen options (spring,hybrid,gel,latex,memory foam) and hours of research on the internet i found Tuft & Needle online.I read about them and loved the concept.\nAs of now they have two stores one in San Francisco and the other in Phoenix YAY!\n\nNext day Me and my Husband went to the store.We were greeted,given bottles of water and walked into a room (fresh sheets) where we could truly test our mattress.I loved the fact that there was no sales person with us in the room.After sometime Jamie walked in she was friendly and nothing like a salesperson (annoying).\nWe talked about the Mattress and our inhibitions around it.Believe me there were Many.\nShe answered all our questions and we were SOLD.\nThere was no pressure to buy the mattress in the store,the employees do not work on commission i think that is what makes a huge difference in approach.We actually walked out and bought the mattress later ONLINE.\n\nThe Price is unbeatable for the quality and they have a 100 night trial after which they donate the Mattress and give a Full Refund.The Mattress takes about 3 days to ship.I'm still waiting for mine.Will post pictures once it arrives.\nDid I Mention we also got free T&N t-shirts.\n\nCheers!
