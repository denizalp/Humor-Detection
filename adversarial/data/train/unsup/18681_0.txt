Fuck, Fuck, Fuck*  http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=c7GaCNK76DI\n\nThose are the words I tend to use most when I think about the fact that I committed myself to a 3 year contact with these guys and the general \"what the fuckery\" type services that Wind has to offer.\n\nI decided to upgrade from my crappy Samsung Q, to a Samsung 3 (yeah, I know the Samsung Galaxy 4 is out but that's just too much tech for me to handle right now) and I ended up purchasing a \"Lightly Loved\" one for a \"bargain\" at $299, fair enough, but the fact that Wind split that payment and tacked $149 of that price on to my existing Wind account balance and then to add insult to injury Wind has the nerve to tell me that my outgoing texts and calls will be suspended because of that owing balance...oh and thanks for offering the option to pay off this balance with ONLY a credit card btw.\n\nSeriously Wind? It's like you need a good dose of Preparation H after enduring Wind's buggery approach to collections.\n\nAs for Wind's 3 and 4G \"speeds\" it's pretty embarrassingly slow, I'm talking in the league of that awkward guy in the Rogers commercials slooooow. Not impressed Wind, not impressed AT ALL!\n\n*Disclaimer*  In no way do I advocate the use of smokin' blunts\/weed, doing coke and making \"noish,noish, noish\" in front of sketchy convenience\/liquor stores
