Ordered a hazelnut latte and a cranberry scone here while waiting for my table at Coca Cafe down the street. Pretty much nowhere else was opened, so my friend and I stopped here for coffee. Inside is pretty much your standard coffee shop atmosphere: cozy, small tables, brick walls. My latte and scone were good, but I've definitely had better. \n\nTaste | 3\nAtmosphere | 3\nPresentation | 3 \nService | 3.5\nOVERALL | 3
