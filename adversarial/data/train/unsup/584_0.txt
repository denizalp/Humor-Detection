After many times of going here (and then later regretting it due to the surge of burping that goes on and on for the rest of the day), I still don't get it...\n\nI don't get their special ordering process..\nI don't get the whole Mexican\/Asian food mixture 'coolness'..\nI don't get that nasty cookie that leaves a layer of lard on the roof of my mouth..\n\nI just don't get what others see in it...\n\nTheir dishes are decent but there's always something too strong in any one of them that makes them hell for my body to digest (hence the never ending burps).... their black beans are too sweet.. Jade Chicken is too spicy.. Machaca is too salty or overly seasoned... Let's just say I've tried many combinations (yes only because my coworkers seem to find this place highly enjoyable and I go along for the team-spirit.. pfffff... yah) to find something that doesn't have such an effect on me and I'm still not sold.  I do have to say their staff has always been nice and friendly... sadly, that doesn't trump taste in this case.\n\nTheir ordering process is a huge PITA - I usually just tell the girl the 2 or 3 things I want and don't even bother 'learning' their whole 'ordering process' -{cough}stupid{cough}.  Also the layout there is oddddd.... lots of empty space and foldable plastic Rubbermaid tables and chairs makes it seem very 'thrown together'.\n\nSorry, but I'm just not a fan.
