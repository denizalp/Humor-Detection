I couldn't wait to get home and write about what a craptacular experience I had. My sweet Dad purchased through Val-pak a coupon for $29 that entailed a spa pedicure and manicure (a $60 value). the small cramped nail area was filthy and crowded. The lady Tray that did mine and my mother's nails was nice enough, but a complete scatter-brain. My mom had gone into the salon a week before to find out about appointment times and picked up her card. When we called to make the appointment she answered and explained that it was her cell phone and that her appointment book was at work. She then preceded to book us for an appointment when she knew she had time available. The salon, however had no record of these appointments. The pedicure chair (1 of 2) that we were seated in had no massage\/vibration mechanism. I asked Tray where the remote was and she said oh, your chair doesn't have one. What a joke! I asked for an acrylic fill instead of the spa manicure since i have acrylic nails. She proceeded to give me one the shittiest fills I have ever received, sloppy, misshaped, uneven, etc. My pedicure went much the same, sloppy, super thick top coat that made it lumpy and gross looking. I'm actually going to try to contact val-pak because after all the confusion and horrible service, she had the nerve to charge me an extra $10 for my fill. My mom asked if she gave me a manicure since that was what the coupon was good for, and she admitted she didn't yet still insisted on $10 more. I used to think of val-pak and groupon as a nice way for a business to lure in new clients yet I think this place needs the money seriously because there is no way anyone would come back here. If I could give this place ZERO stars I would!
