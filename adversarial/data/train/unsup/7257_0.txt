Horrible, horrible service. They do the bare minimum and no more. I don't know anything about cars so I don't think it's asking much to have them check if my car needs maintenance or replacements. \n\nMy center console (touch screen for A\/C, GPS, etc.) isn't working and they told me they would need to replace the whole thing, averaging $5,000, because they don't know how to fix it. My boyfriend luckily came with me and asked if it was covered under my warranty. The service guy finally mentioned my warranty was about to expire in 50 more miles. If my boyfriend hadn't come along, the service guy wouldn't have checked whether I had warranty to get it replaced and I would've been out $5,000. I wouldn't have known what questions to ask without my boyfriend. \n\nLadies, NEVER come here without someone who knows about cars because these people WILL take advantage of you. The guy didn't even seem apologetic. It's basic courtesy to mention, \"Hey, you're warranty is about to expire. Let's get everything fixed while you're still covered.\" Come on Toyota, I thought you were better than this.
