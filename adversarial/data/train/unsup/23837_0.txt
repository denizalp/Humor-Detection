Good service! My uncle bought a Tarmac Pro SL from here.\n\nI went in to check out a Serfas bike case, when i called in they were charging $40 above retail.......they told me they would match the price. So i walk in, tried to purchase a bike pump.........$5 more than the place down the road i had just come from. Decided to price check once more, Park Tools 15mm pedal wrench.....same one i bought in SF for $10. Down the road it was $11.50, this place...........$15! Twice a couple bucks, fux.\n\nThey must deal with a lot of yuppies or something.
