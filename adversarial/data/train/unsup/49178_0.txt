I'm normally not a fan of buffets because of the mediocre food they have but after hearing that this place had good food, I had to check it out.  We decided to go on a non peak day (Thursday) and the wait time in line was about 15 minutes.  \n\nThey have several different section to their buffet.  They have a pasta\/salad section which had a nice assortment of cheeses, meats, and vegetables.  They had Caesar salad with Parmesan chips, they also had different soups.  The next station is a carving station with turkey, brisket, and flank steak.  They even had mini burger sliders.  The burger sliders were a bit undercooked by my standards but still safe to eat.  Could have used some seasonings.  They had a shrimp table, a Chinese\/ Japanese section and a dessert section with about 20 different mini desserts.\n\nI have to say that out of all buffets, this one takes the mark.
