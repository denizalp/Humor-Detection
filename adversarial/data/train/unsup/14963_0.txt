Was loafing around the strip the thursday before bachelor weekend and i rolled thru the Mandarin Oriental...\n\nI don' t know what i came across when i went down to the 1st floor lobby.. The whole front lookd like a scene out of the matrix.. Crazee peaceful and quiet, and jus a few Mr. Smiths and Neos walking around..\n\nI honestly didn't know where I was..  The 1st floor lobby is actually a staircase below the strip and u feel like u are totally somewhere else..\n\nWent in thru the front and saw a lobby that wasn't quite a lobby.. haha.. (Didn't know that the 23rd floor sky lobby is where u check in).. Crazeee... Took the elevator and rolled thru the \"actual\" lobby.. Whoaaahh..\n\nWas speechless.... Definitely another level of hotel... Took a seat at the Tea Lounge and got drinks, and jus chilled by the window overlookin the strip..\n\nThe architecture and interior design of this hotel is quite sexy and I am definitely looking to actually stayin here...
