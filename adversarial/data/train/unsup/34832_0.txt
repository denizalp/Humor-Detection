On June 6th 2012  I showed up at Ulta store #100 in Las Vegas for a previously scheduled salon service. Mine was the last appointment of the day, and the only appointment I could fit in a busy, 2 conventions in a row stint in Las Vegas. It turns out I had booked the service alright, but at a different ULTA location on the opposite side of town! The stylist on duty that evening, Chrystal H., understood my situation (possibly by the horrified look on my face) and came to the rescue, accommodating me as her last, unscheduled appointment of the day. She went well beyond her call of duty that day, giving me a wonderful hairstyle and even managing to restore a smile on my face after such a harrowing day. I will book Chrystal H. (at the correct Ulta salon this time, wink wink!) each and every time I'll find myself in Las Vegas on business. She is a great stylist and a charming addition to Ulta's great staff. Thank you, Chrystal H. I will be back!
