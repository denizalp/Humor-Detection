As much as I love the glitz and the glam and the pampering of the 5 star studs on the Vegas strip at the end of the day I am just as equally, if not more equally, a beer and hot dog girl as I am steak and wine.  And when the sun sets if I have my druthers you will find my happy ass in a dive bar drinking Irish whiskey on the rocks and listening to some metal band shredding on their guitar.\n\nAt Double Down Saloon that bar stool may be covered in some unidentifiable sticky substance but that's okay.  This is my FAVORITE BAR IN  LAS VEGAS.  #1.  Numero Uno.  First Place.  The Winner.\n\nWhen your cab driver pulls you up to the Double Down don't fret thinking that you've arrived at some seedy strip club just because you see the blinking bulb lights and strip shopping center.   No, you won't get raped in the parking lot.  Double Down is just a good ole' classy dive bar.\n\nEven though Double Down books some fab local and regional rock bands they never charge a cover.  Inside the interior is dark, smoky (only major downside is that it is legal to smoke inside in Vegas and the circulation is poor in here) and stuffed with people.  Locals go here, and when I say locals I mean the tatted up crowd, the misfits, the Bettie Page look-a-like ladies.  Double Down Saloon invented the bacon martini and their signature drink known simply as \"Ass-Juice\".  They keep the ass juice in an empty plastic milk carton.  It is deep purple in color and sweet tasting.  They can't tell you what's in it because they would have to kill you so don't ask.\n\nLike all dive bars you have the staples like a worn out photo booth and jukebox filled to the brim with amazing music, and of course being Vegas you also have video slot machines.  \n\nMy next trip to Vegas will involve a show at The Joint at the Hard Rock which is located just a couple of blocks away, so I can be sure to visit Double Down again.  What a great combination that will be.
