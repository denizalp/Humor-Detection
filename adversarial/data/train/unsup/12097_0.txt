I must say, we didn't really expect much going into this little restaurant. It was an early Saturday night and aside from one full table and a few people at the bar, no one else was dining there.  \n\nMejico is in an area that's primarily residential and features a nice backyard patio area that's fenced in. Service was good and prices were reasonable for the amount of food that we received.\n\nI don't like fish, so I opted for a carne asada and pollo taco combination with rice and beans. They were out of refried beans, so I decided on some pinto beans as an alternative. The rice, in particular, was excellent. The tacos had a good amount of flavor to them. My girlfriend ordered the enchiladas de pollo, which also had great flavor. I've also had their enchilladas de res, which did not disappoint.  \n\nOffering up the big \"Medio Litro\" Mexican cokes, some good quality chips and salsa, as well as some flan desert that actually impressed someone who isn't really a flan fan, and you really don't have much to complain about. The only exception would be the pinto beans. The first time, we received a cup of beans, while the second time, it felt more along the lines of eating bean soup.\n\nWe'll return to sample some of their other menu offerings very soon before giving it a full five star bump. But I definitely recommend paying them a visit!
