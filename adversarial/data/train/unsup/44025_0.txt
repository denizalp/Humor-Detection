Every visit results in a happy stomach.  There are a numerous amount of selection choices on the menu, the wait staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is relaxing and enjoyable.  We like that you can substitute any \"burger\" on the menu for a black bean burger; being that we are vegetarian.  Who else thinks of everyone on their menu? Aren't you hungry now!?
