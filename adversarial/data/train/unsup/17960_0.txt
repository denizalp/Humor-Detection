Holy AUTHENTIC!!!!! I've been meaning to check this place out since they opened and I finally had the chance to today..  I literally just put my fork down and had to come on here to write this review.. \n\nGuys! The food is amazing! I ordered the cheese enchilada plate with green sauce, rice and refried beans and it did not disappoint. I know what you're thinking \"cheese enchiladas, really?\" YES REALLY! These aren't just any cheese enchiladas, I'm pretty sure God himself morphed into the chef to create the recipe. The green sauce is full of flavor, but at the same time not too spicy... There is just enough kick, happy-medium if you will. It's not the spice level that is guaranteed to leave you running to the nearest restroom, shrieking in pain, whilst you clench your butthole in preparation of the impending fiery abyss that is sure to erupt at any given moment.... No sir (ma'am, or whatever you identify as I'm not here to judge) that will not happen. So don't get your hopes up if your cure-all for constipation is overly-spicy food. \n\n\nAnd the beans! Oh my GOD the beans! They do not serve you the run of the mill everyday refried beans. These refried beans are majestic, something from a fairytale or better yet a unicorns mouth! Seriously, they are like something I've never had before. They danced their way into my belly like a party in my mouth. I'm not much of a rice person, but theirs is definitely edible. I typically don't eat Mexican rice but I shoveled at least four mouthfuls down. \n\nOh, and the service is great too! Sure, it's not the trendy style restaurants that millennials thrive on, but who cares?! The restaurant is family owned, the staff is extremely friendly and the food is amazing! I can't wait until I'm hungry again to go back. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food, that is sure to make you craving more. \n\n\nGO.CHECK.IT.OUT! You will not be disappointed.
