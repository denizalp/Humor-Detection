I am now a doctor! not! This place has a nice well lit parking lot with the inside appearing to have been updated not too long ago. The king sized bed we had was super firm, as I have come to expect from all hotels, but the pillows were actually of a good quality and actually felt great to lay your head on. There was a huge big screen tv and all the towels, soaps, etc were nicely laid out. The breakfast that was offered was really well done for the most part. They had bacon, eggs, turkey sausage, bagels, buiscuit and on and on. The only thing I will say is that although the pancake machine is neat it makes terrible pancakes. I really would like to give this place 3.5 stars but I will stick with 4 because the breakfast was really nice. The issues I had was the entire place smelled musty, Maybe because there is an indoor pool, but regardless the smell wasn't all that pleasant. Although the bathroom was clean and looked nice the toilet itself was kind of janky. The toilet just wouldnt flush right.Then there is the price. For $80 it wasn't bad its just not the best deal in my opinion.
