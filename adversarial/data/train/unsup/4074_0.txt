I really don't think any of the Apple stores are great because usually the \"geniuses\" have no freakin' idea what they're talking about.\n\nI came here because my battery showed the status of \"service battery\" and I explained to them it's weird because I just replaced my battery on Nov 28 2012 which is about 1.5 years ago. The \"genius\" corrected me saying it's not even a year. WTF. If you can't do simple MATH how the hell can you tell me how to fix my dang battery problems?!\n\nAnyway, I asked the dude to reset my battery notification thingie. I've read stuff that Mavericks OS causes some funky battery readings and I'll just go with that. \"Not even a year\" my foot. PFFFTTT\n\n2 stars cuz there's garage parking and I don't have to worry about my stuff melting in the sun.
