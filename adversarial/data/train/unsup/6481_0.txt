My husband LOVES coffee.  He has planned vacations to places like Bali & Jamaica just so he could get specific roasts.  When we go on long trips, he packs his own  beans, grinders, & even coffee maker.  He is a bit ridiculous.  But, he knows what he likes. \n\nWhenever we move to a new town, finding a good, local coffee roaster is always top priority.  With so many amazing Yelp reviews, we just had to check out Desert Wind.  \n\nOver the course of the year, we've gotten to know Jon & he's gotten to know my husband's taste.  Jon makes great recommendations & we like how he roasts small batches of beans at a time.  So the coffee always tastes fresh. \n\nWe mostly go there for whole beans & make coffee at home.  But, if you are looking for a place to have coffee & hang out with your friends, there are plenty of tables & chairs and the baristas can make a mean cup of whatever you want.  Check them out!
