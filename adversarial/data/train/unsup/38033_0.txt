Good place to kill some time before your flight - however this is my first United Club experience and I'm not sure I would pay a membership fee for this.\n\nThe staff was friendly and nice - no complaints. The food\/snacks however is very limited. Some cheese and crackers, snack mix, bananas, mushy apples, and stale cookies. House shelf drinks were free - premium liquors are an extra charge.\n\nThe space was clean and the view was nice - you can see the LV strip in the distance. Overall though the club was smaller than I thought. The chairs by the bar were hard and uncomfortable. The couches were comfy though. Also plenty of outlets to charge your laptop\/phones and the wifi was good. \n \nAgain if you have a free pass to use from your credit card - not a bad place to kill time. But if I had to pay hundreds on a yearly membership fee - not worth it in my opinion.
