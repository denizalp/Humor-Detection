First time visitor with my college student who likes anything astronomy. Went to both planetarium shows. Very informative and entertaining. $5 each show. We really liked the extensive gem displays, the mastodon exhibit, the plant displays downstairs, the huge collection of \"dead\" animals, and the evolution area. A special treat were the live animals outside. The otters were neat, the turkey friendly, the owls a hoot. We should have spent more time outside if we knew there were so many animals to see. The gift shop has a lot of cool things, too. We surprised ourselves and had a great time--four hours!
