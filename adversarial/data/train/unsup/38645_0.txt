This is my go to Chinese place in Charlotte. The night I moved here I went with my parents, my mom is really picky about Chinese, and raved about it for a week after. I went again a few weeks later and ordered something different and again everything was amazing! Their hours are a little weird so make sure you look them up before heading over. My fav is the black pepper chicken. The chicken is perfectly cooked, seared not boiled like most Chinese and the veggies are perfectly tender with just the right amount if bite.
