My absolute new favorite place to go.  This is even better than Rachel's Kitchen (sorry - I still adore you).  Ingredients are clearly fresh and there is even a bit of love put into the sandwiches.\n\nBig thumbs up for the calorie counts and online ordering.\n\nI first thought this was a national chain as their branding and menu is spot on.  Wouldn't surprise me at all if Greens and Proteins takes over the world!
