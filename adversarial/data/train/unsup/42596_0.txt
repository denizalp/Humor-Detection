Went on for dinner at 9 pm last nite with a party of 5. We were accomadate very quickly within the packed restaraunt. Service was prompt and efficient. 3 of our party ordered the scallops wich were cooked perfectly and delicious. One chicken breast and one filet. 5 out of 5 were perfect . We happened to sit next to one of their local farmers who told us how Honey Salt supports her local farm 100%.\nNice to support a 5 star restaraunt that certainly goes the extra mile. Will be back,
