I'm not really sure what just happened to me.  I just ate a bunch of flash-frozen meat that was white, curled, and stiff.  I put it in a bowl and mashed it with a napkin, put some even less fresh looking veggies on it, and handed it to an angry mexican who proceeded to cook it on something that looked like the urinals in Sun Devil Stadium.  I didn't like preparing my own food for this price, I don't like that they KNOW the meat shrinks but won't give you a decent sized bowl to put enough in it - although...with as nasty as the meat tasted, why would you want any more of it?  I might go back here and just do noodles and sauce.  The noodles were the only thing that seemed safe to eat and the sauce (you make your own) was the only thing redeeming about this place.  I was definitely missing the Wendy's that used to be in this spot.
