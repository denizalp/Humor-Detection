We must have gotten very lucky with our picks (10+) because we did not try a single item that was not delicious. We shared sticky bun tacos, monte cristo, short ribs, smokey poke, dragon claws, paella, gai satay, cock-a-waffle-doo, korean bbq wings, and nutty popeye. My favorite by far was the paella, followed by the korean bbq wings. It was BYOB so we shared two bottles of wine as well. The staff was very gracious and accommodating despite the craziness of having several large parties to deal with. I am not thrilled with the aesthetics of the restaurant and the open kitchen concept, but to each their own. The restaurant did appear clean which is much more important to me. Although this is a great start, I hope the best is yet to come for this little restaurant as they perfect their recipes and bring in the swig.
