Pulled. Pork. Poutine.\n\nSomeone back in the kitchen could be curing cancer, but I'm glad their brilliance is focused on food, because this shit is actually one of the best ideas ever. With a touch more of the tangy BBQ sauce, it might even be the best food of all time, but I think at this point it's going to have to settle for being just ONE of the tastiest treats I've ever tasted.\n\nThe crazy thing about Vices et Versa is that even if they didn't have pulled pork poutine on the menu it would still be an incredible bar, first and foremost because they have beers for DAYS. There are 33 on the tap list (that apparently rotates pretty frequently), and they are all locally brewed and judging by the four or five I was able to taste, all delicious. I guess I'm not well-versed enough in Quebec microbreweries to recall all of them, but I did have one brew called the Peche Mortal (mortal sin) that was dangerously tasty. \n\nAnd there was some kind of fiddle party going on in the back room.\n\nI'm moving to Montreal.
