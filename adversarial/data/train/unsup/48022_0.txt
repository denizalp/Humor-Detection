Got a small caramel toffee mocha and a red velvet cupcake. Also tried a bit of my friend's strawberry scone (she got the same flavour drink). The coffee was really good and smooth - not over roasted or too strong\/weak and had a really nice sweet toffee flavour. The cupcake was a little more thick and cold than I prefer (I like my cake more fluffy\/airy and room temperature) but was really good and not too sugary. The scone was definitely better, though.\nThe only problem was that the coffees did take a long time to come out and it wasn't that busy, but there was only one barista and I didn't pay attention to the line length. Seems like a great neighbourhood spot, though.\nThere was a live guitar player at the time which was kind of neat but strange on a Saturday morning.
