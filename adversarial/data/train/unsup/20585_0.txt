Im not a huge burger guy but during the last blizzard my daughter and I decided to stop and have lunch and take a break from the parking lot on I-90.  Place reminds me 5 Guys.  The Ohio, local thing has been beaten to death and I want to strangle myself though.  If stuff is coming from such a local place why does it cost more?  Guess its makes yuppies feel good.  We had a burger, sweet potato fries and mint chocolate kids shake.  All were awesome and came out fairly quick.  Big chalkboard wall thingy for kids to draw on.  We don't drink sodas but if that's your thing you can show your American gluttonous side and drink from the unlimited troth of sodas.  Don't know why people hating on this place.  Its fast, can be healthier (if you choose) and kid friendly.  Go have a 12 dollar bowl of lunch pho or some 9.00 Heady Topper battered cheese curds and leave the burgers and shakes to me then...
