We came for the open mic night and had a great time. The owners are awesome, definitely a place I would like to become a regular at.\n\nThey have a 42 seat theater in the back completely sound proofed from the rest of the bar. The atmosphere is awesome and even though it's only been open for a little bit, they have a ton of potential!\n\nComing back tomorrow for the comedy open mic :) \nHighly recommend
