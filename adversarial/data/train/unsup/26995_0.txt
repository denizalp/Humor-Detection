My mother and I both enjoyed the turkey avocado sandwich with chips.  The bread was good, ingredients were fresh and it was filling.  I ordered apple cinnamon bread pudding and my mother chose a brownie.  We both thought our desserts were delicious and had a difficult time choosing a dessert because of the variety available.  I also ordered a decorated sugar cookie and a cinnamon roll to take to my son.  In addition to the large offering of soups, salads, sandwiches & desserts, there's a little shopping area with some cute choices.  I'd also like to mention the young man at the register.  He was extremely polite and knowledgeable and made small talk.  He attended the same university my son is at so as common Wildcat fans we had something to talk about.  He is an asset to this location.
