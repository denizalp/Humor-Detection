I've been going to Chapalas since I was 9 years old. That was 25 years ago. I still love it.... a LOT. Even when I was in high school, I would sometimes frequent this place twice a day. While that may seem a little excessive, you have to understand, this place was part of my childhood. And the best part... in 25 years, NOTHING has changed. Same recipes, same taste... I think I just talked myself into going... see ya there!! lol
