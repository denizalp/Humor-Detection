Save a horse ride a cowboy or a mechanical bull! This place was fun and surprisingly busy at 7pm! The food was really good and there was ALOT...I think the best part of my experience was our waitress I got there late so I didn't catch her name...either way she was really on her A game there were a few hiccups but she was resilient and bounced back! She handled her self well and was polite even when I knew she was overwhelmed by the table of 13 or so! I had the jalapeno mac and cheese and onion rings I felt the mac and cheese was a little bit salty and not spicy enough for me personally the onion rings were really good but a few of them are a little soggy in the middle but they were huge onion rings so that wasn't that big of a problem consider the size! I also ordered a a Mai Tai and for the cost\/size they definitely could have added an extra shot or two...which was the what the others where saying too...so if your gonna order a drink ask for a double cuz they a little stingy with the liquor...LOL
