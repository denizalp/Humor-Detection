The \"sushi chefs\" are cackling, blond inexperienced chefs. Despite that, the sushi is decent. The sashimi is pathetic. And the nigiri is pitiful.\nThe drinks are also decent. The decor is what you would expect for a higher-class Scottsdale establishment. But this is yet another place where you need to have a drink or two, be seen, then go elsewhere for the food.\n\nOne star for the adequate pour on the drinks we ordered.
