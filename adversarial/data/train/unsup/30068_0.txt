I usually don't like these places where you have to pick what you want on your meal like Chipotle, but it's worth it here. I had a standard Gyros which was very good with fresh ingredients and very tasty. My wife had a greek salad which was very good as well. It's a little slow and uneven at the counter but the servers are friendly and the owner was there serving as well. Give it a shot when in the area.
