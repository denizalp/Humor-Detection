I was in town for a fight and looking for a place to train.  Outstanding staff that made us feel welcome.  I went to the MMA class, and it was excellent.  Felt like I was part of the family the entire time and had a great and intense  class.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for some great training in a amazing atmosphere.  Thanks!
