Definitely my place to go to satisfy a burger craving. I usually get combo #1: Freshburger with all the fixings (4 oz beef patty, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and Freshburger sauce), drink, and upgrading the fries to a Poutine (which is fries covered with cheese curds and gravy) or California Fries (which is fries covered with sweet sauteed onions, cheese, and secret sauce). California fries are not featured on the menu but highly recommend it. They recently expanded so there is more seating, but still relatively small. Expect a bit of a wait during prime times.
