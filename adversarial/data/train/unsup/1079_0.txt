A dead bar should have drink specials. At one point we were 2 of only 10 paying customers present. Paid $41 for 2 beers and 2 stingy pours of a house wine. I'd say that's on the pricey side, being 10 miles from the Strip and all.\n\nOne could argue, well \"Maybe they're a high-end bar?\" Well, what high-end bartender with fewer than 10 customers forgets what you ordered when you ask for another round less than 30 minutes later? This one. She forgot. We had to tell her. This almost never happens in Vegas, where the service industry pros typically outperform.\n\nNeedless to say, it being a 'cigar bar', we could smell La Casa from 500+ feet away. Those who weren't smoking cigars were smoking cigarettes. So, if you are disenchanted by tobacco smoke (like most folks), steer clear from here :)\n\nWent only because some friends of friends were going. Bad call - should've known.
