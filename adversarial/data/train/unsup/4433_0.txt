You can never go wrong at Guarinos! This place reminds me of an old Italian Sunday family dinner, with authentic decor!! Everything on the menu is old classic recipes that taste home made. The chicken parm and eggplant roll ups are the tops. It's such a nice classy place, we even had our rehearsal dinner here for our wedding! The owners take care of you from the minute you step in! A must go in little Italy!
