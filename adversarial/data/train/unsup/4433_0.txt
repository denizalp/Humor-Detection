My wife and I were out to dinner trying to celebrate our Anniversary. Things were going well until I found a long black hair in my potatoes...gross.\n\nI get that things happens, but I think the problem was that the manager seemed put out by the fact that I asked her to take my plate away. I had only had one or two of the ribs on the rack and they didn't replace the plate...I assumed they'd at least take the rib dinner off the bill being that they threw majority of it in the trash. Instead I get a $5 discount with an uber tacky memo reading \"hair in pot\"...I'll go to outback next time.\n\nWe've been to Texas Roadhouse many times and never had this kind of service...it was our first and last time at this location however.
