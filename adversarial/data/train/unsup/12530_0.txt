No idea why this place get so many good reviews for the quality of food and service.\n\nPro:\nFirst of all I frequent this place a lot but only because of convenience (Very close to work) and needing to eat something quickly. \n\nCons:\n- Pricey for barely average food and you cant really customized your order. One time i ordered for 2 eggs and 4 pieces of small bacon strips that came up burnt for $6.00. I mean rly? If anything make sure the bacons you serve aren't burnt. I stopped ordering bacons since then.\n\n- Food is inconsistence. About 60% chances, I would get the baked potato barely cook or the quantity of meat\/other substitutes varied sometime fair and somewhat reasonable other not reasonable for the cost you paid.\n\n- I agree with review above the owner of this business need to learn how to service people. First of all I don't care about your personal woes or whatever the hell you think is important. I'm here to order food, paid for it and leave. If I don't respond to your \"conversation\" by giving you subtle cue to not encouraged conversation, stopped doing the same thing over and over. It's incredibly annoying and honestly in some cases unprofessional depending on the subject of the conversation. I saw the cook looked unhappy whenever I was there. I'm sure there is other reason why he is unhappy but I think partially because the owner doesn't know how to shut up.\n\n- No joke one time i saw the owner pick on his ear, lick the same finger while counting some cash. Disgusting.  It's why i hate it when they grab utensils for me. No thanks let me get it myself.\n\n- When one of your employees make mistakes with customer order, an apology would be nice. Not much for common sense???\n\nIf you actually have time and convenient isn't a factor, go somewhere else. You will get better food with similar price going to fast food place than this place.
