This place is expensive and overrated.  Where do people get off with 5 stars?  The container park theme is awful.  Looks llke downtown LA.  Complete with a screaming crazy street person out in front.  The grounds look dirty and cheap.  \n\nPrices were outrageous for what you got.  Will never go back there again.  Had some crab louie salad.  So they cut an avocado in 2, slop a brown looking ball of god knows what into the pit area, and set it on top of some butter leaf lettuce.  Easily the worst I have ever seen in this type of fare.  My little friend got who knows what, but even she was put off by the food.  It looked bad from my side of the table.  \n\nMaybe this is the best you can do downtown, but I can get excellent, and tasty, dinner entrees at places like the Venetian for about the same money.  Better ambiance too.  I don't give a crap if it is supposed to be a cool hipster dive.  It was an awful experience and the food was downright repulsive.
