My visit was so fast! It took me more time to drive here than wait\/get inspected. I hopped on over per DMV guidance. (I didn't realize you could check wait times online.) Although there were only two lanes open my entire visit clocked in at 5 minutes.\n\nNo joke!\nThe employees are on top of their game and super pleasant. $20 bucks for cars. Checks are accepted (provided your name and address match state identification).\n\nWhen you pull into the testing area have everything unplugged. Leave the keys in and the car running. Hop out of the car. You probably won't even have time to check Facebook. Have payment ready. (Don't be that fool fumbling around!)\n\nI pulled into the \"Full Service Lane\" all vehicles inspected (the only open options). The \"Express Lane\" is for 1996 and newer cars. (Pay attention! The staff pulled cars out of the general line while I was there.)\n\nThe website for all things DMV is www.servicearizona.com\nADEQ Emission waiting times are here http:\/\/www.myazcar.com\/
