This is the best delivery pizza I've ever had. I ordered online through them, an XL pizza with half covered in tomatoes and half covered in bacon and pepperoni with extra sauce. When I added a fountain soda to the order they gave me the option to get breadsticks for free and I opted to get cheesy ones for an extra $2 (yeah, they got me with that). The crust is not remarkable but I love their pizza sauce. It is very sweet which might not hit everyone the right way. The ingredients they use are really good, my friend who was eating the meaty side said that it was the best pepperoni he'd ever had. The pieces are cut really well too, I'm not a vegetarian but I appreciated that I didn't have to worry about any random peps or bacon pieces on my half. The breadsticks were delicious too, the only thing is that it only has cheese on top in the middle and is cut in half lengthwise and into a bunch of slices perpendicular to that so that there are 4 non cheesy slices on the ends. I was OK with this because I love any kind of white bread that is crunchy so they were very good to me. They gave us two ranch dipping cups with the pizza and we got a marinara one which my friend liked. Getting a 32oz fountain soda was much cheaper than getting something bottled, but it did come with a ton of ice in the cup. If you're looking for quality delivery pizza, definitely get some pizza from pizza care.
