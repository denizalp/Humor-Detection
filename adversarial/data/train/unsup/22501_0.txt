As a daytime attraction, Old Town Scottsdale is comparable to all of the other tourist traps I have visited in North America. \n\nAs soon as I spotted the Del Sol store, the bellwether for all things touristy, I knew what I was in for; store after store filled with western themed crappity crap. Do I need a t-shirt that says \"My Indian name is Runs With Beers\", umm, not so much. \n\nThere is the odd store that does have some better quality goods and there is a certain charm to the obvious theme so I think Old Town is worth visiting once so you can say \"been there, done that\".
