Would give a zero if possible because I received zero service from them. I arrived with very little patrons before myself, waited 30 minutes without even being acknowledged, and watched as people just walking in were getting ahead of me. Worst shop I have ever been to and will not return. If you accept appointments, great, seems logical. You do NOT have an online appointment system that lets us know when we can walk in, you do NOT have a sign in sheet to keep track of patrons walking in and you do NOT have a barber available specifically for walk-ins. Horrible.
