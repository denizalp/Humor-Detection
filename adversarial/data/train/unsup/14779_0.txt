Taco Tuesday\n\nMy friend girl & I stopped by for tacos and of course their irresistible hip-hop latte art!\n\n(5) Tacos\n-The coconut shrimp \"taco of the week\" was decent; no exceptional flavors to rave about.\n-Baja Fish Taco $4.25 was okay; breading a bit excessive though\n-Carnitas Taco $3.85 The jack fruit was pretty bland but the guac was great. \nMy best-friend really enjoyed her carnivore tacos.\n\n(2) Horchata Lattes- I legit enjoyed every sip of my Drizzy lyrics! I could drink these all day long just because. \n(1) Chocolate & Coconut Churro $7- No Bueno! \n(1) Caramel Churro $5 (+1.50 for ice cream) Definitely recommend with the ice cream if your about that sugar life!\n\n$45+ Tip that added up real quick! Unsure if I'll be back for tacos but I'm certain I'll return for a creative latte YOLO!!
