Cool atmosphere- great selection.  One of my go to spots to grab dinner\/drinks with friends.  They always have a huge beer selection and a nice side patio if it good weather.  The menu has a variety of options for everyone\/all dietary needs.  I usually grab a few tapas but if you are looking for a sandwich I recommend the Mushroom.  It is a portabella grilled with balsamic and a GENEROUS portion of mozzarella cheese (parm fries are a must as the side- loaded with garlic and delicious!).  I usually go the tapas route and grab a few sides\/small plates.  Hard to go wrong but the Pesto Brussels sprouts are always a must order!
