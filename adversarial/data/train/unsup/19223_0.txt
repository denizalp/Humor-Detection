Prices are high and when I went in there I was given dangerous information that no gun shop should give out. I was told to only use fmj in my carry gun because a jury would think of me a a killer if I was ever in a shooting. I was also told that adding night sights to my gun could be used against me. High prices are one thing, but bad information is dangerous. I will stick to other gun stores in the area.
