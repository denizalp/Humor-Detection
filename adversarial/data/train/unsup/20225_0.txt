Oh what a ... show. \n\nBefore you go, know that: This will be a stressful experience. You will wait. You will encounter humans behaving on a less-than-civilized level (this is a BUFFET afterall). You will stuff your face well beyond gluttony. You will see the worst and best of humanity. But just keep this in mind: This is not real life, this is a one-time experience. \n\nThe food is good, you can eat yourself around the world, but save room for the endless crab legs. \n\nI'm glad I went, but I'm even more glad it's over :)
