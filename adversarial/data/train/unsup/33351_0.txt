Was here march 28 2017 for 2 nights for my wedding- it was wonderful! The staff was so friendly!!!! The suite was magnificent!!! The inside pool is very nice and perfect temp. - I had a very romantic time with my husband! It really is a hidden gem- the room was nicer than the room I had at Mandalay Bay but at a better price-\nOf course with Mandalay you get access to the wave pool though.
