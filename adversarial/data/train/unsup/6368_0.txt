Face it - modern life can be lonely. And Phoenix can feel like an odd, random place to have landed when you are 58 years old, as I am - how, precisely, did I wind up on the searing desert, and how did it happen to all of these other people who I see sweating on the street? \n\nAt Lux, however, the existential depression shuts off, and its polar opposite flips on - how delightful that we've all come together into this cool, noisy, crowded, friendly, interesting space to have some coffee! If life is indeed random, let's all be randomly happy together! \n\nI have written parts of two books here, and the energy of Lux is on every page - it's a good place to do the difficult business of writing readable prose.\n\nAnd no one here is a \"hipster,\" a word that does the world absolutely no good. They are young, for the most part, and enjoying being with their friends in the wonderful, intense, lovely way young people have since the dawn of humanity, and they are doing it a nice place in the middle of an awful, hot, barren desert, because young people are great and resilient and clever and wonderful. Old people are too, for that matter. \n\nThe whole place, the whole thing, is a testimony to just how fantastic people are, from the people who built this place to the people who come here to the people who smile as they hand over your coffee and ask about your day. Relax, smile, enjoy - it's a little easier at Lux, and when you leave, maybe you'll find it easier to do these things elsewhere.
