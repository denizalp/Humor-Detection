I came here drunk lol I spent , like, $200. Typical girly clothing store that follows current trends. Big, clean space. Warning- you get what you pay for. Clothes are cheap, so material is cheap. *Shrinks easily, so hang to dry.* The employees don't ask if you're doing alright or offer to help you find something in particular, which I actually love. When I shop, I really like to be left alone. The dressing room, especially drunk Af, was appreciated. Since I got to sit as I changed hahahahah  I know The old name for this clothing store was Q-Mode which had an OPEN dressing room with mirrors from every angle. I prefer not seeing boobs and a$s of all shapes and sizes, or people seeing mine lol The guy at the register was sociable only when I asked him casually \" do I look drunk \" . We laughed. I paid. I left.
