Don't be fooled.\nThe burrito is NOT $4.25 as it says on the posted menu, it is $6.00....the jr. burrito is $4.25, not the regular one. And its not a very large.\nI can't imagine how tiny the jr. burrito is....probably more like an egg roll.\n\nMariana's, the Hispanic grocery store, has much better and less expensive burritos at their food counter. \nI won't be returning to Los Tacos.
