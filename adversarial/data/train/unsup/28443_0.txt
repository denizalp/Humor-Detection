I was really looking forward to trying this place out and left feeling very disappointed. I had the Pad Se-Eiw which was very bland. I had to drench it in soy sauce and seasoning for it to have any flavor. My friend has the Kimow and said he liked it, but not spicy as listed. I would say go ahead and skip this place as there are many better Thai restaurants in the Valley.
