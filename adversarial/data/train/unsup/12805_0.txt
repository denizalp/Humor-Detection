I love Salud Juicery. I first got to try some samples at one of the yelp events and came back regularly ever since! My favorite is the \"red headed Irish\" to wake me up in the mornings. But I have tried many other juices as well and was never disappointed. I like the story behind their little store in that they try to cleanse the body and mind and that food in its natural state is the best for doing so. I fully agree. \n\nThe store itself can be a bit hard to find as there is no big sign to lead you there. But it's right across the Starbucks on Copeland. Walk up the stairs, you'll see a huge \"open\" sign and walk into a little oasis. The store is small, but stylish and calming. Their selection of juices, smoothies and \"shots\" (non alcoholic of course) is huge. They also serve kombucha and from what I have seen some \"power bowls\" which unfortunately I haven't tried yet. The prices are very reasonable I would say for what you get. Freshest ingredients and a nice atmosphere. \n\nIn addition, they also offer juice cleanses. And even if you're quite spontaneous you'll just have to give them a 24h heads up and you're all set for your new lifestyle! Highly recommend Salud Juicery.
