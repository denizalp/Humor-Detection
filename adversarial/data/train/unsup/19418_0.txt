Horrible service the waitress never came back to check on us the food was cold there were bones in the food. Judy the waitress never refilled our chips and salsa before the food came out the menu was small more like appetizers the a meal and Rick the manager was no help at all with our complaints this was a birthday dinner that turned into a birthday night mare we will never go back to the salted lime in aliante
