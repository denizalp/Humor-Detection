If you love pinball, this is the place to be. It took me back to my childhood. I seriously haven't seen a pinball machine in a decade or longer!! Not only do they have pinball, they also serve coffee and food. I think it's a great concept and a fun place to hang out to do something different for a change. The staff is pretty laid back and friendly too.
