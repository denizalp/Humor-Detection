Me being in a yoga class is like Donald Trump at a feminist rally. It's weird, no one knows how this person got there, and they don't quite fit in.  Thanks to the beautifully kind instructors Brent and Dana I have finally found a safe place to do ...some form...of physical activity.  I really love how friendly everyone is there when you come and go.  Whether you're a newbie like me or a seasoned Yogurt, all classes are tailored (except the super advanced ones) for all peeps. the last few times I've gone, I think Dana and Brent knew I was struggling so would come by and really help me.  Otherwise I was just looking at everyone else like it's the final exam and I haven't studied.\nTheir 49$ first time unlimited month is a fantastic deal for newbies who just want to see what this yogurt thing is all about!  My only critique and it's no biggie, but maybe to have some showers?  I don't know about anyone else but this is exhausting for me!
