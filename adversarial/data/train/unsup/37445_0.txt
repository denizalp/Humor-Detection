By far my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix\/Scottadale. Adorable tiny little neighborhood spot with great food! Have tried the apple pancake, salami and eggs, dutch baby, and sourdough pancakes, all which were amazing. Be prepared for a wait though, this place is packed on the weekends - and if you decide to try the apple pancake or Dutch baby they take about 45 min but are well worth the wait. They are both a little piece of heaven in your mouth. The salami and eggs (and most of their other egg dishes) are also a real treat as they are baked which makes them fluffy and delicious!!! Be sure to give this place a try if you're in the area!!!
