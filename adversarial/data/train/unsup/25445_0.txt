I took my 2 kids for a ride here.  They were nervous so I chose the private tour.  Our guide, Blass, was patient, friendly and knowledgeable.  We saw beautiful wild horses and learned about the local history, plants and animals.  By the end of the ride my kids didn't want to leave.   This was an experience we will remember forever.
