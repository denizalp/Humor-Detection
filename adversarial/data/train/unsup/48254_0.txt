I love his shows but this was the worst,  most expensive experience. Half and hour to get in, half an hour to get appetizers and then another half an hour after appertizers were done to get the rest of the food. Bland, cold and unappetizing food. If you are going to charge $16.50 for 3 small ahi tuna tacos at least put a decent amount of tuna and be sure the tacos are crispy. Also if you are going to charge $38.00 for a drink bowl put a little alcohol in it instead of 52 ounces of ice. Do not waste your time or money. Not worth it at all. My whole family was very disappointed.
