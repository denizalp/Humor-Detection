This place is truly a hidden gem!\n\nIts like a tiny castle filled with delicious treats!\n\nMy mother was in town for a work conference and she stayed at The Golden Nugget. She's not in town very often so I spent the night at the hotel with her for a few days and while we were all curled up in our PJ's surrounded by wedding magazines and bad reality TV shows both of us got a sweets craving.\n\nWe went downstairs and explored the Chocolate Box. Not only did they have a great selection of sweets, but Omid the man working behind the counter was so helpful and courteous!\n\nHe gave us plenty of suggestions and he was very knowledgeable about all the products! Before we knew it he had us laughing and spending away!\n\nGreat experience and great chocolates!\n\nThanks Omid!
