DO:\n-take advantage of their $0.45 Tuesday Wing Deal! ...it's a great way to taste all their sauces without spending too much $.\n-order over the phone and call in 20 minutes before arriving... especially during meal times. \n-be prepared... it gets busy, but service is fast.\n\nDON'T:\n-crowd around the counter while waiting for wings.  It's confusing to people as to whom have paid and whom are simply waiting to pay.  \n-forget that Thursdays are $0.60 boneless chicken wings... but don't say I didn't tell ya... boneless wings aren't that great. \n\nSERVICE: **** [Fast.]\nAMBIANCE: *** [Noisy, unless ordered to-go.]\nFOOD:  *** [decent tasting sauces, some wings can be over fried.]\nPRICE:  [St-deal!] \nOVERALL: ***\/* [3.5 rounded up to four!  ...cuz of their massive TVs, their Tuesday chix wings deal, and cuz it's OPEN 24 hours!]\n\nNuff said.
