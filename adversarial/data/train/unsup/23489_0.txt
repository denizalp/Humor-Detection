We hired this company for memorial service, to honor my mother-in-law's wish to have her ash scatter in the sea. They were very accommodating about our request of location. We had no problem getting them to come to San Leandro Marina. Captain Ken was very helpful and explained to us how to proceed. He even prepared some coffee and cookie for our journey out to the sea, that's very nice. The company also helped prepare necessary paperworks in a timely fashion. Afterwards, Captain Ken also emailed us some photos he took during the trip (nice touch) to add to our memory of that day. Overall, the whole journey was handled very well and run very smoothly. I'm glad we found a great company to help us for such emotional time.
