We tried this place at the suggestion of a friend.  We have been to the Pacific Seafood Buffet also and I like that one a lot more.  They have a larger selection of food and the taste of the food was better.  It just didn't seem like the food here turned over very fast because there were not that many people there.  The sushi was dry and not very tasty and the plates that had the individual slices of tuna, salmon and other fish had plastic wrap on them and made it impossible to get any.  The crab legs were so water logged that I had to dump the water off of my plate.  Just not very good or worth the money.  The service was good and the waitress was on top of everything.  If not for her (Lisa) I would have given this place one star.
