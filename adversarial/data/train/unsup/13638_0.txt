WOW! I don't understand why this place was empty........it was freakin' Amazing!\n\nAfter looking at their menu on-line I was definitely drooling for my Monday Lunch Date, I Didn't know they had a location in Chandler across from the  library which is where I happen to be so I decided to check it out.\n\nMenu Is Huge! Everything Sounded so good it took awhile to make up my mind. \n\nThe one thing I had my heart set on they happen to be out of but I quickly forgot about  it when I ordered the Calypso Chips instead, which are fried green plantains served with a black bean dip (see pics) \nI also ordered a side of Avocado dip to go with them.\n\nFresh and Hot and Oh So Crispy right outta the fryer.........they were fabulous....I've never had them before but am totally addicted now!\n\nI decided for the main entree to get the Emparedado de Pollo (chicken sandwich) and split it with my daughter. It consisted of sliced poached chicken breast on crusty bread with avocado, tomato and cilantro mayo, It came with french fries and Cuban Cabbage salad (see pics)\n\nThey split the portions and you can see in my pic how much 1\/2 was....HUGE!!\n\nFirst of all the bread was straight outta heaven, crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside, (they also serve this hot bread as a loaf with  butter to start with) a juicy chilled chicken breast, that's right it was cold and I LOVED IT!!! \n\nThat cabbage salad was so crunchy and refreshing, laced with lime and cilantro...I'm already craving it again! \nI'm not big on fries but they were also hot crisp and delicious!\n\nI ordered a cup of the Caldo Gallego too, which is a hearty white bean and smoked ham soup with potatoes, turnips and green kale(see pics)...........Absolutely Wonderful....there is nothing like real homemade soup!\n\nThey also have a Take Home menu of Family Dinners....what a great idea!! And they cater and have live music on Friday and Saturday nights!\n\nI highly recommend this place there is something for everyone, even Vegetarians.\n\nI didn't have room for dessert but there at least a dozen delectables on the menu that I fully intend on going back to try!
