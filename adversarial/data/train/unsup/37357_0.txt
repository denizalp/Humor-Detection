This was actually my second time at Floss - I had visited this office way back when I first moved here and didn't have the best experience.  But when my crown fell out a couple of weeks ago, Floss was the closest office to come up and they could see me right away.  So since it had been a couple of years, I decided to give them another try.  I'm very glad I did because this experience was great.  The front desk receptionist was super friendly and helpful and just all-around nice to deal with, as was the dental technician who did most of the work on my mouth.  The dentist, Dr. Tounian, was also very kind and helpful.  I didn't have to wait long either of the two visits I went, and I'm very happy with my new crown.  No complaints at all!  They got me in on the same-day for an emergency visit and they put in the permanent crown within a couple of weeks (which is normal since a permanent crown has to be made off-site).  I'll probably go back again next time I need dental work!
