Mel and Brendan made the whole experience of buying a house and selling our condo a pleasure. My partner and I have both purchased and sold property before, but this was by far the best experience. We were so impressed with their market knowledge not to mention all of the time spent making sure our condo was priced correctly, creating our listing, promotional websites and printed materials. It was no surprise that our condo sold in 9 days! They really are as good as all of the other reviews say.
