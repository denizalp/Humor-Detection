Yes Virginia, real dives bars are still downtown. When I heard that Alan Glazen, of XYZ, ABC, OWGKTA, I was cringing that he was going to change the OSC from what it was (as I imagined it). \n\nFortunately, one of the last remaining dives of downtown appears to be the same as it was before he bought it. hostesses\/bartenders still wear the white dress shirt with tie. \n\nNothing updated in the past 10 years - The dark wood tables, the classic green bankers lamps at each table [I love them], dimmer lighting, and prices from the 1990s. $4 Long Islands. The handful of drafts were all the poorer domestics - Genesse, etc. \n\nI had arrived with my sisters at Thursday, 10:30pm and they still had food cooking. I pastrami on seeded rye, satisfied my hunger, for $6 or 7, a good value, not very fatty either. \n\nLooking for a dive bar downtown, without paying a downtown premium for liquor ? You've found it.
