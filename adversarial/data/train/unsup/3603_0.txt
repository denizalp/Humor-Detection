This place is conveniently located and has two seating options- Teppanyaki tables (order two entree from the teppanyaki menu) and non Teppanyaki tables. I opted for the later and tried the Fried Calamari (hot and crispy) and sushi\/sashimi platter. From the platter, I loved the nigiri california avocado roll and from the sashimi, the Tuna and Salmon was good. However, I totally did not dig the Yellow Tail fish. Ehh!! The shrimp and crab sushi was tasty.\nAn yelp check in gave me a free Tempura fried icecream. Yay! \nAlso the server, Corey was very good and check on us often to see if we were doing Okay.\n\nOverall, a good experience. I will recommend the Teppanyaki if you visit in a group.
