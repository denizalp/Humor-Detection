Terrible.  Feeling ripped off after the owner of the franchise Jasjit Singh, forced me to use a box two sizes too big for what I was shipping, based solely on the declared value and not the size of the objects.  If I had packed it myself he said it would have been different, but since he is not just an employee, but also the owner of this UPS store #4870, he seemed pretty intent on taking advantage of a customer.  Once I took out two very small but somewhat expensive, not fragile objects, he was OK allowing me to use one box smaller for the \"pack & ship guarantee\" but I still wound up having to use a box that was two sizes bigger than needed!  His rationale was that since the contents were deemed \"expensive\" at about $1000, it required not just \"extra\" packing material but \"extra extra\" packing material, for which I would be charged for an even bigger box and more packaging, even though I was already paying extra for the insurance to cover the declared value!!  Unbelievable. When I pointed out the flaw in his logic, all he could do was try to tell me that it would be easier for me to file a claim using the \"pack and ship guarantee\" service and the bigger box and having insurance rather than just having insurance.  Otherwise, that UPS might deny my insurance claim.  This makes NO sense at all and this man appears to be warping UPS policies to work in his favor, monetarily.  We will not be using the services of this store again.
