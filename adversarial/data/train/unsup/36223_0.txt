Terrible! I am a Mexican food aficionado and this was not even worth the price. The service was terrible and they forgot our food only to come back and try and lie about the mistake. The food was thrown together like they just took whatever was available to them that resembled what we ordered. Rice was dry and the beans had little bits of hot dog. Don't waste your time or money!
