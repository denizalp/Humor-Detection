So, absolutely the worst restaurants experience ever.  So I am not talking about the food, we never got to try it.  But the experience was bad enough I will never, ever go back unless it is under different management.\n\nFirst, it was Cinco de Mayo, so we expected it to be busy. So as soon as they opened I called and made reservations.  6:30 sharp.  So we showed up early just because we expected a little delay.\n\nSo when we showed up, we were informed that they would not honor the reservation on CdM.  But, it would only be a half hour.  So we waited.\n\n45 minutes later, we here the wait is an hour.  So just another 15 minutes.  Hahahshaha\n\nSo, 1.5 hours we are told that they felt really bad.  They weren't going to do anything about it, but they felt bad.  \n\nSo now we are past that point of no return.  They come out and tell us they are clearing the table.  10 minutes after that they tell us they 3 tables had paid, but were not leaving. \n\nFinally we get to sit.  We place the first frozen Margarita order.  It is going to be all good.  NOPE!!!!  No more frozen Margaret's.  Too bad.  \n\nSo at this point we just get up and leave.  There was no sorry, no please come back, no have a drink on us.  Just a sorry, we are busy.\n\nSo in case you are wondering, no a manager never came out.  No one apologized, except for the hostess telling us how embarrassed she was.\n\nSo never again.
