I came to Echo Sushi because a good friend of mine insisted on going to an all-you-can-eat restaurant to satisfy his appetite and profuse hunger, and the Mandarin at Yonge and Eglinton was closed.  We ended up at Echo based on his recommendation.  They didn't give me the option to choose from the dinner menu, since the whole table needs to decide on one or the other.  I suppose this makes sense to prevent sharing, but I feel like giving that option to their patrons would make the atmosphere feel more welcome and comfortable.  The service was good, but one of the servers seemed to be confused about specific items and their ingredients.  I think educating the server staff to have a better understanding of the items they are serving would help provide a more enjoyable dining experience.  Overall the food was average, and although it wasn't anything to write home about, I have no complaints.  I enjoyed the short beef ribs and beef teriyaki in particular, and overall had an enjoyable meal.
