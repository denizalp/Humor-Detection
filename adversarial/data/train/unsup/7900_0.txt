I was checking our Snoh's IG and saw a creation that sounded delectable. We hadn't been to this location but I've been to the other one a few times. We had dinner close by and came here for some light dessert. I would always order the same thing and get Thai tea snow with boba and Nutella. I decided to try something new and split the Barney Supremo, which consisted of taro slush, almond pudding (didn't like), honey boba, marshmallows, chocolate sauce and topped with vanilla ice cream. It was put into a cup which made it hard to eat, I thought it would be in a bowl but we managed to figure it out. I think it was the almond pudding that threw me off, I really didn't like it but everything else was okay. I would've changed the snow\/slush flavor and left out the pudding. \n\nNext time we will try the brick toast!
