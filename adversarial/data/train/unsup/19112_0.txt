Oooo me gusta Poliberto's!\n\nAt first, I wasn't sure why the tacos were $2.45 but once I saw how big they were I can say - the price is well justified...like Justin Timberlake.\n\nI ordered four soft tacos: cabeza, lengua, pescado, and carnitas.  The lengua was pretty tasty & juicy, the cabeza was soft and tender, the pescado was almost on par with what I'm used to at Senor Fish back in Los Angeles, but what really got me was the carnitas.  The only way I can accurately describe eating them is, \"Carnitas be crispy like I ain't eva seen!  I ate one of them and I was like WHAAAAAT ARE YOU SERIOUS, POLIBERTO???\"\n\nBest of all, I saved half of each taco for the next day, reheated them and they were STILL GOOD.\n\nWinner, winner, carnitas dinner!
