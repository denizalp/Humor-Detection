After having several of the most popular cleaners (two - on west Sahara near Buffalo & Cimarron) lose belts for tops and horribly stain my husband's dress shirts - making black stains on the collars and what looked like oil spots all over them, seeing the reviews here, I took them to Master Cleaners. (Not a short trip - I live in the Northwest now waaaaay up the 95!) They were able to not only clean the clothes beautifully, but got ALL the stains and rings the other cleaners made and wouldn't get out!! The shirts look brand new now! Add to that the wonderful service this old world family brings - so sweet, kind, and so willing to accommodate...a lost art in business today!! I am willing to drive 30 minutes (with good traffic!) one way to have them clean my clothes. I KNOW they won't ruin them, and I'll get them back looking almost as good as the day I bought them. Please people - give this company your business! They need to it stay in business. Competing against a world of corporate comglomomarts, they are struggling. To find a gem like them with not only GREAT workmanship, but incredible customer service, AND a FAMILY business - we NEED to support them!!!
