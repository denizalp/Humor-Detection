I've been living in Charlotte for 5 years now and the only relatively good buffet we'll have is Tin-Tin's (Can someone tell me why Greensboro has way better buffets than us?)\n\nAnyways, the buffet size isn't gigantic although the interior of the restaurant is rather nice. They do have a huge amount of sushi to offer (which I love and was so ecstatic to see!) Other than sushi, they really need to step on their quality of food. Sure, it isn't disgusting but the crab legs seem old, their soups are too too hot (we had someone burn their hand badly from picking up their bowl).\n\nThe one thing that I could notice easily was the tom-yum soup. If you get tom-yum at a restaurant, you'll see how orangey red it is all around. However, with this, they used an instant tom-yum flavor (the ones you can buy in jars at the Asian supermarket). The red was floating in little dots in cloudy water with no flavor, similar to bad ramen.\n\nI'll be back in a few months and we'll see how much it improves.
