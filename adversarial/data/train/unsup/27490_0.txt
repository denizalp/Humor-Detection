My days of going to Fountain Park extend back 40+ years to when it was known as Municipal Park. The park has gone through a ton of changes over time and its current configuration may be the best. In the early years the park was heavy on baseball fields and not much else. Later a large playground was added along with a BMX track. Most of the BMX course gave way to what are now beautiful synthetic turf football fields. The original baseball field is still there and several soccer fields have been added to the layout. There is also a picnic area in the center of the park with tables and barbeques near the center of the park. These are most easily accessed from the Vegas Drive entrance to the park. The City of Las Vegas has done a great job with keeping Fountain current and user friendly. If you live I the Decatur\/ Vegas Dr. area Fountain park is definitely a cool place to go get your exercise on!!
