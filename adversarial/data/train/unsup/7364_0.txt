I recently bought a body wash from Honest Ed's.  When I got home and used the body wash, it was rancid and smelled like decaying plastic.  Frustrated and POed, I called the customer service hotline on the bottle and found out that the body wash was made back in 2007, it had expired!  The manufacturer's customer service representative was pleasant and understanding, they are mailing me coupons for new body wash.\n\nBuyer beware at Honest Ed's, if the deal looks too good to be true, check the expiry dates.  Quality products are something that is missing at Honest Ed's.
