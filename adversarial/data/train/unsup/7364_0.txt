Making my way again this year! Insomniac does an incredible job with making EDC awesome! Art installations that are incredible, amusement park rides? Yes please.\nFOOD trucks galore to satisfy any tummy.  Smooth entrance to the festival as long as your ticket is legit. \n\nSecurity makes you fell secure and great vibes from the people at the water filling stations! Drinks are over priced of course but that's why pregaming was invented and besides it's a bazillion degrees outside to be wasted and dying! \nThere are plenty of Porto potties to appease your bladder. If you can't find one it's because your already drunk. \nThe crowd is awesome, they still allow totems and if you want to dress up like it's Halloween, so be it you guys make this festival awesome!\n\nEvery stage is a best stage! Keep it up insomniac and I will forever be a headliner!
