First time I can here.  The \"brownie sundae\" with the whipped cream did it for me.  This 2nd time coming back.  The ice cream by itself was so dense I had to make sure I didn't chip a tooth from biting into my matcha green tea flavored ice cream.  I like how it tasted but on this particular day I was craving that mouth feel of ice cream that didn't require a pitch fork to dig into it!\n\nI'm not big on all the toppings that are available.  Sometimes less is more.  I'm still a fan of the gimmicky concept but I may try a different base next time.  Hey it's made to order and not small batches sitting around so it still earns 3 stars.  Dental work not required thankfully.
