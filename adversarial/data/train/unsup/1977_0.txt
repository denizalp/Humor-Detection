I tried 3 different drinks here is my honest opinion:\n1. mangonada: least favorite of the 3. I know some people like the spicy\/salty flavor in combo with sweet\/fruity but I just felt that the spice\/salt was very strong tasting and overpowering in ratio to the mango portion, which was fresh and had a nice flavor alone. 0\/5 Stars. Nearly inedible-sorry\n\n2. Lychee drink: my favorite of the 3. Very refreshing and good fruity flavor. Just a little too sweet for my liking. 4\/5 Stars\n\n3. Ube milkshake: if you enjoy ube\/ purple potato than you'll like this drink. It tastes like a vanilla milkshake with slight ube flavor. I really enjoyed the toasted marshmallow and candy from a visual perspective. 3-4\/5\n\nWait: over 20 minutes on a weekday late evening, and it was super hot and crowded inside. It seriously felt as if there was no air conditioning in the summer?? Also If you order more than one drink, keep in mind that they will call you to the pickup counter separately for each drink rather than all at one time.. does not flow well
