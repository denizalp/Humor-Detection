Matt at Sutra invited me and my staff to come down to try out a class before our meeting next door at Drip. Matt is a true professional- he set us up for a custom class with instructor Danielle during a time they don't normally offer a class. He also let Drip know that we'd be over afterwards (and they were ready for us with a private meeting area all set up which was really cool). \n\nDanielle's energy is amazing, she is both soothing and energizing, and just cool. She gave individual instruction to make the class suitable for those of us beginners (ahem, me), those of us who are more advanced and for my very prego VP :) The atmosphere is great too, the yoga room is a minimally decorated room with loads of candles, lanterns and simple lighting, and pretty hardwood floors.\n\nWe all left feeling fantastic and we had a very productive meeting. Can't wait to do it again!
