I am a frequent shopper at Sam's and I am never disappointed. The store is very clean and well organized, it is easy to move through and it is usually very easy to find the things that I need even though it is such a HUGE store. If there was one thing I could recommend from the store it would be the rotisserie chickens! They are incredibly flavorful and never dry. The only difficulty that comes to mind is the check out process, there are sometimes very long lines, but the great service of the checkers almost always makes it more bearable!
