Oh my gosh! My friend took me there to get their delicious ice cream. I had a cup with one serving, but two different flavors.Since in a chocolate girl I tried the double fudge chocolate chunk and the chocolate with sea salt ... so good. but the best thing was when I tried their brownie... best brownie I had in a really long time. I'll be back !
