I've parked here a couple of times and both times were good.  The lot is secure, shuttles clean (although would have liked a little more frequent, but nothing bad) and service is good.  \n\nMy only (minor) complaint was during T-day weekend.  Pulled into the lot and they said they only had parallel parking available.  Other words, you double park and leave the keys in the car!  Had to do what needed to be done.  My car had been moved into a space nearby when I returned, but all was safe.  They said that if I had a reservation, I would have had a traditional space.
