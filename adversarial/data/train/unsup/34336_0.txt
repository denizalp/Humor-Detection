I went here for a three course summerlicious meal. I really enjoyed their hot and sour soup and would come back for this dish alone. It's one of the better hot and sour soups I've had. The main dish was lackluster, the cold soba salad with 21 local ingredients. It needed more flavour. I thought it would taste like the slaw at Bent, but I was sadly mistaken. Not even remotely close. The dessert was good- I liked the mango dish a lot. I was expecting much more flavour because of the hype.
