Stopped here on recommendation from 2 local baristas, who we asked \"where can we get a good meal with good craft beer?\" It was a welcome hit. Walking up and down college st. can be overwhelming as there are just so many options, doing that during a Thursday afternoon, even more intimidating. The restaurants and bars don't fill up that much so it's a crapshoot but I've learned to ask locals (so thanks to the guy who recommended). \n\nI'll spare you a photo of the food since I see plenty of them already, and food was just sustenance for our pre-concert drinking but it turned out a highlight. My buddy got the pull pork sandwich for $10 and I got a burger with double smoke bacon (strips), aged cheddar and French fries on it (I asked them to hold on the green onion. Very good. Not the best but one of the better places to eat and drink in West Toronto (and maybe even all of).\n\nGreat atmosphere, the woman bartender\/host was super welcoming and we gabbed for a bit, very nice staff. The beer was almost all local brews (some Ottawa brews too). \n\nWould return here to eat or drink any day!
