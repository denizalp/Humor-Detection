This really is a great little cafe! I took my parents to brunch on a Sunday morning. We arrived around 10:30am and were immediately seated. Good thing we got there when we did because the place filled up fast. The server was great even when the restaurant was slammed and the food was delicious and the prices were very reasonable! And I was impressed by how great the grits were bc most places are bland. I will definitely go back.
