Tried this new addition to the neighbourhood last week and there were a lot of pros & cons but in the end I should stress I think it's a nice place with good food that I will definitely be going back to.\n\nCouple of notes:\n\n- The decor and service were excellent, I like the look of the place, it was comfortable and clean. The waitress was super attentive, and the food arrived quickly and at the right temperature\n\n- The iPad ordering system was great, but some items when you click on them go into great detail about what's in the dish, others had no additional info, and some of them really needed it.\n\n- At the time there is no liquor license, which was a big bummer as we were looking forward to a big pitcher of beer to go with our food. I believe she said it is coming just not here at this time. Had to knock a star off for that, sorry. \n\n- The food was hit or miss, some dishes were fantastic (sushi rolls were all great, basil beef was amazing, pork ramen was decent, pad thai was good, garlic beef was really good, sashimi was super fresh and tasty, etc) but others really didn't do it for me (mussels were gross, sushi pizza was bland, short ribs were greasy and had no meat on them, and they overuse mayonaise and this cold crab salad on a LOT of the dishes when they don't add anything)\n\nThey have only recently opened so I will go back in a few weeks to see if they've ironed out some of the kinks and gotten a LLBO license.\n\nHonestly I would rate this place higher if the competition wasn't so stiff in Vaughan. Between Spoon & Fork and Shittake (and from what my buddy tells me Makimono), Ichiki had a lot to compete with, especially since I'd been to both these places in the past 3 months so they were fresh in my mind. They are both fantastic restaurants with killer food so it's an uphill battle for my AYCE Japanese\/Thai dollars.\n\nI'm cheering for Ichiki though. Great location and a nice place, I want them to succeed and will keep going back to see how they're doing, despite some nit-picks.
