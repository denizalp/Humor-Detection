This is more of a 3.5 star rating but I'll boost it to 4 since I'm in a good mood.\n\nDespite popular belief(probably due to the 5 year old photo), I actually do cut my hair occasionally (whenever I don't buzzcut it).  The problem with me is that I am picky when it comes to finding a good hair salon since I visit them so infrequently.  \n\nI always irk at the thought of going to the same ole Supercuts on rainbow near Cheyanne and having to wait 20-40 minutes every single time I go there (twice in over a year) so I took it upon myself to shell out about $20 for a haircut and figured Sports Clips was decent enough, especially since if I was to wait 20 minutes before I could get my hair cut, I might as well be watching sports as opposed to pretending to be busy texting on my cell phone in public if I were at some other hair salon.\n\nEither way I arrive at Sport Clips with a 3-5 minute wait as the hairdresser was finishing up a patient and I was soon getting my hair worked on.  Normally my hair when grown is a warzone and extremely uneven, I told the hairdresser to trim up the sides and back with a blend on the top.  She did a pretty good job.\n\nAnd as a bonus for going their for the first time, they gave me the MVP treatment for free.  It's certainly nothing like a VIP treatment at some other establishments out in Las Vegas, but I really do appreciate the hot towel over the head, nice neck rub\/massage\/shampoo (normally $5 extra).\n\nWhen it was all said and done I was pretty much looked the the aspiring wannabe hipster I set out to be.  \n\nOverall, I had a decent experience, mid-day Saturday visit with no wait, paid about $20 for a pretty good haircut, no complaints, decently solid in my opinion.
