Let me see where to start this review...saw Little Cleo's as a cute and charming place to eat my beloved oysters. It sort of looked like the quintessential oyster bar Taylor's Shellfish in Seattle. So, great start! Cute inside? Check. Reservation at 7 pm, showed up 20 minutes early? Check. Let me tell you about how me and my friend were treated. We were told it would be at our set reservation time to be seated and to take a seat at the bar while we waited. Needless to say, the hostess forgot about us! So around 7:15 I tell her, she then says \"ohhhhh. Right. I need to set your table.\" We're then seated, and informed that all the oysters are sold out. Mind you.... They opened at 5 for dinner. For national oyster day. That they advertised. Super disappointed in this place.
