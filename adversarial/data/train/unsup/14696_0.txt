DO NOT COME HERE. Please don't be fooled by the pictures I've posted, Yes the sushi looks and tasted good. However, 2 words: FOOD POSIONING! I woke up in the middle of the night sick as a dog thanks to their sushi. Which I also have to mention is extremely over priced considering it was not fresh or properly kept. What an awful experience. I didn't get any sleep because I was so sick. So much for a romantic night out with my boyfriend. I haven't gotten sick from eating sushi EVER in my life so that tells you something. \n\nBe wary of coming here. The service was also lacking and we waited for at least 5-10 minutes for our waitress to come back so we could get soy sauce for the sushi they had already brought out. I'm very disappointed overall. Be careful of what you order if you come here. I had the spicy tuna and shrimp tempura roll and you see how that turned out. :(\n\nOn top of everything, my boyfriend called to complain and explain what happened and the owner accused him of being a \"scam artist\" (his exact words). He told him we were making it up. That is total BS. It really pisses me off because I had to miss work the next day and was up all night. Horrible owner and restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
