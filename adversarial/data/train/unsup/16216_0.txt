OMG!!!!! The Sicilian pizza here is the bomb! \nWe ate here two out of three nights while staying at the Mirage for a trade show. The restaurants proximity next to the sports bar and multi screen TV wall had nothing to do with the choice. Honest!\nThere was no wait for our table and the rapid refreshment delivery by our waiter started us out on the right track. \n The menu has a fantastic selection of pasta and the best fresh pizza that will satisfy any hunger created from working and playing. Our waiter contributed his opinions as we filled out parlay sheet for Superbowl XLVIII. With a full belly and multiple drinks, all was right with the world!
