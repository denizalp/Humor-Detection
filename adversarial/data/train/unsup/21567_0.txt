I called for an estimate. They came out and left an estimate on my door. They said for $150 they would deep root fertilize. I never had a chance to speak with the arborist directly, but the diagnosis didn't sound right. \n\nAnyhow, one of the employees followed up the next week to see if I wanted to go ahead with the service. When I asked what exactly the deep root fertilization service was and why they thought that would cure the huge branches that were dying, we got disconnected. I think the disconnect was legitimately a dropped call, but the guy never called back. He then called back 2 days later and I said, \"When we were disconnected, why didn't you call back?\". He said, \" I thought you were annoyed and hung up on me.\" I said, \" That wasn't the case at all, but if that were the case, why would you call me again?\".\n\nSo, as you might have gathered, I didn't feel comfortable going with their diagnosis. I ended up pruning back my dead branches myself and found that my tree is actually suffering from sooty canker fungus and powdery mildew. It's actually pretty easy to see just by looking at the tree, but I didn't know what I was looking at until I did some extensive research.\n\nMy final synopsis.  I don't think these guys know what they are doing. Their diagnosis was incorrect and if I would have paid $150 for the recommended treatment it wouldn't have helped a damn bit. Unfortunately, you have to cut out the infected branches, so I will either have a tree trunk with few branches or the most common recommendation for this condition is tree removal. Sad, huh. \n\nI definitely will not be calling this company again. Too bad, because I have 11 trees in my backyard as well.
