Really hungry. No time. Stopped in and got the $5.00 Hot-N-Ready, or whatever they call their version of the no-wait, always-ready pizza. Staff was nice, very polite, offered three different types that were available (cheese, pepperoni, pretzel crust). I took the pepperoni pizza, then headed for home.\n\nOn arrival it was still hot. Their medium measured 13 3\/4 inches across with an inch of crust around the outside. The pizza contained 27 slices of pepperoni. Pizza was baked until the cheese bubbled up and began getting brown, just the way I expect every pizza to be baked.\n\nNow for the negatives: Cheese was plentiful but tasteless. Sauce was also kind of bland. The crust was thin but dense, not light and fluffy like fresh-risen crust should be. The only real flavor came from the pepperoni, which added a bit of spice.\n\nOverall, I would say their pizza was bland, nothing special, but would be good if you are in a hurry and need something quick and easy without any wait.
