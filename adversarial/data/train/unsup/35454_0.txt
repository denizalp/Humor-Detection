The first time i went here was for my birthday. Although the restaurant was quiet empty the host gave us an option to sit in the bar area since we had a party of 14 people and he said it would be faster service if we sat there. Reluctantly we agreed to sit there.  The ambience was amazing, i loved the decor. However the food was nothing but average and the service was still terrible even though there were barely any people. \nThe second time was more recently. I solely decided to go back because i love the ambience. upon entering we saw the restaurant was completely empty on a friday night. We sat in the dinning area. With just one server managing the bar area and the dining area needless to say the service yet again was terrible. \nMy boyfriend ordered a quesadilla without the chicken ( we confirmed the order to ensure there were no errors due to him being a strict vegetarian)  and I ordered mashed potatoes and club sandwich. The mashed potatoes were good but just a bit dry. The club sandwich was just terrible and to top it off they gave us chicken in the quesadilla . Unknowingly my boyfriend who is a vegetarian ate a whole piece before we saw a piece of chicken in the quesadilla. We waited a good 10 minuets before we went upto the owner who was fixing the door and asked him to send the server. The server was busy at the bar area and came over 10 minuets later, by this time we were just sitting waiting and the food was completely cold. The server apologized and rushed to the kitchen and said they messed it up. He then brought out a veggie quesadilla and that was it. No apologies by the owner, nothing was taken off our check, no words were exchanged we just paid and left. I was highly disappointed that they did not even understand the extent of disappointment they caused for someone who has been a vegetarian their whole life.\nNever going back again.
