Henderson is finally seeing a surge of boba options, and Teason seems to be hitting all the right spots with a healthy roster of regulars. I initially came in for their grand opening BOGO special and was decently impressed enough to return when working in the area.\n\nTheir Lychee Peachee and Sea Salt Black Coffee are both solid, but my heart belongs to the Chamango slushie. Their boba, when it's in stock, is the right texture with good chew and just a touch of sweetness. I tend to only put this in drinks that are less sweet to begin with, though.\n\nLocation is tiny but cute. Mixed feelings about the drinks being served in bottles, but it's a plus if you're doing a grab and go. Props for having almond milk available as a non-dairy option!
