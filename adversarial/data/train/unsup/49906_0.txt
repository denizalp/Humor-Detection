I forgot to snap a picture of our food before we are it all up. I had avocado toast and hard boiled eggs. Hard to mess up but they added so much flavor. But besides the fold being wonderful I'm really doing this review for the service. From the time we walked in grear service. But Hannah our server was awesome. Such a sweet person but officiant and super kind. Helpful when questions on the menu as well. She knew all her stuff.. I'd go back for the food but id more so go back to see Hannah!
