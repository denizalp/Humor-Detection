This place has a great little patio for the summer months right on Eglinton where you can sit, sip your drink and watch the foot traffic rush by. When it's not patio season you can sit inside and enjoy all the sunlight it gets from the two walls of floor to ceiling windows. \n\nThey have 4 big purple chairs that you can sink into and lots of little tables and your standard chairs.\n\nA friend told me a very relevant joke while I was having coffee here with her this week:\n\n*\"Somebody called me 'pretentious' the other day.\n\nI nearly choked on my half-caff half-fat soy latte grande.\"*\n\n:-)\n\nAnyway, cute little Starbucks location with friendly staff.
