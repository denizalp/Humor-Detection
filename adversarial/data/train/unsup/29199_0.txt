This was the worst rental experience. They chose to honor my rental through Fox and said they would honor the reservations and match the price because fox's computers were down. And THEN  I had to argue with the representative to match the price.  We went back and forth three or four times before he got even close to the original price on my reservation. I finally accepted because it was somewhat close and I just wanted to get out of the airport...even though I could show him the breakdown of the rate on my reservation. \n\nThen, when I returned my car at the scheduled time (that I had arranged originally with Fox) they told me I would be charged $50 extra...keep in mind that my base charge for the rental was only $30 so this is kinda stupid.\n\n I guess Payless expects you to return your car 4-8 hours before your flight so that you're in the \"24 hour period allotted by the company.\" It makes no sense...what company would expect that out of anyone flying out?!!!\n\nI talked to a man at the counter at the Phoenix airport. I talked to customer service. I wrote an email with no response!!! Apparently they don't feel the need to get back to their customers. #Paylesssucks #dontrentwithpayless #nopayless #Foxalltheway #Paymoreforgoodservice
