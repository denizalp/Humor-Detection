SUPER IMPORTANT UPDATE:  They are making their own version of the  infamous Cronuts (halF croissant half donut), available from Thursdays- Sunday no limit per customer, but be warned they are selling out early and fast!.\n\nThis shop has made a cupcake lover out of me.  Conveniently located next to my new gym (see the irony here), I stopped by to sample their wears.  I tried all the 8 flavors and have come away with a preference for the Key Lime, the chocolate, and the caramel.  The place itself is really stunning, a great layout with fun stuff to peruse, whilst you wait you turn to order.  The staff is very warm and welcoming and are happy to guide you towards the path of cupcake addiction.  These guys do it right and use top notch quality ingredients.  Think of them next time you have a dinner party to attend, or as a unique birthday cake, cupcakes are fun for everyone.
