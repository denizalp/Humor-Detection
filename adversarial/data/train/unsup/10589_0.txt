Saltimbocca!\n\nWhat did you call me?!\n\nHey, settle down. Saltimbocca is griddle bread known from Naples. Cibo Urban Pizzaria Cafe's saltimbocca bread is baked fresh in a wood burning oven. \n\nIt was a good call to order lunch from Cibo. Not only does the cafe make a great environment to relax from the bustle of your day, but the food is pretty good too. \n\nTwo of their vegetarian sandwiches are close to my heart. Vegetariano and the Alla Parmigiana. Both are 9.50 each and I got them with the side house salad. \n\nVegetariano has grilled zucchini, roasted red bell peppers, grilled eggplant and mozzarella. \n\nAlla Parmigiana has fried eggplant, mozzarella, tomato sauce, parmigiano, and basil.\n\nIf you know me, you know me and a lot of cheese don't get along. So in place of the mozza I used the parmigiano slices from the salad on my sandwiches. The flavor of grilled veggies came through. And I was a happy camper. Yum yum. https:\/\/youtu.be\/UoMuNARHRvk
