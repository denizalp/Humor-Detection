I kind of consider myself to be a bit of an Irish pub expert.  First of all, I'm Irish.  Second of all, I lived in Boston, the mecca of Irish pubs outside of Ireland, for 7 years.  I'm kind of well versed in these things.\n\nThat being said Rosie McCaffrey's gets my seal of approval.  I'm going to go with 4 stars for right now seeing as I didn't sample the food, we brought our own birthday cake in with us!  (Which they were totally cool about)  I was with the magical Bonnie G who possesses the uncanny ability to get us a table even in the most crowded of establishments.  I swear, she uses some Jedi mind tricks or something.  \n\nThere we were, all cozy in a booth with a huge birthday cake having a great time....and a band starts up!  Playing Irish music!  Including a real fiddle!  I was in heaven.  I almost wanted to shout out some requests for my favorite Irish folk music (Come out Ye Black and Tans, Tri Coloured Ribbon, A Nation Once Again) but I restrained.  \n\nThey have a decent beer selection, it includes the Irish beers you would expect to see but there was one glaring omission for me.  No Sam.  So boo to that.  Our waitress was really nice even though she didn't have to be at all which is always appreciated.  It was a great lively bar scene, with a nice central bar, and a warm and inviting atmosphere.  The crowd was a great range of people from all different walks of life and everyone was friendly and having a good time, most people who passed by our table wished our friend a Happy Birthday (except for one girl who was also having a birthday and we offered cake to and she ran off....who doesn't like cake?!). We exchanged a piece of cake for a rose....it was a good time indeed.\n\nDefinitely one of the better pubs I've been to in here in Arizona.  A pub like this puts a pub like the Rose and Crown to shame because R+C has no vibe.  In fact, in retrospect, R+C feels a little boring to me now.
