The food was pretty tasty, they had a nice menu to choose from and I'm always a fan of fire baked pizza. There are plenty of beverages and the outdoor patio with \"mist-ers\" make for a pleasant and refreshing treat--seeing as it's as hot as the surface of hell in Arizona.\n\nHowever, it's always packed with people, which is a plus because you know everything is good; but, the tables and chairs are so close together that's it's hard to squeeze in anywhere. It's also pretty dark and musty, so when you leave it's nice to get a breath of fresh air (although, the dry Arizona heat hardly constitutes as \"fresh\"). \n\nAll in all, a decent place for dinner. It's a little on the pricy side--so if you don't want to buy the doughnut holes here for dessert, just slip over to a Krispy Creme and snag a dozen for a few bucks. Hey, I'm just telling it to ya straight--woman to.. Well, you. \n\nTips & Tricks: \n* Be sure to get pizza, the best is the meat lovers! It's only big enough for two people though, so keep your gathering intimate. \n* Parking is a beast. Try parking in the surrounding locations, a good spot is at the bank across the way... At least I think it was a bank--I was too focused on filling my belly to notice.
