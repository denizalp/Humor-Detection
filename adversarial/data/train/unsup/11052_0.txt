The first time I went to the DD was 5 years ago.\nI was terrified.  \n\nI've been back a dozen times since then, and I always have fun.\n\nI never go to the DD specifically just to go there..I usually end up there with my girls after drinking and dancing at Freezone across the street.\n\nWe love doing shots of Ass Juice.  You can get yours with a slim jim or a twinkie, but you have to ask.  \n\nIts a fun place, but if you DON'T like dive bars or punk bars...don't go.\n\nAlso, get the bacon martini.  :D
