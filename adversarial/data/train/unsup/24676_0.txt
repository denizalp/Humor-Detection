Free! If you walk through the casino, girls are passing out ladies comp passes. Around the entrance to the lounge, there are guys dressed in suits with VIP passes for the men. Free drinks till midnight for the ladies. Watered down of course but free is good! \n\nAt first we thought it was just the front bar area but there is a whole inner club just waiting to be discovered. The inside: Kick ass walls. I love love love the video projections behind the bar. Sweet decor. So so music. So so crowd.  I'm a little bummed that this place isn't really Beatles themed in decor or music. A Beatles mashup would have been really cool. The only real reference were the girls' costumes with the tie dye and the cute little British flags.
