The Wynn is the best hotel in Las Vegas. The only reason I get to four instead of a five star is that it smells of smoke. I can't deal with cigarette smoke.\n\nI upgraded to a parlor suite room in the tower suites. Pretty sweet! It's 1280 ft.Â² and it has a bathroom bigger than my first apartment. I chose a room overlooking the Strip. It's beautiful. You can see the mountains, and at night, you can see the lights of Las Vegas really clearly. \n\nThe room cost a fortune. I really never would've paid face value for this thing, but I managed to talk the front desk into letting me upgrade. It really does pay to join the Wynn insider club. I think that they take you a little more seriously. At least they figure you'll be coming back, they don't want you to be unhappy.\n\nThe room has everything. All the way from a fax machine to a really fancy toothbrush. And seriously the views can't be beat. I had a whole bunch of attorneys here for a cocktail party in the living room and there was plenty of room.\n\nIf you are not spending your money or if money is really not an object, this is a really nice way to live. They really do treat you very, very, very well. You have your own concierge, entrance, parking attendants, the works. And even room service is delicious, if you don't mind spending $200 on room service. And that's without any alcohol.\n\nListen; I'm not going to tell you how to live your life. If you like to gamble, and you like to have fun, this is a really good place to be. If none of those things excites you, I get that. I don't gamble, I don't drink and I really don't get the desert. But I'm here on business and this does not suck.
