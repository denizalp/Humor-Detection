My girlfriend and I walk by this stand daily, and have had two experiences with them. \n\nThey opened fairly recently, and we had been talking about trying them out for awhile for breakfast. We noticed they hadn't really been getting a lot of business, so we thought we'd give them a shot at our patronage. Our first opportunity came when we walked by and spotted what appeared to be a terrific deal: a breakfast croissant (Egg, cheese, tomato, lettuce) for 1.99. We pounced, and ordered it, but when they brought it to the register, they had charged us over 5 dollars. I pointed out that it was listed at 2 dollars, and they told us it was a mistake and that it was actually more expensive.\n\nWe kind of stared unblinking at her for what seemed like an eternity, before saying \"Welp. Okay nevermind then\" going on our merry but now hungry way. WHY, as a new and possibly struggling business, would you not honour the price you mistakenly listed it as? I don't need a handout, but you already went through all the trouble of heating and serving us the food, and you're going to insist we pay the full price? We were pretty flabbergasted.\n\nThe second experience was picking up a smoked salmon bagel (cheaper in fact, than the 5 dollar croissant) which was delicious and well priced.\n\nGenerally I find their prices pretty unreasonable, considering they're a new business with no customer base, with high competition for breakfast consumers surrounding them. And at lunchtime you have Salad Days to contend with, offering humongous salads at a much better value. We were turned off by the first experience, though the food is clearly of a higher quality than their contemporaries; The prices need to come down while they build relationships with the people who work in the neighbourhood.
