Social House is a decent, up-scale option for Las Vegas, with excellent food, and nice ambiance, but it's wedged in a mall. So all your views are of shoppers, gamblers, and noisy tourists.\n\nThe food here was quiet good. Everything was fresh and well-prepared. I wouldn't say it blew me away, but gauged on food alone, this place would definitely be a 4-star.\n\nThe service was good. No complaints, but nothing exceptional.\n\nThe ambiance inside the restaurant was cozy, up-scale Asian, but most of that falls flat when half the restaurant is an open veranda looking out on a Mall. We sat right by the Mason-Dixon line between upscale, fresh restaurant and Mall sterility and it killed it for me.\n\nThis is gonna be an uncharacteristically short review for me, because while there was nothing majorly wrong with this place (besides the location), there wasn't really that much that put it above, above-average. Vegas these days is a hive of culinary endeavors and you can do better, but don't sweat it if this is your only option.
