Rice in claypot dishes are a true comfort food for me.  Not many things in life makes me more happy then the simple things but it's the simple things that are most often the hardest to achieve.  Done right, rice is the most basic comfort food of all and Good Taste Casserole Rice makes some pretty solid claypot rice dishes.\n\nGood Taste Casserole Rice as its name implies makes some fantastic claypot rice dishes.  With over 70 plus rice dishes you will have serious difficulties in deciding what you feel for that day.  For about $10 you get large claypot of rice, a soup and a side of veggies.  This is some serious value here!\n\nSome choices include the traditional chicken, preserved and BBQ meats, beef and egg but also less common ones you'll see such as curry chicken, BBQ Eel and even octopus and scallop!\n\nThe food is excellent with each topping cooked over a fragrant oiled bed of rice.  But the best part for me is that crispy slightly burnt rice bottom.   Make sure you scrap that up as that is an absolute joy to eat!\n\nThey also serve a limited amount of traditional scrapped rice rolls and some herbal soups as well to close out that homely feel.\n\nThe place it self is very small and cramp with a line up out the door especially during lunch and dinner so do be prepared to wait if you come then.  Service is very abrupt but quick.\n\n4\/5 for some great simple homely food\n\nGreat job!
