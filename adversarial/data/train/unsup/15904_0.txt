I had been looking for a new nail spa for a very long time and now that I've found CC Nail Spa I don't have to look any further! \n\nIt's in a great location in a strip mall on Eastern with many great places to eat before or after you get your nails done.\n\nThe inside is very chic and looks much more upscale than your average nail salon with cute decor and very comfortable chairs. Speaking of comfortable... their massage chairs. Oh. My. God. They are literally the best massage chairs my body has been fortunate enough to sit in.\n\nAll of their nail technicians have years of experience and are some of the friendliest people I've ever met! I've had gel manicures and pedicures done by both Mia and Peter and they have given me exactly what I wanted with such attention to quality and detail every time!\n\nThey also always have great promotions here on Yelp that help out the pocketbook even though their prices are already quite reasonable.\n\nLove love love this place!
