Five stars, for a little hole in the wall Chinese joint? Yes, I'm serious. Now, before you Elite's rip me a new one, and call for my Elite badge to be removed...I should say that I was really in the mood for Chinese food. I mean REALLY in the mood for Chinese food. Typically nights like last night, I would've settled for chex mix, beef jerky, fried chicken, doritos or even Taco Bell....catch my drift here?\n\nOk, so I'm ready for Chinese food. I'm starving. The kind of hunger that could put even third world nations to shame (too insensitive?).\n\nI ordered the almond chicken, egg rolls and brown rice. When I picked it up, the guy that was at the counter was pretty cool. He had one of those voices that made him seem like a character from a 1980's Nintendo game...(Think Piston Honda from Mike Tyson's Punchout). He was pretty cool.\n\nWell, he was cool until, he asked, \"All this food for you?\" Yes. It was all for me. Clearly he couldn't take a hint by my condition. Oh well. He was still really cool. I lied to him BTW. I told him, it was for me and my friend. So he gave me two sets of chopsticks.\n\nThe food was amazing. Actually no. It was more like a religious experience. Yes, that freaking amazing. And no, this isn't like five star, white cloth dining. This is the kind of amazing food you eat out of a box, on your favorite couch, watching Archer, South Park, Tosh.0, or Family Guy.\n\nEpic food. I am coming back. I don't care if it's unhealthy. I work out six days a week just for this.
