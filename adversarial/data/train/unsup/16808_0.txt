In this place I can see the kid who dropped out of culinary school to tour with a band.  This place is rock and roll refined.  There is a sense of culinary knowledge without the pomp and circumstance.  \n\nThe after school special cocktail is a raspberry infused michelada with Modelo unceremoniously delivered in the can.  The brunch menu is spot on.  The Cap'n Crunch french toast was awe-inspiring.\n\nThe biggest knock on this place is their lack of Red Bull.  Apparently, the whole Hard Rock campus is devoid of Red Bull due to some contract limitations....how Rock and Roll.
