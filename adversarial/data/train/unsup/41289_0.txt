The first experience I had here, was a 1 Star, but this location was not available for reviews at the time of my first visit. I came in for 2 bowls. Was told there was no chicken and to please sit and wait. I did. However every person before and after myself, got a voucher for BOGO on food next visit. The girl at the register was certain not to give me one, even when I made it clear I was also asked to wait. I ordered my food, and finally asked why I didn't receive one. She didn't make clear, but handed me one anyway, reluctantly. My second experience here was much nicer, and my food was the best chipotle I'd ever had. Maybe work on people skills? You're in Lakewood, you get all walks of life in this area. Kindness will get you further than blatant rudeness.
