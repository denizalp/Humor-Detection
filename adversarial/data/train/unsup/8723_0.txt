As this was the site of my first UYE, and I had a blast due to the awesome people I was hanging with, I might not be as harsh with my review as I should be.\n\nI'd visited the Hooters in Brampton before it closed down, and had a horrific experience there with terrible service. Compared to that, this Hooters was a treat! The waitresses were really cute (if not really um...voluptuous, as the company likes to boast), and ours was polite with me.\n\nThe restaurant was pretty drab, and even though it wasn't all that busy, extremely cramped. I hope my fellow Yelpers didn't think I was going for free-touches while trying to get through to go to the bathroom...I was just trying to not trip and fall on my face :-o\nAnd don't get me started on the bathroom. One of us remarked that they seemed \"rapey\", and I'd have to agree. It's funny that people love making connections between Hooters and strip clubs, and this is just another example of that odd connection. All that was missing was the ice in the urinal and some pushy bastard trying to spray ManWhore For Men on you for tips.\n\nIt should also be noted that even though it was a chilly, rainy evening, the restaurant was extremely muggy. I'd heard a lot of positive things about the patio, but unfortunately, that wasn't an option.\n\nAs for the food, it was reasonably priced I suppose, and their wings were alright as far as wings go, but I just can't get past the annoyances mentioned. Luckily I was in great company, so I still had a great time. \n\nAnd those uniforms really aren't that sexy anymore. I saw way more provocatively-dressed girls walking out of the clubs on the way to my car.
