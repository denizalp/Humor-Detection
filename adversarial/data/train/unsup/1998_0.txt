My family and a guest arrived on 2nd night of business. The expected slowness came, the appetizers coming very far apart, the drinks came slowly. It was busy, this is a new place, so some things are understandable. I ordered my burger \"extra extra extra well done\", and the waitress understood that. She said that's how her mom orders hers, too. The food finally arrived, and I quickly slice into the burger to discover VERY RED meat, maybe cooked medium, so I sent it back right away. The rest of my party continues to eat, and after a while my burger appears, this time cooked as I asked the first time. I had a couple bites when a short, light haired, roundish man appeared. I assume he was the manager, though he did not introduce himself to me. He asked how the burger was and says he heard they got it wrong the first time. I answer that it is much better, but that the bacon which i also asked for crispy came out very not crispy and in fact I was unable to eat it and had pulled it out of my burger and set it aside. His reply is what was bothersome. He said \"We appreciate you understanding. it's only our second night here, and hey, at least we got the burger part right. (meaning they didn't get the bacon right). That's the most important part!\" Is this guy serious? That was a very unprofessional response. I had to eat after everyone was done, and I mean they were completely done, I get a burger brought to me red and raw, I get a sorry, but hey we got part of it right...If I were that manager I would have maybe comped my meal, took off half, offered a free dessert or something. It seems only right to leave a negative experience with something positive to balance it out. Someone needs to go back to get some managerial training, therefore you earned one star from me.
