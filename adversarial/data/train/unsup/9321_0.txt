I don't know where to begin because this place was off the chain in every aspect! The beginning: Thank God there was no line when we went, but I'm told the lines here are usually very long. You can sit at a table or at the bar. Sitting at the bar is awesome because you can watch them create their amazing desserts. There are these little hooks under the bar where you can hang your bag\/purse. How thoughtful!\nThe menu: They have a wide array of seasonal items, and also cheese plates, as well as dessert wines. Ask them for recommendations on pairings. We ordered a bunch of stuff that I can remember the names because they're funky, so check out the pics I posted! We were a group of 6, so we pretty much ordered one of each of their featured dishes.\nThe finale: EVERYTHING.WAS.AWESOME. what more can I say? From watching them carefully prepare each dish to finally eating it!\nGood notes: My son has a nut allergy, so I am always anxious getting him desserts simply because of the high risk of cross contamination. I told our server about his needs and ordered the raspberry sherbert. She was conscientious and very good. \nThe service: IMPECCABLE \nThe bathroom: Forreal, I felt like I was in a modern art museum. And they have a bidet! With an automatic toilet! And it was clean!\nThis is definitely a MUST for anyone in Vegas. It is in the Chinatown district, in a Plaza that has a lot of Japanese spots. They also have a non desert spot on the other side of the plaza, with a huge line outside all the time. My friend told me you can get a pork belly bowl for $4. Will definitely check that spot out too! \nAnyway, if you come to this dessert spot, and there's a line, just wait in it. TRUST ME. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!
