Solid 3 1\/2 Stars!\n\nCan't believe this place was a former KFC...imagine the irony, now it's a wing joint!  Voodoo Wings does some decent grub!\n\nI do have another preferred chain for chicken wings, but Voodoo will do in a pinch.  They have some standard wing flavors along with some new concoctions.  We tried a 12 piece wing set to go in the following flavors:\n\n-Hot\n-Garlic Parmesan\n\nVerdict?  Wings are just OK.  They were not bad at all but they seemed a tad smaller in size compared to other wing places around town.  Voodoo's hot wings were average, they weren't very hot at all & they were a bit drowned out in flavor.  Still pretty good with blue cheese for dipping though!  The Garlic Parmesan flavor wings were just OK as well.  I wanted them to have more cheese flavor, these were heavier on the salt.\n\nStandout though were the Fried Pickles!  These were tasty!  They were battered just right, crispy but not too thick.  Batter was flavorful too, salty, zesty, spicy all in one bite!  I would go to Voodoo Wings again just to order these.\n\nPrices were on par with other wing places here in LV, it cost us under $20 for 12 wings, celery, side of Fried Pickles, and a large drink.  On a good note, all that food managed to feed a family of 3 just right!  \n\nLikin' the voodoo that you doo!
