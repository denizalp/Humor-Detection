This park has new management!  The new manager is very Pro-Active and has begun to make the improvements and upgrades that had needed to be done for years.  The changes have been terrific.  The water system is getting upgraded, roads are being fixed and gates are now closed all the time.  It's nice to have this security.\n\nThe pool is huge and really well cared for and the whirlpool is one of the biggest and nicest I have ever been in.The community center has a huge area to hold parties and events in, with smaller rooms which include pool tables and poker tables.  There is a computer with free wifi and television for those who need internet access.  They also have a kitchen for events.\n\nThere is something to do if you want to or you can just relax and live in a nice neighborhood.  There is a Phoenix Neighborhood Patrol Program through the Phoenix Police.  The people who live in the park have several different options for how they choose to interact.  I like how the neighbors check on each other and help out whenever they can.  I know there have been several times that a bunch of people all volunteer to help out someone who might not be able to fix something due to income or health issues.  There have been clean up parties and painting parties for re-doing someone's whole yard or painting their trailer.\n\nIt's just a nice hidden gem if you are looking for a place where people still walk around and pay attention to each other.  Where you can be as active or sedate as you want to and be assured of a caring staff and neighbors.
