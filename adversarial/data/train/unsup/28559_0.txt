Service and food was great! I was with my family staying at the pointe Hilton and yelped some mexican food places and this one can up so we decided to go. It was a wonderful surprise not super busy great atmosphere. We had the enchiladas and the tamales (all versions of the tamales)!  Which we all highly recommend!  All the food was great that we tried! worth giving it a try!
