The buffet is reasonably priced for the variety and quality of food that they offer. I have eaten here for the lunch, dinner, and brunch buffet on numerous occasion. It is very hit or miss in my opinion. The quality is amazing at times, while other times I have been very disappointed. They have a nice variety of food to choose from and a large selection of desserts.  \n\nThe brunch buffet has $1 mimosas, which is a plus in my book. \n\nI definitely will return when I am gambling at the casino and looking for a hearty, filling meal.
