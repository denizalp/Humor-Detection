it was 9pm on a sunday and Mon Ami Gabi downstairs was going to be an hour wait.. so F that. Eiffel Tower Restaurant it is.\n\nim always very excited to try different restaurant's lobster entrees and i seen this spot had the surf and turf for $64. me and my date go upstairs and get seated after about a 10 minute wait at the bar which had a nice bartender. the view this place has to offer of the strip and the water show across the street was awesome. nice waiters\/waitresses and all that, but when i finally get my plate, the first thing i wanted to ask was \"UM WHERE THE FUCK IS THE REST OF MY LOBSTER?\" they bring out a measly piece of what seemed to be half of a lobster tail and a baby lobster claw. the portion of the lobster was very upsetting but was delicious and so was the prime beef strip loin. the portion of the beef had to be only about 4oz. total. if you decide to come here, DON'T GET THE SURF AND TURF. way too overpriced for a small ass portion.
