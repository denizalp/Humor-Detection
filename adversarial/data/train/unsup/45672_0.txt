My first try here, it was the 2 of us and we grabbed the small table for 2.  It is a small restaurant, caters a lot to the takeout business, so do expect folks to walk-in and standby the counter, but still very quaint and not bothered.\n\nI like the generous portions and the big slices of tender beef on the Shanghainese beef noodles.  \n\nWe then ordered to go the shrimp mixed vegetables which came with rice. The order looked very compact but when we took it out of the takeout containers, it was a lot!  Love the choice of mixed veggies, wasn't cheap fillers like onions or bean sprouts!\n\nWill come back to try other dishes!\n\nGlad didn't have to go all the way to 14th\/Markham Rd area anymore for Hakka cuisine.  It's a bit of a trek for us.
