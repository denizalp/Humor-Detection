I've been to local Red Robin's in the Bay Area and considering that it's a franchise, they make everything the same at all restaurants. Needless to say, this place isn't all that great. I can come here to eat every now and then, but it's not off the wall where I tend to want to come back more than often.\n\nWe ordered an onion ring tower which was HUGE! and ok tasting. I'm not much of a onion ring lover and that might have an impact on why I didn't think it tasted great. Me and the wifey also shared a chicken pasta which wasn't all that tasty in my opinion, probably won't ever order it again. But what I do like about this place is their fish, fries and shrimp sampler appetizer, although we didn't order it at the time we came to this place, I did have it a few times when coming to another Red Robin and I do recommend it to others when coming here.\n\nAll in all this place doesn't deserve more than 3 stars as food wasn't that great here when we ate. Sorry Red Robin I just know you can do better.
