You haven't lived until you've had your car towed from the nearby apartment complex... little tip, those signs that say cars will be towed are not empty warnings.  Just park on the street like everyone else.  Then you won't end the night making a cash transaction on a dark industrial street with some guy in a white pickup truck who left his lights, I mean high beams, on for you.   \n\nVisited Four Peaks last night for Football Monday, A.K.A. Man Monday.  Literally spent like 6 hours at the bar.  It's the kind of place you can do that.  The food is above average for bar food... note, I said for bar food.  I'm admittedly a vodka and wine drinker, so my opinion holds little weight with beer.  Also, I have no idea what I'm talking about--tried some kinda port beer that tasted like chocolate--see? \n\nAnyway, I couldn't possibly see a reason for hating this place so you might as well check it out.  How's that for an endorsement?
