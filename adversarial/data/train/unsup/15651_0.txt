Avery's is your friendly neighborhood family owned and operated coffee house and I must say that I think I found my new favorite coffee joint! \n\nAs soon as I walked in with my friend we were greeted with a warm smile from the owner and the staff behind the counter. We placed our orders in detail and they were made exactly the way we asked for.\n\nMy friend ordered an Espresso Macchiato, which he enjoyed very much and I ordered a Latte with almond milk extra hot and I gotta say that it was one of the hardiest and tastiest lattes I've ever had.\n\nThe coffee has no bitter after taste and it was very smooth yet bold. I also like the fact that their alternative milks don't have vanilla sweetener, which is very smart of them to consider.\n\nI was told by the owner that the added sweeteners in the alternative milks alters the taste of the coffee and thats why they don't offer it, but they do offer syrups and a variety of sugars that you can add to your drink.\n\nAnother thing that I love about Avery's is that they play easy listening radio in the background and makes for a very relaxing and down to earth atmosphere. And they also provide free wifi and a nice selection of books you can read while enjoying your drink.\n\nAnother plus to this coffee joint is that their prices are very reasonable and I like the fact that the vibage here is not pretentious at all compared to other establishments in the area. \n\nIf you haven't tried Avery's I highly recommend you do. I'm positive you won't regret it!
