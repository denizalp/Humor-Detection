I've been coming here for years... And this is the first time I've walked in and they wouldn't even acknowledge me. They they proceeded to talk\/gossip about another customer. They were quite rude with the comments. I love Dr Grondin he's amazing but should tell his front desk staff to shut there mouths. Cause I'd love to know what they say about me when I leave the office.
