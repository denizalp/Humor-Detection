Great hotel, exactly as advertised. Got a suite with a view of the strip which was beautiful, and customer service was extremely polite. Good location- only a few minutes walk to the monorail and a Walgreens right down the street, which def helps if you're on a budget (they sell alcohol too). The only negative thing was the fridge comes pre-filled so you can't store any of your own stuff, and there was no coffee maker. Overall, great experience and will definitely come back!
