Can't begin to tell you how pretentious this joint is. Back in my day, you walk into a coffee shop and if the coffees hot, you're good to trot. Nowadays you go into these shops and they tell you how you want your coffee. I don't recall even asking you. There's nothing like being an Italian straight from the motherland and asking for Cortado and having some mook behind the counter tell me how a Cortado is made. Are you kidding me? Ok well I'll take it to go. You don't serve Cortados to go? How about you close up shop and leave coffee to the other maestros around the block: Jimmy's, coffee bar, Sicilian cafe, Manic, the Common. Anywhere but this place.\n\nThe sheer audacity.
