Absolutely amazing. \n\n1. Food was great, cheesy hashbrowns went great with my custom omlet\n2. Service was with a great smile all around, greeter and servers took great care of us\n3. Loved the patio and decor, nice modern place and everyone's plate I was eyeballing looked amazing.\n\nConveniently located just outside New York New York and great atmosphere. Highly recommend to anyone local or traveling!
