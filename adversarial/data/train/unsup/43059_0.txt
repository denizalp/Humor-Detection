I wanted to take this opportunity to follow up in regards to actions taken by Academy of Scuba regarding my concerns. In a phone call with the owner on 6\/7\/12, he validated and took responsibility for my concerns. He agreed the situation was not ideal and shouldn't have happened. He also agreed that the situation was a learning experience in which he could improve his services. I have to say I'm impressed with his follow up. I should also note that a refund and invitation for additional services were offered. For me, this was not about the money but the poor and anxiety provoking experience I had. I truly believe my concerns will be addressed and\/or resolved for future companies. I appreciate the steps take to correct the situation and satisfy me as a customer. I will be giving this organization a second chance as a result. \n\nBrady
