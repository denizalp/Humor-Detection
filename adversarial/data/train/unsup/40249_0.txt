My wife and I love to eat here, the food is amazing. My wife's favorite part is tipping just to get \"jelly\"!! When a certain cashier is there though, we never get jelly love. Tonight we placed a to-go order and tipped as usual; then waited for our food. We watched 3 other people come in, 1 pick up and 2 dine in orders, all of which tipped and got a handful of jelly love.... don't get me wrong, the food is awesome, but the service is not equally as awesome. I'd like to give more stars but as the total package it lacks a little on one end of the spectrum.
