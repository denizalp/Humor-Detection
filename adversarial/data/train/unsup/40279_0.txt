Ended up eating here because Thai is delicious and it's a mall food court, so I thought I would take the safe bet. We ended up being the last people to order which might explain the unsatisfactory experience? but after reading the other reviews I don't think so. I ordered some  chicken, rice, and vegetables with some sweet and sour sauce on the top and a ginger ale to go with it. I guess I can't really complain to much since it is mall food, but the food itself was just very bland and left much to be desired. On top of that paying $23 for anything in the food court (for 2 people) is a reminder as to why you should always go eat at an actual restaurant.
