Comes every 30 seconds Northbound from Parkdale to Bloor - yet Southbound from Bloor, there's a 20 minute wait for 5 to show up at once. Crazy drivers take the Queen W bend at 200 kph, but if you're under 70 a multicultural army of grandmothers, all on their way to Dufferin mall, will shame you out of the relative safety of your seat on this overcrowded conveyance. Thanks, Dufferin bus, for driving me from the TTC on to my bike - I've lost 10 pounds and dramatically improved my reflexes and cardiovascular fitness!
