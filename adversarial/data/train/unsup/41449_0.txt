I stopped by Teriwoki yesterday after finishing work. \n\nI got the beef fried rice and the boyfriend got the chicken yakisoba. Both were sooooo good. The fried rice, you get a choice of two vegetables. I chose cabbage and broccoli (the other two vegetables they offered were bean sprouts and pineapple).  The fried rice was all freshly made and was nicely flavored and had a little bit of charring from frying it in the wok. YUM! \n\nMy boyfriend's yakisoba was even more delicious. It was not drowned with any type of teriyaki sauce and had a lot of fresh vegetables in it. It had cabbage, broccoli, carrots, and bean sprouts. \n\nThe next time, I want to get the teriyaki bowl. I didn't see until after I ordered that they offer it with brown rice for a $1 more. \n\nThe woman who took our order was very sweet and funny. The interior is very clean and you can tell they just newly opened this year. I remember in May, seeing their door and laughing because it said \"AH = Poke\" and we were like wtf o_0. They didn't have poke... so I don't know why that was on the door then. \n\nAnyway, will be back. The prices are decent at about $7.95 for yakisoba and fried rice, and $5.95-6.95 for the teriyaki bowls.
