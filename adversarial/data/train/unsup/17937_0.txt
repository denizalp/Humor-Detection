We were trying to find a Mexican restaurant in Henderson & stumbled on this place thru Yelp. We  really enjoyed it.  It's one of those places where you order at the counter & they bring your food. It was much better in that the restaurant area was very inviting, they have a bar (good margaritas) & the food was excellent. Wish they had one by mountains edge!
