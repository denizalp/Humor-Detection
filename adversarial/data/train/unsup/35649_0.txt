I went here because I had a nipple piercing reject and wanted to get it redone.  They did not pierce me initially.  The piercer, whose name I can't remember, pierced it completely lower and deeper than my left piercing.  I was completely uneven.  This cost me 70 dollars not including a tip.  6 months later I got it repierced AGAIN at In the Blood instead and now I'm completely even and it only cost 40.\n\nHot Rod was clean and sterile and the piercer was fun to talk to but I could not recommend this to anyone if symmetry is important to you.\n\nUPDATE: I received a message from Hot Rod on Yelp apologizing for the service I received and offering to repierce me free of charge.
