\"Despite what Phoebe from Friends believed, lobsters aren't monogamous. 'Sometimes they'll have multiple parentage.'\"\n\nLobsters are a great source of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.  If you hold the butter, lobsters aren't fattening. Three and a half ounces only have 96 calories and about two grams of fat.  But when you go and see The Maine Lobster Lady, we're not thinking about these things.  No way.  Give me that lobster on that butter roll!  On a chilly November night, we finally got around to trying this beloved food truck.  We shared a Traditional Maine Lobster Roll [served cold on a warm buttered roll with a touch of lemon aioli], a Connecticut Style Lobster Roll [served warm on a warm butter roll with warm butter drizzled on top], and a Blueberry Lemonade.  They charge the market price so prices vary [$18\/roll on the night we went].\n\nSo the lobster rolls themselves were amazing.  Giant chunks of sweet lobster meat... Oh my goodness.  This is why the Maine lobster reigns supreme.  I got to say that I enjoyed the Connecticut Style more than the Traditional Maine Lobster because butter... duh!  That and because it was a chilly night so the warmth was appreciated.  As for that Blueberry Lemonade, it was delightfully refreshing.  It paired perfectly with the sweet lobster and slaw.\n\nDiana is such a charismatic lady with a great lobster roll.  I had placed the order under my name so when I was claiming a standing table nearby and sent the guys to grab the food, she playfully winked at them and called them Joyce.  Love it!
