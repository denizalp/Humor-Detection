-------- REVIEW FOR THEIR NEW HRH SUITES ONLY---------\n\nHard Rock followed suit with Mandalay, Ph, MGM and built up suite towers to help set themselves apart. They started naming themselves \"cool\" names like Ph, HRH, Skylofts, Signature etc. =D HRH is about 1.5miles from the main strip. \n\nI nearly SWOONED when I walked into our suite. It could not get any more freakin' fantastic (well, I guess it could but for $90\/night...)\n\n... Built in music console on the wall \n   A touch screen console next to the table that has super great rock, oldies, and pop music play lists built in. Hubby & I rocked out to Blink 182 songs and some other \"oldies\" once we got in!\n\n...Super comfortable king bed w\/ down pillows \n    WOW. WOW... and WOW. It's so comparable to the bed we have at home. I slept SO well.. super comfy... it was even topped with a down mattress topper (haha... yeah, we opened it up and checked the listed materials). \n\n...HUGE bathroom\n   separate toilet, shower, and soaking tub. I LOVED the grooves.. loved the lighting. loved everything. This could be its own room in it of itself! Shower could definitely fit 3-4 people in it!!! lol Loved the toiletries! \n\n...Furniture \n  SQUEAL! ... Large leather sectional. I jumped up and down on them hehe. =P 2 flat screen tvs... you know in case you want to watch something the other person doesn't! \n\n...POOL AREA \n   WOW . I was impressed. Huge adult lounge pools (4-5). Music was playing from above too ...loved it! It felt like being at a beach club w\/o cover. \n\nBUT... I did not like people drinking in the pool (ugh) and that there were SO MANY PEOPLE there (could barely move around)...on Sundays it's used for their beach club Rehab. This pool is not kid friendly (bouncer wouldn't let me in unless I showed him my ID!)\n\n\nPARKING -- FREE SELF PARK. HRH has its own parking lot on the south side (don't park in the Hard Rock casino\/hotel area as it's quite a distance to traverse). \n\nRESORT FEE is $15\/day which includes internet access. \nUse of the gym is extra though (first time I heard of that)... only time I haven't used a gym at a hotel!!! \n\n\nI love just love the vibe of this place ... from its off the wall rocked out decor, to the interesting people, to seeing cool memorabilia, to the awesome views.... a definite must stay! Will definitely return!
