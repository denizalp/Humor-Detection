I only ever get takeout here and although they can be slow at times, I think they do their best to move the line along. I love Bubble Republic for their unique drinks. They also carry the more traditional black\/green teas and chiller flavours but my absolute favourite is the smash oatmeal chiller with mixed tapioca. It's a filling drink and a must get when we decide on bubble tea in Mississauga. I would recommend getting less ice if opting for a juice tea as they tend to be watered down in my experience.
