One of the largest poker rooms on the Strip.  I'd guess there are probably 3 dozen tables here.  I was there at 4 am last Saturday and almost all the tables were full.  I played my usual NL 1-2.  MGM attracts mostly younger players with small to medium bank rolls, so you're not going to get into any crazy thousand dollar pots with old guys like at the Wynn.  I don't think there are any jackpots or anything like that.  They also have sit & go games.  One thing to note is that this poker room is very loud.
