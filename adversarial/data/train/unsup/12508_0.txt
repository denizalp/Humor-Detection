We were in search of some accent tiles for our shower. All we needed were the tiles and we'd be on our way as this was a DIY job. We called ahead of time to see if the show room was open and the woman that answered the phone informed us that the show room was just for people who wanted to do the tile themselves. It almost seemed like she was trying to deter us from shopping with them because we didn't need them to do the installation. Either way, we went to the show room which was a terrible experience as soon as we walked in. The man at the desk almost seemed to sink down in his chair and avert his eyes to avoid helping us. He never actually said a word to us, despite several obvious attempts to ask questions loudly about prices etc, until we approached him. When we asked him if he had a price sheet, he told us no, as if we were insane for wanting to know how much the tile was. He explained that we couldn't just buy tile. We had to make an appointment and a salesperson would have to come down with samples. Considering we already knew what we wanted and we didn't need them to install I felt like we had just wasted time driving there and walking around the show room. I've done business with them before and the Salesman was aggressive and annoying so the last thing I wanted was a sales pitch at my dining room table that would ultimately be a waste of time. I'll NEVER do business with express flooring ever again. \n\nNext time someone walks in with money to spend.... maybe you should sell them something or don't waste their time. Your competitor got a pretty decent tile order out of us today.
