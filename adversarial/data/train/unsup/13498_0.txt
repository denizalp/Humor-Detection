Unbelievable. There are so many things going down at this spot, its pretty shocking I have never heard about it until now. This review is for the movie experience and a partial look-see at the lounge during this past Saturday.\n\n~What To Do~\nThere are 4 distinct options. 1-Drink, 2-Drink and Dance, 3-Drink and watch a movie, or 4-Drink and nod your head to the music in the lounge...\n\n\n~The Good~\nWe chose option 3, which was a perfect experience. My fiance and I chose to go see \"The Room\" for the first time with a couple friends, and I was worried that it would be a quiet theater. Nope. Spoons were flying everywhere, people heckling the screen, it was perfect. I felt right at home with the screaming and heckling, it made the movie such an outstanding experience. The beer was not too expensive, and they had a lot of beers on tap. I went with an Orange Blossom brew, and I am now in love with it. They also have wine, once again, so many options to go with. Also regarding customer service, the barkeep let me try a swig of a brew I was eying. He was awesome, and got an extra couple bucks tip, for I remember him being the one whom let me also go in to see the theater earlier in the week (I was curious). They are all about making the guest happy, customer service was quick and fast. The ambiance of the theater and the lounge is very different, it exudes a local independent joint. Beanbags to lay down on are inside the theater as are high tops to sit with friends at. Its a simple yet shockingly exciting environment to be in. \n\n~The Bad~\nMy only issue is that they really have a big problem with noise coming from the lounge ((during)) the movie. That would be a big no-no, if you ask me. At times the bass and sheer noise from the lounge would envelop the theater, which was annoying at times. I know you are a bar, and that's cool, but damn that music is loud. Turn it down a bit and save your eardrums.\n\n~The Down Low~\nOverall, this place is a solid 5 stars, however the noise issue knocks it down to a 4.5. They are part bar, its OK, I get it. The drinks are reasonably priced, its movie selection is spot-on, and the customer service is strong. Its an awesome ambiance, the atmosphere really meshes well, regardless of the reason for being there. Craft brews and movies go well, this is for sure. They have a check-in special on Yelp as well, which I failed to notice prior to ordering up my beer. Total Me-fail. I highly recommend this spot to watch your next cult classic. I can't wait for \"The Room\" to come again, because God knows I will be there. Having to wait for it on the calendar is, as you guessed, \"Tearing me apart, Lisa!\"
