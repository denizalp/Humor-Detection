I guess that it's about time to write a review for this place. \n\nI had originally be taken to Vin room on 4th street years ago by Jeff. A co-worker of mine told me about the new location closer to me in Bragg Creek. \n\nWe have been here twice now and would definitely go back. The ambiance is great, not too loud and has interesting decor. The food is wonderful for sharing and there are a BUNCH of veggie options that don't lack on the side of taste. \n\nIf you're not drinking the pricing works out pretty cheap. The wine selection is vast however, expensive so not for the faint of heart. Also, I'm not a HUGE wine-o so I think that there are probably a lot of aficionado's that would like it here for the vino selection. \n\nI'm a classic cocktails gal myself. \n\nGood location. Lots of parking. If you're early enough you don't need reservations, I would call ahead just in case especially on the weekends.
