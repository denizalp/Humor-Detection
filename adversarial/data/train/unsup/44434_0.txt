Wow.  This is my favorite place to eat in Lakewood.\n\nI am a vegetarian and order the Gobi Manchurian every single time, because there's no better dish anywhere.   I introduced my co-workers to it, now almost everyone (mostly carnivores) order this same cauliflower dish because it's so delicious.  There's nothing else like it.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and the food is to die for. Highly recommend!
