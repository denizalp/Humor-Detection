I have never had my eyebrows threaded before, but after reading all these good reviews, I thought I would try this place. I walked in 45 minutes before closing hoping to get in and I did. I forgot to get her name, but she is thin and very sweet. She did an amazing job with my brows and it was so clean. I have yet to see my brows this clean before. I asked her about how to help my brows grow because my brows have been not growing right in the inner corner. I will definitely be back again.
