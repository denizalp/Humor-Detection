Enjoy the carpet, but don't take your shoes off.\nDispensary feels like drinking in your grandpa's basement.\n\nLove this place for the atmosphere, the lighting and the music.\nBe concerned about the inconsistent service and lack of selection.\n\nTIP: Go for cocktails, not a beer spot.\n\nThe food is typically excellent, so much so, that my favorite thing on the menu is the Tavern Ham & Cheese, a basic, however elegant dinner.\n\nA recent Saturday night featured a live jazz band and some lively locals.\nWe also face an inundated and scattered server. it was honestly more effective to get up from our table and get out drinks from the bar.\n\nThis used to be my go to spot 2 years ago, however, every time things change, it takes a while to adjust.
