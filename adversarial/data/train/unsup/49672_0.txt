I had the prime rib, which was delicious but definitely more medium well than the medium rare I ordered.  Good service.  We had to wait awhile for our food.  The jalape√±o creamed corn is TO DIE FOR.  You can smell the smoke from the casino floor in the restaurant, which is a little annoying.  I would come back because the quality of the cuts of meat is excellent.
