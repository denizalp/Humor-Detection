Competitively priced great service! \n\nDropped my phone and oddly didn't crack the screen but broke the LCD. Over 8 stores responded but Samir replied within minutes of my request with the lowest rate! $50 cheaper than some stores. \n\nI dropped off my phone this afternoon and he fixed it in 30 minutes. \n\nHighly recommended. Thank you!
