As another Yelper said, don't be alarmed that this establishment is in a casino, it is worth the trip there. The service from Fredrick was exceptional, all we're on point! Food was fabulous, we were a party of four and everyone was very pleased with their meals. We will be back, the only downfall of the evening was wading through the sea of smoke to and from the restaurant, but Waverlys itself is smile free.
