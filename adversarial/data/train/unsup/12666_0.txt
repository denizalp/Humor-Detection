When Steve Wynn built the Mirage back in 1989, he wanted his guests to be bring the tropical themed resort to Vegas as a retreat from the desert and the atrium is one of the last remenants of the old Mirage before MGM had taken over and changed the vibe of the resort.\n\nBut anyways this is a great place to relax from the casino and the club and just unwind just listening to the waterfall and the water flowing under the bridge and smelling the tropical plants feels like a breath of fresh air away from the smokey casino and the Vegas heat.
