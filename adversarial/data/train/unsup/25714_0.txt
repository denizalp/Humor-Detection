I have been going to this Ace for 5 1\/2 years now for lots of different thing I've needed for the house and for garage projects.... even for odd nuts & bolts for my Harley.  They have always, always, always been great help and reasonably priced on everything.  ALWAYS!!   Im so glad I don't have to go to Depot or Lowes, like I do when I'm out on jobs around town sometimes.  They are a pain to deal with and have only gotten worse over the years.  I love my local Ace!! I cant believe people would drive from Southern Highlands to Depot or Lowes and waste at least an hour of your time in traffic and crowded store for a couple bucks savings!!  Your gas will cost more than that... and your sanity costs much more.
