This theatre is so clean and organized and cool looking! Also--it's inside a mall!!! You can shop, and then watch a movie. That **** doesn't happen at Fashion Show! :P\n\nThat staircase up is a workout though! Kidding, haha! But it is if you're weighed down by some purchases! \n\nIt is really nice for a stop after a huge shopping splurge. Boyfriends that you dragged along to the mall are really into that movie date; after all, their credit cards need some breathing ;] haha!!
