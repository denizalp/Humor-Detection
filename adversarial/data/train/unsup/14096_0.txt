Donair Pizza. Tandori Pizza. I'm almost tempted to learn how to play the guitar, put on a ridiculous mascot outfit and stand on a street corner flagging people to come and visit Awesome Kitchen. Since my last review I've been reunited with this post-drinking hallowed ground and I realized something...Ali's pizza is REAAAAALLLY GOOD. Yes, that means I've been eating Awesome Kitchen Pizza SOBER.\n\nI hope the prices stay because at the end of the night, you need to find a place to get rid of all that loose change in your pocket. Also if they invented mouth band-aids I'm sure I'll be coming here much more often.
