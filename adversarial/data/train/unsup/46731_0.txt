I ordered flowers for my husband but found out last minute that his office hours changed the day of the scheduled delivery. Flowers by Renee came to the rescue and got the delivery done early without any problems. The flowers were fresh and beautiful. I will never use 1800 Flowers Again :). Thanks for your help guys. I am a loyal fan.
