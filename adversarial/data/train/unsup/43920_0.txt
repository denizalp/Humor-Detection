We had been waiting months for this place to open. When it finally did we stopped in. Now my wife is GREEK\/TURKISH so she knows gyro\/doner. We knew it was probably going to  be middle eastern and not Greek or Turkish but we wanted to check it out anyway. \nI placed an order for the gyro and a gyro plate.  We were expecting gyro meet sliced from a typical cone of gyro meat. What we got was randomly cut up chunks of meat that felt like it had been thawed in a microwave and then placed in front of the heating element. It didn't even look like the rotisserie was  turning. Pieces of the meat were cold and I don't think it was the TON of cucumber yogurt sauce it was drowning in. It also suffered from a ridiculous amount of onion. Now I expect a healthy amount of onion on a gyro but I may as well have had a half an onion on the side to bite into. The lady taking my order was extremely nice and that's why this place is getting 1 star but the guys in the kitchen let her down because it took a long time to get our food. They have the potential to be good because the flavor is there but they need to fix some issues.
