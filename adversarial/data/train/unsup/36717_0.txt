I've ordered a few things from their menu so far.  Their specialty pizza's are awesome.  I've had their gyro and buffalo chicken; both of which, were great.  Their pizza dough is great, maybe store bought but it doesn't matter.  Once their was too much flour on it, but that was it. \n\nI didn't like their Italian sub though, just seemed like lower quality meats on it and american cheese.
