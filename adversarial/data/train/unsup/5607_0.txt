The staff at Bouncy World was very rude, and presents themselves as bad asses that have a business, when in actuality they are just rude and will probably be out of business soon.  The idea that there is no signage when you walk in, grey atmosphere, and the cheesy bounce houses that come from a random party supply store turned me off right away. \nIf this place is meant for children,  make it look festive and fun, not like a prison.\n\nNot allowing your guests to bring in water is also not a good way to create a community, especially when water is $2.00 in a Styrofoam cup. Water in  Las Vegas is essential, and water for your children is essential!!\n\nOur friend was playing with his son, and the staff member rudely told him he couldn't play basket ball because he didn't have a red bracelet, what??? he has to pay $12.00 to throw a ball with his son??\n\nAlso the no shoe policy for the adults is a no go- going to the bathroom with no shoes on is not my idea of fun.\n\nAdvice to management, when a customer voices concerns, apologize and make them happy, don't argue with them and bring it back on the guest. We were told to go ahead and write on their Facebook.. ehh work on your customer services.\n\nThere are many other amazing places you can take your children to on a nice rainy day.
