Well. This place is located in the shady part of Vegas. It is completely off the strip, very few cabs run through the casino, and the entire property itself feels a little run down.\n\nBUT, they have an amazing steak deal. Based on other reviews, I think their steak special is offered at mysterious hours, but when I went, a steak dinner was $5.99 and that it stupid cheap. The steak dinner comes with a slab of steak, your choice of potatoes, eggs, and toast...all for $5.99. Did I mention that the steak wasn't chewy and pretty good? Yes. All of that can be yours. I also ordered a beer which was surprisingly priced at a whooping $2.50! They're practically giving away food and drinks here.\n\nIf you're drunk and adventurous, come here- definitely do, but I wouldn't make this a destination spot by any means. Ellis Island is one of the very few Vegas spots that lives up to the 24 hour steak joint and they do make a mean one.
