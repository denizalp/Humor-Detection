A fun place for good food and games\n\nJJs Grill is a fun place to meet with friends\/family and enjoy good food. JJ's Grill has a variety of billiards, dart boards, poool tables, TV's,  and games to keep everyone entertained.\n\nOn this visit my friends and I shared Fried zucchini and ranch dressing, honey barbecue wings, fish and chips basket, and a club sandwich.  All our entrees were  fresh and seasoned just right. The price was also great, the staff was friendly and the place was very clean!  I cant wait to visit again.
