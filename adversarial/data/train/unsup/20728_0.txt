The food was great, so was the service and I love the design and overall vibe of the restaurant.\nTheir manifesto is clearly proclaimed on the chalkboard-esque walls. Fresh and real food is their promise - and our meal was just that.\nI went here with a couple of girlfriends while shopping in the market. \nThe Jerk-inator (I may be paraphrasing\/making that name up) was a spicy burger with a ring of grilled pineapple on top, that my friend really enjoyed.\nI had the special- goat cheese and lamb burger! YUM I love lamb, and goatcheese, and this burger was a great combo.\nMy other friend had a classic burger, which she liked as well.\nThe fries are fresh and yummy!\nCheck it out!!
