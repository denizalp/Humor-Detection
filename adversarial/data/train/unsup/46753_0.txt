I've been here more than 10 times. I have recommended this place for family and friends because the gelato is SO good and the service is SO welcoming! All of the gelato is dairy and nut free. My favorite flavor would have to be Blueberry Cheesecake! I'm lactose intolerant and my friend has a peanut allergy so it's like, the perfect place for us!\n\nTheir one downside is that they took out smoothwave! Please bring back smoothwave!
