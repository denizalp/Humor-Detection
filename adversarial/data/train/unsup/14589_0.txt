Once upon a time Fleming's was the place culinary dreams are made of, but alas things are a changin'! \n\nThe last couple times I've visited I was increasingly unimpressed. \nJust last week I took my husband for his birthday dinner as we do every year. Boy what a let down. \n\nLets start with the raggedy family wearing their beanies and Harley Davidson baseball caps that was seating right in front of me............ \n\nHello Dress Code......Manners......Anyone?? \nWhy did I bother dressing to the nines? I could have worn  my pajamas and nobody would have cared. \n\nThat right there just made me feel I might as well have went to Black Angus. \n\nNow for the waiter who lacked the experience and training to be serving in a fine dining establishment. \n\nHe was HORRIBLE!!! \nUnprofessional, Inattentive, and Careless to sum it up. He was so interested in my nationality that he had to ask me my heritage, then made a point to reference something Greek each time he returned to the table.......So Annoying! \n\nNot to mention bringing me dirty water and wine glasses, even the little wine decanter they bring your wine in was dirty. \n\nNow for my salad, I always order the Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato salad, this time it was apparent they improvised, the mozzarella was not near the quality it usually is and instead of sweet sliced tomatoes and fresh basil it came with chopped grape tomatoes on top of shaved cucumber. (see pics) \n\nI really should have complained, but being the Hubby's birthday I wanted to spare him the scene. \n\nFor my entree I decided on the Chefs Mixed Grill, Petite fillet, Tempura Shrimp and Seared Scallops. Although as always I asked to replace the steak with an extra shrimp and scallop as I don't eat beef. \n\nI got a plate of SIX GIANT scallops and three shriveled shrimp. \nI had to send it back because I was told I was getting Tempura Shrimp and these shrimp were not. \n\nThey returned it to me quickly but still was overkill on the scallops (see pics) in the pic you cant see the other side of the plate had 3 more scallops. I would have like another shrimp instead. \n\nMy Hubby's steak was perfect for him, but he too was very disappointed in all the things I've stated above. \n\nNow for the biggest let down of all. \nNormally for Special Occasions they will bring out their signature Creme' Brulee and Chantilly Cream with a candle. \n\nNOT ANY MORE! BOO! \n\nWe got a cheesy little gold box with four tiny, crappy chocolate covered strawberries....Not a Fan. \n\nAfter this experience I'm sorry to say that we will not be going back ever again. They are lucky to be getting these three stars.
