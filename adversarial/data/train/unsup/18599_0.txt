Strippers and drag queens can't be wrong: This is the best place to get wigs and hair pieces. I've been here several times before as a place to browse the various wigs. So, Sunday, after dim sum, I came here to get a wig for a \"talent show\" at my family reunion. [My mom and I are reenacting the scene from \"Drop Dead Gorgeous\" where the nurse is pushing a wheelchair with last year's Mt Rose Sarah Rose American Teen Princess is lip syncing to Melissa Manchester's \"Don't Cry Out Loud\"--I'll be in the wheelchair] Not only did I find the perfect wig, it was amazingly affordable. For less than $30, I'll be able to make my dreams come true! I was actually able to wear this wig at a pool party that day; it was a big hit.
