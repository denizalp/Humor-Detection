I had read other reviews on here about Terrible's. I was torn whether or not to go there, but I was just intrigued. Now, what was I intrigued about? I was intrigued about how one yelper said this place was a magnet for Chinese guests whenever there is a famous Cantonese pop star in town for a concert. Now this I just had to see.\n\nI wanted to see what the attraction was all about, but when we got there it looked like any hotel you'd find on the old strip, just less sleazy and less ghetto. It wasn't smelly or musty inside. Since it was morning I thought we should check out their breakfast specials (if they had any). I stopped and asked a security guy where they were serving breakfast and he pointed us upstairs. Cafe on one side, buffet on the other.\n\nWe ventured up the escalators and we immediately noticed a sign for the buffet breakfast. At $4.99\/adult how could we refuse? It was only $2.99 for lil guy. The breakfast buffet was amazing for only 5 bucks. There was a station where you can have custom made omelettes and waffles. Here's a run down on what else was available: pancakes, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, corned beef hash, chicken fried steak, hash browns, fresh fruit salad, a bunch of canned fruits, cottage cheese, cream of wheat, oatmeal, and some other stuff I don't remember.\n\nI ordered a veggie omelet and they even had jalepenos which gave it such a nice little kick. On top of that they also threw in some fresh spinach. The omelets were huge and I wish I had taken a photo of it, but I was pretty hungry and forgot all about it.\n\nFor $5 it was absolutely a great deal. Hubby, lil guy and I ate for a total of $13. Drinks were free. We had OJ, iced tea and coffee, all included in that low low price. DAMN! I was so happy I gave the server a $5 tip. That's like 40% isn't it? HAHA. Terrible's was terribly good for breakfast that's for sure!\n\nHere's to yet another cheap but great meal in Vegas.
