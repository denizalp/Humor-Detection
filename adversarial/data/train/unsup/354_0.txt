when your east coast friend is visiting and tells you they're craving in n out, you have to find it in your heart to make it happen. i know, it's so hard, but someone has to do it. \n\nwhat i ate:\n- protein style cheeseburger, animal style: after eating plenty of snacks in the VIP lounge at my hotel, i wasn't that hungry. my friend suggested i get it protein style. \"it's just a snack without the buns!\" well said, friend, well said; just reinforcing the reason why we are friends. it was my first time having it protein style and i do like it. it's much more refreshing, but i would miss the buns if i was hungry. \n- fries well done: love getting my fries well done, more oil, but better texture\n\npros:\n- cheap! so afforadable\n- delicious!\n- this location was way less busy than the one further south on the 15. although my friends and i did go at 2 in the afternoon or so\n\ncons:\n- a ten min drive from the strip. oh the horror\n\nwould i come again? sure
