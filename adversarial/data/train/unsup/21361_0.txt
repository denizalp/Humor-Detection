This service is a god send. My vet ( Dr. Jody) took her time with my kitties, was compassionate, kind and thorough. Not only did she answer all my questions - she took time to review my cats current diet, recommending some better options and summarizing everything we discussed in a comprehensive receipt. For those of us who understand the stress of travelling with your pet to the vet that alone is worth paying a wee bit more for  the mobile visit. That said, it was excellent value - 2 cats, both complete exams, nail trims and one vaccine each came to $267.00 - Excellent value. Highly recommend this service, the staff and the concept.
