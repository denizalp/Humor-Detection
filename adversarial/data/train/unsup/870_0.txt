This used to be Cafe Mitz, a crappy looking yucky bento joint.  This place has been open about a month and is a total transformation - better paint job, nice hanging lamps, fancy tables, and looks just brilliantly clean.  The staff was so sweet to me.\n\nI ordered something I have been trying to find forever - dolsot bimibap!  It had beef and kimchi....the fried egg, the crispy rice, the seaweed....and the hot sauce!  Came with tofu-green onion miso.  I was offered a second bowl.  The dolsot pot was hot and sizzling - the yolk of the egg broke when I mixed it all together and it was tasty.  I really enjoyed this and the sauce, and was able to put plenty in a to go box for tomorrow's lunch.\n\nIt cost $8 with tax and was very tasty.  There are various bentos, teriyaki dishes, and korean dishes on the menu to try.  I would go back for sure.
