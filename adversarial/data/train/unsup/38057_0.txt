Every time I step into this shop, I feel like I'm in Paris.\nDelightful baked goods and macrons, croissants, and treats.\nEverything is shipped from France and baked in-house.\nA large selection of fine chocolates and petit fours!\n\nThere are a few tables if you want to stay for a coffee.\nThe shop is a short walk from Eglinton Station -  easier than flying to Europe!\n\nBon apetit! :D
