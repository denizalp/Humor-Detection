We are here years ago. We really enjoyed it then. Last night we took our entire team for dinner and it was amazing. \nWe ordered large plates of everything as it was a large group & the sizes were very generous! \nCalamari was fresh with a very zesty red sauce and everyone loved it. The pear salad was excellent. Anti-pasto salad was also a very big portion and it was really tasty. We also ordered Caprice salad for an appetizer... it was delicious mozzarella was very fresh  & really well seasoned. \n\nWe all loved the Spaghetti and the meatballs are huge. Supreme fettuccine Alfredo with chicken was delicious. Veal Parmesan  was crispy, tasty, and we ran out before it went around the table. Shrimp Diavolo was great and the Quattro Alforno platter was really enormous... deserts were the same story.  Large portions & delish;) \n\nI read some of the negative reviews before returning to this restaurant and I don't understand what they are talking about. \n\nJosh who took our original phone inquiry was so helpful. He referred us to Jordyn in banquets sales, she was also very helpful & suggested we order off the menu to save money. \n\nGretchen Heppler booked our reservation... She was great and even texted me information. It turns out she is their Regional Director of Sales.  \n\nOur server Sayed from was excellent, he was getting the food out quickly, refilling drinks and so kind. \n\nWe all want to go back... great restaurant which deserves to be well rated according to all 18 people who we hosted. \n\nThe bill including drinks was extremely reasonable for what we received. Could not ask for any better food or service.  Great Family style restaurant!!!
