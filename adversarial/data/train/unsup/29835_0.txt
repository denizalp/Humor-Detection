Oh airport food, why you have to be so bad...yet so good.\nBig burrito's. Sloppy nachos. \nBest choice for eats in the B concourse, but be prepared for some stomach grumblings afterwards...in a good way...sort of.\nI will try not to make it a habit to eat here, but only because I know bad habits are hard to break. \nI like cheese.
