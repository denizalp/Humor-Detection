What an awesome event!  So many local artists and vendors... Its like the weekly farmer's market on holiday steroids.  I bought sugar scrubs from Slather, jewelry from multiple vendors including one who acid washes copper to turn it an awesome turquoise color , and some pottery from a hippy couple based out of Ajo, AZ.  There were food vendors with fresh produce, baked goods, popcorn, chocolate (Nutwhats and Stone Ground are amazing), granola, oats, spices, jams and jellies... You name it, you'll find it local at Phoestivus.  You will also find a multitude of food trucks serving up some delicious fare.  I did not partake in the beer booth, but if you do you'll need to stand in a long line for a 21+ bracelet and then in another line for beer.  So if you're partner is the shopaholic and you need a beer to cope, Phoestivus has provided that for you. =)  Yelp was there offering to wrap if you purchased something as a gift too!
