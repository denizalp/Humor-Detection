I wish I could give zero! The only positive thing was the friendly shuttle driver. Don't fall for their low rates. Mandatory full coverage insurance makes it up for you! Close to $200 for 4 days??? How are they planning to stay in this business???Slow, young, unprofessional staff make you wait for a long time. This was my first and will be the last time I rent cars from them.
