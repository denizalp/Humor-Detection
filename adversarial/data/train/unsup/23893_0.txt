Holy crap......this was one of the better times I've ever had at ANY social outing and the majority of that was due to this club crawl and the people working it. Right from the get go when we checked in Jessica who was running the crawl was super friendly and bubbly setting the stage for a fun time. The general feel for everyone that was attending that night was of partying and having fun. The clubs we hit were all terrific and their normal cover was $15-$30 each so right there it was worth it. The comments about not having to wait in line and heading straight in were dead on accurate...pure VIP status. As we walked from one venue to another through the casino everyone within the crawl was pretty wasted by the 2nd club and yelling, dancing, pretty much being highly obnoxious in the middle of a casino while people were trying to play at tables and slots and just staring wondering what we were doing and who the hell we all were and of course security couldn't do a damn thing. We got separated (see drunk and lost) from the party on several occasions but were able to find the next spot and catch up with them again bypassing lines outside and just walking right in. My buddies and I even made some $$ on the party bus that shuttled us from on club to another as it had a stripper pole and the majority of the people crawling with us were women who wanted to see us lose some clothes! Overall 6 stars for this company, their employees and their events!!! Thanks guys I will definitely be back again!
