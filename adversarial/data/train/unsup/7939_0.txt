Starbucks is gone, and the neighbourhood felt a big sigh of: Yes! The chain gang are moving out! That's the best part of Toronto, as a neighbourhood gets cooler it doesn't get more Starbucks, it kicks em' out. But wait, what's moving in?\n\nNatrel Mik Bar. Yes, like that Natrel, like the big boys of milk. Huh. That's random. We popped in and had a milkshake, which was pretty meh. Made from strawberry syrup and milk, I believe. Nothing to write home or to Yelp about. \n\nBut the interior... Dang, I'll give it to them. Sleek booths, long couches, little tables and so many outlets for your remote working needs. What about AC? Yeah that, too. Wifi? Champion levels. So, I guess I will be back for a coffee and an egg on somethin' one morning because this place is A-OK.
