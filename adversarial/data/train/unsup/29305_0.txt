Pretty good for uber eats Chinese food. I got the chicken in black bean, white rice ots, and Shanghai noodles. \nThe black bean was great, not too salty, the veggies was alot vs chicken ratio. \nThe Shanghai noodles I didn't love. It was bland not much flavor going on, deadish in a sense. Not alot of cabbage, lots of big pieces of green onion.
