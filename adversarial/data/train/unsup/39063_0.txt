Be aware...Be aware.Be aware \nI wish I could give lower than a stat to this Hustler company. RightToyota is the biggest spam on the Earth. They always try to steal your car (take it for free) by giving you a fake price for the wanted car( first, they add your car trade in value to the wanted car price then subtract your car value when the take your car) so they will pay zero dollars for your car. Plus their prices are the highest in the valley. \n\nI bought a car from them three years ago they played the same game with me, but because I was new in America and I thought all Americans are impartial, so I believed them. \n\nLast year, they sold me an extra two-year pre-paid maintenance, but after only 12 months (Four maintenance), they told me it's expired. \n\nLast month, they sent me a check in the mail saying that they would buy my car for $18000. When I went there, they said I need to triad-in my car to get this offer, and when I asked about the cost of the Highlander lease they gave me ($500) per month (((plus )))my 2013 Avalon. And this would be even more expensive than the leasing a Maserati.
