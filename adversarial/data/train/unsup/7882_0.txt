I walked in on a Saturday evening expecting it to be packed and for every worker to be too busy and stressed to give any descent amount of customer service. But I had my ticket checked by a younger gent, I believe his name was Sam and he was very friendly yet professional already making me feel better about my Saturday night movie experience. Then I looked over at concessions and there he was. A man. Tall and handsome. He had this smile and friendly disposition and I couldn't help but to stare. I waited in his line to make sure I could have his hazel eyes gaze into mine. His name tag read Blake and I just thought that they spelled God wrong. He asked me if I wanted to become a stubs member and I couldn't say no to his beautiful face with his luscious hair. When he handed me my popcorn I felt like I was going to faint. All I wanted to do was reach over and grab his hand instead of the popcorn. I try and go to this theater every weekend because he usually works those nights and sometimes I don't even go to my movie. I just stand in the hall and I stare. Definitely worth the money!
