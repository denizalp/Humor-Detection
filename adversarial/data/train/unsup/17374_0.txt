Since I am a fan and somewhat addicted to Red Mango, so it's only natural I check out the Las Vegas Red Mango location during my trip there.  \n\nCompared to the other froyo places, Red Mango has the most creamy and delicious yogurt around.  They also take pride in having fresh fruit to add as toppings.  Out of the three different flavors they offer (Original, Green Tea, and Pomegranate), Original is my favorite. Add some mochi and blueberries and you got yourself a winner.  I've also tried the Pomegranate flavor and it's pretty good as well.\n\nThe owner at this location seemed really cool and down to earth.  She was really nice and defiantly hooked it up with the toppings.  The portions were extremely generous.  I haven't checked out any other froyo place during my trip in Vegas, but seriously is there a need? Didn't think so.\n \nSummary: Best froyo shop around!
