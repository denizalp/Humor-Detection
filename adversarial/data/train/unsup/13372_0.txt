I have been to a lot of buffets in my life. Some have been mediocre but most are just shitty (cardboard tasting carbs, everything covered in batter, canned goods, dishes where you can taste the freezer burn). I used to love buffets when I was a child (does everyone remember JJ North?). Buffets present a luxurious mindset; 'You can eat whatever you want and as much as you want!' - I think that's what drew me in when I was younger. As an adult, and many buffets later - there is always growing doubt when someone's dinner suggestion is a buffet place. \n\nI was in Las Vegas for work and after hearing a lot of positive feedback (not to mention the gushing reviews on here), I decided to try this place out. There was a line around 5pm, it took our small party of four about 25 minutes to get a table. \n\nI don't even know where to start - this buffet was huge and it was amazing. I ate about eight plates of food (my friends were baffled\/disgusted - sometimes I can't tell) and I have NO regrets. \n\nThey have a generous seafood station filled with king crab legs, clams, gigantic prawns (peeled for you!), fresh oysters...everything you have ever dreamed of in your seafood dreams, they have it. And boy, did I take advantage. \n\nAside from this amazing seafood station (I spent most of my time here), they have other excellent stations such as the dim sum station (VERY good shu mai - I was actually surprised), sushi station, pasta station, soup station...if you can think of something that they don't have, they will make it for you. How fantastic is that? My friend even visited the pho station - like what?! \n\nThe desserts were heavenly. Some of my favorites were the crème brûlée, churros filled with hot caramel (OMG), French macarons, Chinese egg tarts...okay, I need to stop - but you get the idea.\n\nTLDR; Best buffet I have ever been to, it lives up to the hype and you should go.
