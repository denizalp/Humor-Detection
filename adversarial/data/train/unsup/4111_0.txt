Chase and his team moved us about 6 months ago from our Summerlin home to a storage unit. I was, at first extremely satisfied with them until we recently had different movers un-pack it and move it to our new home. Countless furniture scratches and damages from the way they packed everything into a unit carelessly. Especially at the very end where it appears they became the most careless.  I inspected everything as it came off the truck before going into the storage unit and these were not here. When the new moving company came every time they took something out they would point out the damages to me immediately (I've included a few photos) probably about 20 notable damages in total from their packing job.  We also purchased a plastic sleeve for our mattress but they left open side down with our mattresses sitting on the dirty ground. There isn't much I can hold them accountable for as to my knowledge they aren't a real licensed and insurance moving company.   Sadly, I just have a lot of high end scratched furniture now, a badly damaged arm of sofa, dirty mattresses and a lesson learned.
