I love Noodle Asia!\n\nV E G A S  T R A D I T I O N\nEvery time the BF and I come to Vegas, Noodle Asia is ALWAYS one of our stops. The restaurant is open late (until 3am, I believe), which is a huge plus after a long night of gambling or partying. The food is delicious, and I'm not talking about when you're drunk and any food you shove into your mouth tastes like heaven. \n\nB E E F  N O O D L E  S O U P\nIf you like your soups spicy, order the beef noodle soup. The BF and his friends ALWAYS order this dish when they're here. Sensitive to spicy foods, that's okay! Give their BBQ Pork Fried Rice a try. So, I normally order the fried rice, and the BF shares a portion of the beef noodle soup with me. Those two dishes together make for the best combination, EVER!
