Here is the deal. If it's a nice day, go there and sit outside. The place has a really nice back patio with a waterfall. That part is great. The food is just ok. When they first opened it was really good. Now it's just average. A lot of the menu items have changed since the beginning, and most not for the better.  There are some meals there that are very good. I had a salad last time that I really enjoyed. But I have also had some meals that were really bad.  It's really hit or miss. The staff is nice. They do their best.  The food is the only real problem.
