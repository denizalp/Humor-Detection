If I ever need to find a rental again, I will be contacting Apartment Hunters. They did an excellent job handling work that needed to be completed in the last rental I lived in. Unfortunately a lot of people don't write reviews when things go right and are so quick to post negative reviews when things go wrong, which seems to be the case here.
