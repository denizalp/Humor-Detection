Seriously delicious! We went around 1130am on a Saturday and there was no one else in there. The service was quick and everyone was friendly. Great atmosphere. We ordered the street with king crab legs, crawfish and mussels and decided to mix all 4 sauces. It was amazing and we will definitely be regulars when we come to town. The specials\/happy hour on the weekdays is a great deal. Also, don't forget to check in on Yelp during the week for free oysters!
