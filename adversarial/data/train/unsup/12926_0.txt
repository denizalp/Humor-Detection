Believe it or not, locals gamble on the strip too. I don't gamble too often. But if I do, I almost never gamble on the strip. I recently was at the MGM and lost a big pot in poker. I knew I wasn't playing good and decided to hit up New York New York to get some of my losses back. Plus, I was hungry and thought that NYNY would have a lot of inexpensive food options.  I like the NYNY for their lower limit table games.  You can still find $5 Black Jack and 3 Card Poker for $5.  These limits are also available on the weekends.  This is good thing for tourist, gamblers on a budget, and people learning the table games. I played a few hands, got lucky enough to win about 75% of my original losses, and left.  By the way, I never did get anything to eat and still left hungry. \n\nThe casino has made a lot of upgrades on the outside with cool additions like The Park and T-Mobile Arena.  However, the inside of the casino hasn't changed much since they opened.  \n\nI really can't comment on the hotel rooms since it's been over 10 years since I stayed here.  I can say that the hotel rooms are a lot more affordable than the rest of the hotels on the strip. If you want the convenience of the strip without paying baller prices, then NYNY may be the place for you to stay at. \n\n2017 Yelp Review #86
