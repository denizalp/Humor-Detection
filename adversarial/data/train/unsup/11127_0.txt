Great little dark, dank & divey hole-in-the-wall biker bar that serves typical bar food, great drinks and has fantastic live music. We have been coming in here for years when we are in the area on Friday nights and will continue to do so. \n\nPros:\nBike parking\nLive music\nPeople watching\nModest dance floor \nTeeth optional\n\nCons:\nTeeth optional
