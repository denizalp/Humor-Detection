Hello pumpkin spice season!  Coffee Bean offers a wide variety of pumpkin spice options with either cold or hot coffee or tea selections. \n\nThis location offers free WiFi and both inside or patio seating. When the weather is nice, the patio seating is delightful when there aren't any smokers. \n\nThe employees are super friendly and knowledgeable about the different drink options. \n\nThis location was pretty busy Saturday morning and half of the yummy food items are gone. \n\nThey offer different drink specials so you don't have to break the bank for a gourmet cup of coffee. These specials are usually on a special day and time of the week. \n\nI ordered a large cafe americano with a shot of pumpkin spice for $2.50 which was delicious.\n\nI suggest arriving before 830am to get a good seat.
