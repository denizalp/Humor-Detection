I rarely write a review, but I'm a bit drunk and the food was delicious so here I go!\nI had the Jamaican jerk chicken sausage brat with pickled peppers along with fries, Siracha aioli and a black IPA. Basically I need to come back immediately and order the same thing! The brat was flavorful and spicy and the peppers were vinegary and delicious. The IPA was top notch. The waitress was sassy and ballsy which i adore. I will definitely be back with my husband and friends. Seems to be a kid friendly and dog friendly place on the patio as well, if you like that sort of thing. Sad I waited so long to try this place.
