Love it. Petite Maison rocks, the end. The design is cozy and refined and sexy, the staff are friendly and attentive, the service is super fast even when they are packed and the food is delicious. I've only been there late at night and hear great things about the brunch, but let me tell you, the escargot is fabulous, the salade maison is the perfect size and refreshing, and I tried a port-poached pear and creme fraiche dessert the last time I was there that was incredibly lively and light. \n\nThe parking is kind of tough because of competition from nearby bars and clubs, but there's always valet if you're impatient.
