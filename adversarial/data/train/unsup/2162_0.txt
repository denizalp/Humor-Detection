They do not have jello shots anymore (only on \"special occasions\") but I agree with all other reviews. Tina's is delightfully shady and the clientele is refreshingly diverse. Pool tournament players, a dirty thirty party, hipsters, and many other cleveland denizens made an appearance on a recent visit. Things got hopping after 1030. The karaoke was so bad it was good, although the wrong song sometimes got played. Beers are super cheap! There was a fight outside! A ridiculous young man asked us if we wanted to do \"some weird stuff\"! \n\nIt was fantastic. Highly recommended dive bar for the open minded.
