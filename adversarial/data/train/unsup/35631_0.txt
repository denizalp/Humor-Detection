It was okay. The place is pretty big. It is a Lynn Crawford airport restaurant. I ordered a peameal on a bun sandwich. Peameal reminds me of canadian ham. I guess that is where canadian ham originated? It wasn't too filling, but it wasn't that greasy. The fries were crispy. The service was friendly. Overall, I enjoyed my meal here as I was waiting for my flight.
