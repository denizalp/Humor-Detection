The taste of coffee is not great, but their pastries are better than other franchise coffee shops. I like their Green tea pastries collection. The place is very clean and has lots of space. I really like it. Neo Coffee Bar is located in a trendy area and there are many students in the bar. The bathroom is nice. The bathroom itself has a good space and clean. The bathroom is on the ground floor and I do not need to use narrow downstairs which we often have to use in coffee shops in downtown. It is hard to find a bathroom, but I feel happy when I find it!
