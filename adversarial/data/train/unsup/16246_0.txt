Overpriced, bland health food served in a cute, chic atmosphere.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the Cali Chicken Bowl and the Tocoa Steak Bowl for dinner. The protein portion that came with both bowls was just SO SMALL. Honestly...the bowls should really be renamed to something like \"quinoa\/farro bowls with a side of meat\" because that would be less disappointing. And to add insult to injury, the steak was automatically cooked to medium (borderline well-done) resulting in a sad, chewy mess. \n\nWe also ordered the \"Sweet Potato Hash\" to share which essentially was chopped boiled sweet potato. To salvage both of our bowls, my friend and I found ourselves dousing everything in Cholula - so, like, at this point, is it even healthy anymore? \n\nAs a Bay Area transplant, I have to compare Farm & Craft to Tender Greens in California (a chain that specializes in healthy, farm-to-fork cuisine) and say that F&C absolutely pales in comparison when it comes to flavor, portion size, and price point. \n\nKudos for being cute and having Instagrammable decor, but that's about it.
