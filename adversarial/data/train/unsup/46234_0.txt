Good walk-in clinic. I love that it's open late. Wait times are long but this is typical of walk-in clinics in Toronto (especially one that's open later than others, like this one). This walk-in is a one minute walk from the subway station which is very convenient. Pharmacy is right beside so it's easy to fill prescriptions. Also located here is other departments such family doctors (appointments only), different tests can be taken here (such as blood tests, etc.), lab on site as well. \n\nAll the doctors that I've had there have been nice and efficient, especially Dr. Lam. She is totally a lamb:). I had a common infection that I'm prone to (which I told her about) so I'm very familiar with the symptoms. She wanted me to go upstairs to the lab to take a sample just to make sure it hadn't progressed any further which I thought was extra nice. She's extremely friendly and doesn't just seem like she's there to \"do her job\" as a lot of walk-in doctors seem to be like. \n\nThe only complaint I have is that when you give your health card to the receptionist when checking in, they ask what your reason for visiting is. Not everyone likes to share their personal reason (and information) for wanting to see a doctor in front of the whole waiting room. Obviously if I'm walking in to a walk-in clinic, I'm there to see a doctor so I don't feel they need to know what the specifics are. Not much privacy there! Maybe instead of asking out loud, how about another approach? Maybe a form you can fill out? Other than that, no complaints here.
