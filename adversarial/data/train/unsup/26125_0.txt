I really like this place. We went here for dinner before going to a show. I had made reservations and we were seated promptly. Service was a little slow but good overall.\n\n I ordered the crab cakes and the antipasti plate. The crab cakes were delicious! Full of nice chunks of crab and it went perfectly with the fresh basil aioli it came with. The antipasti plate was very good, great selection of cured meats. The prosciutto and salami were spectacular and so was the fresh BURRATA!  This plate also came with some marinated vegetables and some grilled bread. It all went very well together. My only complaint is that they only give you 3 slices of grilled bread for the whole plate of antipasti, the meat to bread ratio was a little off. My boyfriend got the Prime Burger and i had a bite, it was soooo good! The meat was cooked perfectly and the condiments it came with made it even better, I especially liked the coleslaw the put in the burger. We will definitely be back, they also have a late night menu that would be worth checking out.
