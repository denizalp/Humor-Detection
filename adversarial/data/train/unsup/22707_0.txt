I stopped in with some friends for a late dinner with some friends. What immediately caught my eyes were the BBQ Tacos given I figured that would an interesting unique item to eat. I ordered a trio, the Smoked Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Smoked Chicken for my tacos, and we shared some sweet potato fries. Both the Brisket and Pork tacos were $2.75, and the chicken was $2.50, and the small sweet potato fries cost $2.50.\n\nI liked the tacos, each having their pros and cons. I ate the pulled pork taco first and the meat was good, and they put plenty of the of it in the taco. However, the coleslaw, which I liked, was very saucy. The taco quickly became drenched and sauce just kept dripping out at each bite. The pork was tender and had good flavor. Three Stars..\n\nThe Brisket taco came with tender smokey beef, but the meat had to much salt. To make sure, I pulled out of few pieces of brisket to eat on its own, and yes unfortunately is was the meat. This taco also came with the good coleslaw and suffered from the same heavy sauce. Three Stars...\n\nThe Smoked Chicken taco was my by far my favorite. It came with an abundant of tender plump pieces of flavor juicy chicken. This too had a lot of sauce from the coleslaw, but the sheer amount of tasty chicken, quickly made up for that. Great taco and an easy four stars.\n\nThe sweet potato fries were good. They had a nice crispy exterior and soft center and were well seasoned. Service was hit and miss. It was friendly and efficient at the counter, but there not able to get our food to the table simultaneously, so we politle waited for everyone to have their orders, before we began to eat. \n\nIn the end, everything was okay, but it doesn't mean it could of been better.
