After a long drive from Las Vegas to glendale, this was our stop to eat and find a hotel to stay in. Reviews looked good so we gave it a shot. My 2 friends, originally from guadalajara,  said their tortas ahogada wasn't authentic. I had a torta Mexicana. Really liked my sandwich. Very flavorful. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Might haven given 5 stars if my friends thoroughly enjoyed their meals, but I'm sticking with 4  the prices are very reasonable and there is a wide variety of menu items. Something for everyone. Next time I'm in the neighborhood I would pop in and have another go at their menu.
