I've visited Local several times before and have never had a bad experience. The food is always tasty and service is never an issue. \n\nMy last visit was no different. We sat upstairs on the patio (first time) and I was amazed by how big and open it was. Not only is there an abundance of extra seating, but a second bar! Very convenient! \n\nWhat I love about Local is there ever-changing menu and ability to incorporate local fresh food. Definitely a huge plus! I ordered the Three Rivers Burger and OMG... was it good! A delicious burger sandwich between a pretzel loaded with cheese, peppers and more! If you're into spicy foods, this is for you! What more can you ask for?! All sandwiches are served with a side of homemade chips but you can substitute for fries for a few extra bucks. Even though it sucks paying extra, it's well worth it! They even have sweet potato fries! \n\nFor drinks, all Absolute products were on special for $4 during our visit on Friday night so I ordered a vodka\/sprite. Tasty! My boyfriend, however, got an AMAZING Cucumber Melon Smash cocktail (Muddled cucumber and lemon, Effen Cucumber Vodka, melon liquor and honey syrup with a splash of lemonade garnished with a cucumber and lemon). It was one of the best drinks I've ever tasted. So refreshing and light, yet enough to get you feeling good! \n\nTwo burgers\/fries and three drinks ended up being around $50, however after the Groupon we purchased, the bill was $20. Always look for Groupon deals because they're actively for sale (we got the $19 for $30 deal).
