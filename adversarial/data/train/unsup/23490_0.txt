I had a terrible experience here on 2\/8\/2107. First of all I'm pretty sure the bar is way understaffed or staffed with in incompetent bartender. The bar back and food runner was more attentive than the bar tender.\n\nI got drinks on a, I'll help you when I can help you basis, but the order wasn't what I ordered at all. A professional restaurant would have a drinks bartender and a bar bartender on staff- no excuses! This is FEZ management and ownership's problem.\n\nI also asked about the wifi, which wasn't working (to be refreshed) and in over an hour no one helped me. The bartender looked closely at the problem and assured that he'd get someone to refresh the non-existent network. DON'T EXPECT TO DO ANY KIND OF WORK, WORK FUNCTION, OR EVENT NEEDING WI-FI HERE!\n\nThings would be cool if in an hour he even acknowledged there's nothing that could be done. As for my meal- I let them know it wasn't what I ordered or expected and was told \"maybe just consider this your cheat day.\" Really? \n\nThis place is supposed to be \"Gay owned and operated\" but they have no restaurant class... haha. Ya'd think they at least have restaurant class. 1 Star Review which is rare for me!!!!\n\nI haven't seen any gay owners inside here in my visits. It is centrally located, sure! But much better choices within walking distance before you walk into this place. \n\n#ShitofPhoenix\n\n#don'tgohere\n\n#phoenix\n\n#gayresturant \"quote\"\n\n#shittyplaces\n\n#terribleAz\n\n#
