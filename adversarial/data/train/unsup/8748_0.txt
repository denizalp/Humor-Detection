Trying to get these people to apply their price match policy was like pulling teeth.  I understand they have to guard against fraud, but the customer service rep outright lied several times to get me to leave.\n\n1) Would not match price product because it was in limited quantity by their competitor (not true).  She could not identify anywhere on their website that it was.\n\n2) She clicked on some keys and said their competitor was out of stock (funny enough, I was already on my phone with the competitor anticipating this) and funny enough, they said they had plenty of stock left.  Then she said, \"I didn't talk to them, how do I know you're not lying?\".  Which I proceeded to give her their number, and she sighed when calling them.\n\n3) The policy states that they \"beat the competitors price by 10% of the difference\".  My product was on sale for $19 and the Futureshop price was $49.99.  She proceeds to give me a $1 discount, when I said that's not 10% of the difference, she said yes it was.  This goes back and forth a bit, I tried to run through a basic math class for her.  What's 49-19?  What's 10% of that?  She refused to budge by saying to me \"Just trust me\".    WHAT?!?!  After she just lied to me twice, and obviously can't do basic math?!  I just took the dollar because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nFML.
