I went to this McDonald's since I was meeting a friend here. When I feel like having something in McDonald's and I'm in the area, I normally wouldn't stop by at this McDonald's mainly because a few blocks away in the Place Vertu shopping mall, there is a McDonald's there which offers the full McDonald's menu as well and generally whenever I'm around the area, the Place Vertu mall is open. I also prefer going to the Place Vertu McDonald's when I'm in the area because I can easily do some window shopping inside the mall after finishing my order.\n\nThis McDonald's as I mentioned is located in between the Guzzo Spheretech movie theatre and the Place Vertu shopping mall. It has ample free parking. There are seats outside and inside the restaurant. They have free WiFi and they also have the self-ordering terminal touch screens so you can just place your order, pay for it with your credit\/debit card, and then wait for them to announce your number at the counter to pick up your order.\n\nThe soda fountain is self serve and they allow customers to refill your drinks.
