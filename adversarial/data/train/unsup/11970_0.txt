The seafood at this resturaunt is the furthest thing from cajun, and that is coming from someone with cajun roots who was born and raised in louisiana.  This food is a disgrace, honestly.  Never in my life did i have crawfish boiled with heaps of garlic like is used at this resturaunt.  In fact, nobody back home uses this much garlic in seafood boil.  The amount of garlic used in the fake cajun seasoning is appalling and disgusting, clearly used to hide the off flavors of the unfresh seafood.  nobody uses this much garlic in true cajun dishes, and eating here will make you smell like a piece of garlic the next day.  \n\nunauthentic food, and way more expensive than what its worth.  The lb of crawfish that i ate would be worth no more than $3 back home considering how poorly made it was.  Try again on making cajun food, and maybe consult with an actual louisianian if you want to make \"cajun\" food. This is so typical of the midwest.  never go here, its so inauthentic and gross and overpriced for what you get.  Also, fries cant be cajun.  Dear owners and chefs, do your research before you try cooking food that is out of the scope of your culture and dont misrepresent it with awful flavors like you have these first few weeks of opening.  And remove the word cajun from your marketing, as it is false advertising.
