To be quite honest this apartments sucks. If I could give them zero stars I would. There's a lot of broken things in my apartment that my dad and I have to fix. I went to negotiate my new rent. It went bad they put my rent up. She didn't work with me. She didn't care at all if I would renew or left. Just a bad experience with the citrus administration. Even though they have changed them to made them better. Oh hunny it didn't work!!!!\nJust do your self a favor and look someplace else!\nYou will say a lot a money and time!
