I come to this gym for convenience. It's the closest one to where I live and work so I usually come in after work. \n\nI always swear I'm never going to use the pool here because it's small and usually too many people are in it. But occasionally I think, let me give it another shot. One time it was beautiful and no one else was in the pool and not many people in the spa area (I think it was a Sunday at 3PM). But most of the time, it's disappointing and I regret my decision. What disgusts me most is a lot of people who steam\/sauna get all sweaty and to cool off, they take a dip in the pool. It's like their personal shower!? \n\nOn another note, I would like to share another experience: \nIt was a weeknight, and as I was changing to get ready to swim, another young lady was getting ready too. But her getting ready meant putting on makeup, a bikini, taking a photo of herself, and bringing her 50 shades book to the sauna\/steam? OMG, it's not a hotel pool, or a dayclub! Why was this girl getting ready like she was going to wet republic. And really, how much reading of 50 shades are you going to do at a 24 hour fitness steam\/sauna.
