Such a fantastic place. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the food is amazing. The gobi 65 is delicious and my favorite entree is the chicken chettinad. I feel like you really can't go wrong with anything you choose here. Definitely stop in! My mom, who has never had Indian food, really enjoyed it as well.
