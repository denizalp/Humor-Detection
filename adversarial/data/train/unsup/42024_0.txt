My husband and I love this place.  My parents met here, so it has special meaning to me.  \n\nThe last time we went, we ordered the HUGE lobster and shared it.  It was a delicious meal, and the server takes all the work out of cracking the lobster.  \n\nShrimp San Remo is the best appetizer, along with the escargot.  \n\nSalt Cellar has one of the best Happy Hours in town as well.  Many times we will just come for HH and forego the dining room.
