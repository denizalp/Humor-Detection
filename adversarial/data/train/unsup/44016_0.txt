I was actually a regular at their Rainbow\/Russell location when I used to live in Vegas. However, I found out that they opened a new location in Fort Apache, and since this one's closer, I decided to go there.\n\nMaybe it was because I went there on a Thursday afternoon, but there wasn't any wait, and I got seated in less than a minute. The lady that did my eyebrows was really nice and even asked me if I was doing okay when she saw me tearing up (it's not the most pleasant feeling thing, ok?). \n\nAs for my eyebrows, they look fabulous. The best part is it only took five minutes and only costed me $10 with the tip. \n\nSo yes, I love this place for being super cheap and making my eyebrows look great. I just wish Portland had something like this, since the cheapest threading place I've seen there charges $20 for eyebrows. But until then, I will keep on going to Eyebrows R Us everytime I visit Vegas.
