Had breakfast here today with our daughters it was outstanding.  The wait service was prompt and they kept the coffee and water refills constantly.  The chef came out and checked to see how everything was which was so nice. The seafood omelette my daughter and I shared was scrumptious, other daughter had chili verde tamales with poached eggs Benedict and husband had pancakes with scrambled eggs and to die for candied bacon. Their coffee is also delicious.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was it was a little loud along with the music otherwise would've been 5 all the way.
