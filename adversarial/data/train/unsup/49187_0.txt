A very good place to have lunch with a friend or some co-workers. Our office eats here often, and let me tell you how commendable it is to be able to get orders right when you have 9 or more people ordering at a time! \n\nThey have a fairly good selection, and they're flexible with alterations to your order. The daily soups and specials are also always changing, and are great for adding variety.\n\nI've met the owner several times, and he's a very nice and friendly guy. You can tell when someone is being nice just because you're a customer, and when they're just a good person who happens to run a restaurant, and he's definitely the latter!
