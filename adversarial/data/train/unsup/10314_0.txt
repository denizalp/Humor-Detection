I do not have time to write review right, BUT will when I return home. Just need to say this was the absolute WORST hotel stay I've ever stayed at, and I stay in Vegas all time. \nI have pictures of our dirty, uncleaned room upon first night stay this last Thursday. I have three more pics to add in addition to the three I already uploaded of the dirty room. Totally unacceptable!!\n\nOur first night was comped and given a $50 food credit for the inconvenience of a dirty room, having to switch to another room, and having to call our bank the next day because I was billed twice on my debit card and our room was given away. More to come...
