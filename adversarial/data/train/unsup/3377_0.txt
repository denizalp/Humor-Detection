I love the fact that  you don't have to worry about second hand smoke while having a meal in most restaurants around town.\n\nAs for the smoke that is coming from LVG's huge in-house smoker, it doesn't bother me at all! It actually adds to your dining experience. We were on our way to see Carlos Mencia, So we made plans to stop in for dinner.\n\nWe decided to share the 4 meat and 3 sides combo. For our meats, we chose Beef Sirloin, Thai Green Chili Sausage, BBQ Ribs, and Bobby Y.'s highly recommended\nRoast Chicken with Pineapple Jerk Sauce. We got the Roasted Potatoes, Pasta Salad, and Braised Red Cabbage for our sides.\n\nIt was cool because we practically had the whole restaurant to ourselves with only one other diner. Phil came out to greet us, and was happy we found out about LVG through\nYELP, went over the different woods they use, and the different applications for all the meats.\n\nOur meal arrives, and everything looks awesome. I take a bite of the sirloin and wow!\nsmokey, juicy, yummy goodness! The Thai sausage had a very nice heat and the fish sauce and lemongrass was also evident. Phil thought that the sausage was on the small side, so he brought us another one-OH YEAH! The Ribs........The .......................................................................................................................................................................................................OOPS! got side tracked thinking of the fall-off-the-bone goodness!!! Where was I? Oh, I took one bite and the rest of the rib fell clean off the bone-ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!  The chicken? I didn't put that bad boy down until it was all bones! all the sides complemented the meats so well, and we'll definitely take Phil's suggestion and come back to try the wings, and I'll be having a rack of ribs and a bucket of Pineapple Crack Sauce on the side!....ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(206\/365) \"Awesome Second Hand Smoke\"
