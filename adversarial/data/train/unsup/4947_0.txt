I tried installing my own water heater. Yet another reminder that some things are best left to professionals. The last few plumbers I have used were not great. A quick internet search led me to Erik, and he was able to come out and rescue me from my my near disastrous water heater self-install. Extremely knowledgeable, and the price was very fair.  He did some work for me years ago when he worked for another company, also with great results. If your looking for a plumber in the East Valley, Erik is your guy.
