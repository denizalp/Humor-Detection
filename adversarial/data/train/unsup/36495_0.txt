Breakfast is fantastic. I had the bacon avocado cheddar omelette with polenta grits and sourdough toast, which came with delicious raspberry jelly. The grits were out of this world. Omelette was cooked perfectly. $19 bottomless mimosas - but the mimosas are HUGE and they offer you a to-go mimosa so I think it's worth it.
