Always my go to place for the many supplies I always need... I do several crafty things: acrylic paints on canvas, watercolors, drawings, woodworking, sewing, food crafting, making wreaths\/holiday decor, jewelry, its endless.\n\nI just wish I would get coupons like \"20% off your entire purchase\" instead of \"40% off one item.\" I never buy any one thing over $10, and you can't use it on things already on sale. Whatever, I can't stop shopping there;there are too few stores like this as it is. Also walmarts art section isn't as good as this one store. lol
