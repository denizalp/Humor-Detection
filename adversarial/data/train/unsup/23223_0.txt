Still as good as I remember it. The Parlor is truly one of the places I miss most about living in Phoenix! We would frequent this spot at least once a month and always took our friends\/family here when they visited from out of town. I often find myself wishing there was a location here in San Diego....hint hint! The food is exceptional. You can seriously taste the quality and freshness in the ingredients. You cannot go wrong with the Funghi pizza if you love mushrooms and truffles...who doesn't, right? Don't forget to add a whole egg to your pizza. It takes an already awesome pizza to a whole 'nother level. The service is still super friendly and efficient. The place itself still has that cool, chill vibe that just welcomes you to hang out and really enjoy the food placed in front of you. Great place to gather with friends and have a great time. As long as this place is in business, it will always be on our itinerary whenever we go back to visit AZ.
