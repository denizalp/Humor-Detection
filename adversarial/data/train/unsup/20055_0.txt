Raunchy. If it wasn't for the decent food and nice staff it would be rated lower. The food was decently priced and it tasted pretty good.nothing spectacular. Once staff decided we weren't ordering drinks they were less attentive but I guess it's expected. The crowd is pretty gross. Groups of older\nWomen making out with everyone....everywhere. I was mostly irritated when they tried to include me. Yuck. Wouldn't visit again.
