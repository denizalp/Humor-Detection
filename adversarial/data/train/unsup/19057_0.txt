Ok I ordered delivery today. $30 of food all thrown in the trash.\nBurger- tasted like a big meatball like they added breadcrumbs etc to the meat patties. So gross.\nGreek Gyro: thin store bought gyro meat same as I could have bought in the grocery store. That alone made it not worth $8\nCurly fries: soggy\nOnion rings: over fried and very greasy - inedible\nHoney BBQ wings: dry dry dry under all the gooey sauce. Dry. Let me say that again. Dry. Took a bite of two wings and tossed them.\nA waste of money, for real. I regret spending $30 on such garbage. Could have gone to a real restaurant and had a nice meal!!!!\nI don't even want to know what their pizza tastes like.\nIf it's anything like the rest if it, run the other way.
