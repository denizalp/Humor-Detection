Cheesecake factory's a solid. I got the shrimp scamp and steak duane. I keep trying to write Diane and it keeps saying Duane. Now I'm gonna google steak Duane cause I like all different names of steak. It was amazing! And the crab bites (6 bites) Zucchini fries, hubs got Louisiana chicken pasta or something, and Adams peanut butter cheesecake. I mean the wait right?? The parking right?? We all know this right? Staff always nice. Can't comment on the bathroom situation, didn't visit. Tho I enjoyed cheesecake tv while i waited. \n\nWe went on a Saturday arriving at like 4:15pm 45. Minute wait. Pretty much spot on. \n\nOk.. Here's the prob.... While I was waiting! People! Get up! Get up and let and old person sit down! How about seriously a 75 year old grandpa? Nope How bout an old man with a cane??? Nope Oh... Oh... Mr young meathead? Sat there the whole time girlfriend stood in uncomfortable boots? Good grief. Grandpa with kid on shoulders? Stood. Mother holding child and purse? Stood. Couple in thirties sat the whole time playing clash of clans oblivious to themselves, each other and their surroundings. \n\nCheesecake Factory always a solid. Humanity??? Not so much.
