After a long day of working and partying at Friday Night Live I had to unwind at a place...well I just needed food. Didn't care if it was the best. It was food. But what caught the eye was the Lollipo sign that said. All you can eat Prime Rib 4pm-4am.  9.99....OK So that settles the neanderthal in me craving meat sensations. It comes with Mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and salad....\nI smiled....feeling fat and knowing I'm dieting and ordered it medium rare. Yes it came like a thick slab of Flintstone tricertop ribeye...phuckin phat cut. ...BURP.....I asked for another.....Burp....my buddy Tyler couldn't handle anymore. So not to look like a Shamu eating a school of fish. I stopped. Oh sure I was satisfied with two pieces....But I asked our adorable waitress Mandy how much was the record. She said 8...... :) Well once, at Texas Station Buffet....I had 8 tbone steaks, and 4 passthroughs on the buffet plus dessert. Ya I should really stop doing that.
