Food was delicious. God that pecan pie pastry might just be the end of my diet plan. Oh God, that icecream on top of it was just mmm mmm...damn cravings. \n\nThe bread was fresh off the oven, the butter was nice and smooth, the food kept coming out nice and prompt and... wait for it... 1\/2 off local wines on Sundays\n\nSo why did I dock the star - the service could have been a bit better. Perhaps its the superlative experience with the food, perhaps its me and I am hyper critical when it comes to service. Here's the first bit - How do you serve food and forget the silverware. See, I can agree it might have been oversight, but its a restaurant, its all you do. That i expect to get without asking for. \n\n I would give it 4.5 if I could but I cant, so I will give it 4 and say this much - I will be back and I will want to give them a five :)
