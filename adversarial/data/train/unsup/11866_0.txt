My wife and I are new to Vegas and love a good burger.  We live close to this location and had been excited about trying this restaurant.  We have 2 children under 3 so one day when they were napping I ran over to get 2 burgers to-go.\n\nI placed my order and after 15 minutes of waiting I started to wonder how long it would take.  At 20 minutes I started getting a little annoyed.  After 25 minutes I was standing in front of the counter clearly a little ticked and nobody said anything to me.  I finally received my take-out and the general manager handed me the bag and didn't even say anything.  I looked at the receipt and it took 27 minutes!\n\nI have worked at high and low end restaurants and NOTHING takes that long, not even a well-done steak.  All we ordered was a regular burger done medium and veggie burger.  Any manager with minimal customer service skills should have realized at 15 minutes it was taking too long and he was up there looking at the order tickets the whole time.\n\nIn addition, my wife said her burger was undercooked of all things and mine was average at best.  \n\nI was so disappointed that I wrote them an email on their website and they didn't even bother to respond.\n\nPerhaps their food is better if you eat in but I have such a bad taste in my mouth for this business and how they run things, especially not having enough class to write me back, that I fear that will never happen.  So very disappointed.
