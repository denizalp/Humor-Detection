This is the most horribly managed place I've ever been to. It literally took 3 people to take my order, which they still got wrong. I was trying to be understanding since they were a little busy, but they should be able to handle a task as simple as taking an order. I wouldn't be writing this review if it were the first time, but it seems that this is an on going issue here. What sent me over the edge was the fact that i had to clean my own table! Yup! It says a lot about the management here. It all starts from the top! Get a grip on costumer service and reviews like this wouldn't be necessary, Wingstop!
