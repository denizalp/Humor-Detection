Boba Tea House is the best way you can reward yourself after fighting a 70 year-old grandma for that last ripe mango at Lee Lee's next door. It sucks that I have to drive all the way down to Chandler just to drink some (unless there's one that's open at the Chinese Cultural Center that I don't know about -- * note to self *). \n\nI've been a big fan of boba for ages - going out of my way cross-town in San Francisco to my favorite joint in the inner Richmond District, getting a custard, Thai iced tea, watermelon or red bean slush packed to the gills with tapioca pearls. Moving to a city (Phoenix) where the population isn't at least 40% Asian means boba is just a tad more scarce. \n\nBoba Tea House has a giant drink menu - several different kinds of milk teas, slushes, juices, and snows that you can have with or without the boba. But if you don't want boba, why even bother coming here? \n\nSince my tolerance to things dairy took a nosedive a few years back, I've been limited to what I can have when I'm jonesing for this stuff. And since slushes are basically juices and\/or flavors blended with ice, I stick to this column on the menu. Which is all good, because this joint makes a great, refreshing watermelon slush as well as a tasty chocolate mint one. Word to the wise, though - sometimes the slush gets stuck in the straw, and if you inhale a little too strongly you might find yourself choking on a couple tapioca balls.\n\nTherefore, do not attempt this while driving, or you will have the Mesa cops on your ass in no time.\n\n\"No, officer, I'm not on meth. I just choked on tapioca. But I'm fine now. Sorry if I was driving erratically.\"\n\n4 stars.
