On a freezing Saturday afternoon, walking in Old Montreal, and as we were really just looking for a place to get in and warm up, we ended up here, and we were never happier to stumble upon a place we probably would not have entered otherwise. The staff is absolutely welcoming and friendly, giving you time and advice to choose from their long tea menu. The tea presentation and explanation on how to drink it the proper way was definitely appreciated as well. These people really know teas and they're happy to share it. The atmosphere set by the place with all their teas, teapots and Chinese decorations puts you in some kind of tea trance and you leave in a tea zenitude you never thought possible (yes I believe my body reacts to tea as if some kind of drug and I'm now in the aftermath of wanting more more more!)
