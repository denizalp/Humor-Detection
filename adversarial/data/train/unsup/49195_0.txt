Had lunch here today and it was just mehhh. \n\nWe split  the soft pretzels and fondue, which are the exact same as every other Fox concept restaurant that serves them. The candle attempting to keep the cheese warm doesn't do a sufficient job.\n\nThe BLT I had was alright - a little too much lettuce and I wasn't particularly fond of the bread it was on. \n\nOn a more positive note, the place was completely dead, so service was quick and both servers were really pleasant.
