First timer. The menu is very small( only season I didn't rate it higher , meaning if you don't want a burger, this is not your place.  The burger I got was great though. It's the on special Oktoberfest burger with sauerkraut, caramelized onions, bacon jelly and two pierogis on a fresh pretzel bun!  The fried pickles were amazing. Firm, good batter, and def not frozen!  My husband got an order of wings. They were good but be warned you only get seven wings. The French fries had great flavor and were not soggy and the Bavarian pretzel was good ( do not be shocked that it does not have salt on it). It was fresh, soft, and the dough had nice flavor!  My mom got the hummus platter ( huge) and really enjoyed that.  We couldn't leave without trying the fried pb&j!!! Not overly sweet, big enough for four of us to split, and so different. Dad was very excited about them!     I will most likely be back for the chicken and waffles!!
