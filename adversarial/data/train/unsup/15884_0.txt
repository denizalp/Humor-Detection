Finally got to try Shack Shake as it has come to my understanding that this is the In-n-Out equivalent over on the east coast! \n\nParking: Park at New York New York. Free the first hour! They don't do validation here, so if you don't want to pay extra, order fast and eat fast! \n\nAccess: You actually don't get access to Shake Shack from inside New York New York. You actually have to walk through the hotel and onto the strip. The entrance is very easy to locate, the giant Shake Shack sign is a dead giveaway.\n\nLine: Due to the ongoing hype, the line is pretty long. It wraps around inside, but they have huge menus for you to look at while waiting to order your food. The wait was probably 10-15 minutes.\n\nSeating: Plenty of seating available. My friends spotted a table right away, it's a little dirty but it's a fast food restaurant. We cleaned it up ourselves anyway.\n\nFood: I got the single patty cheeseburger with a side of crinkle cut fries. The cheeseburger was really good. Patty was cooked medium, so it was very juicy. It was a good size too, I wasn't overly stuffed when I was done with my burger. The fries were extremely amazing. Deep fried, crispy, and not soggy! I usually don't like large crinkle cute fries, but these fries totally made me change my mind! \n\nOverall, Shack Shake is somewhat comparable to In-n-Out. However, I still love In-n-Out because it's a lot cheaper and still just as good!
