Small portions, super fatty (inedible) bacon for at least half the pieces, luke warm coffee, oily food. Same pricing as other breakfast spots that we have tried but a lot less food. Manager was rude and not responsive and slow (only one wait staff for the entire place on a Sunday) hence our order was missing a few items but they gladly charged us for the whole thing, even after we complained. No one to offer coffee refills. Would I come back? No.
