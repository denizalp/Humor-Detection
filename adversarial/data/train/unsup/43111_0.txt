3.5 stars really. \n\nOn a bit of a burger crawl. Have walked past Grindhouse too many times not to stop in. \n\nLove the rock theme, love that they are a bar, love that Stone Temple Pilots were on when I walked in (102.1 The Edge was playing).\n\nThe server\/bartender was fantastic, made sure to greet me from afar even though he was dealing with another table. He did this everytime, but most of the time he knew the people walking in. Guess they've established a number of regulars. And why not? Every bar's got them.\n\nI went for the Signature on Whole Wheat bun, medium well. In fact, I was caught off guard when he asked me how I'd like it cooked. Can't say I've ever been asked that in Canada, at least not in Ontario.\n\nIt was a good burger. It was a week ago, but as I write this, I only have a faint memory of what it even looked like. That can't be good.\n\nI'm going back, need to try it again. They just got a great review in the Sunday Sun. Maybe I'll need to reserve now.\n\nRegardless, great option for King Street and looking forward to actually partying there some night.\n\nDining tip: don't sit at the bar. Bar stools aren't the right proportion to the bar top. Difficult for eating.
