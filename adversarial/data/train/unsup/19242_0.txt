A cool store until you walk in and the associates don't leave you alone for one second, talking non-stop and making up dumb things they \"know\" about symbolism of the items they sell. The associate stalking us only made a fool out of himself.\nI couldn't run out of there fast enough taking my initial interest of buying something with me.
