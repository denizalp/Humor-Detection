AMC Is currently the new management for the complex.  This company has come in shown little to no level of respect to the tenants. \n\nTenants are being threatened with eviction, for attempting to contact HQ and file a complaint on the treatment.  There is a fear within the community. There is no safety, as the gates are now remaining open 24 hours, there is no sense of value or respect, as you can be verbally insulted  by the staff. \n\nThere are many apartments near Chuparosas, that offer better amenities and from the onset better customer satisfaction. \n\nAs long as AMC is the property management company I would recommend finding a different place to call home.
