O Smelly Deli, How Do I Love Thee?\n\nIs it the proximity to work?  The amazing selection of imported foods you can't find at grocery stores?  The friendly and helpful staff?  The amazing prepared foods you can take back to work to make everyone jealous?  The 87 varieties of cured meats ready to be sliced and wrapped for your later enjoyment?\n\nA little of all of it...  my only complaint is that occasionally, some of the fried stuff gets a little soggy if you go in way after regular lunch hours.  \n\nBut, if you get in there by 1, maybe 1:15, everything is first rate delicious.  Nothing healthy about any of it, but you're not here to lose weight, are you?  No, you're here to eat well.  And eat well, you will.\n\nAnd, if you are more of a \"keep the peace\" type than you are a \"create food envy\" type, you can pick up a pepperoni bread or two, and some great little cookies to bring back to the office.
