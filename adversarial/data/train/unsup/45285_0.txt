Woke up 'round 1100.  Hungry.  Heard a lot about Eggslut.  Figured I'd walk over to the Cosmo from the Luxor and get my exercise in.  Wrong move.  Vegas is hotter than I'm used to.  And now, I'm even hungrier.  Got to the spot and the line was around the corner going down the hallway.  Must be good.  The line moves fast so don't give up when you see the line.  Plus, I love to people watch.\n\nSettled on the Fairfax with turkey sausage and a cold brew coffee.  The guacho looked good but I wanted to taste the egg in eggslut.  Wait for the food was quick.  Got my sammie and coffee and I planted myself at the bar table.  \n\nScrambled eggs were fluffy and creamy.  I like pork sausage but their turkey one was tasty.  Not overly spiced.  The brioche bun was warm and soft.  Perfect choice for it.  Sauce added to it nicely and didn't overpower it.  Good size.  Didn't leave me hungry.  And the cold brew was nice.  \n\nMight go back to try the other stuff.  Ubering it this time.  \n\nDo yourself a favor, drop that McMuffin and get to Eggslut.
