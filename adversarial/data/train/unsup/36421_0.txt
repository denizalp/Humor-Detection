We had Seth working at our house yesterday and today  connecting new bath and kitchen faucets,new hose bib,new flex lines on our water heater, AND a new water conditioning system. My wife and I discussed off and on the past few years getting some type of water softening filtration system in our now 19 year old home. After new countertops and fixtures, and discussing a  deal with Penguin we knew the time was right. And OMG..all of the work done by Seth is remarkable. His attention to detail is way above and beyond. The water conditioner install looks great !! He is very knowledgeable and truly takes pride in doing the job right. My wife and I are VERY  pleased with everything Seth did !
