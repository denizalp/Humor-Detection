It's a nice change to the Markham brunch scene. \n\nOne of the newer additions to Markham's amazing food selection is Alchemy Coffee. It's a cute, small restaurant that only holds about 10 tables. The wait is quite long, so be prepared to wait if you come in prime hours. \n\nSeats are self served so go ahead and pick a spot. Once you're settled in, head to the front to place the order. They'll bring the food to your table once it's ready. \n\nWe ordered the classic breakfast and the pea-meal bacon eggs Benedict. Both were delicious and reasonably priced. The potatoes in particular were very tasty. \n\nIt wasn't the best brunch I've ever had, but it really was quite good. Planning to come back soon to try the other offerings, especially the pancakes and chicken + waffles. \n\nWill update this review.
