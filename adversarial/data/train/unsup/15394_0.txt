Four and half stars!! \n\nI love Italian food and have been to many Italian restaurants in town: Piero's, Fiamma, Parma by chef Marc, Casa diAmore, Nora's, Gantaeno's, Lavo, Carmine, Roma Deli, Panevino, Pasta Mia, Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria ,Mastrioni, Spago and etc. Although I like certain dishes from some of previous listed restaurants but after dining here last night, I found my absolutely favorite Italian in town. \n\nFood:\nI love love bread and OMG, their bread was so amazing. The texture of the bread was perfect. The bread basket came with various bread; Rosemary, cheese, white and etc. Rosemary bread was crispy and fluffy. Cheese one was chewy and flavorful. The  eggplant basil dipping sauce that came with it was incredible good. I even put some in the spaghetti.  \n\nAppetizer \n1. Scallop and Foie gras (3\/5): I have to say I was not impressed by their foie gras. Scallop was not bad. Grilled pear was interesting though. Don't think I will order again.\n2: Creamy polenta(4:5): Ordered this dish because it's popular on yelp. The truffle mushroom that came on top made this dish absolutely delicious. I would prefer polenta was not so liquidity. \n3: Grilled Spanish octopus and squid (5\/5): it was light and fresh. Love the smoked paprika vinaigrette and chickpea that came with it too. \n\nEntrees\n1. Spaghetti with Tomato and Basil(4\/5): like other yelper said, they cook it al dente here. It was just simple and amazing. I added some eggplants from the dipping sauce :p.\n2. Duck and foie gras raviolis (3.8\/5): it was tasty in general but I couldn't taste much flavor from duck or foie. Masala reduction and cheese saved the dish though. \n3. Short rib and bone marrow agnolotti(5\/5): it was my favorite entree of the night. Toasted breadcrumbs and brown butter made this dish so heavenly. \n4. Branzino (3\/5): my friend ordered this dish and he liked it. I tried a bite and it was too fishy for me.\n5. Lamb loin (4:5): I do not eat lamb but tried a bite from my friends plate and it was not gamy. Lamb lover should definitely give it a try. \n6. Pici (4\/5): great flavor. The tarragon and chilled pesto made this dish very yummy although I wish I see more lobster.  \n\nDessert\nAll yummy across the board! \n1. Banana soufflé (5\/5): perfect amount of sweetness from the soufflé although I'm not a fan of rum gelato. \n2. Coconut panna cotta (5\/5): very interesting concept with the guava juice as they called it \"soup\".\n3. Citrus Parfait (5\/5): very refreshing after the meal. It's like yuzu sorbet.  \n\nService was attentive but the service was a bit cold. I don't feel like our waiter was welcoming and patient enough. Feel like he's there to do his job and leave. No smiles either. Maybe he had a bad day. \n\nI will keep trying other Italian restaurants but I can see myself coming back frequently.
