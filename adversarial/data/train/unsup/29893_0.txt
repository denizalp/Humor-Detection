Not the best service. Food wasn't the best wings were a hot mess like they were swimming in a sea of bad sauce and they only came with one carrot and one celery. The veggies on my supreme pizza were till raw even after we asked them to put it back in the oven for a few mins!  and even when we spoke to the manager he made up excuses with no apology whatsoever.
