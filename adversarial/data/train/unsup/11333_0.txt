For me, the food was way too spicy, but I managed to eat a huge dinner here anyway.  I am the only one at my table that must have felt that way--altho I said nothing to anyone--but, then again, maybe several others did, also, and just were to polite to complain.  Who knows?  \nThe food appears clean, however, at the end of the meal a lone roach was walking thru the place on the floor.  Do I need to say more about New India Bazaar?  Think not.\nWill I go back?  Are you kidding?  No.  Just don't feel like sharing my meal with the cockroaches.  Disgusting!  Thank heaven I saw it at the end of the meal and not when I walked in.\nSay \"hi\" to the resident cockroach for me when you get there.......sigh.
