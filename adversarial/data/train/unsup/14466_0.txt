Dear NoDa Brewing,\n\nI know we have not known each other that long but I thought you should know that I think I am in love. I mean, you always find a way to make me smile, whether it be pouring me the hoppy goodness of your Hop, Drop and Roll or the yummy, smooth Ramble on Red. You always make sure there is plenty to eat with your variety of Food Trucks or just having bar snacks available (Hello Cape Cod chips)! You are the perfect Saturday (or Tuesday) date!\n\nWhile I know you have a love affair with plenty of Charlotte people (I know, I have seen the other Yelp reviews) and that is okay, I just want you to know that I have a soft spot in my heart for you and probably always will. Cheers!\n\nAll my (beer) love,\nPaula
