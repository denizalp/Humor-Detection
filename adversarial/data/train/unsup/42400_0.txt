This was probably the best BBQ we've ever had!\n\nWe arrived at 11:05am (they open at 11), and we had exactly an hour wait.  The place is small, so we waited outside.  But, it's very customer-friendly...overhangs, misters, cold water bottles in a cooler, samples being passed out and someone constantly walking by and asking if everyone is okay (in fact, everyone who worked there was so nice).  Most of the people in line are regulars, and everyone seemed very friendly.  I guess this was an average wait, and it really went by faster than we thought it would.\n\nBut, there's a reason why people will stand in line outside during the summer in Phoenix...damn good food!!\n\nHubby and I both got the 2 Meat Combo w\/2 sides.  I got the fatty brisket (they also offer lean, but I watched the guy in front of me get the fatty and my mouth started watering) and pork rib along with cole slaw and potato salad.  Hubby got the fatty brisket and pork rib (what can I say, we like the same things...LOL!) with the jalapeno cheddar grits and ranch-style beans.  Everything was perfect!  I've never had a pork rib so tender and meaty, and the brisket could be cut with a plastic fork.  \n\nThey have 3 sauces, they're in bottles on all the tables...Spicy!, House and Tangy Sweet Mustard.  We both fell in love with the House, and even bought a bottle...I will put it on everything!!\n\nIt looks like we'll be standing in line again soon...this was really, really good!!!!
