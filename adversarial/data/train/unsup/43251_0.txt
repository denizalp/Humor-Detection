I've been coming to this location and others around town for over 15 years. Metro is my go to pizzeria when I have relatives and friends in town. I have taken the pizza class with my meet up group 3 times. My experience yesterday may warrant a change in Pizzerias. I ordered 1 large cheese and mushroom and 1 large cheese, sausage and bell pepper for carry-out. They brought my pizzas out and he had me check them. This must have been the skimpiest pizza from metro I've ever had. When you order a pizza with just one or a few toppings shouldn't it cover the pizza just as much as if I ordered a pizza with lots of different toppings like a combination? A large has 8 slices. I could have taken all the mushrooms off the pizza and it wouldn't have covered  2 slices.  The same for the sausage and bell pepper. Okay, I get it...sausage is more expensive and may not give  them a higher profit margin in their food cost but seriously, mushrooms and bell pepper? It crossed my mind at that moment to not pay for them and express my dissatisfaction but I actually had out-of-state relatives waiting for me at home. If their \"buy 1 get 2nd half off large pizzas\" are at this subpar quality would I have received a pizza that had generous toppings if I paid full price? No thanks, I'd prefer the latter. With embarrassment, I served the pizzas to my guests. I'm sure they were thinking, \"this is what she was raving about?\"
