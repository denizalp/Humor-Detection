A-OK! 3.5 stars! The fact that I could get pizza at a late hour without having to leave my hotel made me extremely happy! It's a small restaurant inside the Hard Rock Hotel so there wasn't much room to sit in and eat it, but they had small Togo boxes to take your pizza slice with you.\n\nI got the Ham and Pineapple and although it was a little greasy, it was pretty good! Not bad for a small pizza joint! The slices were of good size but only wished they were a little bigger. I wasn't quite full from one slice but I know 2 would've been a little too much. \n\nSo even though I've had better pizza, this isn't a bad choice!! The price wasn't too crazy (for Vegas) so that made it more enjoyable as well :P
