I've never been to Canton Chilli on location before but I do order take-out from them all the time.\n\nTheir delivery menu has the cheapest prices for Chinese food in downtown Toronto and it's pretty much free after ordering just two dishes (which will last me a good 3-4 meals). They deliver up 'til like 5 in the morning and it usually arrives within half an hour. Their lunch and late night menu is amazingly priced; pretty much everything is about 5 bucks.... Perfect for a lazy university student...\n\nTaste is only mediocre but not bad. Everything is pretty much Americanized and the sauces they use on everything is pretty similar. Like more Chinese take out, it can get pretty greasy. Any of their noodles are my go-to order but it gets tiring after a while so definitely mix it up. They also don't skimp out on meat!  \n\nPortions are huge for the price though so you really can't complain at all.\n\n\nCareful though... The guy who answers the phone is quite temperamental... He's sometimes super nice and other times a complete jerk (and it's the same guy)... sorta like constant PMS... but an Asian guy.
