Hostess was great about finding us seats for a table in the bar area!  We shared four tacos. Our favorite was the carnitas--all the toppings worked together. Didn't really need the taco sauces on this one. The Asada was a bit chewy. The cauliflower, while seemed interesting, was breaded so it seemed like too much with the soft taco shells although the flavor was delicious. Surprised to really enjoy the farmer cheese taco--yum!  Margarita was also well executed but short. Happy hour ends at 5pm which is a bummer. Clean and restroom was tidy. I'd go back but not obsessed with returning.
