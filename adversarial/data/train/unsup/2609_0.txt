Most of our wedding pictures were crooked and looked very unexperienced. Eyes are closed in most of our photos, shadows cover our faces, and there is a restaurant in the background of our family photos.  I don't know if he was new or if its because they came with our wedding package so they just didn't care how my pictures turned out but they don't look professional and the ones family took of us turned out better. We are so dissapointed that we didn't even want our free prints.
