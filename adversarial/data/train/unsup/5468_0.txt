I called prior to placing an order for delivery and specifically asked the girl who answered about ordering burnt ends.  She told me to put this in the special instructions when I place the order.\n\nMy order arrived with everything EXCEPT the 2 orders of burnt ends.  I called this place again and the same girl answered and I explained I did not receive the burnt ends.  \n\nShe stated this time that she put them on the ticket for the cooks but they must be out of them....why could she not tell me this before I placed the order? This is the level of customer service provided?\n\nVery disappointed with this lack of customer care.  This is not the first time but I believe this will be my last time giving this place my business.\n\nThe food was decent and everyone who tried it did like the taste of the food.  The owner did message me and state that burned ends is not something they have on the menu or sell, so all employees should be aware of what this business offers.\n\nSo in closing, they do not have burned ends, the rest of the food is good so I recommend you try this place and leave your own opinion of your experience, I just had a group of people that really wanted burned ends and we were disappointed to find out it was not in our order and I now understand why it was not, they don't offer them.  Lastly I do have a LOT of respect for a business owner who looks at Yelp and replies, it shows a lot of pride in the business.
