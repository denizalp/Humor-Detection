Beware, Beware Writing about the restaurant upstairs. Had breakfast this am. Ordered eggs, hash browns, bacon and toast. Ordered over easy. The cook burnt the bottom of the eggs and managed to keep the whites like snot!!! Potatoes were like strips of noodles and raw. I ate the yokes, bread and bacon. The manager came to my table and said \" that's the way we cook here.\". She did give me my bkfst for free. \nWhat a way to answer a customer. \nI won't be back!!\nI suggest you don't either.
