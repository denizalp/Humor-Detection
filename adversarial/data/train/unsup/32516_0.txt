I have nothing bad to say about this place. Prices are much more affordable than my other 'go to'  place. I have ordered cheese & sausage pizza. I prefer the sausage. I ordered boneless chicken hot & sweet BBQ...neither disappointed. \nFor 2 large one topping pizzas I paid about 26.\nFor large or extra large not sure & 24 wings think I was at 30.
