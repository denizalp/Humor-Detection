WHAT A DISASTER THIS PLACE IS.\n\nSo, we heard from some friends that they had an awesome special at this place -- where until October 15th, they would be having $10.00 AYCE lunch and $15.00 AYCE dinner! All-you-can-eat is originally $19.99 for lunch and $26.99 for dinner... what a steal, right?\n\nAnd then it all made sense. \n\nIt's evident they probably offered this deal to get more people in the door to help business and their ratings, but seriously -- what a disaster. \n\nFor one, there was an option on Yelp to make a reservation. I booked ours 3.5 hours in advance and even got an email confirmation. We arrived 15 minutes early, but the guy at the register said they don't take reservations. I showed him the yelp confirmation and the e-mail, but he just shrugged me off and said they don't honor reservations. Okay. \n\nSTRIKE ONE? Wait. Give it a chance, we said...\n\nWe wait about 30 minutes and get seated. Can I just say I've never been so uncomfortably cold at a restaurant before in my life? It was 80 degrees outside at 8:00PM... and I had to go grab a sweater from my car to drape over myself because I was freezing. Very odd, but there were people wearing leather jackets and scarves... and believe me, we are not in winter weather yet. \n\nSTRIKE TWO? It's okay, maybe it'll be worth it, we said...\n\nTo top it off though, there was literally only one server. ONE SERVER. A full restaurant, every table full... and you're running an AYCE special. But there's only one server? It's like this place is asking for bad reviews! It took 10 minutes to get our drink order in, another 10 minutes to get our drinks and to finally be able to order... \n\nSTRIKE THREE? Should we leave? But it's so cheap, we said...\n\nThen, because of how backed up they were, we were told that we could \"ONLY ORDER 4 ITEMS AT A TIME TO KEEP AN EVEN FLOW TO EACH TABLE.\" I have never ever heard of this order limit before and I'd like to say I'm an AYCE connoisseur... This is strike four, right? We should get out of here, right?\n\nI do want to acknowledge the young man who was literally sprinting around from table to table, trying his best to accommodate everyone. Your hustle did not go unnoticed and it's not fair you got put into that position to cover the WHOLE restaurant by yourself by management on a Saturday night when they were running a special. \n\nBut 20 more minutes went by and we still had not gotten any of our food yet. At this point we were just hangry (hungry x angry) and not to mention ridiculously cold... we were just over the situation, and were ready to just drive to another AYCE spot and were more than happy to spend double paying 30$ per person than continue through this torture. \n\nNever again.. not even for half price.We had a great dinner elsewhere and agreed it was money well spent.
