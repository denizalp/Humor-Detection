So after writing my review about Dickeys in Mentor Ohio, I get an answer and request for a phone number and email so they can contact me.\n\nThey left the below message on my Yelp account.... \n\nVERY INTERESTING....  didn't seem to care one bit!!!\n\nHi Laura,\n\nSorry to here that our ribs aren't any better than Giant Eagles.  Well, since this is a free country, at least you have the option to get your barbecue there when you have a hankering.  So enjoy your Giant Eagle ribs and have a great day.\n\nRon Barnhart\nOwner
