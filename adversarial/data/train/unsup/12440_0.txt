I'm super in love with this Burger joint. I would look at Jackson's Burger as a more sophisticated alternative to the conventional fast food joint. \n\nBurgers here are made with high quality beef.i know this instantly from my first bite into the burger. You can actually taste the beef and notice the chewy texture of the ground beef. \n\nDon't get me started on the poutine. They make amazing fusion style poutine that is loaded with cheese curds and gravy sauce. My favourite was the Jerk Chicken Poutine. The fries retained their crisp and the sauce was really jerky.
