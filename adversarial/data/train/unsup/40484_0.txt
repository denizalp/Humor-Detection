Love this cute salon\/spa for mani pedis. The staff is incredibly helpful and nice. \n\nPros: Wide range of nail colors, neck wrap with scented oil, better than average tea selection, very sanitary.\n\nCons: you have to make an appointment, the outcome of your nail job may depend on the skill level of the technician (little bit of a dice roll). \n\nOna side note the owner of the salon has taken the time to come up with and manufacture a 'Salon 3121' range of products. This tells me that the business is a passion not just an investment. Overall, I think this salon is striving to do right by customers and they are succeeding. Keep up the good work Salon 3121!
