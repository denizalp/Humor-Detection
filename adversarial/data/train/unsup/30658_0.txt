I only wish this place was closer to the SW area!  Not too many places here (I'm a Boston transplant) have ever heard of a \"Rachel\" (instead of a Rueben), never mind, know how to make one. They did a bang up job of it and I'd definitely go back for another! Didn't try any of their desserts....I was way too full..LOL.
