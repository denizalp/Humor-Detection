Scrubs came to my house for a pre-holiday clean and they were like a cleaning tornado. 4 friendly women went straight o work and scrubbed until it all shined! I am incredibly hard to please, but they did. I will be using them regularly now. They didn't mind working around my dogs and even were considerate of the dogs fear of the vacuum.  Can't recommend enough.
