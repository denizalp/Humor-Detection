I don't frequent coffee establishments...in fact it takes a special place to make we want to go in for a visit.  Sambalatte is just that!  In fact it annoys me now when someone wants to meet somewhere else for coffee.  They are serving quality products here, work with local small businesses and have great customer service.  It is a little trendy, but not terribly pretentious.  The best part is they are carrying She Bakes products now...SO GOOD...they have summoned my taste buds twice in the last week!
