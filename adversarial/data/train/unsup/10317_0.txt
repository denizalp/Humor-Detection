The Pho here was pretty darn bad. The soup reeked of MSG, it's very Americanized. There's not much flavor in the soup and the noodle and meat didn't taste like how they're supposed to. However, the price is actually pretty good, especially for restaurants in Vegas. It's about twice more expensive than regular Pho, but the portion's doubled. I also tried the Beef Stew, it wasn't bad. I liked the stew better than the Pho. The service's really good, it's like dining in a 4 stars restaurant lol. Pros: It's the only Pho restaurant around the strip and it's open until late.
