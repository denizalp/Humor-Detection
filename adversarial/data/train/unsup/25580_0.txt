The best gym that I have joined...  affordable, great atmosphere and well maintained.  Clean, bright and friendly managers\/staff.  Great selection of classes and great day care providers... just wish they had more day care hours during the afternoon hours.  It is busy enough to give you motivation but never cramped.  \n\nThe management team run a fantastic gym and give great service.. so far ;)
