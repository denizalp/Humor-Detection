My friend and I stayed at the Biltmore for the weekend and had spa treatments for two days. Day 1 was outstanding for both of us. We each had a deep tissue massage and were both delighted. A special shout out to Ray who is an outstanding masseuse. Day 2 my friend had an exceptional experience. I had concerns and was delighted because the manager listened and immediately resolved my concerns. I left happy and cared for as a client. I will be back.
