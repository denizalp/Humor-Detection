I honestly only come here for the boba..\nService I don't care for, because well.. They don't give service at all.. If you're dining in, they take your order, bring your food and that's the last you see of them.\n\nTheir menu has varieties of the smoothies, teas, shaved ice and foods. My favorite items would be Taro Smoothie and their Chicken Wings. The other items and drinks are not too bad.\n\nWas never disappointed with food and drinks but the service sucks!
