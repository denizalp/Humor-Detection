Noisy, awful place. I've lived here for almost 2 years and I've literally never seen management walking the grounds. Every time I go to the office, the woman moans and groans and sighs. Real welcoming. The children around here are awful brats who are allowed to graffiti, vandalize and treat the place like they own it. And the kids parents are so ghetto that if you politely ask them to keep it down, you'll be verbally attacked. I've had ever appliance break or work inefficiently. I've had roaches. I've had bad neighbors and bad service from the office women. Thank god my lease is up soon, anything is better than this. If i wanted to live in a ghetto complex, I could be paying like $350 less to do so.
