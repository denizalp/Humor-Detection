Many mexican american places are hit or miss. This place is definitely in the hit category. Service was freindly and quick (I was in and out for lunch in 25 minutes) and the food was decent. Now we are not talking 5 star food, but for the $7 price tag I felt I got a bargain. Was expecting to spend $10-12 for the quality and amount of food I got. So I add the extra into the tip. \n\nIf I am in town again I shall return.
