Sweet relief in the form of a cute semi-hidden hair salon on Lee Road! Who knew?!\n\nI've been \"growing my hair out\" for awhile now and the in between cuts are so important to this process when you're trying to bounce back from a pixie cut...then an asymmetrical cut...then a seriously poorly cut asymmetrical cut. My poor hair was botched the last time I got an in between haircut and I was seriously unhappy with it. I've been working for months and months to get my hair to grow out and reach a certain length and style goal, so you can imagine my disappointment when my stylist didn't really listen and set me back a month or two. After even trying to point out the issues that were evident in the chair and getting shrugged off, I knew a change had to be made. After learning about Cut at the big Yelp Burstday party, I figured I'd give them a try. The girls at the booth seemed nice enough and the overall feeling of the salon was really clean CUT...heh. Sorry. So many \"cuts\". \n\nMandy seems like a really well versed gal when it comes to hair. She immediately took my photo suggestions and developed a plan for correcting what had gone so wrong with my last cut. She even suggested some little tweaks to better fit my face shape, which was a huge sigh of relief for me! I've been waiting to find a hairdresser that will actually take into consideration the fact that the hair will be on my head. As in around my face. As in framing ME. MY FACE. HAIR. It all works together! Woohoo Mandy gets it! (I feel like they all do here; all very professional and talented people, from what I understand.)\n\nI was really pleased with the advice and talented treatment that my locks underwent. I feel like this could get serious. Like I could become--dun dun DUN--monogamous. \n\nI'll be coming back in about a month to continue this long trek to what I actually want my hair to look like. In the meantime, I'm going to keep on growing it.
