I must say that I had an amazing tour with Danielle S.. Gorgeous grounds and I met Rachel, and the grounds foreman Andy. Everyone was super helpful, and Danielle spent hours with me. I am moving in next week and I really look forward to it. Out of everywhere I looked the staff here was 5 starrs!!!!!
