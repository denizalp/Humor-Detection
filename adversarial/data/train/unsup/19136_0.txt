Wow. I have never been blown away by breakfast as I was here. Never.\n\nSimple. Hearty. Filling. Good price. What more can I ask for?\n\nI ordered (can't remember the name...my bad) a croissant with eggs, cheese and bacon in it which came with a side of fresh fruit. I was greeeeedy heffa and ordered a side of their homestyle potatoes\/fries. OMG they were so good and a little different from what I've normally been served...they were buttery, creamy and tasted of dill or a different type of season one doesn't usually experience. The potatoes were soft and crunch at the SAME TIME~ I know, I'm so easy to please...but it was so worth it.\n\nHubby ordered the Three Musketeers and he was suitably impressed as well...he cleared everything off on his plate and looked so happy. After an early start of hitting the mall (to get his computer fixed) and then me dragging him around Home Depot (lights needed to be replaced), this was such a lovely way to get in a late breakfast at 11am.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try their other items on the menu - it all looks so wonderful.
