My cousin and I randomly passed by this place on Sunday. I must say, I really did enjoy their brunch menu esp because its more known for a bar. They serve genetic brunch food but the food quality was pretty good.  I ordered their pea-meal bacon with hollandaise sauce, extra sausage on the side and my cousin had their smoked salmon. We both really enjoyed our meal. I definitely would recommend this place but be prepared to wait a bit.
