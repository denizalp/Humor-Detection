shoot me now... \n\ngot dragged here for a work function and I should have gnawed my own foot off to get out of the experience....\n\nwork is work so once in a while you have to do the Thursday rounds and hit the bay street circuit but I duck out when it comes time to grab dinner... but we had clients in so there was no escaping it.... they suggested the trump...\n\nfirst off, the attitude at the hostess stand was horrendous... so what if we came in at 930pm looking for dinner??? if youre open youre open... and if you can seat us, great... if not just let us know and we can move along... 10 min of humming and double checking with the girl looking at us like we were asking to steal her puppy...\n\nsecond, this is not a steak house... we all ordered steaks... had no prblm with the price cause we assumed at those prices they would know what they were doing and using great quality suppliers... Fail on both sides.... out of 7 ppl only 2 finished their steaks (the 2 fillets....) the rest of us gave up... either too gristly or waaaay too over done...\n\n90min of saying \"its not that bad\" or \"the sides are tasty\" kinda killed the mood.... \n\nThird, what the fuck is up with the music being that loud??? its a Thursday! im having dinner!!! its costing me $150 a plate, I don't need house beats drowning out the conversation...\n\nif youre looking to entertain clients and you have to stick to the core try Blowfish on bay, or Hys, Ki or even one of the Dukes pubs... any wheres better than this...
