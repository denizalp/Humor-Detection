Ah, La Madeleine. I loved to eat at La Madeleine way back when they had a location at the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall (Eons ago, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth in search of Coelacanth croissants, French onion Oviraptor soup and Brontosaurus brioche ), so I was excited to hear they had opened up a shop in Chandler near the mall. We were in search of an evening sweet treat, so we headed over to get a few items to go. When we entered, we were warmly greeted by one of the workers exclaiming \"Bonjour!\" There's a dine in area and a separate to-go and bakery area which is convenient for those wanting to grab and go. \n\nWe perused through the delectable looking pastry case. The sacher torte caught my eye. It's hard to find this little slice of Austrian heaven in Arizona, so I knew I had to get it. I also love citrus-infused desserts as well so we got a lemon tart. It was neatly packaged in a small little box and we were on our way to enjoy some dessert in the comfort of our own home.\n\nThe sacher torte was a lovely sight to behold. The ganache layer was perfectly smooth, with a small little chocolate \"Sacher\" placard on top. While the end of the torte was a bit dry the rest of the cake was moist and I liked the combination of fruit with the dense chocolate cake. The lemon tart was beautifully made, but the crust was a bit too hard for me with a runny filling that was too sweet for my tastes. \n\nI'm glad La Madeleine is back in the Phoenix area! Here's hoping it's here to stay.
