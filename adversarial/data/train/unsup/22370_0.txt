Oh yeah. One of my new favorites and yes it's mainly because of the waterfall and stream. Hey, what can I say the water soothes me like nothing else can. It's just something about listening the moving water that makes everything so tranquil. The hike itself is not very strenuous but it is a bit long, especially with little ones so be prepared. Finding the stream is very easy once you get closer to the mountains. Keep a look out for animal feces as it is EVERYWHERE! If you're walking in the sun it will be a bit warm, but once you hit the shade of the mountain it cools down drastically. We went when there was a breeze so it helped while we walked into the valley. You can hear frogs croaking and the water is so refreshing and cold. I loved it. \n\nThe trail is easy to find as there is a sign along the fence where the entrance is. It is right before Spring Mountain Ranch. The trail is short, took us about an hour and a half. Plus the scenery is breathtaking so you'll want to stop to take it in and enjoy.
