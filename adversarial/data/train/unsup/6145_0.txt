I'm kind of disappointed, on one hand I appreciate the wine selection and the fact that they carry Babcock Ice Cream, but I can't help but feel underwhelmed by the meat and deli selection.\n\nThere are several cuts of meat, but only a few 'prepared' meats. By that I mean, seasoned chicken breasts, or marinated meats, ready to throw on the grill. There was probably one bacon selection, four brats selection, on kabob, and everything else was just plain ol' meat.\n\nTheir deli lacked variety. Every salads they had available was mayo based, displayed in a lackluster shades of white. \n\n*sigh*\n\nI really liked that the butchers and people working behind the deli and cash registers were very friendly, and you do get greeted as if you were a long time customer, whether that's true or not.
