***************************** 1,096 *******************************\n\n       I've been a fan of chef Daniel Boulud and I've been to every single restaurants he owns in New York City, as well as his former restaurant here in Las Vegas at the Wynn before. I was stoked to try this DB Brasserie.\n\n      The space is gorgeous, spacious, elegant, and Frenchies in an Italian ispired Venetian of all hotels in Las Vegas. \"db Brasserie is Chef Daniel Boulud's new contemporary French restaurant at The Venetian® Las Vegas. The menu stays true to Chef Boulud's signature French-American cooking and modern sensibility by offering updated brasserie classics, along with three of Boulud's signature burgers featured at his restaurants New York City. Market-driven dishes, using the season's best ingredients, and a selection of elegant desserts round out the menu.\" It was exactly how I would imagined it. \n\n       Greeted nicely by hostess Elda and Jairy, we were seated promtly with our private party. Our servers were attentive to our party. Pass Hor d'ourves were flowing out nicely and qutie a few more dishes of the night that we go to indulge. \n\n- PÂTÉ DE CAMPAGNE BOURGUIGNON, homemade pickles, country bread - Oh my goodness! \n\n- FOIE GRAS AU TORCHON rhubarb, turnips, pistachio, frisee - California banned foie, I got to order everything with Foie Gras in it. \n\n- HAMACHI CRU, eggplant cumin aigre doux, finger lime, harissa, shallot  - you wouldn't believe what a 3 Michelin Star French chef can do, ORDER IT.\n\n- SAUMON AU CHOU, Savoy Cabbage, Horseradish, Maitake, Pork Belly, Radish, Poppy Seed - love. \n\n- CROQUE MONSIEUR, Warm Ham, GruyÈre and Béchamel Sandwich, CROQUE MADAME - Topped with a Farm Egg, I just had to order this, just because. \n\n- Crispy Duck Confit , swiss chard, turnip, trumpet royale mushrooms, onion rings - I can eat this dish ver and over. \n\n- \"LE PRÉSIDENT\"  Chocolate-Hazelnut Mousse Tart, Coffee Chantilly - delicious.\n\n      We're glad that chef Daniel Boulud is back in town. This is a restaurant when I come here, I will gaurantee the food will be good, consistent, and exactly how I crave for these French dishes. \n\n        Chef  David Middleton executed chef Daniel Boulud 's vision well. I highly recommend it this place, good food, good wine list, unpretentious, and in a casual and comfortable setting. Service was excellent fromn start to finish, hat off to the management since DB Brasserie is still such a new spot! \n\nP.S. Inside the Venetian Hotel
