We ate dinner here the first night we stayed at the Howard Johnson. This place is attached to the motel. So we just wanted to eat and go back to our room to prepare for our convention day the next day. The food was decent. The wait staff could care less about you but the food showed up hot and fast. \n\nWe did go to the bar every night we were here. There was one really nice bartender the first night and we started talking and she said that she would be there all that week and she wasn't there any of the next nights. So she was great but may be they frown upon personal human interaction here. \n\nWe ate breakfast here every day and it was OK. My husband, which is rare, had a terrible breakfast most of the days. He hated eating there but it was right there and we could be on our way to the convention center. Nothing spectacular.
