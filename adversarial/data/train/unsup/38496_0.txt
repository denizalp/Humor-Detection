It is worth the wait!!!! Everything and anything you can order here is beyond amazing. I've been coming to JFF (Juans Flaming Fajitas) for over 3 years now (sorry this is my first review). Before I had even visited JFF I had this image of a robertos type place and oh, was I wrong! It is very spacious, family-style restaurant and it can seat parties of 20-30 (I've been to 3). An authentic feature is that they make their own tortillas in the restaurant while you're dining. \nI have brought every family member, friend, coworker, and even my dog to JFF. Yes...you can dine with your pooch on the patio (just let them know before hand and they'll let you and your pup in the side entrance). I have never heard a complaint about the quality of the food, the presentation, or the pricing from any of the several affiliates I have introduced to the JFF family. I often get invites from people I brought to JFF asking me to join them there because they are now JFF (Juan's Frequent Flyers). \nAbout a month ago I was entertaining family on the strip and while chatting it up with a bartender at a well know Mexican restaurant, she actually mentioned JFF as the best place for locals! That just speaks for itself. I'm excited that they'll be opening another location soon.
