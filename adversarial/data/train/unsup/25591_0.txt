Bring your appetite. They feed you like your starving. Staff was on point with what you expect from a chinese restaurant. Food just as good, chicken was a bit dry but spot on for flavor. Mongolian Beef was perfect.  We did the peking family meal. And the Zombie drinks were great. Planning to make this our goto for chinese food. With tip whole meal came to $60ish for 2. Now onto home for a food coma.
