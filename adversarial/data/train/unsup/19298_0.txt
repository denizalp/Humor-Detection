whooo hoooo.... \nLet me set the scene, its hot, I'm pushing a stroller, just came out of gymboree and on a mission to make it to the coach store... but then up ahead to my right I see the  Dooney and Bourke sign... I do a double take because the only other outlet I have ever seen is in Florida, its hot like Orlando but I know I'm not in Orlando, lol!  Anyways I make my way into the store, the cool a\/c greets me as I enter.  I browse and I can feel my heartbeat skip a beat so happily.  Like a good outlet shopper I head to the back of the store to view the clearance stuff and low and behold there it is... THE purse I have been dreaming of but had not quite found.  Off white, big (fit diapers, bottles and laptop) and all leather.  The sign at the top says 40% off but its right above some small purses so I'm bummed thinking oh I guess I have to pay full price (outlet price).  I go to the register and the guy says this one is 40% off too, I almost pass out from pure glee.  He then proceeds to check in his handy dandy computer for the matching wallet that he tells me can be shipped to me directly if its in stock.  Sadly he could not find it for me but that was ok.  I have to say the customer service was great, my son didn't get buck and I left into the Vegas heat on cloud nine!\n\nP.S.  Now I know how Carrie Bradshaw felt when she seen those shoes in the window...  I recall her saying 'Hello Lover' and that's what I said to my new purse, HA!
