I found them on Groupon.  24 cupcakes for $22.  \n\nI was not impressed at first by the presentaion...meaning the cupcakes did not look at pretty as other cupcake places.  HOWEVER I must say that me and my guests were very impressed by the taste.  We got lemon, red velvet and chocolate and the cupcake itself was fluffy, moist and flavorful!!  Again the decorating was very simple BUT I would rather have a tasty cupcake than a pretty overpriced one.  I liked them and I will be going back!!
