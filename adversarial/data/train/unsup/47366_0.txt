The room was great but for a non-smoker the casino was horrible.  There is a very small area for non-smokers and so close to the smoking area that it might as well have been a smoking area.  Don't know why casinos cater to the smokers only.  Would be nice to have a completely separate area for both.  It's not like they can't afford it.  My fiance and I had such a headache from the smoke that we will never go back.
