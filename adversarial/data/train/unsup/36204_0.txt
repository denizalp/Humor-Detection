It's bad enough the prices fluctuate once you've got your stuff there, to make it even more annoying this is one of many times I've come by the office and it's closed. They requested my keys three weeks ago to do some maintenance and I've made THREE attempts to pick them back up but they're literally always on a break.\n\nLife storage opens at 9am. It's 9:45 and they have this sign up. COOL.
