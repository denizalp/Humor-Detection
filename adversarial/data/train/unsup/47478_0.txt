A group of ten of us (late 20's- 30's) did the noriko room and had a blast. The room had multiple compartments and 2 floors. Production quality was good. We got out with a few mins to spare but had to use a hint. No special discounts if you check into Facebook but $22 pp is worth it for the experience. I also did iescape on Yonge and the quality pales in comparison.
