I am writing this review, having known about Crudo for a while.  I read many of the reviews, as did my wife, and we thought this would perhaps be a place worth trying out one night for a date.   I am writing this after going to Crudo on a date with my wife on 04\/06\/2018.  We live in Mesa AZ.  Here are my observations and thoughts:\n\n1) The appetizer of the seabass \"ceviche\" was good.  My wife and and l liked it.  \n\n2) The market fish entree that I ordered was good.  My wife even liked the albacore (tuna) steak.  \n\n3) My wife's gnocchi with lamb (I believe) was a bit salty for her.  She told me that it was actually way too salty for her.  Whether there was a lot of salt in it, or not, it tasted way too salty for her.  \n\n4) Afterwards, for dessert, we decided to order the tiramisu of the day.  It was supposedly lemon curd flavor.  All my wife and I tasted was sugar.  It was way too sugary.  It also tasted more like cheesecake rather then tiramisu.  It was not tiramisu!!!\n\nI am writing this having traveled to Italy many times with my wife.  We have traveled from as far North as the Switzerland border, to as far South as Sorrento\/Napoli, and Amalfi.  My wife and I know what is tiramisu and Italian food.  This was not.  Lay off on the sugar!!  Stop trying to \"invent\" flavors for tiramisu, and stick to the traditional espesso\/chocolate flavor.  If you do serve a lemon curd \"tiramisu\" call it cheesecake, not tiramisu!!  It was totally misleading.  Nothing like what is in Italy.  \n\nGiven my rating, I did not see the drive into Phoenix from Mesa on the Loop 202 Red Mountain Expressway as worth my time for this restaurant.  They have some good things, but there are many things that are so-so.  Either the food tasted way too salty, or was way to sweet.  \n\nIf indeed Crudo seeks to draw their inspiration from Italy, perhaps it is time that people who own this restaurant learn from the masters (in Italy!).  What they have here is a poorly done copy of Italian \/ American food.  They missed a lot of the subtle flavors that food in the Veneto, or even in Roma or Sorrento, embodies.  They Americanized it too much (in a bad way!).  I am all for being creative (as that is what we do as Americans), but creative is NOT adding more salt or sugar to the food.  Being creative is trying new combinations that compliment each other (not overpower the other, and definitely not adding more salt or sugar!).
