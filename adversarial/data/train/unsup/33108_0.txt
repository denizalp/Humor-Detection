I think I may have a new favorite Vietnamese restaurant with Pho 602. The place is pretty new. It's clean and there's plenty of seating. Probably the best looking Vietnamese restaurant in town. There's also a stage in the restaurant, perhaps for Iive entertainment eventually. I'll have to ask them about the next time I come in.  On to the food. I ordered their rice plate special that came with grilled pork, fried beancurd, and a fried egg. It was plentiful and very good! What to rave about so far is really their fried chicken wing appetizer that my friend introduced us too. They were a light and crispy, not at all oily. They had a touch of sweetness, with a garlic seasoning.
