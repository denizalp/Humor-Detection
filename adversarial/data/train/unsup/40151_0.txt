$5 for small drip, $2 for tap water, slow and unorganized service.  Avoid this place unless you are in dire need.  There were several sandwich orders but they did not bring them out as they finished.  Instead they waited until they were all done and brought out orders for 5 different groups at once.  Confusion ensued as the orders where sorted out.  All this plus you pay an almost 100% premium over other Starbucks. \n\nIt's also a mess in here.  Basically it's a very badly managed store.  The manager should be embarrassed. They shouldn't call this place a Starbucks.  I have some suggestions of possible names.\n\nAgain, avoid.
