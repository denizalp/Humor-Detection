With a rating of only 3 stars I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of both their food and service. \n\nAs a SoCal resident I have tried numerous amount of kbbq and this will go down as one of my favorites. However, it is pricier than most kbbq I've been to. Pricing may be due to the fact that there is not much of a competition with kbbq around the area? Don't let the rating discourage you from giving this place a try. \n\nAlso to my surprise, I didn't smell like bbq afterward. Great ventilation.
