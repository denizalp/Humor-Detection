I used to swim a lot here when I lived closer to this pool last summer.  Since moving, I haven't found a pool that I liked, so I come here from time to time.  I do have a pool at my apartment, but I do like to take advantage of stuff like this to mix things up.\n\nAnyways, the pool is easy to find.  Its right off the 202 on Kyrene on the West side of the road.  Its only a $1.50 to get in, which I think is remarkably cheap.  The place is great for kids, families, or anyone looking to cool off.  They have 3 seperate swimming areas!  They have a diving area with a couple diving boards.  They also have a kids swimming area with stuff to climb on that shoots out water.  They also have an adult pool where you can either swim laps or just hang out in the water.  They even have drink stations n stuff!\n\nI drive here to swim, hang out and cool off when it gets to be hot out here.  If you check out the website, I guess this place also has classes for kids and adults too.
