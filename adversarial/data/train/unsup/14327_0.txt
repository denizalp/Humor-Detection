I just came back from a great dinner.  After an eight hour business meeting, I needed a steak.....I have been wanting to try this NY favorite in LV since it opened last year.\n\nI started with their a slice of their thick bacon and a bowl of lobster bisque.  Both wer outstanding.   The bacon was meaty and the bisque had a spicy kick that made it super yummy!\n\nFor dinner, I had the rib-eye steak, gnocchi with butter and truffles.  The steak and gnocchi was awesome....full of intense flavor.\n\nFor desert, I had the banana bread pudding....it came with a scoop of ice cream and a super sweet caramel  sauce. \n\nOverall, a great steak meal.  The service was great and the decor was dark woods that screamed old school NY steakhouse.
