I came for brunch with my girlfriends and while the food was good, our experience was less than desirable, to say the least. I reached out and let them know what our experience was like and they invited us back and more than made up for it. Any restaurant that puts effort into service recovery is definitely a place I want to frequent. The brunch is really fantastic!!! I would highly recommend it!
