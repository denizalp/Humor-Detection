Recently moved to a new town, new vet. Called Roadrunner to change contact information, shipping address and credit card information. Vet then called in our order. A few days later, received a call from Roadrunner that they needed our credit card information (again???).  Two days later, received another call from Roadrunner saying our vet declined the order because one of our dogs needed a checkup. Dog just had a checkup. Vet called in order already.  \n\nCompany with this much confusion is not a company I wish to do business with any longer. Taking our business elsewhere. \n\nNever understood why they don't have a more professional website to handle online orders and to change contact information. Would make ordering so much easier for everyone.
