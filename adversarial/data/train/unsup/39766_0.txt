Old school Vegas charm - which means cocktail waitresses, vinyl and velour, dim lighting, and Frank Sinatra sightings.  It is in some ways out of a movie.  With so many reviews, there is not much I can add, except that the stars are more for the AMBIANCE AND EXPERIENCE than for the food.  I had the Chicken Parm - double heaping helpings of breaded chix, basic pasta, and passable marinara.  Overall, this is middling Italian-American fare with BREAKFAST OPTIONS and many HANGOVER CURES at GOOD PRICES.  \n\nCUT TO THE CHASE:  On my last two visits to Vegas, I did not make it a point to go back.  But I did not deliberately avoid it either.  It's just not my thing.
