Omg so I was telling my boujee boyfriend about how I've never had macaroons before and he was like describing them to me and it sounded so good. So we hop on Yelp find this place and read the reviews look at the pics yadda yadda so we pull up and it's literally the cutest place ever and the macaroons are delicious!!! I've never been to Paris, but in this grocery store I actually felt like I was in the city of love. I recommend this place! 10\/10!! PS the pumpkin cheesecake is to DIE for!!
