The EpiCentre, as a whole.  It's a tricky mess trying to lump it all into one category, and one review.  As others have said - Daytime EpiCentre and Nighttime EpiCentre are two totally different beasts.  One more beastly than the other, for sure.  \n\nDuring the day\/lunchtime there are tons of quick and tasty places to eat (5 Guys, Firehouse, Moe's, Jason's Deli, Libretto's), some sit-down places (Mortimer's, Vida, Enso) and dessert choices (Cold Stone, Yoforia) and if you're coming from the Wells Fargo campus, you can get there and not have to venture outside (unless you count that section of parking garage you have to walk through in the BB&T building \"outside\").  And if you need a go-to pharmacy, the CVS downstairs can't be beat.\n\nI'd give it a 5 star rating for the daytime.  Super convenient for uptown workers and dwellers during the day (we're already parked here somewhere, so it's not an issue).\n\nNow, the evening on the other hand... beast-a-rific.  Dress code issues (really? you're not going to let us in to see X-Men because the hubs is wearing flip flops?), accidentally going to Suite on college night (get off my lawn), parking, traffic, and oh my the drunkie-poos.  Those things all make it a tad unpleasant.... but yet.... There's something about it.  Something about the closeness of the establishments, and the options that you have.  You can go to a few different places that have totally different vibes and never have to walk more than 100 yards.  It's just such a cool concept, and I really do love it.\n\nWhat we really need to work on fixing is the type of people that end up here.  Maybe... a test before you are allowed on the premises.  I can picture it now.  Set a beer, a funnel, and a tube out on the sidewalk - if you put the 3 together and crush the beer, you aren't allowed in.  Put up a sign with some glitter tubes \"Free Glitter!\"  If you apply the glitter to yourself, you aren't allowed in.  Think that would work?
