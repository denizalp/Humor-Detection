I followed Michelle King here from the disaster of Urban Hair, where the receptionist effed up my appointment twice and aggravated my nerves with her fake nice bullshit. The staff at R Salon are great and of course, Michelle is the shit.\n\nIf you have short hair and are looking for something edgy and fashion forward, get Michelle to do your 'do.  Seriously.  She's phenomenal.  She knows the industry and her styles\/cuts\/colors prove this.  She's flexible in her times and reasonable in her prices.  I am a prick when it comes to my hair, but Michelle turns it out every time.\n\nAlso...R Salon has those DELISH!!! sourdough pretzels and RED VINES candy at the front desk for the customers, as well as refreshments that I can't help but indulge in every time I'm there.
