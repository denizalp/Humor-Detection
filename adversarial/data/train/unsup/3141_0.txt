For my bf and I's first time at a shooting range, Grant was extremely helpful. He explained everything from the different types of guns, ammo and all his recommendations for us as beginners. He's very knowledgable and not intimidating. They also have a store with a wide selection of things to buy connected to the range. There is of course a restroom as well, and it's very clean. It's an indoor shooting range, so you're in the AC'd room, yes! Sadly, Grant wasn't there when we returned our equipment and the this other guy was extremely rude. \n\nThe cost is very reasonable. It's $15 for the range fee, but Tuesday's is free for the ladies and Thursdays is 1\/2 off for locals. As for the ammo it varies from $15- $20 and handguns are about $15. Everything else such as eye and ear protection and targets are $1 each. Great price to practice and figure out what guns you want to purchase or just have a group outing. If you have your own gear you only need to pay for your lane. Keep in mind, you cannot bring your own ammo if you don't posses your own gun.
