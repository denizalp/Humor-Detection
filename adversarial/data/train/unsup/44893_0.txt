Went in today before lunch to get some new nail supplies. I asked the manager of the store what I need for a beginners nail kit. He walked me through the store and told me what I needed. Iwould give it 5 stars if some of the prices were lower. But overall they have a great selection to choose from.They do host classes and give a student\/ license discount. Best beauty supply in Vegas so far.
