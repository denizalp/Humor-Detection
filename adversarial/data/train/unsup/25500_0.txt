Okay, this place is pretty much the perfect weekend breakfast spot. For those of us in college Saturday and Sunday mornings can be absolute Hell. Having to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table to get some breakfast\/brunch isn't that uncommon and makes things even more unbearable. This place is NEVER crowded and you can always be seated promptly. The menu is so extensive that I guarantee they'll have something that's just right to cure that hangover. Prices are great and so is the food. It's kind of a hidden gem... Not too appealing from the outside but pretty nice on the interior. I wouldn't be surprised if word gets out and Theo's starts becoming popular quite soon...
