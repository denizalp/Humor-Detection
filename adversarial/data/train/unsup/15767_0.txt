Items Selected:\nApple Fritter, Glazed Classic Cake, Glazed Chocolate Cake, Buttermilk Bar, Cereal, Raised & Glazed, Maple Longjohn, Strawberry Sprinkles, Boston Cream, Wafer Banana Cream, Raspberry Filled, Lemon Cream, Key Lime, Strawberries & Cream, White Cream, Chocolate Cream, Cookies N' Cream, The Nevadan\n\nVisited early on, an adverse experience with ownership delaying a second, better, trip to the Henderson store, it was largely because of location that Saturday featured a return to Donut Mania on South Durango, the selection far less creative than what was expected with some inconsistency in the dough but generally good execution.\n\nNow serving residents in the Southwest for two years, a short stint supplying Pawn Donuts ended by the predictable closing of such a misguided idea, it was just prior to Seven o'clock that the smell of flour and yeast greeted the nostrils as some twenty choices sat looking out from behind glass, the Fritter available in only one flavor while the rest ranged from classic to novel flavors.\n\nStaffed by just one young lady, her pleasant demeanor enlivening a small space that still feels a little worn, it was as result of a coupon offering ten bucks off a twenty dollar purchase that nineteen selections were made, a double order of the Strawberries & Cream fortuitous as the wispy raised base was one of the best as Whipped Cream contrasted with smooth Vanilla Pudding innards.\n\nUnfortunately finding the un-filled Yeasted collection erratic, some such as Homer Simpson's favorite light and fluffy while the Longjohn and Cereal were undercooked and oily, respectively, Donut Mania's Cake choices were highlighted by the Classic version as a Buttermilk Bar lacked the expected sour notes while the Chocolate one had lingering finish that tasted too much like unsweetened Cocoa Powder.\n\nFinding improvement in the filled options, though the Chocolate Cream suffered similarly to the Cocoa Ring, better bites were found particularly amidst the Fruit choices, the Wafer Banana Cream a spot-on representation of the Southern Pudding in a portable pocket while both Key Lime and Lemon were tangy without overdoing it thanks to both the filling itself and the well-thought condiments on top of them.\n\nFinding the Apple Fritter far too greasy, though admittedly more dense with Fruit than most local competition, Donut Mania's \"Nevadan\" once again proved worth both the calories and getting out of bed early for as the sticky Caramel topping pairs well to the toasted Coconut and Custard within.\n\n*** Slipping a bit compared to my Henderson experience, the consistency a serious issue considering the fact that there were no previously-unseen choices available, Donut Mania remains a good choice for those nearby looking for novelties, though Pink Box has upped their game considerably while also continuing to innovate as Ace continues to set the bar high for classics.
