I went there mainly to try out their $3 sushi menu. I ordered the spicy tuna and shrimp tempura roll for lunch. They were both very tasty! There were 6 pieces in the tuna and 5 for the tempura. If you are craving sushi and don't want to spend a lot their regular rolls are very affordable and taste good as well. The Resteraunt was half filled when I went and the service was still great. I didn't wait long for my sushi and my water was topped off frequently. They have $3 rolls Tuesday and Wednesday all day, and from 4-6p the rest of the week. Next time I go for lunch I want to try their bento boxes.
