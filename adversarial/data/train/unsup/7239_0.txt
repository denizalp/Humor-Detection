In an unassuming building with a simple neon \"Gracie's\" sign on the front of it, when you step inside you're transported to a no-b.s.-cheap drinks-luminiscently-lit dive bar.  The drinks hit the spot, especially on a weekday. There's a jukebox with rad tunes on it and shelves of games you can't help but grab. We ourselves, ended up playing old school Battleship and having a good time sinking each others' ships. The patio reminds me of sitting in someone's backyard and just kicking it. I'm genuinely surprised hipsters have not taken over this tiny, super low key bar, but maybe it was timing, I hope they won't anytime soon.
