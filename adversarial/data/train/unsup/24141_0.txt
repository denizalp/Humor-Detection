This is the closest post office to me, therefore it is the most convenient.\n\nI mostly come in to drop off parcels or mail for my shop and never had issues with the drop box. I've shipped out a few items from here as well and found- like most other post offices there can be quite a line once one forms. However, the service I've received here has always been kind and quick- once at the register that is.\n\nThe office itself is small and slightly drab, but I'm assuming most people don't buy their shipping supplies or greeting cards from here. \n\nThere is a self-service machine and 2\/3 of the office are rented out PO boxes. The office takes cash and credit card.
