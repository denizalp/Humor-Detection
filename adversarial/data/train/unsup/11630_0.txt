Their croissants are delightful and they are the best croissants I've ever had. I hate myself for living in Texas because we don't have stuff like that here. \n\nThe croissants are so flakey and butteryyyy and they had squash soup when I visited. I'm sure they have different soups available. Just get some croissants and dip it in the soup...OMG delightful!!! \nThe staff are really friendly, too :) The guy with the dread locks name is Keith. He saw my face everyday when I was visiting lol. I wanted to eat it as much as I could before I leave to go back to America.
