Newly remodeled lobby...menu is still wonderful! Ginger mushroom chicken claypot, ox tail, salt and pepper pork chops. Again,  if you don't know or ENJOY authentic C H I N E S E food as in mainland China... don't come here b\/c you will be disappointed. Broccoli beef, orange chicken, egg rolls no!  not here go to Panda for that. Otherwise, sit back and enjoy the trip without the airfair.
