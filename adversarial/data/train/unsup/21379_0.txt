Smart idea and very tasty. I came in on a Friday afternoon it wasn't too packed. Staff were friendly and explained the process to us. You pick your popsicle and you can get it dipped the topped with treats. All natural ingredients! The place was spotless. It was clean despite the consistent line on rotation. It's small but a good size to get in and out. I got a strawberry yogurt pop dipped in white chocolate and waffle cone. It was good. I will return and recommend. It's worth the trip to Noda if you sent from the area and if you are you have a pretty sweet spot I wish was near me.
