A fancier Thai fast food place. Trying to see what is this hype on this new restaurant, technically it is fast food restaurant that has elevated its status by having a nicer setting and a different serving method. What it reminds me of Mexican restaurant like Chipotle... you pick what ingredients you want in your bowl. \n\nFood seems ok and price seems ok for a downtown location.
