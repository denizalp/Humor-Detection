I haven't eaten in the actual restaurant yet, but I've grabbed takeout 4 out of the last 5 nights. \n\nComparatively to other sushi places on Bloor, I'd argue Big Sushi has the greatest value in terms of quality of fish, generous portions while still be pretty cheap. \n\nFavourites so far are, T2 take out special, spicy salmon tempura roll and the Chef's special Roll A.\n\nThis was a weak review. I'm sorry.
