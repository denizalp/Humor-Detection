Anyone who is losing their hearing but refuses to use a hearing aid will assume everyone else is deaf and speak at about 200 decibels.  And, of course, 300 decibels is required when talking on a cell phone which is perfectly acceptable in public.  Coco's, I would like you to meet my stepfather.  He will be dining with you whenever I'm involved.  Feel free to provide consistently crappy service.  Judging by my last two visits, that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nI would say the food at this location is generally decent.  And I would say the servers are generally friendly and pleasant.  Unfortunately, it will take repeated attempts to get your order right.\n\nI asked a server once if he thought he should write our order down.  He jokingly said no, then came back 5 minutes later to say he forgot what someone at our table ordered.  He did a nice sales pitch on the sweet potato fries, then brought regular fries anyway.  But, he was so personable I didn't hold it against him.  On my visit last week, four tries to get the breakfast order right.  Supposedly caused by a manager insisting on helping the wait staff by bringing out orders.  Seems more like an attempt to turn tables quicker.  I guess it backfired.\n\nEnd result...not  a bad place if you're willing to wait or eat what they bring you, rather than what you ordered.
