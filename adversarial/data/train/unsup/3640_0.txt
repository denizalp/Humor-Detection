The \"Chinese\" food at Manchu Wok is disgusting. If I could give zero stars, I would. This swill (General Tso's chicken was soft and reminded me of GLUTEN) was so absurdly bad that I couldn't finish it, and my friends know I can eat ANYTHING. The lo-mein was tasteless. It was \"Panda Express\"-expensive, but not remotely as tasty.\n\nI ate here when I was semi-stranded at the Charlotte Douglas airport overnight - the only positive was that the meal was comped by the airline.\n\nEverytime you eat there, God kills a kitten. Oh, and Manchu Wok profits. Avoid this place.
