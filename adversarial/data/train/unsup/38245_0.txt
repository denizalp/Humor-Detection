We came to this restaurant based on reviews, however, it was the complete opposite of what we expected. We ordered two salads, Greek and Gyro, which the menu stated came with garlic knots. It took over 30 minutes to get our salads and once we got them realized that instead of garlic knots, we got pita bread:(. After waiting 20 mins the employee working the register informed us that our food was taking longer than expected due to a larger order that had been called in. This information would have been very helpful prior to placing our order. When we left, there were three other parties waiting for their food and the even their orders were coming out wrong. Definitely not planning on coming back to this place.
