Last time I gave them 4 stars but I'm giving them 5 now bcuz Dr.Fliesher is the BEST!! Screw the wait time I would wait anyday for DR.Fliesher to deliver my baby. 6 weeks ago he delivered my son and I have to say he is amazing.  I have 2 kids my daughter I gave birth to in NY and I also had a great doctor there but he really knows what he's doing. I was iffy about him at first, I was really thinking about changing to a different doctor but I'm real glad I didn't. If u want a good doctor to deliver your baby he's the one! I had no problems
