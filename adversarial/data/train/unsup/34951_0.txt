Decent place uptown, they have a breakfast menu (served all day hrs are 8A to 3P) along with standard lunch menu with reasonable prices. The service was ok but I had to chase down the girl to get our bill but I just think it's part of their adjustment period of being new. \n\nI got the Cobb Salad with avocado and it was great, my friend got the veggie omelet and it looks tasty. I was all about getting the eggs originally but when I got there nothing was singing to me like the salad was so salad it was, I hate when that happens.\n\nI definitely want to see how their breakfast is since you know, their name is Eggheads and all and think it will be a good alternative to the normal staples around it (Showmars, Just Fresh, Dean And Deluca, etc) that are around the Latta Arcade area.
