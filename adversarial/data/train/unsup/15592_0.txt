Review #187 - 2016\n\nMy niece and I ended up at the Gelato Bar on Aug. 24th around 4:30 PM because it was so hot after we downed our ramen at Ramen Sora.\n\nThe young lady who was working that day was very sweet and attentive.  She was so nice & friendly.  We asked to try a few different flavors and I decided on the pistachio on a waffle cone.  I can't remember what my niece ended up getting, but she managed to finish hers with no problem.\n\nThe ice cream flavors are all good, but the pistachio was really good because you can actually tell that it was made with real pistachio and there wasn't any food color or weird after taste like most places that claims that their pistachio is natural & real.\n\nBut as much as I enjoyed my ice cream, I couldn't finish it because it was such a generous portion.  I ended up throwing about half of it away, which I honestly felt really bad about because I was craving for it again when the heat got even worse.
