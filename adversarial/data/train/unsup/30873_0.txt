So I recently moved from southern California and have been on the hunt for a good boba place in AZ to fulfill my boba addiction. After trying about 10 different boba places, I almost give up boba for good. I have finally found the one by accident!! This Boba Tea House is so delicious!! The boba is prepared just right and the tea is made just perfect...not too sweet. I will be coming back for more! Staff are nice and friendly.  Inside is a cute little place.
