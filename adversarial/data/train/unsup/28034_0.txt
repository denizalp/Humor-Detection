First off I want to say the masseuse Sabrina is the best I have ever had. She is the only reason we were going there for so long.\nI give one star because this location is extremely dishonest. My husband has been a member for several years. We have over 3 years of unused massages. They upped the monthly membership price by $15 and charged our bank account WITHOUT notifying us first. I called immediately and after being on hold for a very long time and calling back a few times I finally spoke to someone who wasn't new. The first person Kenna is new and placed me on hold several times. She told me they called all their members to let them know about the price increase. I told her we never got a phone call. She said they called. She also said they sent out a letter. I told her we never got a letter. When I spoke to a Kimberly she looked up our info and said they actually didn't call us but did send out a letter. I asked her what address they sent it to and it was our old address. I had updated my address with them in June\/July. So we didn't get a phone call and they sent out the letter to the wrong address. I told her I wanted to cancel our membership. She said she can't do that but Kendra in member devices would be caking me within a couple days. That was 10 days ago. I called again earlier this week and spoke to Kenna again. She took my message and said she would give it to member devices and they would call me back. Still haven't heard anything. I would save you money and not give them access to your account. Oh and I was told I have to give a 60 day notice. I'm sure they will not count back 10 days ago but the day they finally contact me.
