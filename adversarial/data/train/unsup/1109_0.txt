I am a makeup junkie and frequent Ulta and Sephora. This has by far been the WORST Ulta experience I've ever had. First, I'm not welcomed as I walk in.. No big deal, I know exactly what I'm heading for as I have a mission. Once I'm at the Anastasia of Beverly Hills area, he same lady asked me FOUR times is I was OK. Not, don't you love the new colors, or, yeah we just got those in... No only if I was OK and then stood there awkwardly each time. Needless to say, I out the products away that I was hoping to purchase and went to another area. I'm in the mood to buy a new skin care regimen. Again, a new lady came up to us three times asking us if we were OK and then walked away. Then, the lady from the first encounter came by twice to ask if I needed a shopping bag. Again, I put my products down and walked out of the store.\n\nMy wife never makeup shops with me and I feel bad she had to be there for this too. She was getting nervous and extremely irritated my the customer service and so was I ! I will never go back to this location!
