Never received a call when my glasses were ready, I had to call and check everyday yet everytime I came into the office they were not busy at all... I guess they have better things to do than to give little ol' me a simple call. They up-sell you to get thinner lenses even if you are poor and have medicaid. Exam prices are high aswell. Young African American girl was nice with the fitting and check-out, other than that this is a below average Optometrist who does not give alot of attention to the patient in my experience.
