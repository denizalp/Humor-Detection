Just left this location. Was not greeted at the door, I escorted myself tote computer department and waited for a sales associate to assist me. No one ever showed up, I walked over to a group of employees who were standing around with the \"team lead\" Mark. I asked that I have some assistance with a computer I was looking at, they acted as if I was bothering them. They stated they would page for an associate I watched from afar and no one was ever paged. Then I stood around for an additional 15mins To no avail. I approached the team lead Mark again and he was of no help. I'm not sure why they have so many sales associates but they are unable to assists. I won't be returning to this location and I may not return to the Franchise at all such a waste of my time.
