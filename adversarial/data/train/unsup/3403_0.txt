I really enjoy Joey's selection of the Chicago radio station, The Drive 97.1 FM; they feature classic rock.\n\nOn to the food. The Polish Sausage comes standard with yellow mustard, two sport peppers and grilled onions on a sesame bun. In Chicago we just say \"I want a Polish\". IMHO, this is the best item on the menu. \n\nThe Italian Beef can be garnished with roasted green peppers and melted cheese but their version of roasted green peppers falls way short of expectation. They just thinly slice some green bell peppers and steam them. Plus they use way too much oregano and\/or salt & pepper in the au jus. If I could fix one thing about Joey's it would be the Italian Beef.\n\nTheir Chicago style hot dogs are decent and worth ordering. I used to not like their Italian sausages because they used to overcook them. But they do a good job with them now. Although they seem to be on the spicy side but definitely worth ordering. Their meatball sandwich is good sans the oregano. They really love their oregano at Joey's. The fries are okay but they do tend to put a lot of salt on them, so say  \"easy on the salt Joey!\"
