This dealership is horrible. And their so called Customer Service manager, Beverly something, is beyond a joke. Pretty sure she's just there to fetch coffee and bagels as that's all she was doing the three times I tried to contact her with a problem.  No follow up from her. Can't wait to get my survey to rip them.
