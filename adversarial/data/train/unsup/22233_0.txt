When they opened (a week ago) they were selling sweet tea. Today when I went in they said they stopped selling sweet tea because they couldn't keep up with the demand. IN WHAT WORLD DO WE LIVE IN THAT WE STOP SELLING THE THINGS THAT ARE IN HIGHEST DEMAND? I will resume eating at this panda when they sell sweet tea again and will change my review to five stars at that point.
