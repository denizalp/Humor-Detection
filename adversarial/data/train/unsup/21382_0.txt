I've been to Neo a couple of times since it opened and it's quite a nice little coffee shop. I recognize the owners as I believe one is from Nadege and the other from Voodoo Child. The space is really nice - spacious, modern, light, extremely clean and chill. It has a slightly exposed, industrial vibe with lots of concrete and wood. I like combo of cute, tiny single tables up the front (something different) and booths and a communal table up the back.\n\nThey serve all your well known favourites - lattes, americanos, espresso, flat whites, cortados and pour over. They use De Mello Palheta beans which gives a strong and velvety coffee and non dairy milk offerings include almond, coconut and cashew (hipster on fleek right there). They also have a Japanese, matcha kinda thing going on with their baked goods, all of which look absolutely stunning (I guess I'd expect nothing less from a Nadege alum).\n\nI think this would be a nice place to work during the day. They have free wi-fi and there were some people there with laptops so I'd assume there must be some outlets around. The staff are very friendly but definitely without haste. \n\nOne barista impressed me with her recommendations of different non-dairy milks for different coffees based on their sweetness and frothiness. Based on signage they have won a few latte art awards. The latte art on my almond latte wasn't all that but it's harder to do. Only a few places around can pull of something exceptional with that material (Riddle Room, M Square, some people at Dineen).\n\nTip: To save you some awkwardness - the bathroom really is past the back wall and not downstairs like it would seem. The subtle sign they have doesn't really do the trick because the door almost completely blends in with the wall. But, evidently, if you push on it a discrete washroom appears as if from nowhere.
