Was shopping at Venetian and the fams was getting hungry. Did a search and saw chicken and waffles here. Glad I decided to check it out. Was on the pricier side, but probably one of the best fried chicken I have ever had. So crispy and flavorful. I think the syrup for the waffles had bourbon in it. Was very good as well. The place was laid back and the fams enjoyed themselves. Looking forward to coming back here next time I'm in Vegas.
