Okay, listen.. this is simple. Drop Starbucks, drop Dutch bros, and GET TO DRIFTWOOD COFFEE! \n\nI got their chocolate and orange espresso americano, super smooth and well brewed. \n\nThey offer sweet treats and pastries as well, but was only in for the espresso today. \n\nThey have a venue attached to the shop, will definitely check out some shows.\n\nCool vibes, amazing coffee, great price, bad ass location. Super stoked they finally opened!
