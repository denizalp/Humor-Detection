What made it brutal was: NO WiFi, NO entertainment except for the general screen worst movie choices then repeated from start and cut off before end, NO FOOD - yup you read this right, dripping AC. ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE.\nvouchers are offered to some people not others. Sorry but are you serious I heard that right!??? Yes I heard a crew member offer the vouchers to people that didn't even contribute. Wtf.
