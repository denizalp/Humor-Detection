I trusted this criminal with an expensive weighted 88 key MIDI controller that I was very fond of. All it needed was to be opened up and an internal battery replaced.  After 3+ months of excuses (a different one each phone call) I just gave up on it. I'm convinced this individual is a scam artist that gets people to leave their valuable gear with him, and he turns around and sells it.
