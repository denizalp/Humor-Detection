The Skillet is very good! The staff is a little slow but friendly. \n\nI am staying at the Hyatt and a quick walk down Bloor led me to this restaurant that offers breakfast all day. My kinda place. I was not greeted at the door but I found my own way to the bar where I prefer to eat. Once seated, a server poured me coffee and took my order. I really enjoyed The Skillet. Two over easy eggs on top of a good portion of potatoes, diced sausage, onions and peppers.
