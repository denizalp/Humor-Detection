I absolutely ADORE Roselle Desserts :D\nCute pastry shop newly opened in Corktown! Welcome to the neighborhood! They have a small selection of beautifully decorated mini cakes and also little baked treats on the side (cookies, brownies, candies, marshmallow, etc.)\n\nI was hoping to try The Earl (earl grey mousse cake) but I didn't see it on display. I guess they change flavours from time to time. So instead, I got the Earl Grey Shortie to temporarily satisfy my craving... and it was delicious! White chocolate sandwiched by two earl grey shortbread cookies *droolz*\n\nStaff was very welcoming and courteous. She helped me picked out a few pastries for my family that evening :)\n\nBanana Cream Pie Eclair\n- \"rum'd up banana\" excites me lol\n- very light and I love the bursts of flavours!\n\nThe Turtle Tart\n- salted caramel... can't say no to salted caramel\n- my favourite of the 4!!\n\nLoco Coco\n- soooooo creamy\n- tropical flavours all in one :D\n\n\"The Chocolate One\"\n- most rich of the 4\n- the crispy pearls was a nice touch... I hope you could add more :D\n\nMy family and I really enjoyed the desserts... every bite was an adventure ^^ I will definitely be coming back to try more creations! So excited that you're just down the street from me :D Yay.
