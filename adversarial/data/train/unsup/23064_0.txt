Treated the in-laws and wife to Pier-W for on a recent evening and we very much enjoyed ourselves.  We all ordered white fish and Swiss chard, which seemed to be the special of the evening.  This night's weather was stormy, which is a stark contrast to the sunny visits I've had in the past.  The stormy weather and choppy waters of Lake Erie were still beautiful in their own way.  The restaurant was packed!  \n\nI asked the ma√Ætre d' if he would take my father-in-law and I into their reputable wine cellar and he cordially agreed.  He showed us some of their most expensive bottles from France and California - $4,500 each!  They are on Wine Spectator's list of preferred restaurants too.\n\nI do not remember the wine we drank, but it was delicious and paired well with our meals.  My father in-law ordered a 30-year-old port wine at the end of the meal, which I thought tasted dull.\n\nI knew it was going to be a pricey meal, but how often do we get to enjoy a fine meal at a fine restaurant with family?  Not often enough.\n\nIt was a great night and worth every penny.
