I used to love my car, but now when I drive him I just think of this place.  Their motto seems to be pay a lot and get crummy work.  They are rude and ignorant.  If you question anything they do their response is \"we didnt break your car, you did\"  Really? What kind of response is this?  Hey doctor can you explain why I am sick?  Doctor: Dont ask me, I didnt get you sick, you did.  And both the guys I talked to used this response, they must train them to say this since they get so many complaints.  So if your car needs work, you can bring it to them if you want to pay a lot and get terrible work.  Just make sure you understand that you broke your car, not them.
