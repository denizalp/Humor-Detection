Jeesh. Overpriced drinks. Rude staff. Great view. \nThis is a cool place to check out the Freemont Experience from. It's in the perfect location to see the whole show, and do some people watching. It's a great location. Everything else about this place is lame. \nThe bartender was rude to the gentleman ahead of me. Then he acted like he had never dressed a Mexican beer before. What kind of bartender is this? He wasn't too pleasant to me either. Must have been having a bad night. \nThe large 24oz beer was more expensive than if I'd bought two regular sized beers at the casino bar. \nForget about this place.
