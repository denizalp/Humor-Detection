My 11 year old son outgrew his DMX bike, so I brought it to Martin Swiss and asked if they would donate it if I left it with them.  Then, my son selected a brand new bike that he planned to ride that day.  We bought a new helmet, he was excited and ready to ride!  We were told to come back in 25-30 minutes because the bike needed to be set up...?  OK, so we only live 2 mins from the shop so we left and came back at 5:35 pm.  They were closed, he probably should have told us to come back in 15 minutes considering I bought the bike after 5 pm and had no idea when they closed.  My son was totally disappointed, so I went back today to let them know that wasn't the nicest thing to do.  The owner was very apologetic and the next time we came in to the store, he took very good care of us.\n\nWhile my son was practicing on his new bike (that he loves!), we ran into Phil who wrks at the store.  He gave him some valuable tips and offered for him to come to the store for 30 mins so that he could help him out.  I really appreciated his thoughtfulness.  That turned what started out as a bad experience around...a few kind words go a LONG ways!
