Cute little local boutique packed full of goodies! A little old house given a new life. So much variety - clothes, candles, jewelry, accessories, pillows, wall art, monogramming, local beer\/wine, holiday decor and more! Plan to spend some time browsing! Good selection of NC\/SC merchandise too. Interior design services offered as well (mostly farmhouse chic style aka Joanna Gaines\/HGTV). Owners are locals, so they know the Waxhaw area well. They offer wine tastings in the summer and host local bands as well. Nice outdoor patio area for enjoying libations on a nice evening.
