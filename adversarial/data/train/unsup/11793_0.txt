I am writting this review with a heavy heart as the owner (Cambodian lady) and owners niece at this donut shop were very nice to me the few times I went here. On Monday 4\/25 around 3:15pm I went across the street (as I work at Walmart Pharmacy) for a roast beef croissant sandwich and a couple coffees. Within 2-3 hours after my meal and coffee I was severely food poisoned. Been vomiting with fever for the last couple days and now it's turned into severe diarrhea (I have been glued to the restroom for the last 24 hours). I had to cancel my shift at work twice already which cost me hundreds of dollars and have been bed ridden.  I would never viciously leave a bad review on yelp, but this experience has been a nightmare and this place needs to learn and improve it's sanitation and food handling and needs to be visited by the department of health. I suspect there was cross contamination of some sort and most probably e coli (I am a health care professional by the way). If the owner of this place is reading this review, please do yourself, and future customers a favor and look into this matter as I would not wish this nightmare on my worst enemy.
