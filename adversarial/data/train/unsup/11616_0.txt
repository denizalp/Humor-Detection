Really well designed venue inside and out, with a really awesome atmosphere right when you step in.\n\nThe menu is quite brilliant, albeit overpriced. I had the prochetta sandwich and my fiancee had the rotisserie chicken sandwich. Both were very dry, with the pork being the biggest letdown, being tough and dry. The veggies were really fresh, and I must say that the chicken  sandwich was quite ingeniously built with interesting ingredients like basil aioli and green apple.\n\nThe strangest thing was the service. It wasn't exactly.. unfriendly. But I really felt like some sort of outsider who was being given the ultimate privilege of eating there.  Quite a few of the staff's friends were in there in true hipster fashion and were chatting the entire time.  Here's a great opportunity to interact with your customer in the brilliantly designed bar-to-open-kitchen layout. Instead  I was brushed off as not being part of the clique. I know that sounds weird, but I don't know how else to describe it.  It was the most bizarre service experience I've ever had.  I should also add that it was quite slow for what it was (sandwiches). There might be a training issue there as the cook seemed quite slow to find ingredients, etc.  \n\nI also found it to be quite overpriced, though it may be worth it if everyone in the venue is on their A game because the ingredients are certainly worth visiting this place for. Just bring your plaid and thick brimmed glasses and hope you know someone there and you'll be 5-starring this place in no time!
