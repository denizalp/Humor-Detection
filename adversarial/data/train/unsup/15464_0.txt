I'm so disappointed!\n\nI read all the glowing reviews of Pop Up, and I thought, thank you jesus, a great pizza place in Las Vegas to go along with the very very very few other great pizza places. But alas, THIS IS NOT IT! \nNot even close.\n\nThe sauce tastes like the spaghetti sauce you'd get at Vons. The crust is nice and soft, but not fully-evolved: too much floury flavors. And a touch too thick.\n\nThe mozzarella is so not there, it may as well not be there.\n\nThe pepperoni is so large it looks more like salami, and doesn't have that spicy kick that puts the damn \"pepper\" in pepperoni!\n\nIt doesn't end there. \nTheir business model is as retarded as the Secret Pizza place at the Cosmo.\nThey don't have a menu.\nThey have only one size pizza: 18 inch.\nThey clearly missed the memo from high school business class that says: give the consumer choices and make him feel like he's getting what he wants. \n\nOh, and I almost forgot, it's expensive....almost 20 bucks for an 18 inch (we don't have any other size) pie.\nNo deals.No pick-up specials.\n\nIn the end, I'm depressed. \nI had such high hopes. I really wanted this to be sublime. But it's ordinary. \nI hate ordinary. \n\nGo to Sicili on Twain....still the best pizza at the best price in the whole damn city.\nThat's \"extraordinary\".
