Great neighborhood park surrounding the lake- Terri's review gives more detailed info about how to find it, but it's surprisingly large with a good trail. Perfect for running, jogging, and walking, with or without a dog. Good spot for photos, too. Watch out for the ducks while in the area, as they are sometimes in the street. New favorite spot to run!
