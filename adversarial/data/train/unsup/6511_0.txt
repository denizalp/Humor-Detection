Baseline Sports Bar went through a recent renovation since being featured on the show \"Bar Rescue\" and has since renamed itself \"Brick & Barley\".\n\nThis is a nice bar and grill with a decent menu and fairly priced drinks.  I had the Reuben and it was done nicely.  The fries were also tasty.  The decor is comfortable with lots of dark woods and brick facade.  There is a pool table and shuffleboard to play.\n\nI will be back for a drink and a bite soon.  Check them out.
