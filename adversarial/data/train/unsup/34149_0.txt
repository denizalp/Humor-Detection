(A about a month ago I visited this restaurant, sadly they are no more).  A great hamburger is a wondrous thing, Meat, bread, and salad all in one delivery system.  The burger joint makes a great burger. I was looking to try the gourmet burgers at a local Italian restaurant when I was informed they no longer featured them, luckily I remembered a news article on the 3 am burger at the  Burger Joint.\n\nI started my meal with the stuffed mini-peppers. They come lightly breaded, stuffed with goat cheese and covered with a pimento aioli.  The effect is just fantastic, each one is fluffy, cheesy, and deliciously accented by the aioli.\n\nThe 3 am burger comes with a perfectly seasoned patty, peppered bacon, a grilled bun, roasted tomatoes, caramelized onions, a sunny-side egg, and is topped with hollandaise sauce. The combination is amazing and is close to burger perfection.  The service was at a high level, it was quick, considerate, and responsive. My coffee was quickly refilled and I was given a to-go coffee on my way out .  Simply a great meal.
