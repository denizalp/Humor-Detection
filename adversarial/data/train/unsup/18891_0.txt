As good a review as I can muster for a mall food court that's not Village by the Grange. \n\nUrban Eatery has assembled a compelling mix of international and local chains offering no less than three burger options, high-and-low end chinese, Indian, ramen\/pho, burritos and vegan delites. \n\nPrices are reasonable for the area, and real cutlery, dishes and glassware provides an almost civilized dining experience. \n\nExtra points for including an Aroma, for those who require a caffeinated pause; and for local heroes like Amaya and Liberty Noodle. Glad to see at least some of my hard earned cash going to support local businesses rather than foreign-owned conglomerates. \n\nOK, I like that I get free refills on McDonald's coffee, too. \n\nSeating is ample, and bathrooms range for traditional food court filthy to almost useable, depending on time of day. Ask me nicely and I'll tell you where the cleaner options are within the Eaton Centre.
