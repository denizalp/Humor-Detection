I switched over to this gym after several bad experiences at GoodLife fitness clubs. I was impressed by the facilities, and also by the fact that this gym seems to cater more to adults rather than families\/ kids. I was really appalled by the terribly run-down interior of GoodLife( just down the street), so maybe that's why this Extreme Fitness location seemed so appealing.\n\nOverall this place tops GoodLife in every way. All the cardio machines have built-in TVs and there is even a hot yoga studio!!!  The classes are intense and it seems like they stay on top of new fitness trends and equipment. I go here a few times a week and I continue to appreciate the service I've received. \n\nI'd give this place five stars if they had KettleBell classes and they fixed the showers in the women's change-room...the water pressure sucks and the temp is unreliable. Also, the membership contract is sticky and you will have a hard time making a commitment that lasts less than a year, so keep that in mind if you're unsure.
