If I could give this place a Zero I would. We left before we even got sat do to the horrible looks from the waitstaff, manager and hostess. \nWhen we arrived after the holiday parade we were told a 15 minute wait for table for 3.  Well 30 min later and seeing 6 other parties being sat before us, getting dirty looks from the wait staff, a hostess glaring at my kids and never speaking to us during the wait, a manager obviously seeing us just wait there and not even acknowledging us with a hi, we just left. \nI will spend my money with  other restaurants in summerlin who have amazing customer service. This place just left a bad taste in my mouth. Felt so uncomfortable there. Was really looking forward to the place too . Oh well!!!!
