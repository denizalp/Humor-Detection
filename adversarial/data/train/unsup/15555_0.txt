It might not be King Tut worthy, but it got the job done for me! There aren't a huge number of dining options at Luxor, and as a result I landed here. It is bright, spacious and clean, which is always a nice start to a meal. The menu has something for everyone I'm pretty sure; the service is quick, and the prices are reasonable. My choice: a simple soup and salad combo. The salad was mixed greens with basic vegetables, and the blue cheese dressing was just right. The tomato soup wasn't mind-blowing. It was a close relative to Campbell's. Nothing to be ashamed about. The only thing I truly missed was a basket of warm bread. Otherwise, an acceptable choice for when you're hungry, not looking for anything too fancy and you happen to be at the Luxor.
