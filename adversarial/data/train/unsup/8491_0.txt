3.5 stars \n\nWe came here the other night for dinner, I ordered the black bean burger while my boyfriend ordered the Tex-Mex burger with chicken. We also got some fries to share. It seems like they have a good selection of burgers and change them how you like. I LOVE the in house sauces, the Ragin Cajun sauce... I could put it on everything! I also really like the Thai Ketchup.  \n\nI sadly found my burger disappointing, it seemed frozen compared to all the in house black bean patties I have had. That's not cool when they are serving all natural and organic etc. meat patties. Its not too hard to make black bean patties, very easy and super cheap. My boyfriend's burger was a lot better than mine, I guess I have to get the chicken here from now on. The fries were tasty but a little pricey for $3 for a small. \n\nI'll be back to try out the chicken burgers and stock up on that Ragin' Cajun.
