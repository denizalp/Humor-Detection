This is the mall that time forgot. The food court is jam-packed with seniors. There is a public library branch (always a plus for me!) right off the food court.\n\nThe shops are typical except for one. Mrs. Bridges' British Bakery!\nIt's the best of it's kind I have seen. All your British imported foods are available here. You want haggis? They have it. Or football team paraphernalia? Walker's crisps?\n\nThere is a restaurant in the mall called Watt's Restaurant that looks unchanged since the 50s\/60s. I haven't tried it, but it looks like a place I'd have tea with my British granny (if I had one).
