WOW! The food was incredible, we went for their sat\/ sun $15 lunch platter.  Best bang for your buck in town for sure. You'll also be full all day, so much food. It comes with a little bowl of their most popular dishes.  Each one had so much flavor. Also, try their lemonade! So refreshing on a hot summer day. Service was amazing as well (we had Jeffrey). Can't wait to go back and to tell all my friends!
