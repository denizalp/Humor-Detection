Am looking to switch to a green courier service and got a delivery from a client who uses these guys. Tried to check their website - it was down for days. Called in -- got the runaround big time.\n\nClearly told all three people to whom my call got bounced that I was very interested in possibly using their service but was not able to get them to give me any info (service area, basic rates, etc. - anything, really)  without giving them my banking information, which I was not going to do for someone with whom I have no business relationship. \n\nWas asked if I had enough business to keep them busy & was told outright that if I did not then, they had no interest in working with me.\n\nVery rude and they made it almost impossible to even inquire about their services, much less to set up an account and use them for anything.\n\nGoing to find another green and\/or socially responsible courier instead. Not at all  impressed!
