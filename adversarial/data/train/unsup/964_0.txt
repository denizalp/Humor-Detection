There's nothing like starting your day off with a hot, delicious beverage from a mobile coffee truck that doesn't deliver side a grouchiness with your order. \n\nI started my Monday morning off by ordering a Caffe Latte for myself and a regular coffee for a co-worker, whom I excitedly dragged with me to the truck. I ordered my Caffe Latte without any sweeteners or other flavorings, and I enjoyed the little jolts with each sip I took and all the frothiness that settled around the inside of my cup (mmm!).  My co-worker said the coffee wasn't bad, but hands down did he prefer Grouchy's over the brew in our office. \n\nAfter confessing to the cool guys who were manning the truck that I've been waiting for their arrival ever since the previous week (sound stalker enough?), and that I've never tried Grouchy John's Coffee, they gave me two stamp cards and stamped one card full with happy face stamps! \n\nAside from the fantastic service, the caffeine buzzes, and stamp cards(!), I must note that I also enjoyed seeing a small Darth Vader figurine by the tip jar (the truck's \"guardian\" as I was told), as well as a few items on their menu with titles inspired by characters from Star Wars -- this created a stir of excitement among some of the predominantly IT employees who were present, including myself. I'll have to stalk the truck again to try those Star Wars titled beverages next time and write an update on this review. \n\nGrouchy John's easily receives 5-Stars from me.  Now, go forth and try Grouchy John's Coffee! May The Froth Be With You!
