This place is fantastic if you're a fan of pinball or classic arcade games! I happened across it on my last trip to Las Vegas and it was one of the highlights of the trip. Hints: bring cash with you, although their machines do return $5 bills which makes it easy to break twenties. Also, there are some basic snack machines but this is mainly a place to enjoy the games and move on with the night. I'll be back the next time I'm in town!
