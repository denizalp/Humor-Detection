So I decided to try Polished again. My nail color is on point but 2 of my nails are crooked. When the technician applied the nails I pointed it out and she told me no, after they were filed they wouldn't look crooked. She shaped them. I told her they were still crooked and she told me it was the angle and that they were straight. After everything is done, nope still crooked. She told me there was nothing she could do for me. I love the colors just not the crooked nails. If I'm paying so much for gel is it really that hard to put the nails on straight? Don't they look and make sure they're all straight and not pointing in any other direction because straight up? Ugh, guess I'll be going to LV nail at from now one
