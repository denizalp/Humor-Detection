The second time, for EVERYTHING, is never as good as the first. I am basing this on all of the experiences I have in my life on a plethora of matters (you can imagine). \n\nExcept Consume Loco. Consume Loco was perhaps fucking better the second time than the first. Motherfucker. Must be the exception to the rule or something. \n\nTried some tacos for the first time. Chose 'asada' for no particular reason; they were great. Flan and platanos fritos for dessert (again). Girlfriend had two cheese quesadillas. All of this, plus a complimentary plate of chips, for less than twenty five bucks (and that includes a GREATER THAN SYMBOL 25% tip). \n\nOnly at Los Antojos. I wish I lived closer so I can go more often, but I will continue to go way out of my way to enjoy this unbelievably delicious authentic Mexican cuisine. - E
