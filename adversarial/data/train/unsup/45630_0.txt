My favorite hidden spot!! I love the staff, even as it changes with school. Their ingredients are fresh and high quality, and they have an incredibly creative menu. I almost always get their special, and am never disappointed. The Tuna Reuben (sounds crazy I know) is literally to die for. They will make anything your heart desires!! Also, try the habanero cream cheese on a sammy. Wow!
