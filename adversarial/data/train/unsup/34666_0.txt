We went on Sunday night for dinner for the first time. We were a big family (10 people plus a toddler). We  made very last minute reservations and they accommodated is to a private room. 1st off I'd like to say that it is VERY rare that we leave a restaurant and everyone in my family is happy. Generally I feel bad for places we go to when we are in a group because they can all be high maintenance. With that said I'm giving  5 stars because this is one of those places that hit almost everything perfectly. The staff was friendly and the food and cocktails were great! I generally steer clear of craft cocktails because most places try to hard to make them taste so fancy and they ruin the alcohol. But this place was on point. We all got different ones and they were all good. Word to the wise: even though the entree portions say serves 2-4 it's really a personal portion. 2-4 servings is if you are ordering family style. We also ordered the bone marrow which was amazing but you only really get 4 bites total for about $16 (?) So not really worth the money on that one. The fried chicken of course is a must, and the grits were some of the best I had. So excited to come back on our next trip.
