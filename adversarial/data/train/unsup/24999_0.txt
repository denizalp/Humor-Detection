My first time to a Cafe Zupas.  During lunch time, expect a crazy busy establishment. Upon just parking, you can already see the lines through their windows.  But one thing you have to keep in mind...it's new, it's lunch time, and it's located off Eastern Ave.  So many restaurants off Eastern Ave is super packed during lunch time.  Zupas was no different.\n\nAfter finally getting parked, you walk in.  The line is organized somewhat like what you see at Disneyland (minus the fast pass).  However, the line for ordering does go pretty quick.  Your food is built in an assembly like fashion starting with your salads, sandwiches, soup, and finally desserts. The place is packed and the other concern is whether or not you will even have a seat.  Go ahead and try to save a table.  Can't do it, it's not allowed.  They even have signs posting that you cannot save a table.  This wasn't a problem since there's was at least 3 tables opened when we ate. But I'm sure there are days where seating in limited. \n\nAs for their food, I got their Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panini with their Lobster Bisque.  The soup portions are huge and the food portions are just okay.  My sandwich wasn't bad, actually was pretty good.  It's the soup that I rave about.  The the price and taste of their lobster bisque rivals other sitdown, more expensive restaurants.  Just wish there was thick pieces of lobster in there.  My total order came up to about $10 which included the sandwich, soup, drink, a strawberry, and a lunch roll.  \n\nPrices are about average for the rest of the menu, but they do have a lunch special for $7.99.  This includes sandwich and half soup.  By the way, if you have a sweet tooth, then you have to try their desserts. I'm not saying it's good, because for one, I don't have a sweet tooth. And two, I didn't have any.  The presentation looks good. I guess I will just have to wait for someone else's review to see how good the sweets truly are. One of my issues with this place...so many damn calories in almost everything here.  I know there is because myfitnesspal told me. Overall, I am giving this place 4 stars just because I will probably be back and so far, I'm a fan.\n\nPS:  I still think Beach Hut Deli, which is located in the same parking lot, is better.  Also, not as busy. \n\nTurkey Spinach Artichoke:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=gCG3DRBkaUwppIrFHK3u5g&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nLobster Bisque:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=54M_HQZ28B8dUcHFQAFZcA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nJust for Kicks:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=jebJH5dCLO1mJZqMcxwJQg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nMore Food:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=LXZdzRbRcAj8sTfaGwMX_g&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nSignage:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=fDSg0ZiphuYR2hQRpC4mOA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nStressed Spelled Backwards:\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=tYzl3O18G4WB1mkp3oSd0g&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=f4-EinZe2c1ye8xtikG7og&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=UnZINHMORJvW0b20FZxryA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=aJ64UckpSYrXXKkhAjGB-A&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=eq2k5-lQHBlz3kFdnCeG6Q&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ
