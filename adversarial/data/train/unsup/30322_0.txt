This is our go to for gas in Mint Hill, it is usually less expensive than surrounding gas stations. Inside is clean, with a good variety of snacks and beverages. The facilities are clean and there is never a wait. It is in a good area and I feel safe there (you know how some gas stations just give you the creeps?)
