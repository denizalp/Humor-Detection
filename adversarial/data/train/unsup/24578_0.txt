I dream about her.\n\nWe were standing in line in the pouring rain in front of a food truck.  My hands were numb from the cold.  The lobster lady smiled as she handed us the huge chunks of lobster with a very light garlic dressing on a butter toasted roll.\n\nIt was surreal, as if we were walking alongside a seaside village enjoying our eats straight from a fishmonger.  I know that hubby was quite satisfied with his coz I didn't hear a peep.  \"I don't like it that much\", my little cutie pie handed me his piece.  I didn't argue this time about not finishing his meal.  \"I like crab better.\"  More for me.\n\nWe will be tracking The Maine Lobster Lady down like epicurean stalkers!
