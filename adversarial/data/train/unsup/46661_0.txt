Came here on a Thursday night without a reservation and we're sat at a one-off table with high-stools upstairs. Wasn't too crowded but packed enough. Beer selection was standard and our waitress was attentive. We ordered four plates - the stuffed sausage poblano, the meatballs, the lamb lollipops and short rib on polenta. Everything was delicious but pretty salty. Our waitress was informative since it was our first time there and attentive. I'd go back again but would just request all the dishes be less salty. Seems to be much more happening on Fridays and Saturdays. Bartender waved goodbye even though we never met him. 2 thumbs up from me!
