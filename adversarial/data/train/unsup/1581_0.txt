Rustic country kitchen with VERY delicious food. I don't eat at these types of places very often, but really enjoyed the meal. The staff was all extra friendly and they have this whipped cinnamon\/honey butter that is absolutely divine! The prime rib is served extra thickly sliced and perfectly rare. We also loved the Parmesan crusted chicken, sans gravy, which was pounded out thin, yet still juicy. Ask for some lemon wedges to squirt on top of the chicken (you won't regret). 5\/5 would eat again.
