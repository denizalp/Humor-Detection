Supa fresh. Clean, modern looking spot open right by campus of Case Western Reserve University. As a 2010 Alum, I can say these kids have no idea how lucky they are with all the great food options. The best in my day was Best Steak and Gyro in the hood (respect if you've eaten here before).\n\nIt's an asian chipotle with 4 decision points - carb (rice, noodle or salad), protein, toppings and sauce. I made a salad bowl with spicy chicken and korean red sauce. The colors from the bowl are awesome, very artistic and instaworthy. Red from the sauce, purple from the cabbage, green from the salad, yellow from the corn, orange from the carrots. \n\nBowl was tasty and healthy. Not overly filling like a chipotle bowl but still good serving size. Pro tip: the Korean red sauce is legit spicy so do as you dare. \n\nAlthough no longer a Case student, I will be back to try different bowl combinations! #8yearstoolate
