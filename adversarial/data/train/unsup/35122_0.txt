Went here for dim sum today based on recommendations from friends. I wasn't very impressed. It was good but it was nothing special and I am glad I didn't go when it was crowded.\n\nFood: The food was good but it was nothing special. The only thing I thought was really good was the steamed bbq pork buns which were really moist. Only thing was that they stuck to the paper and fell apart a bit. There was a decent selection of dim sum but not that many. The shimp dumplings and shrimp rice rolls were not very flavorful.\n\nService: Not the best dim sum service I have had. The carts took a while to come by and some carts came by more times than others. I had to grab the servers' attention to get drink order refills.\n\nPrice. A lot pricier than the other dim sum places I have been. I paid $45 for food that would usually cost 26 to 35 elsewhere. \n\nOverall, the dim sum was okay but I don't think I want to go back (there are other places to go).
