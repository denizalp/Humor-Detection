There are a couple good things about this place, none of which are the food.\n\nThe staff was friendly. The place is decently clean. The food though? The food was mediocre at best. I ordered a small falafel plate. It took 4 minutes to come out and they brought it to my table. It came with four falafel pieces on a bed of rice pilaf, a side of iceberg lettuce and chopped tomatoes with quarters of pita.\n\nThe falafel was burnt and when I tried to pierce a piece with my plastic fork, it nearly broke. The rice was bland. The lettuce and tomato was sad because I could tell the lettuce was old. The pita was hard and chewy and the hummus was too acidic. As for the sauces, their famous white sauce was basically mayo and their tahini was tasteless. It was actually all pretty tasteless. And for the price? It's an awful value for a mediocre meal. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place. The food isn't completely inedible, but for the price and quality, you're better off going somewhere else. Almost anywhere else.\n\nSide notes, they don't offer tzatziki sauce and we overhead an employee pronounce gyro as \"jie-row.\" If you were looking for an authentic Greek place, keep looking. This is not the place.
