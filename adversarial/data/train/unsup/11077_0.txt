All I gotta say is \"Monkey Cakes.\"  Holy Mother of God, they were a delight to the senses.\n\nI've had the omelettes there too -- absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe service is less than stellar.  Sort of the \"tragic hipster\/totally unaffected\" vibe.  If you can get past that, good, because your tummy will be happy!
