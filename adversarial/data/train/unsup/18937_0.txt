One cannot deny the elegance that the Encore has to offer. This has been my go to hotel in Vegas for years. But after this weekend I can't say I will be coming here again. There's not much to complain about with the hotel itself. But the staff and front desk were less than helpful and did not offer a 5 star hotel experience. Not only was the wait incredibly long at check in and check out. When I had an issue I had to wait an additional 20 minutes to speak with a manager. Service to me is everything. And after the experience I had I will gladly be spending my money elsewhere.\n\nI will like to add that I have stayed at this property at least 8 times. But after the way I was treated I had to write a review.
