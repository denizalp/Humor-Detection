I needed a valve assembly but their price was $30 higher than Amazon, which they don't price match.  Their prices for chlorine and pool salt were higher than Costco\/Home Depot.  Friendly staff though.  I'd rather wait an extra day for Amazon shipping than buy from a company that isn't price competitive.
