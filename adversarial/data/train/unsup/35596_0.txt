Fast checkout and has very reasonable prices. It can be a little overwhelming at first, but just take your time. I do wish that there were more employees on the floor to help, as the check out stations are mostly self check out. I also think they need some training or a refresher on what they stock because we were shuffled along to three different employees looking for sparkling water because they didn't know where it was or what they really had. There is also no one posted to assist with the self check out, so if I was a first time customer I would have not known what to do.
