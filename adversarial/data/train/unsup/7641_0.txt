My all time super fave for a hang over cure or if I feel like I need to eat something 'clean'.\n\nCongee, it's the remedy to all ailments, at least according to the Chinese.\n\nThis place become quite popular over the years so if it gets too busy, I would suggest getting take out and eating at the food court.\n\nService and food comes pretty quick. I go to selections are minced beef Congee, fried dough fritter, beef noodle wrap and soy sauce noodle.
