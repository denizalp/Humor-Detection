STRIP DOWN NAKED dericiousness \n\nThis small little place is impressive & you almost ALWAYS know that it is gonna be close to authentic Japanese when you walk into a small little nice & simply decorated place! They have about maybe 6 booths & 4\/5 tables.... nicely spread out so it's not invading your neighbor table's conversation & about 6\/8 seats at the sushi bar. \n\nWe were greeted right away \"Ira shai ma sae\" from the chefs & seated right away. The service was great! I think our server's name was SALLY (don't quote me...) she was very informative & told us about all the specials which we pretty much ordered MOST of them!\n\nThey have HAPPY HOUR everyday 10pm- 2am everyday which is AWESOME! Also 5pm- 6pm as well. But the late night happy hour for 4 hours!! Ummm yea... ahhahaha\n\nMIRUGAI SASHIMI 5 piece $22.50 - ummmm.... OMG!!!! so little places in Vegas can I find my favorite of all favorite clams!! The GIANT clam! So good typically crunchy but they sliced it all up so it was not as crunchy as they sliced the LIFE out of it. Just gotta ask them not to do that NEXT time.\n\nLIVE AMAEBI SUSHI $11 - this plate was absolutely gorgeously plated & you could tell the freshness of the sweet shrimp because of how stiff the tail was & the deep fried head was so MEATY!! 1 order is 1 shrimp. \n\nSALMON SUSHI $5 - hubby said it just melted away\n\nHALIBUT JALEPENO $12 - This was good but I was a little DISAPPOINTED on the lack of freshness... halibut is MY FISH & I have a taste buds of a cat when it comes to this delicious fish.\n\nGOLD UNI SUSHI $12 - gold represents the quality & boi was it GOLD in flavor along w\/ color! We had an order for appetizer then an order for dessert!\n\nTAKO WASABI $4 - the amount that they give you for this dish is RIDICULOUS!! We couldn't taste too much wasabi but we found out it's because they ran out of fresh pickled wasabi =[ but still good.\n\nSHIGOKU OYSTER $7 - tiny little oysters that we're so cute & gone in less than a second. 2 pieces per order.\n\nROCK & ROLL #1 $15 - a no rice roll that our server chose for us... ahhaha we have had this roll in many different places so we weren't too impressed... but her enthusiasm for her choice was cute. Thinly sliced cucumber wrapped around Tuna, Salmon, Crab Stick, Yellow Tail, & Sprouts.\n\nORGANIC MISO SOUP $3 - it was just miso soup... probably won't order it again for 3 bux\n\nHH GREEN BEAN TEMPURA $4 - you get a GOOD amount of green beans... definitely could have been a little more CRISPIER.\n\nGREEN TEA CREME BRULEE $7 - DERICIOUS you could definitely taste the green tea & it is served w\/ a strawberry sherbert w\/ whip cream. My photo really does no justice \n\nMOCHI ICE CREAM $4 - I dunno why we ordered mochi... ahahaa you could get a whole box at the market.\n\nMAN'S MOUNTAIN JUNAMI SAKE $12.50 - rich & dry at the same time... came in a cute little craft w\/ ice filled in the whole to keep it chilled. \n\nDEFINITELY will be back to try more items ESPECIALLY HH stuff!!
