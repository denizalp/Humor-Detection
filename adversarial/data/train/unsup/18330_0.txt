What type of meal do you want when you party in Vegas?\n\nFilled with alcohol?\nSomething fresh?\nSomething fun?\n\nHarvest by Roy Ellamar is your place!\n\nLocated inside the Bellagio (which I have always thought was a classy hotel), Harvest is a little past the Conservatory.  The walk through the lobby always inspires me....especially with all the Chihuly art glass on the ceiling.\n\nArriving at the restaurant...the first thing you notice is the giant rectangular bar. Racks of liquor bottles hang from the ceiling, begging you to pick your poison. The variety of liquor was very good, but the bartender we had was not very knowledgeable...bummer.\n\nThe front desk hostesses were very nice and accomodating, and they did their best to take care of us, even though we were early for our reservation.\n\nOnce seated, we were lucky enough to score a table near the kitchen.  YOU WANT THIS!  The kitchen is enclosed in glass, showing every 'heated' moment and tasty morsel.  \nIf you are not seated by the kitchen, get up and take a stroll around.  You will see many cooks working diligently on seafood, a rotisserie, and all manner of dishes.\n\nOur waitress Susan was really warm and she took good care of us....even with all of our special requests.  She had a nice smile and made sure we had everything we needed.\n\nFILLED WITH ALCOHOL\n\nI had a glass of Stagg Jr. which is a nice addition to any meal, and many cocktails were sampled.  My favorite was served in an 'Aviary' (Alinea style) decanter. The combination of fruit and herbs gave the cocktail an unusually large amount of body and depth of flavor.....very delicious and a pleasure to share.\n\nSOMETHING FRESH\n\nWhen you hear the word harvest what do you think of?  Exceptional produce of course!  And there is plenty of it here.\nChef Ellamar turns veggies into treats as the first food hits our table.....from a snack wagon!\nWaitstaff deftly wheel carts of beautifully presented food to each table.  You don't have to partake, but if you do, small share plates will excite your palate.  We shared a few items, but the best was an eggplant caviar.  Light, fluffy and rich, this was one of the dishes that made my night memorable.\nAll of the veggies were amazing, but the cauliflower and the brussel sprouts stood out as 'must haves'.\nFresh seafood was also bountiful at harvest.  We had delicious Kuushi oysters, poke, and ahi sashimi, which all tasted amazing.\nMoving on to the big plates made us even happier.  The hanger steak had so much flavor and was so juicy....we almost ordered another.  The scallops were money!  Buttery and soft, they were savory pillows of greatness.  The perfect meat dish was the lamb chops.  I am not sure if I have had a better....so tender and flavorful, I could have eaten the plate by myself.\n\nSOMETHING FUN\n\nI love savory food, but I always have to end with something sweet.....and Harvest is a great place for dessert.  The mobile dessert cart has everything a growing boy needs (horizontally, that is).  Full of color and whimsy; cupcakes, lollipops and dark chocolate truffles make your mouth water. Standouts included the chocolate coated popcorn, chocolate covered hazelnuts, and chocolate covered espresso beans.  My favorite was the creme brulee.  Light, airy and sweet, this is really what you want in your mouth.\n\nOverall, Harvest was a wonderful dining experience.  From cocktails, to food, and service, it was the Vegas dining experience I had hoped for!
