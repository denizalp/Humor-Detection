I came on a Friday during lunch and had ate their buffet for $15. \n\n- Classy. high ceiling. fancy wine glass for water. nice silverware. \n- Great chicken curry! Not dry!\n- Solid variety. Great taste.\n- No old film over curries \n- Hint of spice! \n- To-Go buffet same price as lunch. $12.\n- They had some chopped fruit, but didn't look too appetizing. \n- 2.5 plates, naan, and vermicelli pudding was enough to put me in a food coma..zZzZ\n- I'd chose Mint if you come solo and want to yolo. But if you're +1, this is the place since you can use the $15 for 20 value and get the mango dessert from check-in!
