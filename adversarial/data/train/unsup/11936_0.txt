Helen's was terrible.  I got magic straight at Helens I think I paid $150 ish and she did not know what she was doing.  & kept blaming me, and kind of made me feel stupid my korean was not on par with hers.  \n\nThen when I called to tell her it didn't come out she had me come in again.  Attempted it again but given she doesn't know what she's doing obviously it didn't come out.  \n\nShe also laughed when I asked her to cut my white husband's hair.  Told me to go to a white salon.  I thought she was really rude.  Hair city is waaaaay better.  623) 847-0308\n\nHair city has on multiple occasions successfully straightened my hair (hair city did give me a funky hair cut once)
