Viet style food, done with care and perfection. \n\nTucked away in a small plaza, this place was busy on a Tuesday at 1 PM. There were only two tables empty, a larger one that could sit 6 and a small one (which is the one they gave me).\n\nLunch specials are $8 for an entree, a small soup, and tea. I asked the guy there (who was waiting, busing tables, and running out on delivery calls) to help me choose between a Pad Thai and a Chicken Vermicelli with a springroll. He told me to go with the latter. \n\nAnd that was a good choice!\n\nThe food was fresh, tasty, and quite filling. The food flew out of the kitchen very fast too.\n\nThe soup of the day was hot and sour, served in a tiny bawl. Just enough to keep you busy while they are plating your dish.\n\nBTW I passed a couple of other places on my way there and those were empty. Lucky Bamboo was far from it. I don't know if luck has much to do with it or maybe these guys do such a good job the word does actually get around.
