I flew in to work out at Master Toddys. I paid for a private lesson it was $100 for an hours and they also threw in a group lesson. \n\nI worked out with Master Wong. I believe he has moved on since I worked out with him. \n\nI worked basic stance, shadow boxing technique, pad work, knees, punches etc. \n\nI was exhausted afterwords what a great work out!!\n\nPrivate parking lot with plenty of parking. They treated me like a king when I got there full run of the place. \n\nVery clean facility. The locker room was huge with shower, lockers and seating. \n\nThey have a full service equipment room where you can purchase anything you may have forgot or a something with Master Toddy's name on it. \n\nThe staff was help full, engaging and fun to talk to. \n\nIf you are planning a trip to Vegas like I was add this in it's only an hour and man a great work out. \n\nThe only thing bad is that I did not get to meet Master Toddy he was in Thailand. Maybe next time.
