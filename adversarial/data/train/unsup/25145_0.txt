ONLY PUT 5 STARS SO YOU CAN SEE THIS. This place has no communication. And very little choice in colors One girl started my fill took the color off and then just got up and sat in the pedicure chair I sat there for a bit until asking what was happening and all I got was a laugh from her. So I decided to no longer get my nails done but had to wait for my sister to finish and after an hour she had decided she would do my nails now and I told her I would no longer want them done she made me move from my seat when there was no one else in the salon for it to be used.  Unprofessional and rude. I will not recommend nor come back.
