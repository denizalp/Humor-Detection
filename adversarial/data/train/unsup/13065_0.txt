I have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers on this place- bar Suzanne really shines because of the space. I appreciate, above the beautiful decor and the fantastic music, that it's a sizeable bar that gives a lot of room to each patron. There's zero sense of being on top of one another here, which is fantastic. In that vein, it makes a really nice date spot (I think 75% of the people we saw last night were on some sort of date). Additionally, the service was really attentive and things are pretty reasonably priced for what you get.\n\nWhere they drop the ball, as others have commented, is on the food. I'll have to give other plates a try in the future, but the dumplings were a lunch bag let down. We ordered the two veggie dumplings and both tasted like over-seasoned baby food in a dumpling wrapper. I'm not sure why they insist on puréeing the contents of the dumplings beyond recognition but it doesn't do justice to their ingredients.\n\nThe drinks were ok- I ordered a gin cocktail with grapefruit\/rosemary syrup. I'm a citrus fiend but the syrup really overpowered the rest of the flavours and I wasn't able to distinguish the roméo gin (a gin tasty enough on its own) from everything else. The beers, however, were reasonably priced and I appreciate that they have a decent variety.
