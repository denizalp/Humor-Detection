This service is an absolute GODSEND. Irv and Karen are simply amazing. My lovely 13 year old white German shepherd loved them the minute they came to my door. \n\nCan I say again how awesome it is to have someone come to your door to take cart of your most precious pooch, your first fur child, as if they were their own? \n\nMy beautiful, sparkling boy came prancing to the door after his \"spa\" treatment all fluffy and new, just like he looked as a puppy. Even had his Sunday best on (a tie with stars!)\n\nIf you are questioning whether you should have a door-to-door service, please stop. Your furry friend will thank you!\n\nFetching Fido, you are the best!
