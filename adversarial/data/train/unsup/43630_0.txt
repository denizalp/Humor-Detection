Margaret is a GEM. I was nervous to get an expensive cocktail dress altered for a wedding, I just imagined taking it somewhere and scissors hacking in to hundreds of dollars of fabric and sequins- but Margaret made it seem so simple. The fitting was quick and painless, and her accuracy and quality are unmatched. On the opposite end of the spectrum- I've also handed her a Forever 21 skirt, and she made it fit so well it did not look like it cost $20. She probably even fixed up some of their shoddy stitching! \n\nI would feel confident handing over anything to Margaret, her top-notch skill and passion undoubtedly shine when you receive your clothing back and it fits exactly how you had imagined! I was never one to get anything custom fit, but shes got me hooked!
