Congrats Mandys!\n\nVery smart, groovy, busy business.  \n\nSalad done like never seen before. The 95%, mostly 20 something, estrogen-power packed house gathered in front of large bowls of greens plus. With boxes of water! A couple fellas joining. One adult fella sat at a communal table with red meat tossed on his greens and a steamy bowl of soup. \n\nSalad that knows its worth. Not cheap: portions, nor price. Lots of choice. Create your own. Filtered H2O. Product. Clean. Lovingly designed. \n\nJust smart. Healthy. \n\nAwesome.
