Friendly reminder to fuel up before hiking (Black Mountain Summit Trail or any trail for that matter)... \n\nBlack Mountain is a challenging hike with beautiful views and a nice change from some of the trails I'm used to hiking in the Scottsdale \/ Phoenix area.  It's not too far of a drive and there are so many great local businesses in the area -- make a day trip and enjoy!\n\nThat being said, I recently hiked this trail with my husband... I didn't eat breakfast that morning and got 3\/4 of the way up and didn't think I would make it any further (up or down) without passing out... Luckily, after a handful of hikers went by without any sugar \/ fuel, we found a woman who was kind enough to share half a Cliff Bar with me.  I made it down after that thank goodness!  Now I'm determined to return after fueling up and complete the entire hike next time... Hope to do that soon and add some photos of the beautiful views on this trail as well!
