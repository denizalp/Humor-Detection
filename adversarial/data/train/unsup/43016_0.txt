The best deal in Vegas for sure. The tapas style brunch was the best dining experience I've ever had and that was mainly due to the service we were given. Our excellent server Carmie was the most attentive and kind server I think I've ever had at a meal. All the tapas plates were just perfectly executed flavor bombs. I will be going back whenever I'm in Vegas. PS. Go for the endless Mimosas
