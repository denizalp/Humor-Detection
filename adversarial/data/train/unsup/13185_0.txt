I lived in Columbus when Cameron Mitchell still owned the Fish Market and it was fantastic. I'm a seafood-lover and I trusted that even after the sale of the chain they could still maintain the quality of food. \n\nI was foolish to think so. I've had two terrible meals there in the past month. I wants to give them more than one chance, but that was yet another mistake on my part. The food reminds me of an Applebee's or some godawful chain that simply nukes pre-made meals. I don't know if that's what they're doing, but that's how it tastes. My meals were bland, poorly cooked and sparse in terms of the actual fish\/seafood on the plate. My husband's entree was just as dismal.\n\nCameron, you are greatly missed. Hopefully, the Woodmere location will close down soon, so a real restaurant can take its place.
