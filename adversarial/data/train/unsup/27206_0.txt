Normally my boyfriend and I really love this place. We ordered delivery before work like we do frequently, and it was a little late which was no big deal. My issue is that I ordered banana peppers on my sandwich and got pickles instead. The peppers were mentioned twice on my order but the sandwich is totally void of peppers so I'm not sure how this happened. This wouldn't normally be a bug deal but I'm allergic to pickles and we didn't have time to either order a correction or go pick a new one up. We checked our order to make sure I didn't hit the wrong button on online ordering but I definitely selected banana peppers, and even requested light peppers in the comments so I'm not sure what happened. Just hoping their employees will pay a little closer attention in the future when making sandwiches so any serious allergy issues don't occur. \n\nBesides this, their sandwiches truly are delicious and I recommend people give them a try.
