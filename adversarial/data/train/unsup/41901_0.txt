I like it! The service was pretty good. The build out and space is awesome. Ambiance is a little loud but lively. If you like beer, their selection is pretty good too. Bathrooms were clean and overall it was a good experience. \n\nMy only reservation was that although the food was good, it could've been better. I think the recipes lacked flavor, even though they were cooked well. Desert was just OK - you could tell it was store bought cake and ice cream. I had the deviled eggs and bison burger. Kale salad is good!\n\nI'd definitely go there again and try more of their menu.
