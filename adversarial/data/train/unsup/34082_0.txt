I`ve been a loyal member for the past 3 years.  They have a wide variety of free weights and Nautilus Equipment.  A nice track and pool area.  The staff is green to say the least.  Most being right out of High School, it makes sense that they wouldn`t be very good in catering to customers.  My biggest bet peeve is the low cost of a daily pass.  Since Mayor Don Walters put in new bus lines going to and from Akron, this facility has been frequented from people outside the Falls.  I thought this facility was built for the residents of Cuyahoga Falls, not Akron? It can be irritating to see the facility packed with young punks from Akron who have nothing better to do than be loud and disruptive.  I understand being able to attract people to memberships, but it seems to be that the cheap price of admission is the biggest draw for people who live outside the Falls. The Nat should follow the example of Water Works.  They just raised the daily admission for non residents of Cuyahoga Falls.  If this facility is truly for the tax payers of this city, then this is what should be done.
