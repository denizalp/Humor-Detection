I think Yelp hasn't updated its address for Cynthia's, which is actually located on Durango, between Sahara and D.I.\n\nThree years ago I bought a sewing machine, and never took it out of the box. I'm tired having to go to a tailor every time I buy a pair of pants that are a foot too long, and I have about 50 tee shirts from all of my travels that would be better as nightshirts.  But I was terrified of the thought of being stuck by needles, or the concept of having to wind a bobbin.\n\nEnter Groupon, which offered just what I needed - a class at Cynthia's that would teach me how to set up and use my spiffy machine.  I bought the Groupon and scheduled an appointment.  And last week, it occurred to me that I wasn't seeing that appointment either on my wall calendar or the calendar on my phone.  It was bizarre, because I recall standing by the calendar, pen in hand, when I made that appointment.  When I called, I found out that I had missed it!  And therein is the hallmark of Gracious Customer Service:  it was not a problem at all, and I was able to reschedule.\n\nToday was the day, and I learned that everything I need to know is in the instruction manual and the DVDs that came with the machine.  But I typically learn much better by doing, and Darlene showed me all of the functions.  She had me practicing how to wind the bobbin, thread the needle, change the feet, create a buttonhole, and sew a button, in addition to having me practice a variety of different stitches.  The best part of all is that I'm no longer intimidated, and now have to confidence to forge ahead with my new Martha Stewart existence.\n\nI didn't have much time as I would have liked to look around the store, but I'll definitely be going back.  There is a large variety of sewing machines for sale, as well as supplies and lots of cute craft-y ideas to see.  And local stores like Cynthia's, with expert one-on-one attention and interaction, deserve to be patronized.  I'm a fan!!!
