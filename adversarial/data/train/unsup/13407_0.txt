My 23 month old daughter spent the past 4 months taking swimming lessons at Hubbard and we really saw a change in her especially when she takes a bath in her bathtub. She loves to blow bubbles and float on her back. Most of the teachers we had were great and customer service is great too. Whenever we had to skip a class, we were able to take a make up whenever a class had an open space which is a great perk. Lately, my daughter has lost interest in the swim classes. Maybe it's because it's starting to get cold so we are cancelling and will resume classes when it starts getting warm again.
