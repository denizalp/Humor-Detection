A must do for a local or a tourist!!!! Unbelievable experience!  Let me tell you this is not an just any helicopter ride... this is an experience!  Having your feet dangle as you over look the breathtaking city is indescribable.  We did the night time vegas tour but there are many options...Day, night, sunset, Grand Canyon, red rock and more!  Worth every penny! Diane was our pilot and without a doubt amazing! She looks young but has 6 years of experience flying in Vegas. Joe was our coordinator and provided us with instructions.  Professional yet had a sense of humor which was appreciated.  Safety first... no hats, no scarf, no slip on shoes basically nothing dangling from you. Glasses are ok they are secured with the headset. Recommend taking wedding rings off if they are easy to slip on and off. They secure your iPhones to your harness. It goes by quick so enjoy and definitely take advantage of the foot selfie!  Only four to the helicopter so take advantage of the adventure seat!  I can't wait to book our next flight!!!
