Enjoying this place so far; it's all I can think about this week. I've been here 2 times this week and considering going there again a third time. I have yet to venture outside of the market bowls to the other half of the menu. I just enjoy the options you can create with the market bowls. For $11, you can pick your base (brown rice, quinoa, or kale), pick meat, and add 2 side salads of your choice. My favorites are the mung bean noodle salad and the snap peas and goat cheese. The food is light: you can't sense much oil or fat. But it's filling enough that I leave satisfied, not gluttonous. It's a great meal that I can grab on my way to work. \n\nThe rosemary lemonade is made in-house; I want to order it next time. Sounds delicious. There are happy hours throughout the morning and evening for discounted smoothies or side salads. \n\nAtmosphere: Clean, organized. The benches are comfortable. There is even a bar for those who want to sit alone. I like the use of metal piping for decoration. Background music is Top 40, mainstream music. Nothing too distracting. The kitchen is open; you can watch them make your food right behind the cashier. \n\nStaff: Very nice and helpful. They allow you to try samples of the different side salads and meats, so you can choose wisely. They are also very keen to provide suggestions and are ready to answer any questions you have. \n\nProducts: They use recycled cardboard\/paper bowls. Don't worry. They're sturdy. \n\nCan't wait to try more of the menu!
