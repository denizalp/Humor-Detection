Signage outside shouts $4 SHOES but majority are priced in the $12-15 range. Quality may be questionable; majority are club-style heels made of synthetic materials in bright and clashing colors\/fabrics.\n\nIn addition to clubbing heels, there's a variety of sandals and flats but most appear cheap- a step below Payless, more like what you'd get for your middle school daughter than purchase for yourself as an adult. Limited selection for men, no sneakers for women. Each shoe style only available in a few sizes, many limited to only a few pairs.\n\nStar score cut down due to the following:\nOnly available seating to try on shoes is by front counter, one single bench seat for the whole store which is inadequate for a store this size. Try on your shoes because mine weren't true to size.\nSignage upon entry bans food\/drink and large purses, and indicates that bags can be searched at any time for any reason. And there are security-cam  photos posted behind the cashier of shoplifters, which is incredibly tacky and unprofessional.\n\nSuggestion: Hire more employees to wander the floor and keep an eye on product rather than drag down your business image like that. The only employee I've ever seen here is the cashier.
