2012 State Track and Field Championship. Mesa Community College. May 9-12.\n\nAs a former high school state track medalist this was a treat. My High School Phoenix Christian still dominates our division by design. I would run the 100 meters which back then was the 100 yard dash. The 220, long jump and several sprint relays. I was fast.\n\nThis weekend I enjoyed seeing hundreds of kids preform their best. \n\nPhoenix Christian senior sprinter Preston VanHofwegen, who is going to Azusa Pacific to play football in the fall, won the 400-meters with a personal best time of 49.45 seconds. You will be hearing about Preston in pro-ball in the near future.\n\nDevon Allen the Brophy track star won a pair of state titles on Saturday and came a whisker away from two more, thrilling the crowd at the Division I state track meet at Mesa Community College. Brophy's tough.\n\nAs expected, Allen captured the 110- and 300-meter hurdle state titles. He dueled Deer Valley sprinter Trae Armstrong in the 100- and 200-meter dashes, losing both by a hundredth of a second. These were exciting races.\n\nCongratulations to every participant.
