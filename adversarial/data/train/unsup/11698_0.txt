Although Hot Star didn't live up to my expectations overall, I have to admit the chicken is pretty damn good. Meat was tender, well-seasoned and not dry at all! However, the batter is quite thick so it was really heavy especially upon the first few bites where there is little to no chicken to go with it. The best part is towards the middle (where all the meat is) but as you move closer to the end, you'll have to eat around the bones which is a little annoying. Its a good snack to eat in the cold as it comes out piping hot.\n\nThey don't cut the chicken into smaller pieces in order to retain the moisture so it's not really sharing-friendly. \n\nConsidering the size, I don't think the pricing is outrageous nor is it really fair to compare it to what you'd pay in Taiwan. I didn't regret it but I'd think twice about going back since it failed to leave a lasting impression.\n\nIt can be pretty confusing because most people automatically start standing behind whoever is closest to the door without realizing that there are two separate lines (order and pick-up) and the longer one is most likely the pick-up line. So beware of that to prevent wasting your time.\n\nI spent about 30 minutes in this place altogether - 10 or less in the order line and 20 in the pick-up when I came in on a late Saturday afternoon. It wasn't that bad as I've waited longer (ahem* Uncle Tetsu) but it's definitely not a place to go for a quick grab by any means.
