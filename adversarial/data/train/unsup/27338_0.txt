Good displays, lots of which are interactive, mostly (I'd say) targeted at ages 8-15, stronger on life sciences and geology, weaker on chemistry and physics, with a somewhat odd digital technology room having remarkably little digital technology. Nice Arizona-specific displays throughout! Don't miss the 4th floor ... accessible by elevator or hidden stairway.
