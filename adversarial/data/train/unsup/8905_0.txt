So the Atlantic Farmers Market is probably not really what you think of when you think of \"Farmers Market\".  For one, most markets are bright and airy and give you this feeling of walking in a meadow of flowers or something.  Step through the doors here and you are blasted with a stink of god knows what.\n\nIf you think that smell turned me away, then you have not been reading for the last 800-odd reviews, because we checked out every inch of the place, and there is plenty to like here.  It just is not a market like anything you are used to seeing.\n\nThe place is huge, and I am not sure that I would buy much from the clearance aisle, because the entire building is like clearance from everywhere, but more power to those who can.  Just bring your own Fabreze.
