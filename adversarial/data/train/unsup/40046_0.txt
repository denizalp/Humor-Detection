This is such a hidden gem in the Strip. It's SO cheap, the serving sizes are huge (so are cheese portions ) and EVERYTHING is good! For those who might feel intimidated by Peruvian cuisine, they also have Mexican dishes (like quesadillas and burritos), and even burgers and fries! \n\nMy favorites are the rottisserie chicken, the giant fried chicken burrito (they're not lying about the giant part) and Yucca fries. And don't forget the green chilli sauce! \n\nI also love that they're BYOB and have a few sidewalk tables.
