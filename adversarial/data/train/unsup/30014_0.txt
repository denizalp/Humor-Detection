Sadly, I have to put in a negative for my most recent experience at my favorite bar in Old Town.  I was excited to share my favorite hang out with my cousins in from Illinois, for dinner before St. Patrick's Day festivities.  The bouncer said he could not let any more patrons in since they didn't have enough staff to cover all the tables.  Half of the tables were EMPTY!!!  \n\nThe manager came out and said they were short staffed, some people didn't come in and we would have to wait about 30 minutes, or until enough people left.  I can certainly understand the predicament, however this manager was unapologetic.\n\nI convinced my cousins to come back later for a night cap and some appetizers, and the same manager delivered our food and said, \"I see you cam back!\"  Again, no apology for the situation, and didn't even offer a free drink or appetizer for our inconvenience.  \n\nI love this place, and will come back based on my past experiences, but the manager needs serious customer experience training, because my cousins said they will never go back based on this bad experience.
