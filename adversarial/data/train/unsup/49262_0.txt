Visited Saturday morning. Our first visit here. The place is small but quiet accommodative if you do not mind to have the next table inches away from you. The service is slow but did not matter much. I tried the original sandwich which people had reviewed here on yelp and they were right I would say. Well cooked pork loin grill and toast combination. But my wife being a vegetarian tried the Kaya toast with boiled egg which was a disappointment. I will surely come back to try some authentic Malaysian dishes on the menu, especially laksa to see if It could match the Singapore food court style.
