Love this store. \n\nEveryone that I've met in this store has been super friendly and helpful. But not helpful in that pushy, stalker-esque way. They're attentive and knowledgeable, and patient when I'm being fickle. The store is clean and well organized. They usually have a tasting going on for beer or wine. \n\nThe parking lot can get a little hairy, but it's not the worst. I always go out the exit behind Total Wine, there's a light there. Drive cautiously in this parking lot, don't get too excited about bringing home your well priced wine and beer. They have a make your own six pack aisle, but most of the beers you could just buy one of if you like. \n\nAlong with the helpful staff, they also have carts and baskets to help you carry everything - but I'm with John H - I'm usually struggling to get my armload to the register. Challenge accepted.\n\nps. one of the \"survey questions\" at the end of this page is asking me if they deliver... what a tease!
