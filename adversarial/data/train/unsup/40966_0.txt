How disappointed. We went here for lunch and couldn't believe how sub par the food was. I guess since we heard such good things we expected better. We went to Caesars new buffet the night before and this buffet doesn't come close. The sliders were overcooked. The ribs were terrible. Sushi choices were all veggie until she finally made a spicy tuna roll which was average. Salads were good. If you like pesto this is the place. All the pastas with pesto and the mashed potatoes with pesto were good. Desserts were good. For the reputation I expected better.
