Located in Old Montreal close to the Old Port, this restaurant was one of our highlights while on vacation.  We enjoyed a wonderful brunch with live jazz in their beautiful garden. The menu is extensive and features lots of freshly made items and the service is attentive.  Most at our table had crepes (they are famous for them) while I had a delicious salad with field greens, beets, goat cheese, nuts and lots of other goodies.  We had a ringside seat to a 3 piece combo and lovely singer.  \n\nThis restaurant is a must for a fun Sunday Brunch if you are in Montreal and nearby after April, 2014. They are currently undergoing off season renovations.
