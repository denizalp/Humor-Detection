A Major Scam for the Price:\n(A) Terrible service: We didn't get our bread until we had started our appetizer.\n(B) Mediocre Food: Tomatoes were hard & tasteless like you'd find at Giant Eagle; salad was ridiculous--mainly cheap iceberg lettuce with a few tomato slices; main course was nothing special\n(C) CASH-ONLY Accepted: WHO'S HEARD OF A RESTAURANT THAT DOESN'T TAKE CREDIT CARDS!!! I mean, even the tiny village restaurant near Nanjing, China takes my American Express card?! Oh yeah, they do post a tiny, hand-written sign near the entrance that states \"Cash & Personal Checks Accepted\". C'mon, they take personal checks but not credit cards?!
