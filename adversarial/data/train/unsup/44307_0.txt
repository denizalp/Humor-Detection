We were given tickets to see The Beach Boys on August 10 at Maddie's Place so we decided to 'make it a night' and have dinner at the restaurant which advertises on CJAD and for which announcers swoon over the roast beef.  We are all serious meat eaters and looked forward to a glorious meal. We made reservations and arrived on time to be seated.  We were never advised that on that night there would be no menu and only a buffet would be available so I am only reviewing the buffet.  I have no reference for the actual menu.  The food was truly awful!  The food was cold, overcooked and mostly not there!  The charge was $30 per person for cold pasta, dry cold ribs and some kind of overcooked beef swimming in a sea of something, certainly not jus.  The shrimp were okay, just okay.\nThe main issue here seems to be management. When we complained on the Monday after the show the person who answered our email told us we had free tickets to the concert so we had a 'great night' for about $35 per person.  Whether we paid for our seats or not has nothing to do with the quality of the food.  Our meal was truly one of the worst buffets we have every frequented.  The combination of bad food and a manager who does not care encourages me to seek other restaurants to frequent.\nAgain, perhaps the menu is wonderful, but we did not witness that on that particular visit.
