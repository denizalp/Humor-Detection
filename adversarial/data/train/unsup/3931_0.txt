Dear Marquita,\n\nThanks for butchering my name this morning. I'm used to people getting my name wrong, but when your coworker asked you about it, your were rude & justified your mistake instead of owning it. I'm happy to share how rude & unapologetic you were.  I'm happy to spend my money elsewhere.
