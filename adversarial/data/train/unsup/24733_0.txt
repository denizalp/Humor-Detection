My daughter insisted I needed a microdermabrasion. So on a recent visit to Las Vegas, i decided to do this procedure. A friend who lives there recommended De Vries Cosmetic Center. I was a little nervous that my appearance would ruin my vacation until I met Olga.  She was uber-professional and explained that while I would be red from the IPL, it would look healthy! I had both procedures done in this immaculate facility, and to say I was thrilled with the results is understatement. My face was glowing and my skin tone was smooth and even. It is worth flying to Vegas. The price is right and the people -including the owner, Alexis - really know skin. I'm flying out in three months for a follow- up treatment.
