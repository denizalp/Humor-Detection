Visited a few months ago for Restaurant Week in Charlotte. Walkable from my girlfriends house in Dilworth so that was a plus. \n\nAtmosphere was classic and quaint - I mean it's in an old church! Service was amazing as the waiter was spot on for timing and recommendations on what we should order.\n\nReally enjoyed the Pork Belly app - it's small, but worth it! They had an issue with my entree from what I recall it was made wrong. They RAPIDLY solved the problem and had a brand new plate out in less than 3 minutes.\n\nAll around a great place to visit if you are in the Dilworth area looking for a fancy meal.
