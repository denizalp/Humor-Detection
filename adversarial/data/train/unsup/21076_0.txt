My daughter told me that Peacock Boutique had recently moved to 11 St. SW...near me!\nShe suggested I check them out for selling my orig. designs (I do artisan jewelry). I was so excited. \n\nSo this morning I went into the shop and went right to the till and asked the sales assistant (owner??) if she would be interested in selling my designs. Without even a hint of friendliness, she glanced at the bracelet I'd brought to show, barely visible in a sm. see-thru bag, and immediately said she wasn't interested. Without even seeing or touching the design.\n\nI left, a bit crestfallen, and decided, on the walk back to my car, I wouldn't go back, to shop or peruse. It's kind of sad; P. Boutique used to be such a welcoming place when it was in Kensington.
