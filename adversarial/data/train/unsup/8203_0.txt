I went by on March 28th (my birthday) to inquire about a tattoo. I was really nervous due to not having a tattoo done in 3 years.\n\nChris told me it would take him a week to do draw up a tatoo amd $50 deposit  to start it.\n\nI didn't mind the $50 deposit , but a week , really !!!!!\n\nThe shop was COMPLETELY EMPTY , WHY A WEEK ??\n\nI wanted to get it done thst night for my birthday , or maybe the next day.\n\nI don't think I will be going back here.\n\nREALLY disappointed.  Because it had VERY good reviews.
