I heard a lot of good things about Sushi Crystal so decided to give it a try. We waited ten minutes to be seated. My date and I were given tablets to order our sushi which we thought was neat. About thirty minutes after our sushi arrived slowly. It took us two hours between the time we sat down to the time we left as the kitchen was understaffed. The sushi was delicious and everything was very fresh. I would like to give this place another try in the near future. Good prices, ambiance and music.
