Have to agree with Jane W. Sometimes simpler is better. Having staff walk around in chef's coats and selling gourmet sandwiches is not what this place needed. Sure it needed a makeover but not a complete overhaul. Prices went up yet quality stayed the same which was good but not great. \n\nAs far as I know the wholesale part of it is still up and running. It's too bad. I've been going here for about 15 years.
