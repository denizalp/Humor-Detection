Thanks to Postino, I'm obsessed with bruschetta flights! I'm determined to have one every time I'm in Arizona.\n\nMy flight in order of favorites...\n1. Mascarpone, proscuitto, & figs\n2. Brie, green apples, & fig jam\n3. Arugula & bacon\n4. Salami & pesto\n\nPostino also has great deals on wine and beer throughout the week. The atmosphere is hip, so it's a great place for a date or group of friends.\n\nThey also have well-kept gender neutral restrooms. So awesome!
