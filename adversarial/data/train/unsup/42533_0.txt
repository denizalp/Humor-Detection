I've been coming here for years and it's just as good now as then. The staff are as quirky, friendly, and helpful as ever. There's always a great sample cooking in the back corner. I love the wide assortment of frozen items that aren't anywhere else.\nThe wine section is great as well. \nAnd where else are you going to get orchids, humus, and mochi in the same place?\n\nThis is a great store to pickup everything you need for a special homemade meal with that special someone.
