Would I pay the suggested price of $250 a night to stay here? Bahahaha. No.\n\nWe booked Omni William Penn via one of those Mystery Deals on Hotwire: they tell you it's a 4-star hotel located downtown, you book it, and you're stuck with the consequence. We got the room for $99 a night, which is reasonable.\n\nIt's a grand old building, for certain, but I'm not sure what the fuss is about. As we were unfamiliar with Pittsburgh, there were things we didn't know, such as Downtown being a business district that completely dies after 7 p.m. It's obvious this is a hotel for business people and not tourists because we were left with nothing to do at night. Let's just say I'm completely caught up on the latest season of \"Duck Dynasty\" and I don't even like men with beards.\n\nWhat makes this a four-star hotel? I'm not sure. Our view was other hotel rooms, and they were unoccupied so we couldn't even be entertained with voyeurism. The building is oddly shaped, creating an area where sounds from the busy street below become trapped and wake you up every hour of the night. The entire building is heated, which was awesome when coming in from the snow outside, but made for very hot nights that we were unable to counteract with the a\/c unit in the room. The TV was a good 10-15 feet from the bed, which was kind of amusing at first but an annoyance when trying to see the nuances in Food Network cooking competitions.\n\nThe perks were a bagel shop, Jimmy John's and Starbucks downstairs in the same building. Given that this hotel does not offer free coffee, free breakfast or free WiFi, prepare to open your wallet if you don't want to spend hours outside wandering around trying to find a place that's open past 5 p.m.\n\nLocation: Meh\nAmenities: Meh\nBed: Meh\niPod dock: Seriously, what kind of four-star hotel doesn't provide an iPhone dock?\n\nVisiting Pittsburgh for pleasure? I'm going to give you the advice I wish somebody had given me: stay the hell away from downtown.
