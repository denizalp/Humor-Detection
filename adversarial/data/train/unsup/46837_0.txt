Had dinner here last week. Party of 6 (3 couples). \nThe staff was fantastic, drinks were delicious. I ordered a salad which was great except they served me fried chicken instead of baked. They also screwed up one of our meal orders as well but corrected it right way. Overall a good experience and I'll definitely go back. Had it not been for the 2 mishaps it would be a 5 star rating :)
