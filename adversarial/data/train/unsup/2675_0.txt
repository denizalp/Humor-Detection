Bond is one of those random casino bars you just walk by and never really think about stopping at because you're on your way somewhere else. It's right past the south entrance of the Cosmopolitan hotel (the one on the strip). Sometimes there's a band or other randomness occurring around it like people dancing on the main walkway--which makes this spot interesting.\n\nI sat down for a minute, ordered a drink, and while waiting for it, for fun put $20 in the gambling machine on the bar itself. Because I was gambling, I got the cocktail for free! So, if you're looking for a free drink here, sit down and put some money in the machine!\n\nI am pro-random-casino-bars.
