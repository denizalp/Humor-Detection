Just  ordered a margherita pizza, large salad and large cannoli.  My husband and I could not finish anything. The service was not that friendly. The pizza was terrible, had tons of sauce and the cheese was not  melted entirely. The salad came in two different containers, super small but paid for a large. The cannoli had tons of the filling so it was way too sweet, might as well just call it something else as it was just covered and swimming in a white NON RICOTTA sweet  cream.  We really wanted to find a nice pizza place close to home but for now we are going to stick to Spinattos. It's sad that we haven't found a great pizza in Ahwatukee yet. We are never coming back to this location, nothing really was worth the money. I'm very sorry for the bad review but I wish I had not spend my money there tonight as I'm writing this review still hungry and with a bad taste in my mouth. :( I really wonder if the other reviews are real....
