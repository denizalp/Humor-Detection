I ordered delivery and I wasn't overly impressed. The food was barely warm, the naan was mostly dry and hard... quality is mediocre, I've definitely had better butter chicken. And the delivery guy asked if I gave a tip WHILE I was still using the interac machine. \nI'm curious if dining in is better but I likely won't order delivery from them again
