I think the best thing this place had going for it was cute bar tenders and dudes sitting at the bar on the patio outside.\n\nThe wait staff, while moderately friendly, seemed not in any kind of rush to be of service. Another reviewer hit it on the head with the word 'clueless,' I think. \n\nIt can sometimes be a bad sign when you can find Mexican, Asian, and typical American choices on the same menu. And sure enough, the food was absolutely mediocre.  \n\nMy portabella burger was not bad, but if I'm paying for food, I would not want to waste my money here again. Too many other restaurants to try. I think the right word for RRBC is forgettable. Nothing was terrible, it was just forgettable. \n\nThe beers were fine, but I can also think of a million other places I'd rather go to have a bigger selection of better-tasting beers.
