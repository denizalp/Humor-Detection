If you could look up \"Doing It Wrong\" in the dictionary there would be a picture of the Uptown Hooters next to it.\n\nA group of 9 of us (8 guys and me) went for a friend's birthday because they had ordered the UFC fight. The fact that even with the fight the place was half empty on a Saturday night should have said something, but we set in and ordered up food anD beers. Since we were a large group we were given two waitresses but they didn't coordinate so items we ordered kept not being entered. After the initial round of food all we were ordering was beer but even with an average order to table time of over 20 minutes we were still missing some pints (this may be because one of the waitresses said she was too young to serve beer so she had to relay the orders to a bartender who then forgot them).\n\nYou would think that after paying around a grand to be able to show the fight they would actually do so, and you would be wrong. They forgot to put it on until we reminded them and a few times switched the channel to King of Queens. When it was on, it was so low you couldn't hear, which was odd since it was the only thing our entire section was watching. Apparently the manager was the only one who could change it back and if I were him, after hearing one of the waitresses whine out my name at the top of her lungs every 5 minutes, I wouldn't be on my A game either. I feel sorry for you, David.\n\nMy bar for the food was low since it's Hooters (the breasts and thighs they specialize in aren't on a chicken). But even though I was drinking water, not beer, all night I still got sick later that night. Bar: not met.\n\nSo, bad service, lack of beer, poor fight showing, and questionable food. Yeah, I won't be going back.
