We just ordered this place for work and not only did the owner personally deliver our food, but it looks amazing! Our order arrived about one minute before the exact time we wanted it, which was a weird time. The pizza looks so delicious and the wings smell good. I have eaten from this place before and I like it. I have had a few different items and all good. I really liked the garlic knots. They are small, but so tastey! The crust is good and it looks as if it was baked in a brick oven. We will definitely be back.
