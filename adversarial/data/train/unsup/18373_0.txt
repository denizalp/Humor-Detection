I came here on the 2nd weekend that they opened ( Labor Day Weekend) since they had free entry for Dirty South with even ratio. \n\nGetting in was a cluster fuck of people and a huge mess, we arrived at the venue at 9:30 but weren't walked in by our promoter till 10:30, and spent an hour waiting in a line for no apparent reason.  Apparently alot of other people were just waiting for their promoters to just show up as well.  I am guessing since they are pretty new they are still trying to work out the kinks. \n\nI love the entry \/ interior decoration of this club.  They have 3 different levels but most of them are filled with tables.  So if you don't get a table you are going to end up on the edge, on the stairs or on the very small dance floor.  They have dancers hanging from the ceiling and dancers located throughout the club as well, very cirque du soleil like. \n\nThe bass\/ sound system for this club is ridiculous, you can feel the bass through every part of your body.  The opening DJ for Dirty South was pretty good in the beginning, but by the end of his set he started playing some music that was just all over the place sudden drops \/ dubstep \/ electro sounding stuff that I really had no idea what it was and I wasn't feeling it at all. \n\nI would definitely come here again since the venue is so attractive inside.
