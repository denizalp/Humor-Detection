I had an amazing experience with ED Marshall.  I was sitting on a watch for years, that hasn't worked since I've had it.  I knew that it was good quality and definitely not a throw away.  I'm not much of a jewlery\/watch guy so I had no need for it and thought I would see what it was worth.  I went to a few pawn shops around town and got quotes for $100, $115, and $150.  I almost sold it then, but I figured I would be better off just keeping it.  I saw a few commercials for ED Marshall on tv, and decided to try one more place just to see what could be.  They offered me $400!  Double of what I was hoping to get.  \n\nEveryone in the Scottsdale location was really helpful and great to work with.  They have me digging around my house seeing what else I don't need anymore.  If you are looking to sell your watch or any other jewlery definitely try ED Marshall first.
