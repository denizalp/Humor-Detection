Tried this today for the first time.  I got the fatoush salad with chicken,  almost $13.\n\nThe plates are tiny,  so there was very little salad. I couldn't believe how little chicken I got on top. About a third or half of what I would get at any other place. \n\nFlavour was delicious I'll admit that,  although a bit too strong, overloaded the dressing.  Hot sauce was great. \n\nThis place would get 5 stars if the portions were correct,  I would have to pay $26 to get a plate equivalent to my normal Shawarma places.
