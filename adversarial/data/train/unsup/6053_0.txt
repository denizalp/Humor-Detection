Other reviews here have summarized the good points this salon has to offer in good detail so I'll focus on the pros that stuck out to me. This review is for the male populace reading the reviews, ladies you get a lot of love at the salon so this one is for the homies. \n\nJulie is one of the most talented barbers I have come across in a long time, she has a great understanding of current and classic hairstyles and can offer advice on how to control your hair for your desired look. For me the mark of a good barber is not how the haircut looks on the first day but how well it grows in, I've always wanted to keep a longer hairstyle and Julie is the one that let me have it! She cut it and instructed me on how to style it and it was exactly how I wanted it. The spa has great amenities and a great atmosphere, fellas I recommend you try out that celebrity cut you have been dying to pull off, Julie can make it happen.
