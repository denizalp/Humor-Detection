My boyfriend bought me a beautiful necklace for Christmas! My new favorite piece of jewelry...... he then accidentally dropped it onto a plug that was half sticking out of an outlet so it fried the silver and broke the chain. Long story short brand new Christmas present ruined, or so I thought! LOL! Found this jewelry repair place on Yelp and decided to give them a try. We swung by on a Saturday morning and spoke with the a very nice lady. She was able to show me a few different chains and let us know they would replace the chain for me for free, I just had to purchase the new chain. After about 40 minutes, we went back and my Christmas present was beautiful again! They were quick, affordable, reliable and very helpful. My necklace is good as new! Thanks so much for saving my boyfriends butt! Haha!
