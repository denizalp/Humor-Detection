I loved the MacDaddy with Carne Asada! I also ordered two pollo Asada tacos on the side! My Lovely Woman had the Carne Asada Dilla and was pleased as well! I definitely recommend the Pineapple Drink in the Mason Jar. Yes you get to keep it! Refills available as well! I look forward to going back and having some more tacos as well trying the Carne Asada Fries!
