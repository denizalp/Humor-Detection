I just saw this show again about a month ago and I have to say it is still my favorite cirque show in Las Vegas. The music is so fun and up-beat and really puts a smile on your face. I know some people will tell you that there is not as much dramatic stunt work as some of the other shows but really if you watch closely you will see that what the performers are doing is just as acrobatic and impressive but it is just presented differently. This show feels more like a Broadway musical than a circus. But I think that is exactly what makes it so amazing. I love LOVE!
