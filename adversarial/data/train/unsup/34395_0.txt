I've never had the food but a super fun place to hang on Friday of Saturday nights. They raise the large table upstairs and DJ plays great music. Always a good diverse crowd- fun dancing to awesome music! The bartenders are usually quick and fun and take excellent care of customers. One of my favorite spots to hang out!
