They serve Kool-Aid as a \"drank\", y'all. That's just so ghetto, ain't it? As I have waited for flights at Sky Harbor, I noticed this spot before thinking with disgust who in their right mind would wolf down chicken and waffles before a flight? Apparently nobody around me in that food court since everybody else was eating salads and staring at the gluttony about to occur. Now here's a case where what you do in Phoenix may not stay in Phoenix since who knows what would come out of you after the \"Fasten Seat Belts\" light comes on.\n\nSo yes, I had a half-hour and a weak moment at the same time and decided to give it a try. What may have not been a great sign is that I had to cajole the server to come out of the kitchen to take my order. He seemed a touch perturbed as he was chatting with the cook. It gave me more time to decide to go full gonzo and order the $14.50 Lo-Lo's Hood Classic. It consisted of three pieces of Southern fried chicken on top of two full waffles in a weak styrofoam container (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2m6cUi9). Don't judge me.\n\nI was hungry because they didn't serve lunch at my business meeting. It was a huge amount of food as the people around me can attest, but I was disappointed how bland and dry it was once you get over the finger-burning heat of the chicken. The waffles were rubbery and merely acted as a sponge for all the grease (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2mlCFfa). It was hardly worth the massive calorie intake, and I ended up eating only half of it. My biggest challenge afterward was keeping it down, especially when my plane hit turbulence. Not pretty.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...big pieces of fried chicken but bland with dry meat and third degree burns when you touch the poultry\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...it's the airport...are you serious?\nSERVICE - 2 stars...I didn't get a lot of Phoenix love here\nTOTAL - 2 stars...Southern by Southwest?...hmmm, not really
