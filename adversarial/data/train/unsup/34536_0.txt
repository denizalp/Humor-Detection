I finally went in for lunch after driving by nearly everday for the past 2 years.  I was a little reluctant from some of the reviews, but I tried it anyway and I must add my two cents.  The service we received was prompt and friendly.  Our food came out in a timely fashion...and it was very tasty.  I typically dont care for egg drop soup, but it came with the lunch special, so I tasted it...then I finished the whole bowl.  The broth was delicious.  The egg roll was super good and the amount of chicken lo mein was enough for two meals, which I did take home....because it was totally worth eating a second time.   We also had the bbq pork buns, they werent the best ive ever had...but still worth eating and enjoying.  I will be back again...I hope its just as good.
