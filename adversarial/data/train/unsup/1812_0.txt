I love shopping at the Base Exchange. it's like the Target\/Sears\/Dillards for folks who are living on base and can still enjoy the comforts and convenience of shopping for familiar goods without having to go off base.  But if you do live off base and are active duty\/reserve or retired you still enjoy the benefits of the Exchange or \"BX\" which is the coined term we all use.\n\nThe best thing about shopping here is if my wild children run off, we're on a military base...so folks here are generally kind and helpful and are not rude because there are generally a lot of young families here.  I find this to be the case in all the BXs I've been on. I feel very safe shopping here and I love that feeling.\n\nFrom household cleaning goods and cookies to computers, kids clothes and coffee tables this place has it all.  \n\nThe best thing is shopping for high-end cosmetics like Estee Lauder, Elizabeth Arden, Clinique, etc.  Like a mini Sephora here!  If you're a COACH fan several handbags on display too for you to splurge on.  \n\nBut the reason to shop here is the tax free benefit and a lot of items I've found to have better prices.  I bought a great outdoor table with four chairs and an umbrella for a very reasonable price.  So for those type of high end ticket items i definitely go out of my way to shop here it's worth it!
