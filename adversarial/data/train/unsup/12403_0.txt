Rockbar.  I vaguely remembered it was the old Acme, but since I am not in Old Town much at all lately... I don't know how long ago it made the conversion to Rockbar.\n\nThere was a $3 cover charge for the few minutes while we were entering... The band was playing a version of Eleanor Rigby that rocked pretty hard so we agreed to pay the meager fee.  The band played two songs and then stopped.  They seemed to start up again as we were leaving... and I noticed the cover was no longer being collected.  Odd.\n\nAnyway, the vodka\/sodas we had were strong and served with a slice of lemon and lime.  I am not a big fan of vodka, so I appreciated the citrus.  I wish I could tell you how much they cost, but thanks to my Best Buddy Brian and Eric R, I didn't buy a drink at this place.  Thanks Guys!\n\nI would come here again if a good band was playing.  The place was pretty empty for a Saturday night, though.  I don't know if this is a common thing, but I didn't care because I was in good company.
