After the Alzheimer's Walk, we opted for an American breakfast and since we've hit up Du-Pars quite a few times when we're in the downtown area, we decided to check out Eat after the rave reviews from fellow yelpers.\n\nChef Natalie Young has helped re-ignite the downtown area by giving people a hip trendy spot to start their day. As you step inside, it makes you feel like you're not in the desert, but somewhere in the Bay Area or even NYC. Serving breakfast and lunch, The menu items at Eat definitely has something for everyone. We decided on the Huevos Montulenos and the Downtown Benedict (Served on the weekends only)\n\nOur server was very attentive and offered suggestions as well as answered any \nquestions we had before making our decision, and kept our coffee mugs full with the tasty coffee from the Colorado River Roasting Company-YUM!\n\nThe Huevos Montulenos is layered with tons of flavor-a tortilla with sweet peas, black beans, saltiness from feta cheese, more added sweetness from bananas(not sweet plantains) covered with two fried eggs and topped with a nice heat from the christmas sauce(AKA salsa rojo y salsa verde) served with a mound of potatoes. The benedict was kinda small in portion size but definitely made up in flavor with the wheat english muffin, turkey bacon sauteed spinach and two perfectly poached eggs that oozes out as you cut into it. Being in the food biz, I can tell whether a place cuts corners, but the hollandaise sauce is the real deal Hollyfield folks...it is dangerously good!\n\nIf you happen to be in the area, stop by for a tasty bite. You will not be disappointed!\nLooking forward to returning to try Chef Natalie's other creations...ALOHA!!!
