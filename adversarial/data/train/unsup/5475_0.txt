Liz is very professional and I appreciate the advice that she gave me regarding my business and personal taxes. The only critique I have is that it took them a really long time to e-file my taxes. I provided all the documents needed by February 8th, yet my taxes did not appear to be e-filed until I called to follow up on February 19th. \nI called on the 19th because I had not gotten any confirmation from iQTAXX that my taxes were e-filed correctly and the IRS had no record of them being filed. I was put on hold for about 15 minutes and then was told my taxes had been e-filed at that time because the IRS had not accepted them previously. I would have liked to have been notified if there was a problem and would recommend that the business let their customers know in that event. Fortunately I did receive my refund from the IRS within two weeks so I'm happy now!
