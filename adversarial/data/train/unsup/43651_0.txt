I'm mad that I purchased something from them and I'll never shop there again! Worst customer service ever! There was one dark haired older gentleman that was great, but he was only helping out in the gun department. Everyone else seemed bothered and annoyed if you had a question! This was my first gun, it's a major purchase! There are so many options so I had a few questions. They acted like I was buying a stick of gum, as in: are you going to get it or not kind of attitude! So of course I was rushed into purchasing it and found it for $30 cheaper at Dick's Sporting Goods and now I have to deal with the headache of a price matching war! If they don't honor a price match, I'll never shop there again!!!
