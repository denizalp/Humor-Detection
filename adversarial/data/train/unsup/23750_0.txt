Mmmmmm.... Penang Curry. This is my all time favorite Thai dish and they made it just how I liked it. The taste of the curry with the hot spices weren't salty and that's what I found in some Thai restaurants. I did wish I would've eaten there as the restaurant had that local feeling to it. I imagine that's what one of the restaurants look like in Thailand, small and cozy. \n\nMy bf ordered the BBQ Chicken over Fried Rice. He was very impressed with this dish, from the presentation to the flavors that married together. The charred taste of the chicken was also what made his taste buds happy. \n\nAs a third dish, we ordered their pad Thai. I don't think I would order this again. Maybe I just am not a fan of pad Thai but I have had a better version of it. There was just something about the taste that didn't quite agree with my pallet.
