Nice place with spacious rooms. The food situation is great. Loads of low to high budget places to choose from. I prefer the Wynn resorts to the Venetian, but still a nice place. Service is okay, could have been a bit better, but the pool attendants were great. Very accommodating. The pool clubs make the whole pool a little louder than most pool goers seemed to appreciate and the music from the Tao club could be heard in all of the rooms facing the pool. Is the club scene for 150 people really worth making everyone else have to listen to blaring music in their rooms all day? Their wifi is the worst I've ever seen in a hotel (LaQuinta Inns has better wifi and no resort fee...). You're better off not using it. If more than one device is on it, it completely crashes, the wifi doesn't reach throughout the entire room, so good luck using it in the bath or in bed. For a $28 resort fee, I'd expect the wifi to be fairly decent, at least workable... Other than that, pretty nice place to stay.
