I went here with some friends during a ridiculous sunday.  I mean, it's kinda so bad its good.  I am not sure if the bartender was bombed or just \"whimsical\".  We had to finish our beers until he gave us another one ( I don't think he wanted to wash another glass).  Then we asked for shots and was confused what \"chilled\" meant. hahah.  I think our tab was like $30 for a couple hours of heavy drinking though. \n\n\nPros: If an out-of-towner is confused what a yinzer is, just take them here...no words necessary.  Cheap drinks.  darts. PEOPLE WATCHING. \n\nCons: Smoking...but i guess its a dive bar.  I mean even vodka club was pushing the limits of the bartenders patience...\n\nOverall: eh, why not? ha.
