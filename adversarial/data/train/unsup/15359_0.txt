I am about to make a very bold statement. This is THE best lunch deal in town. Period. Yes, yes, there are plenty of super delicious, cheap options in Chinatown, taco places, etc. But hello, this is a Strip restaurant with uber fresh fish. Come on!\n\nSo, the lunch costs $20.13. I chose the tomato salad to start with because everybody raved about it. And yes, these are near perfect tomatoes. The only bad thing after trying them is that you'll get super depressed with the lack of access you have to supreme tomatoes. For my entr√©e I chose the lavraki, which was just perfect. Lastly I chose the walnut pie. Hmm I could've done without it and just continued in the spirit of light, refreshing things and chosen the yogurt martini. I'll just have to come back again.\n\nI cannot sufficiently praise Mediterranean cooking, that uses only the best ingredients and is prepared very simply. You can really see the ingredients shine through in this method of preparation. And Milos really know how to bring out the best in every single ingredient. Well done indeed.
