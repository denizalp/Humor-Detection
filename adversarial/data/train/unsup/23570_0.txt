Once I heard that Slice of Vegas has a Vegan Buffalo Pizza, I knew it was only a matter of time before we would wind up here once our plane touched down in Vegas.\n\nLocated in the Mandalay Bay along with another Vegan-friendly restaurant by the name of Hussong's Cantina, Slice of Vegas offers a full on Vegan menu. It mostly consists of Gardein and Daiya based recreations of their regular menu. Hey, this is Vegas damnit! Nobody comes here to eat salad.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, I skipped the Buffalo Pie in favor of the regular version so that my babygirl would be able to share the pizza with me as she isn't too keen on spiciness. The thin crust was so so, but the rest was Daiya & faux meat heaven. I'm not the biggest Daiya fan, but it is great substitute for pizza.\n\nI ordered a side of Vegan Buffalo Strips as an appetizer for myself. If I had known they wouldn't be very spicy, I would've went with the atomic sauce instead. It was odd they put the sauce on the side, rather than smothered into the strips. Perhaps it would've given it more flavor as well as the joy of getting your fingers messy as you much away on Buffalo sauced goodness. I enjoyed this but at $10.95, it's a bit pricey. Even for Vegas...\n\nI wish I was hungrier on this visit as the menu had so many options to from. Various appetizers, pasta, soups, salads, desserts and more. So many pastabilities, so little room in my tummy. The prices could be lower for the quality of the food, but I can't complain too much. Even though I'm rating this 3.5 stars, I'm rounding up for the simple fact that this type of Vegan food in Vegas is a rare find, and the simple fact that I will be back again to try out more things. Oh, and to get that atomic sauce.
