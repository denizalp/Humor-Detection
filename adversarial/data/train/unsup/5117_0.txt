This is review for Machine Gun Shooting.  Handguns and Semi-Automatic didn't appeal to us at all. \n\nWe were seduced here by all the advertisements in the taxi cab on our way back from lunch to another spot, and on a whim decided we needed to go check this place out.  \n\nWe came here with intentions of shooting the machine guns and were excited by the selection.  \n\nWell, when we arrived and walked in we were met by a line of about 40 people.  Bummer. Not a fun way to spend the early day Las Vegas buzz.  The place is small so it was super hot and uncomfortable.\n\nWe decided on the AK-47 which includes 25 shots for $50 plus a $2 Shooting target fee.  Not worth it IMO.  If you've ever shot an AK-47 you know how quick that will go.  If you haven't shot one, your not missing anything here.\n\nPaid for taxi to drive us there, waited more than an hour on our feet, purchased some overpriced water and redbull while waiting in line, shot for a minute.  For $400 plus...I recommend something else!  \n\nI'm a true believer that you cannot put a price on experience, but this experience was just.......whatever.  Maybe if your going for the rifles and handguns, this might be fun.
