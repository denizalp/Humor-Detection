This is a letter I mailed, faxed and hand delivered to my Service Consultant at Arrowhead Lexus.    Never received a response.\n\nSeptember 20, 2010\n\nArrowhead Lexus\n9238 West Bell Rd\nPeoria, AZ 85382\n\n\nLexus Manager\n\nI have had my Lexus RX 330 serviced by your service center multiple times in the last year.  At the last three times there was a note with the work order that I complained of steering wheel vibrating at high speeds and that it was pulling\/drifting to the left.  Every time I was told it was the tires, the road, or the rotors.  After my last service and the vehicle were still under the 100,000-mile warranty, I was again told everything was fine.  This past service I went to another Lexus repair shop and he told me right away that the struts were leaking and had been broken at least a year, because the boot around it was completely worn away.  Since the strut was broken so long, it had caused all the other struts to fail including the stabilization arm.  \n\nAll told, the bills were $3,600 dollars.  I feel that Lexus is always advertising that it does excellent service and in this case it didn't which cost me more to service the vehicle because proper maintenance was not preformed at your service center  this should have been fixed in the previous three service visits. \n\n\nNot satisfied customer\n\nScott
