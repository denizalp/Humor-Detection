I hit by a car (which left without checking to see if the person they'd left on the street was okay) as a pedestrian on my way to work a couple of years ago which left me with a pretty bad knee.  It went out regularly, hurt almost constantly, and just generally didn't feel right.  \n\nAfter MUCH encouragement from my husband, Mom (an RN) and finally my doctor, I decided to visit a physiotherapist.  I wasn't too sure what to expect, and honestly, I picked on On The Mark because they were just a short distance from my house.  I will never be hesitant about Physiotherapy again.  Not only did they help my knee get better at an alarming speed, every visit was also about pain control.  It was wonderful.  The location itself is also great, with a bus route across the street, ample street and a parking lot across the street and a lovely, spacious clean facility.  The people there are also wonderful, and I've referred my Mom, husband and several co-workers since then, all became quick and ardent fans as well.  I'm now going on more than a year with a knee that works great, and is pain free.
