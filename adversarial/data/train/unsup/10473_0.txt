Seriously, the complaints that this is a rickety warehouse are laughable. Did you miss that part that you are shopping in a Big Tin Shed?? Low overhead, EXTREMELY low prices and a HUGE selection. Yes, this is not your high commission, fancy showroom with everything dressed up to look like a room already. This is stacks and stacks of so many different things and interesting pieces. If you havent found what you are looking for, or dont want to pay $600 for a plain wooden dresser at The Fancy Store, or $100 for a crappy particle board dresser at Walmart, then this is the place for you. Customer service can be a little hard to get if you need it, but when you do get it, it works out. Ive bought a Cali King bed from there about 8 years ago, and just 2 weeks ago I picked up a dresser for the kid's room. I also ordered an oak TV stand with a faux fireplace in it that Im picking up right now.
