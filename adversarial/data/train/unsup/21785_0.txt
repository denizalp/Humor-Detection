This happens to be my second visit and I left this place disappointed.My first visit was so delightful that I wanted to come dine here again but this time I wasn't blown with your food.\n\nMy food as you can see in the photos was a Nutella crepe, seafood crepe and seafood coquille.I don't want to go in the details of the food but just want to mention that my food was cold??We were so hungry that didn't bother to send it back but I wish I would have done that.The seafood crepe had become overly salty since it was served cold.I wasn't quite able to distinguish the flavors of the main dishes since there weren't hot.Everything just tasted meh except for the Nutella crepe of course.\n\nService here was great-our server was friendly and sweet.I did get a chance to use their bathroom and found them very clean.\n\nTheir location is absolutely brilliant right in the middle of all the action.We didn't have to wait here since we got to the restaurant after the lunch rush.
