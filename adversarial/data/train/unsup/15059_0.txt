I feel like many people have already noted that the only reason to come here is to wait for your table next door at Pizzeria Bianco. With that said, I still very much like this place. I'm a meticulous planner so often times, I don't need to \"kill time\" before my party gets seated at the pizzeria. However, I do like coming in just a tad early to catch a beautiful sunset over Heritage Square with a hearty glass of red wine on Bar Bianco's pretty little porch. While this may not be a destination bar (there's Rose and Crown across the way for those looking to plant themselves for the long haul), it's a nice little interlude to what could potentially be a treacherous wait for a table. Cheers!
