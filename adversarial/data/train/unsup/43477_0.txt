One of my top 2 favorite BBQ restaurant in the Charlotte area! Love their Brisket sandwich done \"Bama Style\" it's fricken delicious! The fried green tomatoes are the second best I've ever had. Losing out to The Cajun Queens legendary fried green tomatoes! But still they are amazing and they really need to make them a permanent menu item!!! All other sides are really good. Banana Pudding is good, but has an odd spice in it that taste a little like clove, which really should not be in it, but it's still pretty tasty. Good service usually. I have eaten here almost weekly for the past 3 years and I never get sick of it!
