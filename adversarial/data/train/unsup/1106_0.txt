You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. That's how I feel about the SLS, the renovated Sahara Hotel.\n\nSure, the hotel now has fancy restaurants and a modern interior design, but the infrastructure is still old and decaying. Some elevators don't work. And my biggest complaint is that the walls are very thin. Was woken up at 2AM by a baby crying next door. Tip: Bring earplugs!\n\nMy experience wasn't as bad as other reviews have noted. No issues with the service or room size for me. However, since the SLS occupies an old building, even with the redesign, the overall look and feel didn't appear luxurious or contemporary, what I'd expect from the SBE brand.
