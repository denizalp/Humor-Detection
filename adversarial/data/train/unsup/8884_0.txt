Hot Eats?  Skip them. \nCool Treats? YES, PLEASE!\n\nFor those of you not versed in Diary Queen lingo, 'Hot Eats' refers to their burgers, fries, etc. You know, normal fast food junk. Skip it, it's pretty gross and definitely not what keeps them in business.\n\nTheir \"Cool Treats\" on the other hand, definitely worth your time. The cookie dough blizzards are absolutely delicious. This location has a drive-thru so you don't even have to get out of your car (score one for the lazy!)\n\nThings to watch for - before they hand you your blizzard they ALWAYS turn the cup upside down to show you that the ice cream won't fall out of the cup...I'm not really sure WHY that's a good thing, but it's trade mark dairy queen move, and I like it.
