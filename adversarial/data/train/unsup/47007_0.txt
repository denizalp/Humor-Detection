Meatball Strombolli was huge, fresh and perfect crust, excellent ingredients and huge (did I say that?).  Eggplant and mushroom Strombolli lacked spice and real flavor but then again those ingredients typically do - so not a complaint, just an observation.\nWonton nachos were tastey but I really loved the Lofah (?) with gorgonzola, mozzarella, bacon and sweet fig bits. \nWill try the pizza on next trip.  Beers were good too.  Happy to return !
