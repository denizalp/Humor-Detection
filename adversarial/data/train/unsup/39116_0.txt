It was a pleasant visit this time around.  Last time I wasn't able to have their regular menu due to it being the weekend in the morning..very selective menu for weekend brunch.\nThis time around I had the phish & fries and upgrade my fries to the supremecy and Mac n' cheese...wow!!\nThe cheese sauce was AMAZING. ..I just can't get enough!!  My only problem was with the phish....it was just a big block of tempeh,not very good.  The batter was delicious but the tempeh felt under seasoned and greasy.  I will definitely be back because the service was fast and pleasing.
