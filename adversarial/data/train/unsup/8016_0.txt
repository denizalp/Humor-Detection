This place is the worst ever restaurant ever and I had a huge bug I'm my salad. The waiter didn't care at all and neither did the manager! The restrooms haven't been cleaned in months and there are cockroaches everywhere. I wouldn't take my worst enemy to this shit hole. Do yourself a favor and go Taco Bell!
