I think this buffet isn't bad regardless of the price. I went on a weekend, so it was $32\/person for brunch. Which I don't think is unreasonable for the buffet.\n\nYou get all your usual prime rib, shrimp cocktails, variety of Chinese foods, spanish foods and seafood. There was quite a few seafood salads and the smoked salmon was really good as well. The roasted lamb was very good in my opinion. In addition to that, obviously there's a big selection of breakfast foods and two omelette making stations to custom make your omelette for you.\n\nThere's no alcoholic beverages included with the price and the dessert section is not very large compared to some of the other vegas buffets but this is a good solid buffet in my opinion. I definitely like the price as well.
