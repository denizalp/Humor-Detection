Imagine going on vacation and being taken to church by your best friends family...guess where?? You guessed it the same place that they filmed Uncle Buck..the Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse, super wierd!!. My best friends church was using this place as a make-shift house of worship and I thought woo-hoo I get to push the gender bender b\/c, that morning I was requested to wear a tie.  Afterwards, we were offered brunch here and I realized why the tie...servers came out with huge scissors and cut them off staple them to the rafters and started singing and yes they do have a contest for that huuge steak that was seen in the movie= tourist magnet.  I do remember it being rather pricey but, an experience I'd never forget..church at a steakhouse and a eccentric cowboy lunch
