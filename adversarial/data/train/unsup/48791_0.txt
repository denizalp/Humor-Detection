Did this place change hands or something?  This has always (for over a decade) been my go-to for a burger and a drink. I came in today and the woman cooking the burgers is as slow as can be - more interested in visiting with her buddies at the bar about personal stuff than actually doing her job and making some burgers. The drink tasted like an airline drink, not the usual quality that I have come to know. Seems like they are resting on their laurels and depending on increased business from new apartments and not providing the quality service, food and drink I've come to know. It's very disappointing.
