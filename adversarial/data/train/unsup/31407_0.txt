Aeropress of the day is excellent coffee.  This is really high quality stuff.  If you require cream and sugar, skip Pourquoi Pas; the subtleties of good coffee will be lost.  \n\nNice little shop, friendly staff, decent prices. A few people have said the best coffee ever, and while I don't agree, it is quite good.
