This cool place is located in the same shopping center as Barrio Queen.\nZinburger is an upscale burger joint offering a full bar and plenty of different burgers to choose from. \n\nMost burgers are in the $10 range for Angus Beef, Kobe Beef is available for an additional fee.  We started out with an order of Green Chili Fries which were outstanding!  The fries were extra crispy and the diced green chili's were amazing.  If you come to Zinburger, you had better order the Green Chili Fries!\n\nSince we were all impressed with the Green Chili Fries we naturally ordered a burger featuring green chili's!  The Diablo was a big Fail.  The burger was way to soft and pretty much fell apart when we bit into it.  Picture three grown men trying to eat their burgers with a knife and fork LOL.\n\nService was fair overall, a second order of fries arrived very late and only after we asked for them twice.  Hopefully Zinburger's other burgers are better than the Diablo, but the Green Chili Fries are worth a visit on their own merit.
