So I call in and ask if they have tofu. They say yes. I ask if it's cooked. They say yes. I ask for low mein with tofu on top. She said she couldn't do that. I asked for tofu on the side and just plain low mein, she said she couldn't do that. I had to twist her arm by asking the simple question \"are your cooks not competent enough to throw some tofu on top of some noodles?\" and she said they were, then she goes on to tell me that if we did that then it would cost 4 dollars more. 4 dollars for tofu. Tofu is cheaper than meat. I asked for the tofu extra crispy THEN she goes \"oh yeah we can't do that\" so I just asked her to have the cooks cook it longer than they normally do and she said they can't do that. If they literally can't do some really really basic simple stuff like that then that's sad. I hung up at that point and went to good china.
