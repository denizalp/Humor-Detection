The original location by my area in seven hills shut down but luckily I was excited t hear that they relocated by town square. \n\nThe restaurant is located in the outskirts of townsquare by las vegas blvd at the NE section of the shopping center.\n\nWe arrived just before dinner was starting and were seated in the dining area within a few seconds.  The waitress was complaining to the manager saying, \"really i have to do all these tables?\" This really irked me and literally made me want to leave but i figure i would at least try out the food and enjoy my company with my lady.\n\nInitial Service: The waitress wasn't very pleasing as she came to our table with this \"Why do i have to serve you\" sort of expression which continued to ruin my experience there.  Took about 15 minutes for our drinks to come out.  I got the bonefish martini which was actually pretty good and gave a decent buzz.  She got the fresh cucumber collins which was refreshing.  \n\nEntrees: We read all about the bang bang and we basically did a drive by.  We ordered bang bang tacos,  bang bang chicken and bang bang shrimp lmao.  Plus it was a good \"bang\" for the buck being $6 for each entree during happy hour on i think it was a wednesday?  The entrees were all very good but it was too much bang.  The sauce they use is like a spicy mayo with green onions.\n\nEnding:  I ordered another martini and noticed something shiny in my drink.  Thought it was a golden ticket for Wonka's chocolate factory but it was aluminum from a whisky top.  I reported this to the manager and he apologized by saying hes not sure how they got there but it must've been from the ice machine.  He ended up comping one of our bang bangs and getting me a new drink \"metal free.\"\n\nOverall:  Poor service with the waitress.  Great alcohol and good food. Check your ice cubes before you sip your drinks\n\n**Daily * 4pm - 6:30pm\n$1 off Draft Beer\nHalf-Price House Wine, Well & Select Spirits\n$5 Select Cocktails (all day, every day)\n\nSun - Thr  4pm - 6:30pm   \"Happier Hours\"\n$5 - $6 Appetizer Menu (see menu below)\n\nBang Wednesday \nWed  4p - close \n$5 Bang Bang Shrimp
