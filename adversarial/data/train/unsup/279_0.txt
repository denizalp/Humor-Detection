Get your grease on.  I love the food here not because it is quality but rather they excel in going all out into the greasy fake Americanized Chinese food.  Don't let the name fool you, this is not a pizza place, they serve Chinese food.\n\nI had the Lo Mein and the Fried Dumplings.  Both coated my entire mouth with a thick layer of oily grease goodness.\n\nThey cook the spare ribs too much for my taste.\n\nMy fellow enthusiasts had a garlic chicken dish and enjoyed it but then had a simultaneous stomach ache.  This is probably a fluke but if you have one let me know.
