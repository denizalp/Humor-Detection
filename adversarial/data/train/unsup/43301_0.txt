Man, I really love this place. Today was a crazy day at Metro Pizza. We got there at 2:30 right when happy hour started not many people inside my daughter ordered a kids meal individual cheese pizza with light sauce. Me and my son ordered a large Bleecker Street which came out in about 20 minutes before my kids pizza. Myself and my son finished our slices, and my kids pizza will still not out.   Our waitress came up with a crazy excuse of the pizza cook did not time it well. So me and my son were already finished with our slices of a large pizza and my little eight-year-old still waiting for her kids meal. When the kids meal pizza came out it had extra sauce on it, so we told the waitress and then had to make her another one. This is where they should've comped The kids meal and a manager should've come over and apologize for the mishap. They didn't do anything, and it was a really weird experience. Not the type of Service I expect at Metro Pizza. I frequent this place often, and this is the first time that something like this happened. The pizza is amazing. I believe the waitress forgot to turn in her order, or the the pizza chef just forgot to make it and she came up with some stupid excuse about his timing being off. I mean how can a large pizza come out 25 minutes before an individual child's pizza? And then when it comes out it has extra sauce instead of light sauce?? Today it seems like a lot of people who are working in the kitchen or just constantly talking and not paying much attention. We got there at 2:30 and there was really no one there, so truly no excuses   .
