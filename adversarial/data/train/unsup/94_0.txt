I'm 100% convinced that the only reason Pure Barre has less than 10 reviews as of now is because women are trying to make sure the classes don't get too full (which they never are, Sundays can get packed, but there's ample space in this studio). Seriously, this place is amazing! I was going to Barre Definitions initially, but my fiance encouraged me to try this studio because it was 1) closer 2) had more convenient class times 3) heard from a few folks that they got the best results from Pure Barre, compared to other Barre classes. I only wish I didn't have to travel out of town so often for work, otherwise I'd be here way more often! Barre classes are pricey in general, but I think if you find a studio that works for you and you go consistently, the money is worth it. One of my favorite things about Pure Barre is the round-back against the wall exercises and how they execute them are more deliberate and comfortable to be in than other methods I've tried. Apparatuses are frequently used and my heart rate gets pumping right away here. A lot of the directions are given verbally by the instructor, but there is usually another instructor in the class that you can look to as an example. I've loved all the instructors here so far and they are there to challenge and motivate you throughout the 55 minutes of class. \n\nMy favorite Pure Barre quotes would have to be:\n\n\"It's tank top season!\" - which I end up yelling at my fiance too when he works out at home\n\n\"The higher the heels, the thinner the thighs\"\n\nPicturing yourself in a bikini while you work out actually really, really motivates you to push harder and fight for that burn! I'm getting married next year and definitely will be relying on my Pure Barre practice to kick my butt into shape!
