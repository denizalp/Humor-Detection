I've been in here a couple of times now, and I fall more in love each time. I leave here feeling a longing to go right back. There's such an interesting variety of books, comics, and graphic novels cramped into the tiniest space I've ever experienced for a bookstore. It's a wonderful nook that makes me feel inspired just being there.\n\nWith that said, I recently found a few dirt-cheap novels from a British publishing company, as well as a pocket Rumi book. There's a few memoirs in graphic novel style that I am interested in too. There's always SOMETHING here that makes me excited to pick it up and read. \n\nNot only that, the people who work here are great.\n\nThe prices are great. Local bookshops have a hard time as it is, and Copacetic just doesn't price gouge, which I appreciate. \n\nThe only downside\/negative is that it's tedious for me to get here by bus. If it were any closer\/easier, I would be here ALL OF THE TIME. It's worthwhile to come buy a book\/comic or three, and head downstairs to Lili to sip on an amazing latte.
