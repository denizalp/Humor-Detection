The last review that I wrote was 3 years ago(I've been coming to this place for 6 years). I have had many experiences here at Via Brasil since then! \n\nFrom co-worker happy hours, girls nights, Halloween, Brazilian festivals, Brazilian meet ups, World Cup, family brunches, to rehearsal dinners, Via Brasil has been my place! \n\nOur rehearsal dinner which was amazing. The food was top notch and they were so accommodating for all 60 of my guests. (A few of my guests were actually rather annoying and demanding but the staff were very professional! Hahah) What we loved was the fact that they made coxinhas upon our request. (My now husband is Brazilian) I even had some vegetarians at my wedding rehearsal, they were more than satisfied! \n\nSince the AYCE rodizio, is not something I can always manage, I often do the a la cart happy hours . What other churrascarias in Vegas offers those?! Via Brasil is always putting new things on the menu so have tried a bunch of plates. if you read my last review you could probably tell that I LOVE the salginhos. Since then, I've updated my palate. I LOVE their salmon with passion fruit sauce and their risotto with chicken! Are you a vegetarian? No problem, order the asparagus risotto, you won't be disappointed!\n\nOh, and btw don't listen to that guy complaining about the staff getting after him about sharing a 'little piece of beef' with his wife.... We all know that it  had to be more than one piece of beef!!\n\nDon't listen to the haters!! Give Via Brasil a chance :)
