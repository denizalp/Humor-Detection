I dunno, but I really liked Della's Kitchen even if it's a few dollars overpriced.  In fact, I went all 3 days recently while attending a convention at Delano\/Mandalay Bay.  Since it's the only bonafide reasonable dining experience at the Delano Hotel (I don't count 3940 Coffee & Tea nor the ultra-nice 64th floor \"Rivea\"), it would be very nice if they would expand their hours and didn't close at 2pm or be ONLY Monday-Friday.  What about the hungry weekend warriors in Vegas?\n\nI tried a number of things during my recent trip:\n====================================\n1.  Fried Chicken & Waffles [$23, 4.5 stars] -- buttermilk-battered fried organic & free-range chicken breast, bacon, waffles -- topped with 100% delectable maple syrup with 100% satisfaction.\n\n2.  Chia Seed Pudding [$16, 4.5 stars] -- don't get excited as I did peeps, it's not really pudding, but for what it is, it's very good.  Chia seeds mixed into plain yogurt, housemade granola, berries and pomegranate seeds.  Nice and light for breaky.\n\n3.  Fresh Fruit Bowl [$17, 5.0 stars] -- a large mixed bowl of amazing fruit: strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, grapes, pineapple, cantaloupe, and honeydew.  Perfect.\n\nAll in all, I found the food very good:\n============================\nMy dining partners\/co-workers loved the burger and Croissant Breakfast Sandwich (scrambled eggs, bacon, cheddar), while only the Breakfast Burrito didn't make the cut due to the spinach being too watery and making the whole thing soggy (scrambled egg whites, mushrooms, asparagus, roasted peppers, spinach, and avocado).
