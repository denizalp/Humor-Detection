Cute cafeteria styled resto. They moved to this new location within the last year.  The converted church pew benches and colorful art add a sense of whimsy to the place. \n\nService is really prompt so great place to stop by if you're starving and gotta eat like yesterday!! \n\nHighly recommend trying the juices they're refreshing! \n\nFood: we order two beef arepas--the pabellón and the popular and the shark meat one to share. The waitress brings our three arepas each with a crispy watercress salad and for some reason I mistake the shark meat for the beef pabellon!! \n\nAll the while I'm munching on it, I'm totally confused cause shark meat tastes a bit like flaked tuna. It was a little bland so I drowned it in the avocado sauce. I kept thinking that it was a fishy tasting beef. Still couldn't figure it out! Lol\n\nThen we shared the pabellón (which I still thought was the shark one) and to my surprise I was soooooo good with the sweetness from the fried plantains, the saltines of the feta, the garlic from the black beans and the meat all married so well together.  You must absolutely try this one if you eat meat!!! \n\nSo finally I couldn't take it anymore, I show the waitress the photo of the shark arepas (which I still thought was the beef) and asked her if it was a wrong order to which she clarified that it was the shark arepas!!  I had eaten the shark one and shared the pabellon instead of visa versa!  Hence this is why we take photos of our food as Yelpers... It can help clarify mystery meat :P\n\nThe popular was quite good, cheesy. But I prefer the pabellon best! Must go back to try some more!
