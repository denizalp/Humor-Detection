If you value your time and mental health do not go to this practice. After being diagnosed with MS 9 months ago, I was referred to Dr. Travis. And although I'm sure the doctors are at the top of their profession, dealing with the office is not worth it. I only wish I was exaggerating that EVERY appointment, EVERY lab order and EVERY imagining order has been messed up. From not scheduling the appointments (you can't do it yourself), not submitting your orders to the facilities, referrals to specialists who no longer accept new patients and just flat out ordering the wrong tests. The staff is absolutely incompetent. The office phones shut off at 4 every day and you better believe that, if you are lucky enough to get a call back from an MA, they call you after 4 so you can't call them back. After merging with HonorHealth I was promised things would be better and staff would be better trained and although they did finally start answering the front desk phones, the MAs will not return your call or your facilities call when they screw up. Again, I'm sure all the doctors are fantastic as Dr. Travis has been great but to have a practice run so poorly is not worth your frustration. I have been brought to tears of anger due to the incompetence of the staff more than the unfortunate circumstance of being diagnosed with MS at 27. They have gone through 3 practice managers in my time with them and i can only imagine it's from complaints like these with a practice unwilling to change. I have my 6 month review this week and I cannot wait to gather my records and never look back.
