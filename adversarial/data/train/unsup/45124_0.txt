I love you, Trader Joe's!\n\nWhen I first found out I would be moving to Vegas\/Henderson, I saw there was a Trader Joe's and I knew it would all be alright. I basically live off Trader Joe's pre-packaged salads, salmon stuffed with dill & couscous, TJ's Bambino frozen pizzas, and TJ-brand beers. \n\nThis location is clean, bright, and well stocked. The employees are friendly and chatty and always greet you in the aisles with a smile and a little conversation. \n\nThey are community-minded and have been extremely generous in their donations to my school's charity projects. \n\nIt does get pretty crowded. Early in the day there are lots of older folks, while in the afternoon there are lots of parents with their kids. I have yet to find the sweet spot in terms of the ideal time to go. Early Sunday morning while everyone else is at church has turned out pretty well for me, but can also be pretty hit or miss, especially in the fall during football season!\n\nPro tip: island soyaki makes an excellent marinade for their barbecue-cut salmon fillets (with skin on). Broil in foil with some TJ's baby broccoli for a quick meal with very little cleanup involved. You don't even need a plate.
