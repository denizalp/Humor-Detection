Enjoyed this local restaurant twice. Carefully read all the reviews and we were a little cautious about trying Black and Bleu but glad we did. Our party of four tried both soups and declared them excellent. The sea bass was tender and flavorful, the steak bites melted in your mouth. My husband had the short ribs and loved them and the other gentleman in our group enjoyed the blackened pork chop. The restaurant agreeably swapped out vegetable offerings and made sure our water and iced tea were always filled. Definitely recommend this restaurant and suggest those who had a poor experience; give it a second try.
