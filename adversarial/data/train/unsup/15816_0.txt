The coolest part of TAO Nightclub are those bathtub girls by the entrance. \n\nThis is one of those clubs that I went to and will say \"Okay... Been there, done that.\" \n\nThere's 3 floors, but it's relatively small. I personally hated the room with all the Buddha in there. Kinda freaked me out when I was roaming the club drunk. Music was good, but the biggest problem with this club is that IT'S TOO CROWDED. \n\nI guess you should come here just to say you have been to TAO before, but I can definitely think of other spots I can party at in Vegas without feeling like a canned sardine.
