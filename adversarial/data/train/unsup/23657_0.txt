All you have to know about this place:  BEST BUTTERCREAM FROSTING EVER.  Yes, I do have to shout, thank you for asking.\nThe shop is located in the heart of downtown Madison...it's tiny and it's perfect.  The cupcake I tried was awesome (and no, I was not still drunk from the game thankyouverymuch), the staff is funny and friendly, and the other treats they make are pretty cool too (insult truffles, anyone?).  Next time I'm in Madison, you bet I will be stopping in.
