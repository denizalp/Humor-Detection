I got some print-making supplies on a Groupon.  I thought the staff person seemed nice and helpful enough.  I can't speak for the other sections, but they had a good selection of linoleum blocks and inks for print-making.  My main complaint is that the prices in-store didn't match the discounted prices shown on their website.  Maybe this is too much griping since I did have a discount already, but it was rather confusing after seeing the online prices.  On the plus side, they do offer a student discount (I think I heard 20-ish percent) as well as having other big sales during the year (usually there's a sign out front), so I'll probably continue buying supplies from them.
