\"The worst massage ever\". The receptionist was very rude. The massage therapist was so unprofessional. His phone rang, and he picked up and was talking on the phone while giving me a massage. I asked if he could turn it off. Then the phone rang again the second time and he picked it up again. I got up and asked him to turn it off. He said he will. It rang again the 3rd and 4th time and both times he answered the call and talked while giving me a massage. I was upset and he told me that I need to wait because he was busy! I got up and could not believe that I was more stress leaving this place than when I got there! I had a VERY BAD experience here. I do not recommend!
