My first time @ the Bellagio Buffet was pretty good, but this time was so disappointing!.  Favourite is still the Wynn, but Bellagio is cheaper (only $19.99 for lunch--and get here before 4pm and you get dinner which includes king crab legs).  \n\nThe king crab legs were so freezing cold and salty it was disgusting. No warm, melted butter either!  Our server only came by ONCE to refill my orange juice (which is pretty good btw), and that's only after I pretty much had to BEG for it.  It wasn't that busy either.  You can do better.  If you are looking for something on the strip and want to splurge go WYNN.  Otherwise middle of the road is the Spice Buffet @ Planet Hollywood (you can do their $49.99 24 hour thing, or just print the $5 off coupon on destinationcoupons.com--valid for any meal so great deal!).  If you want true value hit up the Paradise Buffet on Fremont!!! Half the price and way more satisfying!  \n\nAnd oh yeah, their creme caramel sucked!! How do you screw that up?
