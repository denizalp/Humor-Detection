Solid hibachi restaurant with super friendly staff and service. Food comes fast, tastes good, isn't as greasy as other hibachi places I've been to, and very reasonably priced, especially for lunch. It was also family friendly, and I could not believe how accommodating they were to my baby! Would definitely come again and again.
