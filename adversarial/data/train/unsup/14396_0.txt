Standard independent coffee house, appreciate that there is a drive thru but the complaints about timing are why I went in for my beverage- was in and out in under three minutes, large iced chai latte in hand.\n\nI like that their house chai is a vanilla blend, saving me the hassle of adding flavoring (and calories). Menu has several breakfast sandwich options and they have several roasts to pick from if you like your morning brew strong and black.\n\nLocation is slightly messy in a lived-in way that is comfortable rather than chaotic. They have a whole wall of bookshelves filled with used tomes to browse, which is a nice touch. Service was friendly despite the morning rush.
