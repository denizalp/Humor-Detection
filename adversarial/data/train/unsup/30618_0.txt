The perpetual Yelp dilemna, find a new place with good food, want to share it enough to stay in business but not bring so much attention that it gets overrun....\n\nTired of the hassle of the Danforth when looking for good traditional Greek food?  How about free parking and no lines (at least as long we keep it quiet....)....then this is the place for you...\n\nThis comfortable 30 seat location is simply decorated but that keeps the focus on the food, another one of those times when its too bad that Yelp doesn't allow for rating of food and service separately, the food was quite good, particularly the appetizers (dip combo, dolmades and spanakopita this time out) while the service needed some help, giving the benefit of the doubt on the latter though, as we showed up on their third day of business so hopefully it improves.  Mostly simple things like clearing the table and keeping the water glasses filled.\n\nSince we live just a couple blocks away we'll definitely be back, hopefully with the need to upgrade the rating.  Are we giving up on Greektown as a result? Not a chance, there are a few places there with better food and service, but most certainly an appreciated addition to the area.
