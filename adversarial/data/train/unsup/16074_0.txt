Wow!  Where else can you get a breakfast with a view like small engine planes coming in and taking off? \n\nThe menu is nothing short of a delicious surprised. \n\nI'm not sure if this was proper but I helped myself to coffee and cookies in the lounge waiting area as we waited for a window seat. \n\nThe service was okay,  could have been more attentive but still friendly enough. \n\nI ordered the crab cake Benedict's and eee disappointed that it was imitation crab. I guess what did I expect for $9? Too good to be true. However,  the eggs were fluffy,  cooked to perfection. It came with the option of hashbrowns or fruit. \n\nThe sausage scrabble was very well received by both parties that ordered it. Generous beef of hashbrowns were topped with diced mixes of sausage,  green peppers,  onions,  and fluffy eggs. Served with a side of toast. \n\nThe special omelette of the day was a chili, also very well received with choice of hash browns or fruit. \n\nThe total bill with tip was about $50. Great deal for such an memorable dining experience.
