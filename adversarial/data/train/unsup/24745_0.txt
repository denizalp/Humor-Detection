Katrina welcomed me as I came in the door. I've always felt the employees at this location are really a great group of people. Cheerful, helpful with good attitudes. Kudos to Don and his team.\nI had an hour before a meeting so I stopped in for a Breakfast Burrito ($2.65). I opted for the Chicken variety. The burrito was filled with scrambled eggs, chunks of chicken, diced onions and peppers. This is a decent breakfast burrito for sure. I sat at a high top near the cashiers and got the opportunity to listen to a lot of the interactions between the staff and the customers and the staff among themselves. It was definitely a pleasant environment.\nClean dining room. Good Breakfast Burrito. Great Staff. Prices... ehh. 4 Stars.
