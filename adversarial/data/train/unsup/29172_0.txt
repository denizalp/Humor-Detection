Like others have noted - this place is full of suits on any weekday. I happened to be one of the suits hanging out here on a weekday for lunch, and my experience was a wholly positive one.\n\nThe hostesses (yes, all female) are efficient and professional. Despite the other reviews, I found all the service staff modestly dressed and highly courteous; this certainly isn't a seedy sports bar.\n\nMy sirloin was done perfectly to medium rare. The sides, however, were a bit lacking - the string beans were bland and the fries tasted suspiciously of the McCain variety. All in all, however, the meat was a winner - and ultimately, that's the point of eating at the Keg anyways.\n\nMake reservations if you want to be seated inside for a weekday lunch. There's first come first served seating in the bar area and on the patio, if that's more of your thing. Note that there are two entrances, so confirm with you're party which one you're going to meet at!
