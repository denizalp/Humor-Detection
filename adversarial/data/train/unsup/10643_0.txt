Never been before..... Will be back\nI went with a In and Out veteran who helped me thought the written menu and the \"secret\" menu.\nMy double double animal style with extra crispy fries was excellent. You can also get sides of their sauce in squeeze packs.\nWe did the drive thru which was a bit of a line, but it moved.\nAll fresh and tasty , thank goodness they are not back in Michigan
