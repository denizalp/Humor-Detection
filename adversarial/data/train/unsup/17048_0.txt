If I could package a smell from any place in Toronto, this might be the one I'd choose.  (Least likely candidate: Dundas\/Spadina, but I digress).\nCinnamon buns are delicious, just the right amount of sugar, not gooped with icing like those chain places you find in a mall, and the cupcakes have an almost shortbread-like flavour to them.  Homemade granola is also very good.  Owners are always gracious, friendly. Stopping in here at least once per weekend is pretty much a weekend ritual that I must observe.  Highly recommend.
