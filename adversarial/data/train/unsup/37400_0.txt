Well, they have 70 flavors of popcorn and you can get a 3oz serving (which is just enough for a flick) for only about $2-$3 bucks. The popcorn is in Giant buckets behind the counter, so I'm not exactly sure how long it sits there before they make another batch. Only sampled cinnamon and loaded baked potato and the potato was better among those two choices. Ended up with the Vermont White Cheddar which is a pretty normal flavor today in the popcorn world and it had too many crumbs in the small bag  Will have to try some exotic flavors next time like banana or watermelon or salt and vinegar.
