I stumbled in here randomly  when another place in the plaza was closed and I wasn't sure what I wanted for dinner.. and I'm SO glad I did! They are very friendly here and greet you as soon as you come in and when you leave. The food also arrives quickly. \n\nSince I always start with the tofu salad, I'll start my review with it: LOVE. I love it. I am not a fan of salads at all, but I will eat this.. I think it's because of the sesame based dressing... MMMMMMmmm.\n\nMy personal favorite here is the spinach & egg curry -- occasionally I will add corn or cheese if I'm feeling a little hungry. There just isn't much I can really say about how amazing this curry is ... you just have to try it and see for yourself! It's not anything like Indian curry.. I would say the consistency is more like gravy. It really does sounds boring and even looks kind of weird, but I assure you the flavor is anything but that. My boyfriend and I joke about how cheap a dish of curry here is, but since he loves to add all the extra options (pork katsu, chicken katsu, sausage, etc), the entree can easily become pricey (but it's okay because it's still delicious).\n\nI love spicy foods, but for some reason I prefer the curry here non-spicy. My boyfriend on the other hand always orders at least an 8\/10. I have ordered the 5\/10 before and I would say that is VERY spicy (and I can handle spicy...). A little weird tidbit-- they charge you an extra 80 cents if you order more than a 5 on the spiciness scale (1-10). So if you want a spicy level of 6\/10.. just go for the 5 .. or make it worth it and get a 8 or 9.. or 10! \n\nI am super happy that they took over the location next door and expanded the place. It used to be tiny and really wasn't big enough for more than 20 people at once.. which was common!
