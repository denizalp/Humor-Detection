This was our first buffet stop in Vegas. We ate here mainly because we were staying at Paris and my friend, J, raved about their breakfast offerings. The wait can seem like an eternity if you're trying to get in before your 24 hour wristbands expire but in reality we waited 20 minutes on a Thursday am and 30 on Friday. We were told by the cashier if we had their Player's Club card we could have had $10 knocked off our wristband price.\nI loved the small village ambiance that continued all the way into each dinning area. Both our servers each morning were quick with the drinks and a shout out to our second server who tried her best to locate a keno runner from Bally's for me to place a bet. As for the actual food a must is the rosemary potatoes, eggs Benedict and varieties of sausages from a group consensus. I personally liked the loxs and bagels. The salmon was fresh and there was still tons of it even though we were close to lunch time. I almost never get it and filled up on it like this was my last meal. Oh and if possible try to sit on the outside of buffet seating. People watching is great fun and I actually felt like I was at a small French caf√© instead of inside a money gobbling casino.
