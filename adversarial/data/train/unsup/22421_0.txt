After a miscommunication, I re-booked an appointment to redeem a Groupon that I purchased for eyebrow threading. I had asked if my mother could come with me into the room, as she's never seen the procedure done before. The esthetician said no, the procedure is private...but then left the door open. \n\nI hopped up onto the chair, and then she asked if I was pregnant. I am 100% not pregnant. No apology, nothing. She then had me hold my eyebrow taut while she worked. The whole thing took about 6 minutes. She then informed me while still in the treatment room that I had to pay $2.60 tax. The treatment value is $18, so I am not sure where $2.60 comes from. But what are you going to say to a woman who has already shown she is OK about asking you insulting questions?
