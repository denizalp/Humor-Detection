It's my own fault for coming back to this raper. \n\nTypical story, went in for an oil change\/car wash after recently having my car at a mechanics who assured me all my fluids were good. I could barely understand the mumbler that told me I needed brake fluid, transmission fluid, air filter, and some other filter. No thanks. Just the oil.\n\nHe came back with a bill for $98?? He charged me for gas. I didn't get gas. It took 20 minutes to get it sorted out. I was there almost two hours. Car wasn't clean. (Do they really vacuum?!!!)\n\nWill I ever learn?
