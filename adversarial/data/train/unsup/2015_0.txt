Attractions like this are part of the charm of Vegas that you rarely find anywhere else. Whether you're 7 or 70, the Bellagio Conservatory + Botanical Gardens is a must-see pit stop when you're in Vegas. Why? Because it's one of the most if not THE most lovely garden display you'll ever see in your life + it's FREE! \n\nEver changing, each season is newly decorated with bright + beautiful flowers, statues, towering structures + lighting fixtures that truly make the space come to life. Coming here never gets old as each visit leads to a unique surprise of how the designers outdid themselves each time. \n\nAnd, of course, make sure to bring your camera so that you can join all the other tourists in taking zillions of pretty pictures \n\nHere's a few examples from some of my past trips of how the gardens change at different times of year: \n\nChinese New Year: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/YzlgswAwmpkMQifS3-YQTw?select=Cb00Bmdy5aKt2qvQS3YZww\nComplete with a gazebo + a giant buddha!\n\nSpringtime: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/YzlgswAwmpkMQifS3-YQTw?select=bqb_IcQblxLWIUGAHf39bQ\nIncluding a butterfly house with real butterflies!\n \nAutumn Harvest: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/YzlgswAwmpkMQifS3-YQTw?select=G5r90A-LkA4c_GM8vZpyug\nGiant pumpkins!!!\n \nChristmas: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/YzlgswAwmpkMQifS3-YQTw?select=oFZQTSvxhUblR7gclVQHAQ\nAnimated penguins! \n\n\nConveniently located right between the parking lot entrance + the Bellagio's front desk, it's only natural to take a peek in while venturing the Strip no matter what time of day or evening. I've found that the best time to come without having to deal with crowds of other people bumping into you or accidentally walking into your photo is in the wee hours of the early morning... aka when everyone else is asleep except for those who never went to sleep.  ;)
