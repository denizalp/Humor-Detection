I'm convinced this is the planet Lady Gaga is from.\n\nWhat a show! I've only seen two shows in vegas and this was the second and boy was it... sexual. There is no holding back in here, no topic is off limits and the end of the show leaves you very... satisfied.\n\nI went in not knowing what to really expect besides nudity and crazy acrobatics but it turned out being pretty damn funny too. There is a lot of audience participation and the show definitely ends with a \"bang\" haha.\n\nAfter leaving the show sex was definitely in the air... While waiting in line to buy a drink at a bar close to the theater entrance some random drunk chick walked up to me and asked if she could lick my face. I mean, I'm not gonna NOT let some chick lick my face, it is Vegas. That quickly turned into a zumanity style kiss that tasted like a strawberry daiquiri.\n\nFellas, I guess the pro tip would be if you're not going to see the show, chill by the bar near the show and wait for all the drunk and sexually excited women to swarm out.\n\nGotta love Vegas.
