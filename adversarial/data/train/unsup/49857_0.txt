We showed up for taco Tuesday only for them to tell us that they no longer do taco Tuesday. We live very close and were extremely disappointed to hear this. We were there last week and they had the special!! The worst part is, they still have the fact that that do taco Tuesday on their website.. WOW what kind of false advertising is that?
