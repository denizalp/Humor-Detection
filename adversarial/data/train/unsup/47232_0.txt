We went here on Saturday night because the wait at The Mission was nearing 2 hours and Cielo could seat us right away.  We were initially put off by the lack of patrons (read: the place was dead) but all of that faded away when we took the first bite of food.  Yummy!  We ordered the octupus appetizer, tagliatelle (spelling?) pasta and duck for an entree.  Delicious!  Actually beyond delicious.  My husband and I are well-traveled foodies and this place, in spite of it's bland decor, is worth a second visit!\n\nOur waiter informed us that the hotel has new ownership and that the restaurant would be getting remodeled, as well.  Honestly, all the place needs is a good promoter (who would likely suggest they do something about the 80's soft rock that was playing overhead...hello... and hire some folks to fill the place up and give it a little buzz).  There is ample free parking, outdoor seating, and excellent food.  Oh-- and dinner for 2 with wine and dessert cost us less than $100 with tip.  A worthwhile date night indeed.
