TL;DR The ol' YIKES & Avoid! Their open kitchen is a lie and a front to the hideousness of flavours and portions that made me regret every bite.\n\nFood (-1\/0)\nOh boy. What like $17 for a sad looking dry burger and chewy old bread??? The veal kidneys were sO HORRID my boys have you ever heard of cleaning organs??? GOOGLE IT. \n\nAny organ lover would know any sort of organ should not taste the stereotypical horridly spoiled taste of organ meat. Because let me tell you, whether it be lungs, liver, intestines, gizzards, or even KIDNEYS, THEY SHOULD NOT TASTE LIKE THEYRE ON THE VERGE OF DEATH!\n\nTheir only wierdly redeeming factor was the fish of the day Salmon on herb butter and grains.\n\nBUT DONT LET THAT FOOL YOU BECAUSE THAT JUST MEANS ALL THEIR MENU ITEMS ARE TERRRRRRIBLE! I bet their normal menu food stuff sits in their fridge sulking and spoiling.\n\nTheir desserts are 200% sugar flavoured.\n\nAtmosphere (2\/5*)\nFamily style restaurant??? With an open kitchen. Has a seperate basement section that can seat about 15-20 more people if their patio and front seating isn't enough. \n\nAvoid that death trap basement though, service is wierd down there as they only come down when they want to.\n\nService (-9000\/0)\nI don't even want to start. They're all old ladies with tempers and impatience. \n\nThey won't let you order ahead of time if you're in a party. \n\nTHEY ENFORCE 18% GRATUITY EVEN WHEN THEYRE LIKE, \"btw guise we have no 18% gratuity haha ecksdee xD\" \n\nDONT LISTEN TO THEM ITS A SHAM.\n\nThey watch you like VULTURES ready to GOUGE and TEAR and GOUGE and TEAR if you don't pay them their damn tip.\n\nThey want to rip your throats out regardless though because they're always so ANGRY AND MEAN like think, old asian gran who's granchild wasn't born a piano prodigy with no skills shown by the age of 3 months.\n\nGod I felt terrible mentally and physically.\n\nGet me out of here this meal was so exhausting and so was their review. Thinking about my experience here is exhausting.
