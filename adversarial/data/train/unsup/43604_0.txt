In a nutshell:\n\nShabby interior and very tiny for a \"fine dining\" experience. \n\nAppetizers: Ordered the mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto. 4 TINY mushrooms with a filling and wrapped in overly cooked prosciutto. Served with a tasty \"cheese sauce\" but the proportions are WAY off.  $9???.....Mussels. Served the \"French\" way. Too much wine in the sauce that hadn't been reduced and mussels tasted like rubber. This is Cooking 101.  I think I got a great buzz though just from the mussels!\n\nEntree: Lamb and Waffles. Seriously??? Lamb was good. I'd give it a 7. But the sauce with the waffles is simply tasteless. In more ways than one. Overly cooked Risotto had burned chorizo on top. $32? Really? \n\nTo finish: Puff pastry filled with Cheese and 2 Blackberries served with Spicy Chocolate sauce. I could drink the chocolate sauce--it was that good. The puff pastry didn't have much filling though.\n\nNot sure if we will return. Maybe to try the Pizza? \n\nWaiter: Awesome!
