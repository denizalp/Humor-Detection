We've been coming to Yuk Yuk's for comedy shows for a few months now and keep coming back for the laughs. As others have already mentioned, the comedy club is located on the second floor of the Elbow River casino. There is also a window for buying tickets or picking up your tickets in the back of the casino (on the main floor). The price of tickets varies depending on the act, but it pretty much always ends up being well worth it for a fun night out. \n\nWalking into Yuk Yuks, you are greeted at the entry and seated based on your preference (closeness to the stage) and availability. There are booths located on the perimeter of the venue but those are reserved for Yuk Yuks ticket winners (Protip: you can win those by listening to the morning show on the comedy radio station in Calgary - Funny 1060 AM) but the majority of seating for regular ticket holders are long tables.\n\nYuk Yuk's Calgary only offers snack items and this likely works in the clubs favor to be able to pump out the offerings on the small menu quickly. Others have mentioned their thoughts on skipping the food and the limited menu, but to be honest, most times we've went here we have ordered some bites. The nachos are a classic, though our favorite lately has been the meatballs with buffalo sauce - perfect with a few beers. The service has always been friendly and fast, the odd time we've had to get the servers attention before she's had a chance to come over to our table. \n\nBottom line is that heading to Yuk Yuk's is a sure thing for a great night out. Can't comment on the comedians as they're always different, but we know that we'll get the same great service and cozy atmosphere at the the club. I say check it out!
