I went here after eating at Earl's and this was my first time going to Sugar.  I love the setup--nice and clean, white walls and loads of good candies from chocolates to lollies.  I wanted to buy their signature lollies and i did--the pussycat dolls lollipop and 2 refills of cherry and orange cream.  \n\nThey serve gelato, which is great and the even have cute cupcakes for sale!  They serve their own drink mixes, teas, and coffee, so give it all a try at least once.  It's worth it.\n\nI love being a kid in a candy store, and now there's a candy store for adults.  From candy bras to GIANORMOUS old-fashioned lollies and their signature lollipops, they have many things for any occassion.\n\nTip: they are open till 3am so stop by late at night and get your sugar fix!  Oh, and the signature lollipop collection runs $25 or more each and usually is great if you're going out clubbing or partying to show off.  I bought one.  Hell--you should get one at least once in your life! Also, sample their gelato even if you don't have cash.  it's free and you can sample as much as you want, if you want.\n\nHave fun yelpers!
