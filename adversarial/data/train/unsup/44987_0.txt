Beware!\n\nI have eaten here a few times over the past couple of months. Holiday dinner, birthday dinner and took some friends from out of town here.\n\nEverytime I went, the wine was offered to us at 1\/3 off. But when the bill came, the discount wasn't included. Mistakes happen, but after the third time, it makes you go hmmmmmmmmmm. \n\nIt is a shame because the food is excellent, but the billing error left a sour taste in my mouth.
