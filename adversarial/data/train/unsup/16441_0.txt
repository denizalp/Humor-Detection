Again, upon Adam Richman's heels...  \n\nAs a continued fan of \"Man vs Food\" and after having bookmarked a few of Adam's noted, Phoenician eateries--Chompie's, Alice Cooper'stown, and Los Reyes de la Torta--I saddled up, traversed over 350 sun-scorched miles, and with extreme prejudice negotiated terms of surrender with a literal powerhouse of a Mexican sandwich--one piled high, layered thick, and respectfully ordained \"Del Rey.\"\n\nÂ¡Muy delicioso!  Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, hot dogs, omelet, chorizo, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce: all hail the King!  Ok, it's true, I may be a bit biased--after all, who am I to contradict Adam?--but unwavering confidence and grandeur shoulder this reigning torta.  My job, put simply: tossing confetti.  How am I doing?  =]\n\nThe rundown:  http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7KjOMCauQYI.  (By the way, I visited the West Indian School Rd. location, while Adam opted northward to Sunnyslope's haunt on North 7th St.)\n\nWhat was even better was being treated like kings, ourselves, while we were there.  We really were.  The service was supreme!  My only regret was not taking a picture of the Elvis statue in the window!  Yes, the King himself.  But I'll get it next time.  Trust me.\n\nAdam...lead on!
