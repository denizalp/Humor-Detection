I ordered your classic new York strip steak. Asked for medium rare and in return got medium well. After my food got dropped off my waiter did not check up on me until I was almost done eating. It was not busy. From what I saw, they had a good handful of tables. Beside the negativity, the front of the house staff was very friendly.
