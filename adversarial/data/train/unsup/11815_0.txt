I came to Trapeze U having never had the desire to do any aerial... anything. A group of us went together and learned from the ground up (literally) some basic moves and by the end of the lesson a few hours later, we were all climbing, jumping, flipping, and flying like pros. Instructors are professional and patient and not only tell you how to perform moves one step at a time, but they explain to you they whys and hows of each move. I enjoyed it so much we are planning to return soon! This is great for parties, groups of friends hanging out, athletes who are looking for something a little bit out of the ordinary, and anyone who wants to try something new and fun!
