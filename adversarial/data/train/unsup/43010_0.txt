Placed and order to send flowers to my wife as a surprise the day of our wedding.  Pink Twig assured me that they would be delivered before noon.\n\nThe flowers were not delivered before noon.  I called after they missed the delivery time and was assured they were out for delivery and that they would be arriving momentarily.\n\n2 more follow ups calls were made on my end before they updated me with the news that there was a death in the family of the courier company and that they were short staffed, also that the flowers would not get there until 3 or 4pm when there would no longer be anyone at the delivery address.  If they had let me know earlier in the day before the flowers were scheduled to be delivered I would have understood.  I take issue with the fact that none of this was communicated earlier.\n\nA disappointing result on such an important day.  I would not count on Pink Twig for any important occasions.
