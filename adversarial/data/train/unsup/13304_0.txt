A few weeks ago I booked a new patient appointment here per a referral from my women's doctor. \n\n1 star for wasting half of my day by booking an appointment without bothering to confirm my insurance info. I took off early from work also sacrificing a half of days pay so I could have an afternoon appt. at 1:15. I specifically asked when I booked if they needed to know my insurance info now and I would send them all my new patient paperwork. \n\nGuy: okay ma'am, you are all set for December 31st at 1:15 pm. \nMe: thank you for your help; should I send you my insurance and new patient paperwork now so you'll have it all set up for me when I arrive?\nGuy: no that won't be necessary, just print from website, full out to have with you on arrival and we will get your insurance info at that time. \nMe: okay thank you. \n\nNow he had ample opportunity to ask me who I was covered with. Did he take the extra step to do that? I was pretty surprised they didn't ask me for the info in the 1st place as anytime I have ever booked a doctor appointment with any kind of specialist, I have always been asked who my insurance was. \n\nSo when I arrive today I tell my name to the gal at the desk (who had a diaper bag on the front counter and a baby in her lap by the way; that's super professional), and that's it she ends up scooting away in her rolly chair and asks someone else to take care of me. Uhhhh okay.... Another gal comes over and I tell her my name AGAIN, and then hand over my stuff including ID and insurance card I get an \"ohhhh\" followed by me giving a concerned look to receptionist.\n\nGal: we don't take your insurance, it's an HMO. \nMe: well why would my doctor refer me to someone who doesn't take my insurance?\nGal: I am not sure but let me make a quick check with someone to see if I am wrong (at least she went a little above and beyond here, kudos for that). \n(About a minute passes)\nGal: Yes, we do not take your insurance but we can still see you today; it'll be anywhere from $60-150 for just a consultation, any procedures would be extra. \nMe: why wouldn't they ask me who I was insured with when I booked the appointment so this could have been avoided? \nGal: I don't know (insert shoulder shrug) \nMe: no thanks that's alright I can't afford that out of pocket. Please give me back my paperwork. \n\nThe I left. Soon as I sat back in my car I immediately called my doctors office to chew someone's a** for referring me to somewhere that doesn't accept my insurance. They clearly saw what insurance I had when I was there. Wtf would you do that for? \n\nMaybe I should have asked both offices but seriously why do I have to do someone's job for them? \n\nThe office was beautifully decorated though, nice ambiance. I guess I won't be back here ever unless I can pull some money from my back end or I get an insurer they accept.
