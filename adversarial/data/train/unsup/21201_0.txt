Big big ruth's cris fan here. Swear the butter has crack in it to get you back! But unfortunately, dont think I will. Was a regular but the food quality has fallen off or I'm spoiled from City hall. \n\nCame for thanksgiving with the family. My filet was not centered cut which I explained what I wanted from the beginning, lobster mac and cheese wasn't good at all and the 3 course turkey meal wasn't impressed by 2 of my family members. Again, it was decent food but for the price, you can do better\n\nI recommend City hall - regular there now (go almost once a week). Ive never had a bad experience or meal (plus they have buttercake)
