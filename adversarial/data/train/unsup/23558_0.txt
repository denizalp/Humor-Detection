I've been to Lebowski's only one time since I moved to Charlotte. It was GREAT. \n\nWe were looking around the ole internets for some good trivia in the area and we found Lebowski's consistently making people's lists towards the top of the ranks. We decided to give it a shot.\n\nWe called ahead to get a reservation on Tuesday night with no trouble at all. As soon as we got there, they cleared a table for our group and sat us no problem! The menu had a bunch of things that looked tasty, which is always nice because you can get something and still want to come back to try some other things! There were a few specials on drinks (beer under $3, $4 white Russians) and some on food, too.\n\nI opted to go with the *award winning* wings and was not disappointed! They were great. Not too spicy, but sauced up enough and crunchy. I got a side of pasta salad and although I'm not a huge fan of olives, the pasta and peppers part was delicious. \n\nOn to the trivia! My friends and I from DC played a lot of trivia up there, and really wanted to find a good spot in Charlotte. We nailed it on our first try. I forgot the dude's name who does the questions and answers there, but he was fantastic. It went at a good pace, and didn't last way too long like I've seen some trivias before. \n\nBottom line, if you're looking for a good trivia outing and some good food to accompany, Lebowski's is your place!
