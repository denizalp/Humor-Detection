DISCLAIMER: I love Panera like Scooby loves Scooby Snacks so I might be a bit biased. \n\nAfter a long day of catching villans dressed up as giant electric eels in order to scare off folks who might discover the giant vein of gold ore running a scant few inches underneath Old Man Jenkins' property nothing beats going to Panera and unwinding with a nice cup of coffee and a Frontega Chicken Sandwhich.
