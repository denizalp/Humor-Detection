My boyfriend brought me here instead of my usual computer place and I'm glad he did ! This I will forever be my go-to whenever I need to get my computer fixed again !!!! \n\nI came in and it was pretty busy, but they let us know they acknowledged us and told us to set it up so we can show them the problem. They were very friendly and informative about what the problems may be. So then I just signed the papers and they said they'll call me when it was ready.\n\nThey called the next day and let me know that it was ready to be picked up. I missed their call, but I'm glad they left a voicemail. I went back and my laptop was as good as new ! They didn't make me feel like I had to buy unnecessary apps or accessories & went straight to the point. They really do care about their customers.\n\nThe total came out to be $80 before the discount, so I only paid $71.10 for everything. Which I think was a steal bcs he added a lot of apps for free ! He included ALL of the Microsoft apps (like Word, Excel, Publisher, etc.) which values WAY MORE than what I paid. Also he added 2 programs that cleans my computer AND an anti-virus spyware !!!!! THATS AMAZING ! They really really really really care and I'm so happy with their service (: I got my money's worth and extras ! \n\nI HIGHLY, MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND (:
