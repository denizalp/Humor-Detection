We do not come here as often as we should : )\nLunch after the movies.\nDaughter got macaroni and cheese, hubby some sort of chicken wrap, and I got the BLT with avocado. We were all very pleased : )\nService was good, and my sandwich came with a cute cup of soup: Chicken stew with chipotle : )\nService was good.
