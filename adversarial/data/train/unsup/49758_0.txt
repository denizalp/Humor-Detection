Steve's is in my Baseline & Guadalupe neighborhood, and I have come to rely on their ultra smooth french press coffee.  A mellow coffeehouse that isn't packed with hipsters who stand around outside smoking.   Wonderful place for actually reading.  A great independent Tempe business...  don't go to Starbucks in Tempe when you have so many other choices.
