Fat Ninja Bite has been on my hit list for a very long time! I've seen lots of photos posted of delicious looking (and huge) food, I've read the reviews, and I've seen friends checking in on Yelp and FB. I've even had friends tell me that I should go but never understood why they just didn't invite me. Hmmm, friends? I even came here once, only to discover that they didn't open on Tuesdays. They do now!\n\nFirst of all, the very friendly and welcoming staff greeted me very enthusiastically as soon as I stepped in. I thought it was just me but they greeted everybody that way. They were very engaging during my entire visit.\n\nJK, a regular visitor here, ordered for us. We had the Chicken Katsu (dark meat) burger and an order of Takoyaki (octopus). Later, we had some delicious Taro chips and purple Taro ice cream, something new for me. It was all quite yummy!\n\nThe chicken was so deliciously tender and the breading was extra crunchy, making for a wonderful contrast. I heard they make their own breadcrumbs from bread made specially for this purpose. Hey, whatever they're doing, I'm a believer!\n\nThe takoyaki, not something I would normally order, was good but could have been crisper. It had good flavour.\n\nThe taro chips were really nice but I guess I had a quota because JK took them home. At least she allowed me to eat most of the ice cream.\n\nI'll definitely come back. And bring more friends.
