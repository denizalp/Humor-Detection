50mins to receive two orders of ramen and 1.5hrs to be served sushi is ridiculous. What's more ridiculous is the fact that we actually waited patiently all that time. This place has gone down hill since being taken over by new owners. A long wait is the norm here but that was only worth it as loyal customers to the original owners. \n\nTo speak to the food quality...The noodles in the ramen were over cooked, soggy and had absorbed the over salty broth, turning the noodles the bronze color of the broth. The bamboo shoot in the ramen was also soggy as if the entire bowl of ramen had been sitting for 30min before serving it to us. I would have thought this was the case but the broth was very hot when served. \n\nThe previous owners kept the Japanese tradition of high quality and great attention to detail. It was obvious that they cared deeply about sharing their Japanese heritage with the community. Now, it's just becoming the run of the mill Japanese restaurant like every other in town. Eventually fading into the sea of Asian restaurants before closing its doors for good.
