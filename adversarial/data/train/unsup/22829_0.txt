My only gripe is they didn't have salt bagels (and it isn't my gripe, it is my husband's).  The coffee was hot and delicious, and he put almond milk in for free.  Most places charge you which is rude, but the counter attendant obliged with no issue!  \n\nIt is honestly a great place to get a light breakfast for $4, which is what we were after.  Nothing frilly, nothing gourmet, but good.  \n\nNOTE: it is next to a bail bonds place in what appears to be an office building.  We had an issue following the directions because it looked like we were there but we couldn't find it.  Maybe because we are stupid?  But maybe you are too...
