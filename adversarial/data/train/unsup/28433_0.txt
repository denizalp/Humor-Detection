Joined back in July.  Facility of always clean and machines work as they should.  Sometimes you see a machine out of order but not for long.  Classes fill up pretty quick so you have to get there early.  Staff is friendly, they always greet you, smile, and ask if you need anything.  The overall vibe is positive, everyone that goes to MSF seems cool, not judgmental or rude.  My teenagers also enjoy going.  We don't use the child care so no experience there.  Steam room is always working, that's a plus.  We pay $99 for a family of 4, which isn't horrible.  Overall, it's a good family gym.
