Had my first meeting yesterday with Jane for a consultation and a facial for my stubborn acne. Originally was brought to this location due to their acne and sensitive skin care specialty.\n\nJane is super nice, upbeat, and knowledgeable. She works with hyper frequency devices that obliterates all the nasty stuff in your pores, medical grade LED treatments, as well as professional grade  products that can be a tad pricey for the larger bottles.\n\nI was recommended the 302 skincare line, and the face reality line. The day of the facial, my skin was tight, clean, and it felt great! The next few days it felt just as great and even more clear if I may add. Although, I'm only on day two of the process, I put my trust in Jane and the recommended products, I will be visiting every two weeks for a facial while using the recommended products at home. \n\nI'm looking forward to this process, I definitely will be placing and updated review.
