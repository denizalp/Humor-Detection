I was very skeptical of this place. Everyone raved about it. See the chandelier, they said. Eat the secret pizza, they said. I've been burned by hype too often in my life to completely accept these things at face value, but I was pleasantly surprised by the Cosmopolitan. It was by far one of the nicer casinos I visited during my time in Vegas.\n\nTheir aesthetic is cute and I love the pink accents everywhere. This casino trends quite 'girly', but it's also hip, modern and most importantly clean. It's a breath of fresh air on the strip, definitely different from nearby competitors and a pleasant experience.
