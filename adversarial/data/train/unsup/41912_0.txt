Beers for you, hard cider for me.\n\nIn between downtown events, the time was right to check out Barhop for a quick drink and snack.\n\nWeather was cooperative in October, so the patio was the destination. The hostess was accommodating and the server was quick to provide the menu and options.\n\nIn the end it was a hard cider day. West Ave Heritage Dry hard cider and KW hard cider were the chosen ones and they were both great. Stuffed jalapeños was the appi which was hot (warning provided by the server) and sweet. Bacon makes everything better, right? These jalapeños popped!\n\nDef on my hip radar for another pint.
