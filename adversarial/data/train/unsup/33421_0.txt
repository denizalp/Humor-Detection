Hopped in here as the first stop of some delicious beer spots in Toronto over the weekend. \n\nTook awhile for anyone to greet us, eventually the bartender came over and offered us a seat.\n\nOpted for the patio but then realizing how muggy and cloudy it was we changed back to inside without much issue.\n\nBeer menu was extensive with a great $6 for a flight of 3. I tried the Rodenbach, Hacker and a sour. All 3 were pretty good, especially liked the sour. \n\nOrdered a beer off their rarities section but unfortunately that one was sold out... bummer but went with a second choice and as he was pouring it he says this one is available at LCBO you know... then why did I just pay $17 for a bottle???\n\nAll in all the beer was still pleasantly good. The burger my partner ordered was more disappointing... sloppy and not great at all. It was falling apart from all the liquid and by the end of his lunch his plate had a small lake on it... \n\nWill come back for their beer options but wonder how many are available at LCBO lol  \n\nStaff was friendly, restaurant was nice and comfy.
