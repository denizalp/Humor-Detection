Not the greatest sandwich but I still enjoy it! The Italian herbs and cheese bread is really good as well as the chipotle southwest sauce, I always ask for extra! I normally get the chicken breast with provolone, cucumbers, bell peppers, tomatoes, and lettuce. It's my go to and its never let me down before!
