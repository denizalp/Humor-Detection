Wow! Is the first thing that comes to mind when writing about this place. I went for my 1st lady parts maintenance ever and was scared beyond belief. After doing a lot of research on numerous places I went with here. Reasons being the price and the vibe I got when I called. When I called, Stacey was informative and had a great sense of humor. (I kind of look at it like a date. If you don't have a good personality why would I let you go down there?) And by far their prices are the most reasonable I could find. She knew it was my first time and put me quickly to ease. I get my eyebrows threaded and tear up more with that than I did this. She chatted the whole time which took my mind off of things. It's been almost 2 hours and haven't experienced the slightest bit of discomfort. I may be a Brazilian addict because of her now. You can tell she takes great pride in what she does and is so humble about how well she is doing with her new business. Best of all she appreciates her clients. The Birthday Suit is 20 miles from my house but very much worth the drive. I feel like I should buy her a drink after our very intimate experience. Thank you for the awesome job Stacey! I can't wait to show my husband face down on the concrete :p\n\nP.S. another thing I loved about her was I brought up a couple other places I checked into for my wax and she spoke so kindly about them! That is so professional and great business practice in my opinion. I am so glad I went here.
