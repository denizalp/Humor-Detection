Cute little restaurant in downtown Chandler. Candy skull murals and a fire place outside if you want to sit outside and still stay warm on the cooler winter nights. \n\nGreat deals for the amount of food you receive. $10 for three tacos of your choice, rice and beans, with a fountain drink. Very filling. \n\nThere is a salsa bar next to the fountain drinks. You are not skimped our on meat in the tacos and the rice and beans were very tasty! Not too dry or runny, just right. If you want a sweet treat to end your meal with, there is a Paletta's Betty cart by the register.
