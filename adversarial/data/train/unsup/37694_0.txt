Went in at 830 on a Friday. It's right before Christmas and the plaza they are located in is preparing for Samar, but Fractured Prune has its door open and donuts going. The second I walked in, I knew I was in for a treat! \n\nThere was one employee working the register and one working the donut line, but they both answered any questions I had. After I filled out the slip selecting my dozen, my order was taken with with politeness with respect. The employee answered my questions and offered suggestions when asked. \n\nNow for the info I know you want; AMAZING FOOD! I got the eggnut with sausage and let me tell you...mmmmmm! Great balance of crispy fresh donut and warm egg and melts cheese! The meat was pretty tasty, but the donut made the sandwich! I couldn't leave the establishment without devouring this bad mama-jama!\n\nI got a dozen donuts of various flavors, but made sure to get the bacon bomb. Again, was not let down. The glazes are subtle, as mentioned in previous reviews, but I like that. I believe it is supposed to be a subtle taste to bring out the awesomeness of the donut. \n\nEnjoy!
