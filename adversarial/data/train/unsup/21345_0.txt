We are victims of good yelp review of this buffet. \nLike many of you guys, we check yelp before we visit the place. \n\nIt's Saturday brunch. This is by far the worst casino buffet we've been to. Fried food is dry and hard enough to be a weapon. If there is food fight in this buffet, people will seriously get hurt. I got chicken fry steak. Took a bite, feel like I was biting into a hockey pot. Shrimp popcorn, hard and chewy. \n\nSushi display is something I've never seen before. Usually sushi station is clean and organized. But not this one, sushi is piled up on top of each other, rice got stick to each other, filling is falling out. It looks like a one big plate of sushi fry rice. \n\nEvery single station we saw was messy and not clean. We never seen a buffet this messy and not organized. As we watched the employees who prepared the food behind the station, we realized why. \n\nUnlike most buffet, most buffet when food it out, they pick up the tray, clean the area, put in fresh tray of fresh food. But not this buffet, the employees put food on top of old ones, they don't even bother pick up the old tray, they simple scoop the new food and slap into the old tray. As a result, food is getting more salty, hardened, messier....\n\nwe don't know how's the new chef and what the \"good yelp review \" were talking about. Don't believe those. They are NOT TRUE.
