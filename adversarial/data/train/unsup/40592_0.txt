Dined at El Chorro for the first time on 3\/9 and had a wonderful meal in an exquisite atmosphere. The only thing better than the sticky buns was the fantastic view of Camelback Mountain. Nate, our server, took excellent care of us and his advice on appetizers (Shrimp pot!) and cocktails was spot on. The Moscow Mule they served is also delicious! I'd absolutely recommend El Chorro for any group looking for a picturesque setting to accompany a quality dining experience.
