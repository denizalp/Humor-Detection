What Godfather II was to the Godfather is what Steak 44 is to Mastro's.  It is possible to improve upon perfection!  Every dish was meticulously crafted to provide the best taste and visual appeal.  As expected the meat is superb but don't leave without enjoying notable sides like the  crispy shrimp, asparagus, sweet corn, and lobster mashed potatoes.  The wait staff was attentive, professional, and very helpful.  The ambiance doesn't quite have the polish as Mastro's and the adult contemporary top 40 that was playing too loud detracted somewhat from the experience, but that is mere nickpicking to an otherwise superb dining experience.
