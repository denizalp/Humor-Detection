We stopped in to have a drink and watch some football one Saturday afternoon.  The place is pretty swanky...not somewhere I would normally choose to hang out but it ended up being okay.  Service was quick, which is always a plus.  We had already eaten but decided to have a snack with our wine.  We went with the housemade potato chips that came with two dips...caramelized onion and bacon horseradish.  Both were delish!  If you like upscale places and enjoy dressing up, I'd suggest checking it out.  Probably not the best spot to catch some football though...
