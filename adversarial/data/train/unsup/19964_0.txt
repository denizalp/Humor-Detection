If you ever have a chance to try a Kamayan Feast aka Boodle Fight, you gotta go for it! \n\nThis Filipino feast is a mouth watering assortment of grilled meats, seafood, grilled veggies, fresh fruit and rice served on top of banana leaves. You wash your hands and dive right in with no utensils. It's definitely much more fun when you do it with a bunch of good friends whose hygiene you trust. They do provide gloves or utensils if you can't handle eating with your bare hands.\n\nNow to the review: it's a clean restaurant that's nicely decorated with Filipino music playing in the back ground. They have a patio during the warm months and can acommodate big groups. Free WiFi and a small parking lot in the back with free street parking after 4pm. The servers are as sweet as can be. They want you to enjoy your experience so they'll observe you from afar, all you need to do is make eye contact or raise your hand and they'll come. They've improved on their presentation and the food is ok.\n\nPrice for the Kamayan is $16 per head and believe me, you WILL be stuffed by the end of your meal. Ready, set ATTACK!
