If you're looking for a nice sports bar that is a step up from Natives or Buffalo Wild wings, this is your place.  Natives and BWW are nice when you want the down and dirty bare bones experience like in your college days for wings and such.  But now you're not in college, time to upgrade your sports bar and palate. LOTS of TV with lots of channels for sports.  Big bar area with TVs or booth seating for just family dining.  The menu for food is impressive, the burgers are big and juicy, wings are ok. fries are ok.  But they have just a big menu for everything and the quality tastes just better then Natives or BWW.  The beer selection is good, and for mixed drinks they're decent.  And its CLEAN!\n\nPros:\n-LOTS OF TVS (think wall to wall)\n-good food (esp the burgers)\n-big selections of beer\n-spacious bar and regular dining area\n\nCons:\n-CLOSES AT EARLY (or earlier than most)\n- gets very crowded during big games so there might be a wait\n-parking lot can get full real quick
