High Strength Cask Ale. $5. This beer has generous amounts of floral hops without being loud. The malts are crisp and the ale is well balanced. This is a real ale and a good sipper. Served in a dimpled pint glass. \n\nI place an order for the sea bass special. $14. Perfectly baked with a beurre blanc sauce and most likely reduced with one of the ales and on the side, seasonal vegetables. Excellent meal.\n\nSitting on the breezy patio was pretty good as the interior was solid packed. The only annoyance was the occasional smoker. What I would give to light up a rollie. But being a reasonable non-smoker, I ignore the irritant.\n\nAnyway somebody tell the landlord it was a great time.
