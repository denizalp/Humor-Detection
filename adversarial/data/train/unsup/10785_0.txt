worst service ever & extremely rude! i will never come back to this shop again after my experience yesterday! i got off work at 5pm. i work in chandler. i called the shop when i got off to try and schedule an appt. i was told that they were booked. i asked if walk-ins were acceptable. i was told yes. so i drove 45 mins to the shop. when i got there i was told by another customer that the shop just sent away another customer due to being short staffed. i went and talked with one of the techs to let them know i was there and that i would wait. they said ok. after 30 mins of waiting the same tech that i told i was there came to me and asked if i would like to schedule an appt for tomorrow. i told her no because i called and proceeded to drive 45 mins to get there. before i could even finish, the tech walked away! like are you kidding me?! i left angry because i just wasted all this time when i could have gone to a different shop! worst service ever! if i was the owner, i would be pretty disappointed! i will ensure none of my friends\/family will ever go to this nail shop again! ... and to think I, at one point, liked it and recommended it to others. **psssh**
