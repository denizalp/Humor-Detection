I haven't had a general eye exam in years, so I decided to make an appointment with Dr. Kim since she takes appointments on the weekend which is convenient for people like me who aren't able to make it in during the week due to work! Making an appointment was really simple! You just go online and fill out some information, choose a time slot, and book your appointment. \n\nDr. Kim was great! She was very personable and thorough when it came to explaining things to me about my vision. My appointment was fairly quick and to the point. I would definitely recommend Dr. Kim to anyone who is looking for an eye doctor!\n\nP. S. Cheryl at the front desk is really sweet and is willing to answer any questions you may have! Thanks, Cheryl!
