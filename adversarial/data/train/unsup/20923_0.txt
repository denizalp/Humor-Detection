I recently enjoyed two meals at Enzo's.  On the first occasion only Enzo and I were present after I asked at the door at 9:10 p.m. what time the restaurant closed and was told, \"Ten minutes ago.  But come on in and I'll take care of you.\"  The second was for pizza with Diane and friends just a few days ago.\n\nOn the first visit, after a Dinner Salad with Italian Dressing I enjoyed some complimentary Garlic Knots (since otherwise they would have been thrown out) and a filling meal of Sausage & Peppers.  Chef-owner Enzo does not scrimp on portions, and I had an ample amount of sausage lengths to devour, along with both Green and Red Peppers nicely enfolded together in a tasty Pomodoro Sauce.\n\nOn the second stop, the Garlic Knots were big, freshly made, and chewy.  Another Dinner Salad with Italian Dressing, greens, and a few pieces of tomato and carrot was nothing special but a serviceable beginning.  The pizza, however, was sublime.  A great thin-crust Neapolitan pizza with supple dough, plenty of sauce and melted cheese, and this time five ingredients: tomato, mushroom, sausage, pepperoni, and cashews.  The cashews were brought in by Diane, and Enzo graciously accommodated our request to add them as a topping on our 16-inchers.  Our friends split an 18-inch pizza, so pizza was omnipresent on our table top.  The pizza was delicious, even though the sausage packed a spice that lingered in the mouth for awhile.  To offset the sausage's kick, the pepperoni was mild.\n\nService was very good; our waiter somehow remembered me from a single stop over 3 years ago.  The ambiance inside our dining room was casual, and our booth seating was quite  comfortable.  Food came out quickly, too, even though the place was humming with several diners in our midst.\n\n4-1.2 stars overall for the Sausage & Peppers, Garlic Knots, and fine pizza!
