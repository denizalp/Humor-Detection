Simply put, this place is awesome! From the outstanding service, to the classy-unique decor, and of course the tasty Italian Ice, Joe's is a place I could see myself frequenting in the summer. The young gentleman at the counter gave us samples which were all tasty in their own right, but we (party of two) decided to share a large Raspberry Italian Ice. Be sure to try it Joe Latti style, as it provided a perfect balance of cream sweetness to the tartness of the raspberry.\n\nI fully expect my stamp card to be fully punched and redeemed by the end of the summer!
