Ok just so I can get this off my mind. This place looks very nice and the prices are fine. But I'm not a woman I don't plan out my haircuts. 2 times I called this place for an appointment. I'm used to calling and getting a same day appointment. Haircuts are an impulsive act for a man not a Normandy invasion plan. First time I had to wait almost 2 weeks for 150 worth of services..gimme a break..get more barbers or something that's just unacceptable, cancelled that appointment a day later when I got done what I needed elsewhere for half the price...second time I was told I could be put on a wait list..lol..what? Am I buying a house..ridiculous...it's one thing to pay top dollar and it's another to be told I can't get in when I need to...doesn't matter much to me how high your ratings are...maybe someday I'll call and they will be able to fit me in before the next ice age...
