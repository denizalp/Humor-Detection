Oh man. Food was so good. We had the charred broccolini, smoked whole wings, and the meat and cheese plate with the cheddar.\n\nProbably the best food I've had in a long time.\n\nBeer is excellent also. We had the Saison, session ipa, and farmhouse ipa.\n\nSteel some Jalepeno Jelly from their deli and smuggle back home. It's got crack cocain in it! So good!
