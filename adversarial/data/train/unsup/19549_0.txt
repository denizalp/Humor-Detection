So after watching Undercover Boss S03E04 (yes I know I'm like 5 years behind), I thought I'd would try out our local Checkers.\n\nMy first disappointment was the lack of double drive thru.  The TV show billed them as the \"worlds largest double drive thru\" and this store didn't have it. Oh well.  However what they did have was the most crisp sounding intercom speaker system.  It was kind of weird how well the cashier sounded.\n\nWe ordered the chilly cheese fries and a chilly dog.  Both were disgusting.  The chilly was sour on both items.  The chilly dog used a low quality bun that disintegrated in my hands.   The hot dog was also very thin and had a tough chewy consistency.\n\nI was very disappointed in the food and would probably never go back.
