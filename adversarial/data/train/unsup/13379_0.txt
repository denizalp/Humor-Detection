We visited Geeks Mania tonight for the first time on a suggestion from a fellow Yelper.  (Thanks, Stacey!). My extended family came along, which included my sisters, teenagers, tweenagers, and even Grandma. \n\nThe space is in the back of the building through a long well lit hallway.\n\nThey have a number of old-school arcade games, two pinball machines, at least four to six very long tables and chairs for traditional card fantasy games and two large projection TVs for console type games.  There's plenty of room for parents, friends, etc. to sit and chat while others play games and enjoy the offerings.\n\nThe vast majority of the games are $.25 and are very nostalgic for a tail-end baby boomer like me.  Pac-Man, Battle Zone, Centipede and Duck Hunt are all here and more. They say they add a number of additional games every day--Galaxian and Galaga are on the way!\n\nIt's a clean, friendly and wholesome environment. One of the operators shared  that they are really promoting a mellow and safe environment.   They had music playing but with that and all of the game and customer noise, I did not feel overwhelmed by a cacophony of sound. That was nice.  Even Grandma's delicate constitution (aka, \"nerves\") remained intact. \n\nIt was a nice way to spend an hour and a pocket full of quarters. It was fun revisiting my youth and to watch the kids have fun with older technology from back in the day.  \"See,\" I told them. \"You didn't die. Not every video game has to be connected to the Internet.\"  Of course, some eye-rolling followed, but the old man's point was made. Chalk one up for the parents!\n\nThey also have comic books, cool T-shirts and a number of other miscellaneous items for sale. Vending machines have drinks and snacks.\n\nThey have been open for three weeks and are asking people to help spread the word.   I'm looking forward to going back, seeing the additional games and a hopeful uptick in their business. \n\nGood guys with a good wholesome business idea.
