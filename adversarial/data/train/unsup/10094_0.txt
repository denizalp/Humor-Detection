Horrible customer service!! Will never stay here ever again. Called the operator and house keeper so many times for towels and no one brought anything to our room. Waited abt 2 hrs and gave up. The manager was complete worthless and showed no support in expediting the request. Still no towels and it's almost midnight!!! Time to call it quits but in the near future there will be no booking at this pathetic hotel again.
