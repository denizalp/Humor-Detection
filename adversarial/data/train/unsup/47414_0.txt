I live right off Valleydale Road we did not have anything close to us like the new CIRCLE K this is the place that when you walk in the employees are so friendly the restrooms are clean. The coffee area the food prep area everything is clean. The pumps outside are well lit and they always have paper towels when you need to clean your windshield. This is one place that I don't man riding at night by myself. There are several employees in there when is Gina and the other ones Rachel there are many more they are so sweet and helpful I am so glad we have a new CIRCLE K so I don't have to go far from my house thank you
