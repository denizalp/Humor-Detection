I can see why this place gets jumping on the weekend. It looks like a cool lounge that just happens to serve sushi. You half expect a dance floor to be tucked away somewhere. I didn't get to experience the thumping music since I came in on a weekday, early evening. There were lots of seats since most of the patrons chose to sit at the bar.\n\nThe drinks are very strong, which is always a plus. My date and I ordered calamari, 3 different sushi rolls and seafood fried rice. I wish the rice didn't have imitation crab, but besides that it was filling and delicious.  It's the second best fried rice I've had after Ru San's. The calamari was great, lightly fried- which is a welcome change from some restaurants who serve calamari with more bread coating than squid.\n\nThe price is a little higher than normal, but that's expected due to the area. I ate at a sushi place in Steele Creek last week and the price difference wasn't that much between the two. I look forward to returning.
