Came here for a drink on a Thursday with my husband. \n\nPros: cool atmosphere, looks new, bartender\/server was nice, drinks were good, not packed (which is both a pro and a con, but I was relieved to be somewhere that didn't have a million people)\n\nCons: GRATUITY IS ALREADY INCLUDED -20%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Like wtf? What place does that. I asked and they said that's \"what we do here\".  2 rounds of Old Fashioned's was $62 plus a 12+ tip already included, making it come to over 80 bucks for 4 drinks. Wow!  The audacity to already include 20%...ballsy for sure.  Also had some pretty lame DJ music that no one was into. \n\nProbably wouldn't go back. What a shame.
