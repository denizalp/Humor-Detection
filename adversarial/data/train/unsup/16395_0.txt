We came here because the wait at Ru San was crazy long so I quickly searched for an alternate. Good place! It was mostly empty at 2pm on a Saturday. We ordered the gyoza and three speciality rolls; came to about $55 with tax. We had the H&M and the Sunset roll; both tuna and both good. Skip the roll with the fried crab it was not as good as the other two. Our waitress was very nice and cheerful. I'd come here again; good place for lunch before or after going to the mall!
