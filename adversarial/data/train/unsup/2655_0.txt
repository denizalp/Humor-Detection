Best Thai food in town.  I absolutely love the curry, and my friend swears by the pork fried rice.  There is a ton of excellent options on the menu, but be careful what you order on your first visit.  I have a hard time ordering anything else.   Now the only way I get to try anything new is to bring someone else and sample what they order.  \nService is always pleasant and decor is simple.
