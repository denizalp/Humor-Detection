So some friends of mine had found this place and since it was in DT Phoenix I was happy to make a food discovery outside of my comfortable Scottsdale zone.  The girlfriend is a big sushi fan so definitely couldn't pass this opportunity up.  The staff was very friendly and we were able to get a table there no problem even for a Friday night, but it looked like they had some tables reserved so that explains some things.  \n\nFirst off we had the shrimp tempura and watch out it's piping hot, but only because it's so fresh!  The first words out of my mouth were, THIS IS THE BEST TEMPURA SHRIMP I\"VE EVER HAD.  I mean i'm no stranger when it comes to tempura shrimp and this appetizer was just so flavorful and crispy and fresh.  To top it off the ponzu sauce had an added kick of spice in it which put it over the top.  The rolls that we got were the H3 roll and the Oh my God roll as well as a spicy salmon roll.  Now right off the bat you know it's different b\/c they used some sort of purple rice it seemed like.  I know i've seen this type of rice before, but could not specify the type of rice.  The H3 roll was good and I am unable to go into too much detail due to it being overshadowed by the Oh My God Roll.  So the Oh My God roll is nothing I've ever seen before.  It comes wrapped up in (for what I can see a child crafting a viking helmet out of foil) and there's a plate that's ON FIRE!!!!  Then this viking helmet starts flying!!   OH my GOD! as in... Oh My God it's flying!! or... Oh My GOD there's a Fire...or just OH MY GOD It was sooo darn good!!!!  Our waiter unwraps this foil contraption and there's this awesome roll that has almost a smoky campfire type flavor to it which was just fantastic!  I can't even tell you what was in it, just eat it!!  I will definitely be going back.\n\nCheers!!
