There are lots of raves for this place but my experience was that the property is on the \"low to average\" scale for the chain.\n\nFirst, the rooms. They aren't bad, but it's the \"cheap\" package - no fridge, minuscule desk, terrible lighting in the bath & near the desk, loud air-con that's either glacial or stuffy...you get the drill. A chair but no ottoman, and the very minimal number of towels in the bath - 2. I used one, hung it up, it was removed (ok fine but WHAT ABOUT THE EARTH?). Day 2, same thing but no more towels so I had none and had to call for them. Sheets had brown stains (see photo) and had to be replaced as well. \n\nSecond, the property - its relatively new but cheaply constructed. Stay on the top floor facing front or you'll hear the people above you stomping around as well as hootin' and hollerin' from Top Golf. Regardless of your room location, you WILL hear noise from other rooms. Bring earplugs. \n\nThird - amenities. Breakfast is a scant spread (powdered eggs, etc) with 2 hot items, and the standard dry bread products. Wifi is free but the signal is slow\/unreliable making it hard to get work done. There is a small gym and a pool if you need them. \n\nThe area is fairly desolate in the sense that there's nothing immediately nearby (except Top Golf and the casino) so you really do need a car. Most stuff (restaurants etc) is a 5-15 min drive. That's probably going to change as the area appears to be in development. \n\nOverall, there's nothing here to bring me back. Staff was generally absent (almost never anyone at the desk, always in back) or indifferent. I've stayed at several great HI's recently which really highlights how \"meh\" this one is.
