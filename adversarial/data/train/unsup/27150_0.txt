Really cute bistro with a Sunday brunch at a very reasonable $15 prix fixe.  I had the vegetarian quiche with salad and it was delicious. Lots of cheese and the salad was very generous!  \n\nThis bistro is in an up & coming area of town. They accept reservations and take credit cards.  I highly recommend!
