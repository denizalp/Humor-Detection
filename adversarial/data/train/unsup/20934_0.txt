I've been trying to visit this place for quite awhile and finally made the trip this past weekend. Mr. Z lived up to the hype by not only serving pretty drinks but they taste delicious too! My friend and I got the butterfly Pea teas in orange and grapefruit and they were divine. As a tea fan i found it we a great blend of floral, fruity and sweet, while my friend (who isn't a tea fan in the slightest) found it to also be refreshing. \n\nI'll be returning every chance i get!
