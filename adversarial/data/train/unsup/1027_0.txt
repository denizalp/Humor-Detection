Well, I tried sending the folks at Momofuko a letter through their website, but their feeback section on their website didn't work for me ... so, here it goes:\n\nDear Momofuko:\n\nI am writing to express my concern about an incident that occurred on the evening of January 18, 2013.\n\nI had made a reservation, well in advance of the aforementioned date. \nIt was my girlfriends birthday.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were sat at the bar. \n\nI was disappointed that my reservation was made well in advance and we were sat at the bar to have our dinner. \n\nI understand that at many establishments in Toronto, this is commonplace, however, I figured that booking in advance would have made a difference, considering that there were many, many tables in the place.\n\nThe service was slow.\nOur plates weren't changed when new courses were brought, and the old ones were quite dirty.\n\nThe food was good.\nOur server was very kind (she was also the bartender). \nThe wine was excellent and not over-priced. \n\nLastly. I understand the concept of the restaurant, however, when making the reservation, I noted that we would be having vegetarian meals. \n\nMost places I go, if there aren't a lot of options, the chef always makes a special meal for me. I don't care about the price. \n\nWhen my reservation was received, someone could have checked in regarding your limited options.  \n\nI would have asked when I arrived - I don't have a problem asking, but I honestly didn't feel welcomed sitting at the bar. \n\nI am going to give you the opportunity to explain why this could happen, and you are willing to do about it. \n\nI waited until I wasn't upset about it to write you. \n\nSending thanks in advance for your consideration.
