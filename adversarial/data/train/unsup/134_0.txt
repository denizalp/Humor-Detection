I have to admit that the artificial sandpit in the middle of the shop is a good idea-- my son spent most of his time in it (it's not free to enter). \n\nWith that said, I believe there is no need to exaggerate when praising this shop. It's just a tiny (due to the space the sandpit takes up), outdated toy shop that would take you approximately 10 minutes to walk around and most likely decide not to buy anything. Some reviews I read make it sound like the front door opens to a magical world. Common sense, please.\n\nHere's 2 dollars' worth of advice: socks are required to enter the pit and they sell socks in the shop for (yes, you guessed right) 2 dollars a pair. I ended up buying a pair since my son had his slippers on and wanted to enter the pit very much; however, they did not have the right size for him. I had to choose the biggest size they had, which was still smaller than what he needed and he had hard time putting them on. I was a little disappointed because if wearing socks is made a requirement, and socks are made available to customers to make some more money, they need to make sure they carry every size.
