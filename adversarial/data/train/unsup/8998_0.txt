I had been to Udupi Palace once before, while on the UYE Little India crawl. I'd totally forgotten about it until I logged onto Yelp this morning and noticed that Kat T had a ROTD for this place, and I thought to myself: \"Self! Let's go to Udupi Palace for lunch today!\" Luckily, self (and my husband) agreed.\n\nI'd forgotten that Udupi Palace was a vegetarian joint. As a meat eater, this made me a little bit disappointed, but once I stuffed my eager piehole with delicious dosa, I'd forgotten all about the lack of tasty animal. My husband and I split the Masala Dosa, which was huuuuuge but a little skimpy on filling. \n\nFor my entree I decided to go North Indian and have the Matar Paneer, which was excellent. A little lacking in peas, but plenty of cheese and spicy sauce. \n\nYum. I can't wait to go back!
