Worst restaurant experience. I went to eat here when I was driving thru for a photoshoot I was doing downtown. I ordered a pizza and my assistant ordered a burger. We both can say it was the worst food I have ever eaten because of the meat quality and the dough quality. Simply the worst service from Amy too.
