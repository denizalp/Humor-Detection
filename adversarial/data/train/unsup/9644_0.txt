I didn't get the chance to try the one in Chicago, so we ordered a deep dish for delivery. The deep dish takes about 45 min to cook so keep that in mind. They deliver up to 5 miles and the fee is $4.  \n\nWe tried the special, which has sausages, mushrooms and onions. The pizza was alright, the marinara sauce could have been better but they definitely didn't skimp on the cheese. Compared to Lou Malnati's, I'd pick Lou's!
