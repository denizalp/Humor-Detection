Get here early for their delicious and wonderful quiche! \n\nThey tend to run out, and they do make em fresh, so its worth waking up early. Every latte's I have tried have been perfect, and that chocolate twist is to die for. \n\nI like how its small and hidden within this huge plaza. So it might be hard to find the place if you haven't been. \n\nThe customer service is simply on point. Every time I'm there, I see every one smiling and hustling. I love it! Everyone's so helpful and awake. Havent seen a grump just yet. Also, I witnessed an accident once and fortunately the girl who was apart of the accident didn't mind too much. I believe the girl spilled some coffee, and broke a cup. I believe the owner came out to apologize and accommodate them as much as he can. People make mistakes, and I'm glad the customer wasn't infuriated.\n\nThe place itself is small, but there is a ton of outside seating. On a nice beautiful day, sit outside with your coffee and munch of some pastry. It's simply delightful. Even with the French music playing. \n\nIt's simple, delicious, customer service is A+, and a great experience. I even saw a family come in from out of town. They said they saw the reviews on here and wanted to try it out. They were all happy! They said it out loud. Haha. \n\n\nI recommend, most definitely
