What to say what to say... the trio of Kevin, Lou, and Ivy are the best of the best. Lou not only knows how to give a pedi, but also told me and my boyfriend some good places to visit outside of the strip. Ivy, gave me a mani that I can't stop looking at! Then there was Kevin... my boyfriend said it was his best pedi ever. Even tho he's only had 3 before, he said nothing compares to Kevin. \n\nThis place is the cleanest salon I've seen before, and will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!
