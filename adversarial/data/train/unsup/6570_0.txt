Walgreens is by far my favorite place to spend $80 on nonessential items in 15\nMinutes. \nThis particular Walgreens though is absolutely ridiculous. Upon check out there was a price discrepancy on one of my items. The cashier Denise ,from the beauty department, seemed already very flustered and unable to ring up items under the pressure of two people in line. \nNoticing this $2 discrepancy I alert my cashier. To which Denise ,from the beauty dept, gets even more flustered and picks up her intercom phone and announces that she needs a price check...on a super pack of 50 Kotex tampons! She literally announced to the ENTIRE store that not only do I need a massive amount of tampons, apparently I'm cheap as well. Being a woman I would assume she would have a little bit more sensitivity to the issue but apparently not.
