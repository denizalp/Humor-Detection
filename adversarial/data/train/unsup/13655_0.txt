I just can't believe the bad pricing that exists here.  I get it they have to pay for the high rent that Soho must charge but seriously.\n\nThe burger is decent, average at best.  The buns are thick and a bit too bready.\n\nSo I ordered a 5 oz burger with cheddar and a milkshake, which was actually pretty good.  And that's it.  No fries, no onion rings, no lobster, no filet mignon, nothing else and the price was $19.\n\nSee the picture and you decide if this is a well pricing scheme for this resto.
