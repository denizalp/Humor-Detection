Although I can't speak to the sales experience at LHM because my husband is as much of a shark as the sales staff, I am writing this review on my experience with the service dept.\n\nIn my lifetime, I had a few positive experiences dealing with service depts at dealerships, but wow--Tom Rodriguez in LHM's service dept is a true gem. He explains things in simple terms, doesn't try to talk you into things you don't need, follows through with answers, follows up with phone calls, and doesn't treat you like an idiot. I didn't have to crawl up his butt to find out when my car would be done. I didn't have to remind HIM what my warranty covers. I didn't have to fight him to fix things properly. It was just done and done correctly the first time. He doesn't talk down to me because I'm a woman but he does take the time to explain things so I understand. Tom worked with me to find a time that worked in my hectic schedule, kept me in the loop, and made me feel like we on the same team in the service of my vehicle rather than making me feel like it's a battle. \n\nI am VERY pleased with how I was treated, how my vehicle was serviced correctly the first time, and can't say enough nice things about Tom.
