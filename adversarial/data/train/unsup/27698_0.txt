The gyro sandwich is very good.  The pita is soft and fresh, the lamb meat is flavorful and tender, and the lettuce and tomatoes seem fresh and looked good.  The fries are served very hot, medium salt level, and on the light side (i.e., not fried to a dark, golden color).\n\nThey are cash only, which is a limitation in 2017.  And the setting, while quite clean, is kinda of dark and small and not super inviting.
