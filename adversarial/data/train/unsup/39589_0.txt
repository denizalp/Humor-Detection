The tom kra gai was delicious but I really wasn't very impressed with the basil chicken dish mainly because the chicken was so dry. I ordered thai hot for both and they just put the chilis on top of the chicken so it wasn't spicy.. Like at all. The service was really fast even though we sat outside during lunch rush and she was so friendly!!!
