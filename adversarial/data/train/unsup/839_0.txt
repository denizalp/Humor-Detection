I live in Cleveland where the streets are paved with gold. Or potholes more likely. I got a flat tire around 9pm. Called this place because they open at 7 AM and being that they're in Cleveland I didn't have to get on the highway to get there (which is a necessity because of the spare). They said it was first come first served. They charged me $30 for a very good looking used tire and had me out of there within 15 minutes. I got to work on time. The professional, courteous manner of this establishment made the stress of a flat tire seem like no big deal. I highly recommend.
