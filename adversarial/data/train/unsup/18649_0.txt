I had a pretty standard breakfast and it was okay. Eggs, hash browns (fried potato cubes), ham and a lot of great rye toast. It's three stars because they were too busy for the amount of staff. Sitting at the bar and facing the kitchen, I saw quite a few plates sitting up there ready to go to tables for way too long. Including my own that was up for a good four minutes.\n\nWhen they had time, the service was friendly and good but they needed at least one more person working the line this morning.
