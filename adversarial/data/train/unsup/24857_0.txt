I'm torn as to whether or not to take two stars from this place as opposed to just one but I decided, a single negative employee shouldn't ruin an otherwise great experience. \n\nI called ahead (I strongly recommend you do this), to see if they had two relatively rarer currencies available. The lady I spoke with said yes and that she would hold the money under my name for me until I could pick it up. I told her I would be in within a few days and thanked her for her time.\n\nI went in on the day I asked and when I opened the door I said \"Hi, I called on Monday and someone said they were going to hold some currency aside for me until I could come in today and get it.\" The lady sitting at the back desk responded very rudely and abruptly with \"And?!?!?!? What am I supposed to do with that information?\" I said \"Well um, ok then...\" and she then asked \"can I at least have your name or something? How am I supposed to know who you are?\" After I gave her the information she asked for, she went to the back and got the currency, and returned. She was a lot nicer to me after she returned. It was almost alarming actually how quickly her personality changed. Regardless, there is zero excuse for this behavior. That is not how you treat customers, especially customers who are not being rude to you. \n\nThe office is a little difficult to find, but there are lots of people around and they will easily show you the way if you get lost from the parking garage. The office itself was clean and well kept. They validate your parking which is a nice bonus. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the exchange rates here are AMAZING. I honestly do not think you can get currency for these prices ANYWHERE, and you certainly cannot in Nevada.
