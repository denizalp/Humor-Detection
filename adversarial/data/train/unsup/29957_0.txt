Best tacos, hands down. I have never tasted something so addictive, so tasty, that it keeps me coming back on a bi-monthly basis. The flavours are authentic, the menu is simple but has variety, and there's Mexican flair all over the place. \nIt's run by probably the nicest people you'll ever meet, and the prices are unbeatable, especially for the amount you get. You'll regret not trying this place if you're in town or in the neighbourhood. Easily accessible from all parts of the city (and off-island). There is not a single thing wrong with Tacos Tijuana!
