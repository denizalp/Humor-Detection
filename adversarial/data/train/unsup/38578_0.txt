Anthony is such a nice guy. He comes out and sprays every month and we have never had any issues. Blackburn does a great job! Kendra who calls to confirm appointments could use some tips in customer service. She was very rude with me and hung up when I asked to reschedule for the second time. It's summer, we have a very busy schedule.
