I visited Shinta last week after work. It's a fairly large, clean and spacious restaurant. It was so busy!!! Best to make reservation to save some disappointment. Might be wise to make reservations a week in advance ( ask for a window seat !) Restaurant is slightly understaffed, \nso service might be slow. Staffs are friendly and accommodating. \n\nPrices are very reasonable for quality food. Prices start at $70\/pp for wagyu dinner and can go as high as you want it to be. The more premium wagyu costs extra, and is calculated by every 200-300g. I highly recommend trying Japanese A5 wagyu. That was the highlight of my night!! For side dishes, I recommend trying clams in sake, mixed mushrooms with garlic butter & takoyaki.\n\nLoved the extensive drink menu!!! Drinks were inexpensive, which is a good thing. It was hard choosing just one drink, so I got the Shinta Polar Bear, sake mojito and strawberry yakult. The Shinta Polar Bear was my favourite, and complemented the wagyu very much. Not much strawberry taste in the strawberry yakult though... Meal ended with a popsicle as a light dessert. Yummy!\n\nMy first wagyu experience was a success, but it won't be easy adjusting back to regular beef.....I will be back!!
