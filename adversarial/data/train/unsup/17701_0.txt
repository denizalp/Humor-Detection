I've been here twice, once alone and once with my wife. Both times, the food was absolutely excellent and consistent. You should go here, very reasonable prices, very authentic Greek\/Medi food. The staff are always attentive, polite and prompt.\n\nGyros wraps and hummus are on point. Coming from the bay area california, I know it when I taste authentic and this place is it. Very unassuming in a stripmall across from a starbucks, but some of the best local Greek\/medi food I've had.
