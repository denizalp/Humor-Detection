The place is really cute and very clean. Our servers name was matt. And he was awesome. Great suggestions. We ordered the veggie omelet and the Monte Cristo. My omelette came out with cheese wich I asked to be taken out but Matt checked back very quick and brought out a new one. Our food was excellent. I would definetly recommend this place.
