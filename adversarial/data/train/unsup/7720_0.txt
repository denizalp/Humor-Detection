What a royal treatment! \n\nI have to admit that I was hesitant and skeptical at first about going to the King because firstly, this one happens to be 30 min driving distance away from me and secondly, there are something like 47 chinese restaurants at every corner in Toronto. But I did go because someone in the group promised that this place serves THE BEST Peking Duck in GTA. And boy... this place is goooood!\n\nThis is no fancy restaurant (most chinese restaurants aren't) but both the food AND the service are fit for a king! \n\nI was there with a group of 10 and the service was lighting quick. We got our 8 dishes within 20 min! I truly enjoyed every single dish we ordered! My favourites were the Peking Duck (of course!), Peking Duck stir fry, the orange garlic beef, and the deep fried sweet and sour fish. \n\nI highly recommend this place, but if you're going with a group make sure you call ahead to make reservations as this place is packed!\n\nP.S. This place is cash only.
