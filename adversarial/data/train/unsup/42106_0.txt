Stay away from this place.  They don't return calls, they don't refill prescriptions when YOU need them and they only show up when THEY want YET they will stalker call every month, even if you don't need an appointment and if you don't let them come EVERY month, they will send you a nasty certified letter that they will no longer provide care.  OH - and they sent the letter to my dad with ANOTHER patients name on the letter.\nAWFUL AWFUL place.  Go to DoctorCare or Cholla Medical instead.
