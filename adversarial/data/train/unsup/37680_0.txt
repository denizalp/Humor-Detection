Omg I am writing this review as I'm sitting on the plane after a 2 hour delay and now going on 2 hours sitting in this freaking plane with screaming kids. I'm flying to Fresno it's an hour flight!!! They don't value your time or your mental anguish. No one lets you know what's going on but keep getting text messages delaying the flight even longer. Ugh!!!! Think twice about using this company.
