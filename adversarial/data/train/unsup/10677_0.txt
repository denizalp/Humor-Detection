Ahhh the fabulous Wynn Las Vegas, puts all the MEDIOCRE hotels to shame, specially all MGM and Harrah's properties.\n\nIf your all about the glamourous life of Las Vegas then the Wynn is the place to be.\n\nThe moment you step into the Wynn, you will fall into another world of luxury and the finner things in life. \n\nThe service and ambiance of this hotel is defintely a 5 star rating. As well as the rooms and restaurants in the hotel.\n\nThe Wynn has always been a faovrite place of mine, i usually joke and call it my backyard since I am here most of the time relaxing and enjoying the fabulous lounges and restuarants.\n\nA favorite spot of mine i highly reccomend is the Parasols down bar, located downstairs with a spectacular view of a water fountain which features a mini show every 15-30 min.\n\nIf your hungry and care for a snack indulge at the drug store cafe at the Wynn located near the Le Reve theater, cheap and portions are huge.\n\nIf your all about class and  the finner things in life, get blown by the Wynn.. :)
