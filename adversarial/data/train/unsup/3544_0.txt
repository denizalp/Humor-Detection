Let me begin by saying the new place is BEAUTIFUL! What a fantastic job you did on the remodel. When you opened in Urbana I loved the new addition to our town. I had many a fun time at Todd and John's. For me the food in Urbana has always been good. The frustration has been your limited capacity. I cannot tell you the number of times I've come in and you were sold out of my dinner choice. \n\nNow to Champaign. I was so excited to learn you were opening in downtown Champaign. Finally I thought no more capacity problems! I first ordered carry out in May--I am a Brisket man and love it moist and with \"bark\". This had neither.  It was fatty and without smoke. Fast forward to today. \nOrdered Brisket, and Pork  Ribs. \nBeans dry and SWEET?  Dry? Sweet? \nCole slaw warm.\nBrisket dry.\nRibs salty.\nMuffin moist and yummy! That's Nice. \nApplesauce spicy? \nServer overbearing at times. \nFYI. I think brisket should not require a knife. \nGetting the check:\nNow, what's with no printed receipt? \nMeaning, what's up with no opportunity to review your bill? \nServer: \"Sorry, I cannot print you a receipt, you can only sign off on the total I am giving you\" \nMe: How do I know it is accurate?
