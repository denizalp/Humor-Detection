BEST BRA FITTERS IN CHARLOTTE.\n\nThose Victoria Secret clowns said I was a 38 DD when I went bra shopping but nothing felt right. Come to IC London, turns out I'm a 34FFF (yeah, that's right, whassup) - sounds like VS was just trying to sell me something in a size they carried!\n\nAnyway, back to IC London - wow wow and WOW. If you're looking for a bustier and thigh highs, don't come here. This isn't The Red Door. It's a high end bra and sleepwear store. From AAA to GGG, they carry a million high end, well made bras ranging from $50-100 and that will last you 3-4 years if you launder them correctly. Personally, I'm a fan of the Elomi bras but just purchased a strapless\/convertible one that made me want to cry: I NEVER KNEW MY BOOBS COULD LOOK LIKE THAT IN A STRAPLESS BRA! \n\nAll my big busted ladies will feel me on this: When you have big boobs, gravity works against you and it's hard to keep these babies up where they should be! If you're hearing me on this, stop reading and just go see IC London. Be ready to be amazed at what a correctly fitting, high quality bra can do for your confidence, breasts and figure over all! I put on my first Elomi and it looked like I'd dropped 20 lbs!\n\nAh, I can't sing their praises enough but I will try and stop here....\n\nI LOVE I C LONDON!!!
