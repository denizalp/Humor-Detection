Walking in I had memories of my mother taking me to a fabric store.  I used to watch as the clerk would undo a swath of material and then magically... i would end up in a pair of corduroy pants and some other pant or shirt pattern befitting the late 70'sor early 80's.  When I returned to reality, I realized how busy this place was.  Bless you, all you little boys and girls out there whose Mom's still possess the incredible ability to sew.  The GF and I roamed around looking for fabric for curtains.  Not one time were we ever approached and or greeted by any employee.  We also did not find anything which we wanted to make curtains out of.  Perhaps it was because they were overwhelmed due to having more people shopping than even I expected.  Thank God this is the GF's thing, as I know nothing about such things.  And also because the memories turned to nightmares. as I remembered homemade overalls and paisley patterned button up shirt.  The store kind of sucked but to all those that still rock a seeing machine....you are AWESOME!
