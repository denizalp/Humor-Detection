I come here mainly because of how close it is. The service has been consistently great and the people there are quite humorous too - I always walk out with a smile on my face! I've had things dry cleaned and also hemmed pants there and I'm always satisfied with it. The only downside is it's a bit pricier but it's the price to pay for convenience! Unlike the previous reviews, I've never had to pay upfront.
