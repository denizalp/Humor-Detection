I have recently discovered harvest kitchen and to be honest it is probably the best restaurant on this side of town. I have never ever had a bad meal here. The menu is very unique and bistro like. And everything is very flavorful and like a lot of places that I go where they're pretty average. This particular restaurant prides itself on Farm to table food and uses local vendors for its produce, meat, and other items. Are usually get aburger or some sort of pork that's on the menu. Just an FYI the french fries are cooked in duck fat. For those of you who are super health-conscious I just thought I would mention that. There is a bar at this restaurant and you can pretty much get full-service any kind of liquor you would like. I would say if you're looking for a good food on the east side of town this is definitely a place you should visit. It is definitely a foodie kind of restaurant and you will absolutely find it to be delicious.
