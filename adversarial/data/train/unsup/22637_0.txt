Here you have a perfect view of Bellagio Fountains and the service is perfect. The restaurant itself is beautiful, classy and elegant. The ceiling of the restaurant is covered with colorful clothes such as purple, yellow and red. It is very beautiful. \nWe went there before going to see a show on the strip. The service is excellent, friendly server,happy to chat with us, tell us a few stories, make us feel welcome. They have a good bread basket. The food is excellent as well. Desserts were on top as well. I tried the chocolate suffle and it was really delicious. \nWell, it is really expensive, but you will leave this Le Cirque feeling like having made an investment into your culinary experience and be happy about it.....I loved it...
