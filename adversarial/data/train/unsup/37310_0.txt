It's hard to understand the negative reviews.  My wife and I have eaten at Italian Restaurant four times over the past six months.  The food and service here are excellent.  Everything that we have tried on the menu was very good.  The chef has a literally fresh approach to Italian cuisine.  If you want stereotyped plain old Italian food, this is not your place.  The atmosphere is simple but pleasant, with a view of the kitchen in the main room.  There is also seating outside, and they just expanded into an additional room.  Business must be good!
