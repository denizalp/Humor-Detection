This is my go-to spot for teriyaki chicken. I prefer this place over Panda and the like, although TM brands itself as Asian Fusion, so it is a bit different than other places. A lot of my health conscious friends like to eat here because you can get a healthy, filling meal that's not swimming in oil. Plus the portions are big enough to have some leftover for tomorrow's lunch! \n\nYou can choose a bowl or plate, then pick your protein. Options include chicken breast, spicy chicken, orange chicken, beef and teriyaki tofu. Then you add white or brown rice, (noodles and fried rice are other options for an additional charge) and mac salad or a house salad. They also have appetizers including edamame and cream cheese wontons, egg rolls and potstickers. They may be a bit pricier than other chains, but I think the quality is better. If you have never been, I suggest you try the spicy chicken bowl with mac salad and brown rice. The flavors will make your mouth sing happy songs!
