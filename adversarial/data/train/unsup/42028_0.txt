In from out of town, i picked up strep throat and caught an uber here to see a doctor on Christmas morning. They were so polite and efficient. Listened to me and didnt condescend. I was out of there in 40 min. I didnt have insurance and it cost me $100. Very professional and compassionate. They saved our trip!
