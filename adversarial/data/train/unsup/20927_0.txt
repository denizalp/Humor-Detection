Ordered some ramen for delivery from this place.. Overall the food was very mediocre and the service was great however towards the end of my meal, I chewed on something that almost broke my tooth... After investigating, and showing everyone around me, we came to the conclusion that it was very obviously a piece of gravel\/stone... \n\nThe ramen was definitely not worth a visit to the dentist.
