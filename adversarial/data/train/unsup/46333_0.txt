I really had a taste for the Shanghai Trio......everything was meh, the sauce wasn't reduced so the rice was floating, the shrimp & scallops totally flavorless (yes, steamed or poached seafood can still have some flavor).....Such a disappointment\n\n***Note:  Ask Landry's Select Club members how they wish to pay, never assume.....This will prevent any issues later
