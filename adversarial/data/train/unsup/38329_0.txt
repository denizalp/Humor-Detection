This place was great, then it sucked. Now it's great again. For low price food of better than low price quality I figure they're breaking even at best. They need the local trade to support the neighborhood market so after years of trade they found the sweet spot. It's five stars are not meant to imply an equivalence with the best restaurants but in comparison with its peers like Arizona Charles, Suncoast, the Palms and the Cannery. The food is really good enough to eat and you can still get the iconic buffet dessert-lemon meringue pie. It always takes some discipline not to over eat and be gluttonous only with thine eyes. There is enough fresh food and non- fried entries to be good on the salad and meal so you can be a little bad on the sweets.
