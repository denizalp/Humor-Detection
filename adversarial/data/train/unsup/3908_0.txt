This is a fine Starbucks.  We were here to pick up a quick coffee and be on our way.  The wifi was strong and happily used.  The seating here was comfy too.  I'm not a usual Starbucks patron, but I liked my Latte.  My companion had a cold coffee of some sort that ended up being given to a homeless person we passed on out way back up Youngs.  \n\nThey were training a new employee and from what I heard it's a comprehensive training program.  Always interesting to hear things like that.  \n\n3 stars for this chain.
