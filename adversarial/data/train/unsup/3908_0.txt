Had the meat omelet that was supposed to be \"loaded\" with meat, but was instead sprinkled with meat. Toast comes in large slices, but heard from the couple at the neighboring table that we could all grow a year older waiting on jelly, so they shared their extra jars with us. They also shared their Tabasco sauce. Service was slow and nothing to write home about. We didn't know who to tip at the end of our meal...our server or the adjacent table who loaded us up with condiments b\/c they were quite helpful.
