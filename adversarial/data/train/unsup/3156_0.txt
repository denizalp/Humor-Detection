I visited Pugliano's prior to a work meeting. With little breakfast in my belly, I was glad for a warm meal. I visited on a Friday and there were plenty of lunch specials.\n\nGiven it was during Lent (and boy do I love me a fish sandwich!), I chose the cod sandwich for my meal. When it arrived, the fish was overcooked to the point where I couldn't take a bite because it was so tough. This is fish, people! If it's too tough to eat there is a major problem.\n\nOverall the restaurant was fine, but looked a little outdated. The seating was very tight and I kept getting bumped up a chair behind me or the moving aside for a waitress to walk through.\n\nI'm glad I got some lunch in me, but I won't be back.
