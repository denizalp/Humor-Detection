3  just for the sushi. Sushi is always good and fresh...if only the servers were able to provide good service. I mean, they don't even have to serve food...just keep the patron's drinks full (1 refill in an hour and a half). Apparently that's too much though. But Bora sure brought the bill in a timely manner.
