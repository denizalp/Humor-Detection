Second time in two weeks but it doesn't change my last experience.  \nLike last time I ordered the smoke salmon egg benidick.  Instead of letting them cook how they want; I told the server to have my pouch egg medium.  But....... I was Exteremly runny...... Other than the doness of the eggs; the rest of the plate is yummy.  The smoke salmon has nice apply smoke favor but is not salty.  The English muffin is the best I've ever had so far in toronto.  One thing I should highlight is the harshbrown, it was in prefect texture with a bit of carrot in it.
