Never eat here, ever. My friends and I are scarred for life and we from now on will stick to safe late night breakfast places. \n\nOur server was crazy, legitimately insane. She rambled on and on and on and immediately started picking on my friend who was clumsy and spilled a drink. So we cleaned up the mess because it was our fault, the server brings her another drink but this time it was in a to go cup and she says to my friend \"You better not spill this one or I'll have to cut you.\" And while she was saying this she pulls out her pink knife and clicks it open. What do we do in a situation where my best friends life is threatened? We laugh trying to diffuse the situation and make the crazy lady go away. She did after 10 minutes  of discussing how she hated her Hispanic lazy sister in law. After she leaves my other now silent friend whispers to me don't order anything that could harm you. I asked her why and she said simply \"I saw a bug.\" Great. Cockroaches are now added to our horrible experience. We all got a singular waffle and ate very quickly after that. We left as fast as we could. As soon as I got home I took a very long hot shower and changed into clean non Waffle House smelly clothes. Thankfully I didn't get sick but I will never again set foot inside that establishment. Ugh.
