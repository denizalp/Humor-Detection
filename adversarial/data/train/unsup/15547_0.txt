This place was meh.\nThe idea is cool..assembly line pizza.  And the choices of toppings were plentiful.\nAnd even the pizza tasted ok..i like the wood-fired oven niche.\nBUT..it was WAY undercooked. My pizza arrived supper soggy..except for the very outer 2 inches, all the way around.\nAlso, my friend attempted to get a drink from the bar, like someone had done a min. before him. And the girl back there had her back to the room, with her nose in her phone...for a good 5 minutes. My friend stood there for 5 mins...and she just was going to town on her phone.\nNot coming back.  Not impressed AT ALL.
