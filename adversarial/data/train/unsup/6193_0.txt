I have been to this BW3 a few times and I confess - I like it. I don't understand the appeal of wings, but now that I know they have boneless wings, I'll be back more often! I tried the honey bbq which had a little bit of spice to it, but was really good (I don't tend to like real spicy foods). Would like to try another sauce next time.\n\nFun atmosphere, wait staff has always been attentative and offered refills which keeps me happy!, and the food is good.\n\nRecommend you give it a try!
