I don't care how many interior designers you hired to hodge-podge together your \"authentic\" Southern d√©cor, Lucille. Your screen door opens onto a suburban mall parking lot. \n\nPorch chairs from the '40s, old-timey chandeliers and your great aunt's wallpaper. The only thing missing from this fake Old South experience is a whites-only drinking fountain. Guess the marketing folks thought that might be just a bit *too* authentic.\n\nThe other thing missing? Flavor. Sure, you heap on the sides and your fried green tomatoes are tasty, but this pulled pork is dry and boring, there's too much sugary crap in my cocktail and my biscuit is like a butter-covered rock. \n\nMight I add: You mention \"St. Louis-style\" left and right, which I do believe is north of the Mason-Dixon line. So unless you want to argue the effects of the Missouri Compromise, I'm pretty sure St. Louis ain't part of the South you're trying reeeeeal hard to imitate. Even more baffling, your website says the original Lucille got all her recipes from her grandma in Greenville. So which is it? \n\nIt's neither. It's a corporate creation myth written by some copywriter in an office park in Thousand Oaks who was told to make the brand \"feel real.\"\n\nAnd it does feel real. Real boring.
