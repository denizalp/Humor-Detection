Despite my initial hesitation at trying one of their sandwiches (they have one that is made withSun-Dried Tomato peanut butter, bacon bits, lettuce AND cream cheese) I caved and checked it out.  \n\nIt's a cute little place.  They give you animal crackers with every sandwich and the first drink they list on the menu is milk.  Awww.  It just fits right in with all the little kid stores in that area of the mall.  Makes me almost forget the image of peanut butter and bacon bits.\n\nI did find a sandwich that I could get behind though, the LATTE DA.  It's made with European Caf Mocha peanut butter, pretzels twists and marshmallow spread.  Delicious.  My sister says that it shouldn't count as a meal, that it's more of a dessert, what with the marshmallow and all.  Whatever.  I'm an adult and I'm eating marshmallows and peanut butter for lunch if I want to.  So there.
