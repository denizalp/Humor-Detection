This place was so damn hard to find and those AARP members wielding those \"how may I help you?\" signs were no help at all. \n\nNote: the bakery is separate from the restaurant, it's on the lower floor where everything's at, near the convention center I think. \n\nI came here based on Yelp reviews and of course I came here for the MACARONS! The eggshell-like cookie texture and soft, supple, and oozing center was on point and I suppose this is how an authentic macaron should be but I'm sure they don't compare to the ones from the Laduree in Paris. I hear the ones in Bottega Louie come close - my next target.\n\nThe macaron is like a mature, sophisticated, cultured, flamboyant, confident, well-dressed and sexy version of an oreo for all you macaron virgins (better yet, just look at the fuckin' pictures).\n\nI got the packaged variety pack which cost around $17 and the price is worth every shining penny; definitely grab one, it includes 6 delightful pieces of art (each equivalent to an hour at the gym). The Pistachio macaron in particular was a tad larger than all the others (I've been told that Pistachio is the preeminent flavour to which all others will be judged) and this flavour was by far the best to lay on my hurricane tongue.\n\nThey have a plethora of other French\/European pastries and stuff so I can't vouch for how exquisite they are or explain the nuances between the various croissants and what not. \n\nGood luck finding the damn place; the search is worth it. The chick manning the register was a doll :-)
