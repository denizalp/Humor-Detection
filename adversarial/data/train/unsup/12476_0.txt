Check my ratings...I tell it like it is and fellow Yelpers love it. \n\nThus, you can imagine my surprise upon discovering that my post (the original and first of  Dallas Horton) has gone missing...\n\nNonetheless, I commend the following Yelpers for warning us of attorney antics: \"Lisa K\" exposed Adam S. Kutner while \"and o\" exposed Wright & Weiner (oddly, searching Wright & Weiner directly yields NO review so search for user \"and o\" to get the true story).\n\nThe above \"first\" reviews are accurate summaries of \"just a number\" treatment that is all too common from personal injury attorneys.  They reflect, almost exactly, my own experience.\n\nWe all know the \"devil is in the details\" and in these cases, the devil has been caught red handed.  Attorneys that victimize by acting \"above the law\", performing sub-par legal work and outright ignoring clients has consequences.\n                                                 \n                                             AMBULANCE CHASER ???\n\nAlthough no accusations are implied, his firm's location is prime for \"ambulance chasing\". His office is literally right around the corner from Harmon Medical & Rehabilitation Hospital, two blocks from Kindred Hospital (Flamingo campus), one block from Kindred Hospital (Desert Springs campus) and last but not least, Progressive Hospital is only four blocks away...facts are facts folks....FOUR hospitals within short walking distance. You know what they say about real estate...location, location, location.\n\nTo top it off his office address is on Eastern Ave., one of the most busy streets in Clark County and a great vantage point to hear ambulances on a daily basis. Also, the Eastern & Flamingo intersection (one and a half blocks from his office) is one of the top two auto accident prone areas in Clark County.  \nSo, honestly, do you really think his office location is coincidence ?? Where there's smoke there's fire. Enough said.\n\nThe facts of my personal injury story are similar to what other Yelpers have shared:\n\n1. Mr. Horton was quick to \"assess\" my case and fraudulently declared I  would receive \"...alot of money...\" for my injuries.  \n\n2. He then proceeded to promise, and then reneged on handling my property damage claim.\n\n3. Without discussing (as legally required) with me a low-ball offer from the insurance company, he demanded I come to his office and sign said offer.\n\n4. Due to my refusal of said first offer the insurance compnay put forth another low-ball offer that Horton told me \"...this is all you are going to get...\"\n\n5. From here on out his firm did nothing to advocate for the clear value of  my injuries...letting my case stagnate.\n\n6. Clearly, he completely dropped the ball.  Adding insult to injury, his staff  was rude and evasive. \n7. When I ultimately fired his firm they made it difficult for me to get my  records from his office in order to \"punish\" me for exposing their incompetence.\n\n8. His demanded fees\/costs for his incompetent \"legal work\" were severely  \ninflated. Many attorneys profit, excessively, (see other injury attorney posts on Yelp) from your pain with a smile on THEIR face.\n\n9. I went on to represent myself successfully and was awarded much more  than what Horton told me I'd \"...be able to get...\".\n\nSurprised ?  Most vicitms can't represent themselves so they suffer needlessly at the hands of a greedy attorney.\n\nForget complaining to the State Bar...its run by attorneys.  So the Bar says they \"discipline\"attorneys ? How are you to confirm said attorney actually paid a fine...if they even were fined ?  \nDon't waste your time. It's the classic \"good 'ol boy\" arrangement...attorneys in bed with attorneys. Make a PUBLIC record by suing the attorney yourself.\n\nFurther, don't be fooled by Horton's warm and fuzzy adverting campaign that  positions him as the \"country boy\" from TX. That may be where he's from but he forgot to pack integrity, empathy, sincerity and ethics when he moved to Vegas.\n\nNOTE:  Most attorneys perk up, grow empathy and actually work for the clients that are most likely to earn them BIG fees (notice how MOST attorney websites brag of a few multi-million dollar settlements)...the rest of us be damned since the \"...money isn't there...\" for THEM to pursue a meritorious case. Thus, for the average accident victim, attorneys prevent you from getting the justice YOU deserve.\n\nObviously, running a law firm in this manner is against the propaganda \"..we work hard for all clients...\" yet it happens day in and day out regardless of the \"oath\" all attorneys swear to which states they are to represent client's  interests (not attorney pocket books) to the fullest degree. \n\nWhat a joke.\n\nWant more PROOF of Horton's pattern of  corrupt conduct ? \n\nSearch for Dallas Horton on \"ripoffreport\" and \"wildwildlaw.blogspot\" (March of Morons). \n\n...see for yourself.
