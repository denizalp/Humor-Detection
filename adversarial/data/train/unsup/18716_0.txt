Sarah L and I have never had a bad time here. For some reason we often end up here when no one else is around, and one or more of us has a laptop, and we get to drinking, and five-way-Skyping and incredible times ensue.\n\nOr we'll show up and and before we know it we were knee deep in a fundraiser featuring stand-up comedy. This kind of thing happens a lot at The Central where there is something going on almost every night. Live music, comedy, parties, DJs, what-have-you is always on the schedule.\n\nDownstairs features a diminutive bar, their main dining space and a little stage (where the aforementioned comedy took place) for gigs. Upstairs features a more chill space with loungy area with couches and a TV. I believe there is also a patio up there, which combined with the large streetfacing patio brings their count to TWO. Impressive.\n\nThe foodstuffs are surprisingly decent and reasonably pricied. I remember the dip platter being more food than any quantity of people could handle and being delicious too. Hoorah!\n\nObligatory Title Pun: This place is in the MIDDLE of all the action.\n\nMenu Readability: It's ALL right. I like the use of black stock.\n\nNeed to mention: They have Amsterdam, Wellington and Creemore Springs on draught. Pints are $5.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: The formula for fun is Sarah L + Laptops + Beer.
