Terrible. The family went there for my sister's birthday dinner tonight. The place was less than half full (12 people in addition to our party) but it still took over an hour to finally get our food, closer to 90 minutes actually and we weren't an exceptionally large party, 14 people and 2 of them were children of 5 years.\n\nMy sister-in-law's steak was so over-cooked it was inedible. My brother's liver dinner was like rubber. Another brother's fish sandwich wasn't even assembled, he got a small piece of fish on a plate with a bun and a piece of lettuce on the side that he had to ask for after the fish was delivered. My nephew's fries were burned and inedible. They also have no appreciation for food allergies, I have a mild allergy to root vegetables, especially onions. I ordered cole slaw as the side for my sandwich, 99% of the time a very safe choice vs a salad for me, There was nothing stated on the menu that there are onions in the cole slaw and who puts onions in cole slaw anyway? I realized it after I tasted it, I just hope I'm not up all night with a reaction to it.\n\nWe were seated by the kitchen, the profanity coming from the kitchen was inexcusable, unprofessional and inappropriate, especially with 2-5 year old children right outside.\n\nThe only saving grace was our waitress, she tried her best to keep us all happy but unfortunately couldn't do anything about the quality of the food or the kitchen staff. I hope that she soon finds a new job at a better place. None of my family members will be returning there.
