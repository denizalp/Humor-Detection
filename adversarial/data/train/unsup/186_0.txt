The food is good - typical of any Paradise Bakery. Good breads, meats, salads and the cookies.\n  The facility is great, but parking is horrible.\n  The reason for the low score is the staff. It seemed like they were all moving under water. The sandwich guy may have been the slowest person I've ever seen. Lethargic would be a good description.
