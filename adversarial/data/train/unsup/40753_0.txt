A Chill local bar a staple in the area for those who enjoy a good burger it's one of your best options in Phoenix. It's a family-friendly and despite an earlier reviewer Asian friendly Bar and Grill the customers are cool except a some crochety old guy that comes in on the weekend(mornings)in a red truck but a great atmosphere and the new owner Vinny is on top of things he's kind of a hunk too LOL
