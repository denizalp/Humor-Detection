Seeing KA was my very first time seeing a Cirque Du Soleil show! I've been to Vegas a bunch of times, but this was the first time that I've had the chance to see a Cirque show and I was SO excited!\n\nTickets & Pricing:\nYou can buy them online or buy them in person from either the KA box office or ticket selling vendors out on the strip. We got our tix from Tix4Tonight at $87\/person, but if you have a party of 4 or more, you should definitely get your tix online! We saw a deal online for the same show at $69\/person for a group of 4.\n\nLocation & Theatre:\nYou have to travel to the south side of the strip to the MGM Grand Hotel. The entrance to the theatre itself is colorful, and the guys that check your tickets and let you in are all dressed up in costume, too! Then they send you either to the left or right up a ramping hallway into a huge and dimly lit theatre.\n\nOnce you're in the theatre, even before the show starts, there's fire shooting up from the \"stage\" area, performers running around the pirate ship-esque scaffolding to the left & right sides of the theatre, and whispering sounds coming out of small speakers IN THE CHAIR behind you head! The whispering totally freaked me out at first because I thought I was hearing things...and my bf's response at first was \"What sounds? I don't hear anything...\" lol. \n\nPerformance:\nYou definitely have to think about Cirque shows as a circus performance on crack & steroids and with a storyline. That being said, there were acrobats, choreographed fights, sliks, a \"clown\" type scene, balance acts and more.\n\nMy bf is an engineer and he LOVED the stage itself. I don't personally understand how it works, but it was essentially a large platform that could move in whichever direction you could image---up, down, left, right, it tilted at all angles, and at one point became a wall (instead of a floor) that people were performing on.\n\nTons of special effects throughout the entirety of the show. Fire, mist\/smoke, wire work, a jungle scene where huge \"vine\" poles came down from the ceiling, a bucking ship (imagine a bull machine in a bar...but it's a small ship w\/ ppl on it), a flying bird machine, and all kinds of fun stuff.\n\nThe one trick I'll always remember from the show though, was the human hamster wheel on crack. Two human-sized hamster wheels connected across a center point around which they can turn (like a fan). One guy in each wheel, they somehow manage to get the entire \"fan\" to rotate, then one guy gets OUT of his wheel to start running around the OUTSIDE of the wheel instead of running inside. It was crazy! Then he starts jumping rope while on the outside of his wheel, while it's spinning around the center point. I swear he almost fell at one point...\n\nOverall:\nAnywho, it was a great show and I had a great time! I don't like spending a lot of money upfront when I don't really know what I'm spending it on, but I totally understood what I was paying for after seeing the show!
