This is the worst place for pizza in downtown Scottsdale or any downtown. I have come wandering in here after many nights of drinking and never could pull the trigger on a slice. They are nasty, greasy looking triangles that will set you back at least 5 bucks for one slice. My buddy used to get the slices and always said he would never order one again, but he was from Canada and kept choking it down. I think it was because he drank liquor and that further clouded his judgement and my pleas to \"don't do it.\" It is a husband and wife team and they are always texting or on the phone when you walk inside and the place is never open either. Consider yourself lucky if you arrive one night and they are closed.
