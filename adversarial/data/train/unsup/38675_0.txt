The BLT was good. The chicken wings, thighs were ok but the chicken breasts were very tough. The biscuits were slightly undercooked (kind of doughy) . I realize however that they were extremely busy when we were there so maybe that could account for the problems with the food. Drinks were good . Cauliflower side dish was cold. The service was very good.
