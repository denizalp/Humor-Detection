I went back. My girlfriend had some passes for the outdoor spa and I decided to give this place another chance. I'm glad I did too because the experience was much better than the last. The customer service staff were very friendly, the facility was very clean, and most importantly, it was actually relaxing!\n\nLast time I came here, the staff was incredibly rude and most pools were closed, so this experience was definitely a step up. \n\nWhat I liked:\n\nLots of pools of varying temps to choose from.\nWas crowded but never felt crowded; always a private spot nearby.\nBeautiful fire to warm up by.\nWas offered free locks and waters. Also given a coupon for our next visit along with a scented candle (nice touch!).\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\nChanging room is small (men's).\nThere is a much larger changing room located in the middle of the layout (nowhere near the entrance) which is much more accommodating and nicer looking.\nParking was full and far.\nPrices are still outrageous for anything other than a spa pass. Mind you, won't fault them for that since prices are similar to competitors. \n\nGreat experience.
