Used to come here when I was younger and recently came back for the first time to rebleach my roots!~\n\nThey're right next door from where I work so it's super convenient for me! :3\n\nWorkers are really nice and friendly and they try to make you comfortable!~\nThe prices are actually pretty reasonable depending on what you're getting done.\nI always ask for Danny (he's super skilled with long hair) but it might be more expensive to get your hair done by him, so if you're just getting a trim you can just walk in!\n\nThe cut is always great but the one thing that I don't really like would be the spacing of the place. I had to sit on a separate chair in a different \"station\" to process my hair (the \"station\" being a chair against a partition). Other than the layout of the actual stations, the actual hair cutting is fine.\nWill come back next time to colour my hair again~
