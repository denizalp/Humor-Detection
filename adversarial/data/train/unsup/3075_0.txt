Our server was pleasant but our meal took FOREVER to come out. We got there at 1945 and did not get our dinner until 2100, AFTER I said something. My chicken was lukewarm and the mussels in the clam bake were gritty with a fishy smell to it.  Portions were small and unimpressive. Interestingly, they took care of the next table's bill while all the manager could tell us is \"I'm sorry we just opened two weeks ago\"... I wonder if it's because my table was Asian descent while the other is all blondes... NEVER COMING BACK HERE. DO NOT RECOMMEND.
