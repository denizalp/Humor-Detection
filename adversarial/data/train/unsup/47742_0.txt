I have been buying music gear here since I was 14 years old and I am 44 now. Jim Minch is the star of the show. I can't think of anyone more knowledgeable about the music industry and instruments in this valley. Fred is my other go to guy, very very knowledgeable. I see some bad reviews here and I have to say that I think these guys (sales staff) are not high pressure salesmen. They will ask if you need help but otherwise they'll leave you alone until you're ready with any questions. Jim and Fred will always work with you on price and they have always stood behind the gear they sell. I had bought a set of Cobalt pickups for my Tele that Don sold me a few years ago. I called Jim up a couple days later, not knowing what else to say, I told him, I just didn't like the pickups. He told me to clean them up and put them back in the original packaging and he will take care of it. He got me a set of the Vintage Noiseless and I simply payed the difference. Can't say enough good things about Milano Music.
