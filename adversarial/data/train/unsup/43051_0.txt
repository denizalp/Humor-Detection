I really don't know why these reviews aren't higher. I know a lot of people who have gotten great work done here, so when my roommate and I made a spontaneous decision to get another tattoo, this was the only place that came to mind. \n\nWe didn't follow the usual protocol - make and appointment, get a drawing, make another appointment to get tattooed. I understand why they have this policy, but our tattoo wasn't too large or complicated, so we walked in. We were prepared to be there for awhile, which turned out to be about four hours (1 1\/2 for the actual tattoo). \n\nBoth of ours came out even better than we were expecting.  I can't remember the names of our tattoo artists, but they were very talented. It was a bit pricey, but to worth it. Obviously, if you're permanently marking your body you should be willing to spend some extra cash to ensure its an amazing tattoo. \n\nThis is always my #1 recommendation for a tattoo place in Pittsburgh.
