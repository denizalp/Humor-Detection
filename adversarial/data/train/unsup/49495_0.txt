Not a great place to dine. I am staying at the motel so thought I would check out the restaurant in case I had some dinner meetings.   Hostess and waiter were nice and courteous.  Small and not too crowded.  Menu is fairly limited.  I had onion soup for an appetizer.  It was ok, not great.  For the main course I had a seared scallop and shrimp plate.  2 of each.   I actually sent it back as it was pretty non warm when I got the meal. (after a very long wait).  They brought it back seared more with the plate very warm.  It was ok. No real zest to it.  Maybe I wasn't that hungry after the long wait.  I am going to give it 2 stars.  For the price I will try a different restaurant tomorrow.
