They were great! I discovered one of our two AC's had quit blowing cold air last Friday night at 6pm. I called Duke's and left a message. Tonya called me right back from her cell after hours and asked some clarifying questions and if we had an emergency or could wait till 7am the next morning as she could have her tech stop after he finished his last job if needed. We decided on the next morning and ran some fans because the 2nd AC was still working. Robert was there on time the next morning. He diagnosed the problem and was very no pressure with solutions! I had already replaced the same part on my other unit a few months earlier and luckily it was an easy fix! \n\nI appreciated reading all of the positive reviews on Yelp. They are a great local company with Midwest values which we appreciate!
