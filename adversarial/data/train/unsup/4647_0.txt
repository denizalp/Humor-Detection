I have now seen Shania twice and I have to say, I wasn't really a fan of her music before I saw her show, but I am now.\n\nHer live show showcases a little bit of everything from her portfolio. A majority of the songs she performs in the show are themed to match the music video for that particular song. There are also quite a few times where she interacts with the audience and actually goes into the audience to interact and shake hands with her fans. She really has that star quality and you can see why her fans are so loyal and drawn to her.\n\nThe show is broken up into themes. Starting with of her hits, then transitions into more of her country music, a little a Capella which is beautiful and then ends with some more of her well-known hits. \n\nA great all-around show and I highly recommend it to anyone even if country isn't normally your thing.
