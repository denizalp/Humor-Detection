Great location and Great selection.\n\nIf you happen to be staying on the strip or shopping at Town Square, Total Wine built a brand new location for convenience. When driving on Las Vegas Blvd, you can easily see it.  The entrance is a little awkward but manageable.  The parking lot is huge and accommodating.  \n\nLike most of their locations, it is a well laid out store so you can find exactly what you want. Their stores are consistently well organized with somewhat of the same layout.  Check out was quick and effortless.  I usually find their pricing competitive with the other liquor stores around Vegas. \n\nIt's 5 o'clock somewhere right?
