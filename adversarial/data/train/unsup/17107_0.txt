This pool it was awesome!\nLove our private cabana! \n\nMy daughter got to relax and watch tv in between swimming and soaking up the summer sun  \n\nThe pool was big with a volleyball net in the middle.\n\nThere was a bar that had decent prices. \n\nI'll be going back again soon, I really enjoyed my tome here!
