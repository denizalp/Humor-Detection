Don't get me wrong - I love Ulta. I've been a Platnium member for years. \n\nThe girls who work at this store just don't have enough knowledge as other Ulta locations. They also don't carry lancome makeup which is annoying. There is always a long line at the register. I've had to ask the cashier to call additional employees to ring. \n\nI will walk out of your store and not buy anything if you make me wait a long time to get rung up.\n\nSalon was meh - I got a decent hair cut but the blow out? More like a blow up. My hair looked better when I air dry it. They don't know how to properly do a blow out.
