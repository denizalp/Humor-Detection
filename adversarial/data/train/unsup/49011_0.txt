Great place for locals, easy to find. Had the Lasagna with meatballs, excellent very generous portions,great price point. I try and eat here once a week, also have eaten the spaghetti with sausage. Pasta is homemade and it tastes like it, along with the sauce. The owner is a cool guy who actually cooks too. Not many places left like this anymore. Check it out
