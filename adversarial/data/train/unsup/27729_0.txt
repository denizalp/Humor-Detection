New experience with Persian food on my wife's birthday along with our daughter. Small place, nice authentic ambiance, attentive service, new flavors indeed...is it fantastic? not that much, I am not sure how rhubarb fits the Persian meal? portions are SMALL, lamb tastes very good but 3 small pieces in the main course and I like to eat meat, main course for $15.50 mainly..OK to try...the eggplant kashk-e bademjaan dip was good..not cheap for $7.95...reservation is preferred.
