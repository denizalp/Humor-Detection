A see-and-be-seen tanning joint?  Of course!  Why not?!  \n\nFor those of us unfortunate enough not to have a trust fund (yes, there are a few folks in town) and to have to work during prime sunning hours, there is Darque Tan.  \n\nConvienently located across the street from LA Fitness on Scottsdale and McDowell, you too can be a part of the gym-then-tanning or tannning-then-gym crowd.  \n\nThis is a mostly membership situation, where you are either a member, and pay a lot, or you arent a member and pay a ton.  Actually, I think their monthly membership prices, while a tad steep (since you still pay each time you tan anyway unless youre in a level 1 bed), are still very comparable to other local tanners.  \n\nI'm already confusing myself on pricing.  Alicia put it best, they know what theyre talking about, give 'em a call.\n\nThe lobby, bathrooms and beds are always spotless, front desk and cleaning staff is friendly and efficient, and their beds work really well.  They have both regular beds, stand-ups and spray tanning so you can fry away to your hearts content.  \n\nEveryone needs a tan in Arizona, especially if you want to look skinnier than you are.  And who doesnt want that?  If you cant make it to the pool every weekend and lake is just out of reach, Darque Tan is your new best friend.
