Five star in every category. Let's start with service !\n\nService was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. \nFood: we ordered a couple things and everything was amazing\nRobata: we got the lamp chops, pork belly (perfectly seared on the outside and satisfying texture on the inside), salt and pepper squid. \nEntree: we got A5 wagyu beef and seabass. Even though we only ordered 2oz on the wagyu order, it was served in a beautifully decorated plate with lots veggie and dipping sauce. Half way through the wagyu we were pretty full. Seabass is by far the best ever had, also perfectly seared on the skin to give crispy yet chewy texture and extremely tender inside. Sushi orders and oysters were extremely fresh! We also added wagyu gyoza which was perfectly balanced with the squash pur√©e dressing. Soooo good. \n\nWe ordered a couple cocktails and a bottle of sake. Everything was good.\n\nI'm already thinking of coming back the next day!
