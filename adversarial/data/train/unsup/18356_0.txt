Beautiful, Exciting, Amazed, and a Tremendous show to check out. \n\nI have never seen a fountain show quite like this one at the Belliagos. Everything about this fountain show is coordinated so perfectly. The music and water are all in sync and in rythm. It is such a great show. \n\nYou must check it out. The show is good during the day, but even more better at night time. Truly one of those attractions that makes Las Vegas such a great city.\n\nDuring the day, shows run every 30 minutes and there is less of a crowd. During the evenings, it runs every 15 minutes until almost midnight. Do come early to try to get a good spot. \n\nFor a much unique view of the show is to go up the Effiel Tower and watch it from high above. \n\nIt also happens to be a free show as well. \n\nDo take pictures and videos for a good memory.
