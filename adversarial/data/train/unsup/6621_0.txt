Lorenzo our server was fantastic.  If it was breakfast at the bar w\/ Lauren and JP, fantastic as well!  If the chef would put the Chicken Cordon Bleu back on the menu on Sunday's, then the Grand Cafe would get a regular 5 stars from many more patrons.  \n\nSpa breakfast is the BEST w\/ a Crisp Turkey Bacon & whole wheat English muffin.  Lots of Cholula, very healthy and I substitute the poco de gallo w\/ avocado.\n\nMy GVR BLT, added horseradish, and dad's $9.99 baby back ribs were tasty and we both finished our meals!  Mom's fish n chips were not so good.  We shared everything and the fish batter was soggy!  The fries were unsalted and bland.  \n\nService from Lorenzo gets a 5 stars!  I wish we could review on service and food separately.  Two meals were great, one was horrible!  \n\nWith the GVR players card, you get the discounted price.  When I went to pay the bill in front, it got complicated leaving the tip on my cc, unlike when I sit at the bar.  Another reason I give less stars.  People behind us were shaking there head and honestly the cashier should know how this all works.  \n\nUpdate.. when we got home our credit card was charged twice for the $8 tip we left.\n\nOn the super upside, I love how they support breast cancer awareness and make amazing treats yearly!  Love the pastry chefs!!  I will be back and hopefully update my review to a better rating.
