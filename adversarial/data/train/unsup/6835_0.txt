THE WORST FUCKING INTERNET SERVICE EVER! I've had century link less than 6 months and I've had a technician out 3 different times. I work from home and this is a HUGE inconvenience not being able to use the internet. Once again the internet doesn't work. Yesterday I was told it would be up and running at 6 am, but at 7:38pm the shit still doesn't work. Upon calling century link I'm told there is yet another line issue. Lol. BS ass expensive ass worthless ass internet provider. I couldn't even cancel my service because their systems were down!! What a fuckin joke!!! \n\nCox please don't fail me!!!!
