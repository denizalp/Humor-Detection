I called 2 weeks in advance to secure a makeup appointment for an engagement session photo shoot.  I confirmed multiple times that the salon was in fact open on Easter Sunday. The gentleman on the phone confirmed that yes they were open and that they would see me on Easter Sunday.  Well much to my surprise when i showed up on time for my appointment the salon doors were locked and all the lights were off. Nobody bothered to call and let me know that they would be closed. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED and left without a makeup artist on such short notice. Thanks Stevie Danielle for ruining my Easter Sunday.
