Staff are extremely helpful and nice!  I love this location!  Just beware when it gets late and close to closing because the rowdy high school teenagers that live across the street at the apartments walk around the parking lot area causing chaos.  Last time they were racing stolen shopping carts and almost hit my brand new car.
