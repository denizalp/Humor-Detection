From the owner of Joe Beef, a restaurant where those not-so-adventurous foodies can eat. Liverpool House has a rotating menu, so many reviews have mentioned specific dishes that were nowhere on the menu. However, I will mention what was on the menu yesterday when I snagged an awesome last-minute table. There is one main dining room and the bar area- totally decked out in Canadiana- deer antlers and row boat oars. Great artwook on the walls. We sat in front of the dinner menu and throughout people had to come stand near us to take a look at the options du jour.  This could be a great way to meet some new friends!\nService was great in french and english explaining all the wacky dishes and preparations. They also aren`t bad for the eyes...\nEntrees range from $9-20 and run the gamut from Huitres (oysters) to steak taco. I tried the gnocci, as I try to do at any place that serves this dish.  It was creamy and soft- obviously made within the day.  \nPlats (main dishes) run from $25-50 for the lobster spaghetti, which I saw and it has pretty much a whole lobster on top!  Most are in the $30 range. Of the fish options, artic char or dor√©, I opted for the char with a `crust`of shrimp. Awe-inspiring and tasty. This had to be the biggest peice of char I have ever seen, and the smallest plate at my table.  The pintade (guinea fowl) was served on a platter and was the size of half a chicken. The rabbit could have served two, but my SO managed to finish it off!  No room for dessert, which is maybe why they only have 3 options. No matter, they all looked good. \nThe drink selection is great which wine by the glass and a whole other wall-sized chalk board to review the wines by the bottle.  \nAt the end of the meal, I stepped to the other side of the table to the hallway labeled, `pipi room`. After a bloody ceasar (served with oyster on top) and one glass of wine left me giggling all the way home.
