This T & T is so much more expensive that the other t & t 's in Markham. I came here a few times, the layout is similar to other locations. Parking is easy to find, but driving here is horrific because people just push their shopping carts out on the mini crossing area without looking and I swear it takes forever for a car to drive through. There's also poles covering the pedestrians so it's harder for cars to see.\n\nWhy I rated it one star? The specials as shown in the flyers are the same, but EVERYTHING ELSE, literally everything is more expenisve. I had to go to another t&t in the same day because it was so overpriced. Fruits an be 1.5 times to 3 times the prices of other stores. Also, when you check out, you have to purchase a bag, thought from what I know, other locations just give you a bag.
