Friday afternoon at 3:50pm 19 people in line. One teller open and drive up teller is closed. See picture. Worst experience in a bank I've encountered. Avoid. See picture.\n\nYelp keeps throwing this review onto my sign in screen saying I need to finish the review, so perhaps they need to hire someone? Word count passed.
