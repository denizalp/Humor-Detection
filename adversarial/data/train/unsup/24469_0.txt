Ok I agree that the owner(s) may be quirky.  Adds to the charm of the place as far as I am concerned.  I went there on Wednesday only to discover they don't open until 10 am.  Thought that was kinda weird for a bakery. Went back the next day @ 4 and there wasn't alot left but what was there looked fab.\nLet me explain I am not a fan of most european bakeries sweets because they are well......... just too sweet.  I do love the breads and the pretzels.  I also love a good plain coffee roll, strudel, ect.  Not sweet but more on the flakey flavorful side of things.   So while I skipped the eclairs, kreme horns, ect I did try a coffee roll and a french baquette. \nLet me say that it is the BEST french baquette I have had since I was in Europe.  Hands down.  The coffee roll was my breakfast the next morning and frankly I almost went right than to buy more of them.\nYummo! \nTo top it off, the elderly lady in front of me ordered a loaf of sliced bread and then discovered she didn't have any cash or her check book and was embarrased to tears.  The owner GAVE her the bread.  Some might say 'big deal it was only 3 bucks\" to which I say YES it is a big deal.   Kindness is always a big deal to me.  I will go back to this quirky kind place with great food.
