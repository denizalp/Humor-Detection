casual vegas dinner away in chinatown...upstairs plaza second floor...yakitori in izakaya fashion...beers, sake and shochu...japanese small plates dining...a pitcher of beer while browsing...standard skewers...beef tongue chewy, but not tough...hamachi kama juicy and meaty...large rolls fat for sharing...average in presentation, quality and taste...another pitcher of beer washing...wings, bacon wrapped mochi, agadashi tofu and additional skewers...standard izakaya selection...nothing memorable in presentation or taste, but cheap!...finish and back to the strip!
