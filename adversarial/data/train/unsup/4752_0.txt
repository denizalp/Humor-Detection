It's really difficult to add anything original here because everyone else has already said it, but this place is simply amazing!  I have never tried anything here that I didn't like.  Their lattes especially are delicious.  The iced chai tastes very similar to Starbucks, for anyone who has become vegan and is no longer able to drink Starbucks chai because it has honey in it.  I also recommend the raspberry mocha.\n\nAll of their cupcakes and the McBagel and the burritos are great, too.\n\nJust try the whole menu.  You won't regret it.
