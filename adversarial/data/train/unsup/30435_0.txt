3 thumbs up! We had breakfast here and decided on the build your own omelette.It was perfectly done with the sliced avocado placed decoratively on top and the hash browns had melted cheese .Add to it a generous helping of toast and it all looked and tasted awesome.\nThe price was not cheap but normal for this type of place and this type of food.I highly recommend this place!
