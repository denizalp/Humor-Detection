I went in for two new tires to match the tires I purchased at a competitor and the price was outrageous with tons of add-ons.   In the interest of time, I moved forward.   Then came the alignment scam.   Sir, your alignment is out of place, would you like us to do an alignment.   I responded that I thought I paid for that already and I have never had such a question asked at their competitors.   They said that they check the alignment for free and then I checked my invoice, and they charge $19.99 to check.\n\nWhat an overpriced, scam.
