This place just opened up next to my work and I couldn't be happier. I'm not one for fast food at all but 24\/7 with alcoholic freezes makes me excited. Place is always going to be busy but quick line because of quick service. I think most people think it's a big deal here, which it isn't because at the end of the day your still eating Taco Bell.....\n\nIf it's late or your drunk I'm sure this place will rock your world.\n\nThe steak quesadilla actually wasn't too bad. I mainly go there for the Baja Blast alone. Now I can spike it with vodka ;p
