We left empty handed and frustrated tonight after paying for two iced coffees. We asked three times for 'one black and one with milk'. We watched as two were made with milk. After reminding them twice \"no milk in the second one\" we waiting for 15 minutes as a number of customers behind us came and went with their orders. When another iced coffee was served to us with milk, we left without a refund. I see no reason to ever return here.
