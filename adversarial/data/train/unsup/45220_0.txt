Ordered wings as an appetizer and the pizza as our main dish they were definitely worth the wait, both arrived to table at the same time. The meat lover pizza it was straight up on point! The wings were the perfect, had the medium buffalo sauce had a kick but it was super good (get them crispy)! The ranch was the perfect consistency extra tasty. Looks like they were short staffed, because waiters took a while to get back with our check. But we will definitely be back when they aren't so busy!
