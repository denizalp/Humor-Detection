Yet again Idolize doesn't surprise me in the amazing experience I had. This was the first time being in the South Park location since it's kiosk days. Don't get me wrong I loved the work they did then, but it is nice to know you don't have a bazillion people looking over the wall and staring at you while getting threaded.\n\nThe new store is lovely! Just the right space for what is needed. Arpita has always rocked, but to have found out that she is now the manager at this location is super duper YAY!!!!! She deserves it.\nWhen I'm in the area of SP like yesterday and needed a major threading I know where I'm going.
