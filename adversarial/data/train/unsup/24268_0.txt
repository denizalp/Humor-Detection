Fish Fry Time! I live in Bloomfield and come every year for the fish fry at least once. The women of the church making the food and running the fry are characters for sure. They make a mean fish sandwich and an even meaner Mac and Cheese. It's so creamy and the cheese sauce is like velvet to the lips.\nThere's still time this year to check them out if you can.
