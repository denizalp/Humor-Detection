I love this place and its tasty comforting food!\n\nTwo dishes that I love and cannot wait to go back for more:  Spicy Shrimp with Garlic and Golden Beef.  \n\nServed with salty fried garlic and super hot green chili, the spicy fried shrimp warmed up my soul quicker that a cup of joe!  \n\nThe beef with red curry-coconut base was divine.  It was so good that we had to order another one.\n\nIn terms of service, the staff was accommodating and terrific!\n\nIf you don't mind the austere d√©cor and want some good home cooking, this is the place to come.  It's a great little joint to share yummy food with a group of friends.  At $16 per person with tips, six of us left heavier and happier.
