Great old school, upscale steak house playing classic vegas music in the background inside the Golden Nugget. Great food and phenomenal service. Filet was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The highlight was the crab cake appetizer.  Just perfection. Lobster bisque and scalloped potatoes were on the salty side. Also had the mac and cheese, 2 whole heads of broccoli, and caesar salad. Decent but rather unremarkable.  Croissant bread pudding was stacked high topped with caramel ice cream and the silky chocolate mousse deserts were a great ending. Really enjoyed the great service.
