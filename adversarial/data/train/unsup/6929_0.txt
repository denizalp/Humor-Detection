Looking for a top notch Dinner? Look no further. Bandera which is part of Hillstone restaurants has it all. Central location, attentive and helpful service, scrumptious grub, delicious drinks and nice ambiance. I went with some girlfriends but the restaurant boasts a dimly lit romantic vibe so would be great for a date night. \n\nI am an unapologetic carnivore so I went with the gigantic prime rib, while my friends had ribs and chicken dishes. Each plate had superb presentation and the potatoes had a delicious cheesy flavor we loved. All in all, we had ourselves one damn good dinner and look forward to my next visit.\n\nTip- make a reservation
