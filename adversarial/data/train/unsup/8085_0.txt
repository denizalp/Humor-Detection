This was a specular experience for me.  No 3 inches of snow on the ground or frigid wind was going to come between me and my bowl of steamy hot Ramen. I credit my boyfriend with the idea to try Ramen Bar and it was well worth the two buses and tramping through the dirty sludge to get there. \n\nRamen has been a dish I was curious about for so long one that I have seen my favorite TV personality Anthony Bourdain enjoy. I had the Tom Yam Men I made this choice because I saw in the menu description that it was Thailand inspired hot and sour broth.  I added egg and shrimp.   The shrimp was plentiful in the dish however I found myself wanting more mushrooms and the egg was hard boiled I had been hoping for a poached egg one with a runny yoke. \nThe service was very friendly and the other dining guests there were of various ethnic backgrounds.  Ramen Bar is an A + in my book.
