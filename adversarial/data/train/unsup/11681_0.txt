Bomba has so much potential. \nI stopped in with a friend after a movie. The customer service was a little odd--they verbally told us they were closing soon and seemed a little off-put we were there (it was 1.5 hours until close, and other folks were in there). So that started things off a little awkward. I think in terms for suburban taco options, Bomba is great for people who live in the area, but all of us who know Barrio will just be constantly spoiled. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu, so we went with tacos.\n\nThe taco portions were a tad small, with some unusual flavors. The fried avocado taco sounded like a good idea, but just ended up being a bit mushy. The chicken tinga taco was good and had a nice kick to it, but I don't think I hit the money on either of these tacos. The taco shells, though meant to be soft, were a bit hard. \n\nThe service was fairly quick and the restaurant had a cute ambience. The bar was really hoppin'. While my food was just OK, my drink (margarita) was absolutely delicious, as was the side of plantains and the mango friend rice. If you're in the market for Bomba, I imagine it's a great place for small plates and drinks.
