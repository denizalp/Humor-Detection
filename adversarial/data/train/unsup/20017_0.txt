I was excited when this restaurant opened in Town Square, I love seafood. Time went by and I saw the ratings were on the low side but I saw a Groupon so I couldn't pass up the chance to try it out for pretty much half the price.\nWe went on Sunday afternoon and the place was eerily empty, 3 other tables occupied, no hostess present to greet us, so we walked inside, feeling confused...maybe we seat ourselves. We stood for a few minutes until someone came out from the back, apologized, and got us to our table.\nI pretty much knew what I was getting, I studied the menu for days. My poor husband doesn't like seafood so he had few options we knew wouldn't be anything to write home about but he would endure for me.\nNeither of us got drinks, just beer and water.\nI got the Killer Shrimp, Crab and Lobster. It comes with bread for dipping in the sauce. The sauce had a peppery spice, it was good but it overwhelmed the seafood. The seafood was cooked nicely, plenty to eat with a few corn cobs (34$).\nMy husband got The Filet done medium with mashed, it came with a demi glaze over the steak. It was a small portion, he said it was better than expected but nothing special.\nWe skipped dessert.\nOur waitress was nice and gave us adequate service.\nMore tables filled as our meal progressed.\nSo I'm glad I got it out of my system. I got a bowl of clam chowder to go to try later, it was pretty good, probably the only thing I'd go back for.\nFrom what I saw I wouldn't doubt if Killer Shrimp folds in a year.
