I mean it's a casino, albeit it's probably better kept then others on the strip. Plenty of eating options. They have a pit for table games. The staff\/dealers at the craps tables were hot and cold.  But it was good gaming. The cocktail waitresses were a little too insistent on making sure you had a an empty before bribing you another drink even though they barely made their rounds.
