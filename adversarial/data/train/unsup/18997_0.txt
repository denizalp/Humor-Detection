So we came to Capo's in the same weekend that we visited several \"upscale\" restaurants [some owned by celebrity chefs] and this was the best restaurant we visited all weekend.\n\nThe service was great starting from the \"greeting\". Our waitress Sara was awesome and interacted with our group very well. She certainly added to the fun. After starting with a couple of pitchers of Sangria we ordered some appetizers and onto dinner. \n\nMy wife chose to go with the Chi Town shrimp scampi appetizer for her dinner which was really good. I had the spaghetti and vegetarian meatless meatball. Yes, that is right, a meatless meatball. I have had some better faux meats around but still the marinera sauce really takes over the taste and I really enjoyed this meal.\n\nMy brother had the lobster risotto and I had to taste it but I am glad I did; may be the most delicious thing I have ever tasted. At over $100 its something you only try on your birthday weekend but man it was good.\n\nEverything about this place made you want to come back. I have to go get a fake NV license because I read that Tue is local 2:1 specials. Hope to come back soon.
