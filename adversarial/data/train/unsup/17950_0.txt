This place has arguably  the cheapest Japanese\/Korean rice in town and a nice selection of things so its not terrible but, what was terrible was the food court. If I had the option of rating their food court I would give it a 1. \nSo there I was, I was next in line the cashier lady turned away from me and started saying angry things at the bus boy or the kid who took the trays back.\nIt went something like this.\n\nOld lady: Jinhuan u no gud\n\nJinhuan: I gud.\n\nOld lady: No u no gud,\n\nJinhuan: I rear gud\n\nOld Lady: WONGTONGBONGSONG!!!!!!!! U NO GUD\n\nMe: Shil lyeh hamnida.... Excuse me....\n\n*Stand there with a $20 in my hand... They kept arguing. So I walked away.*\n\nI would go back for the Kimchee in the supermarket though.
