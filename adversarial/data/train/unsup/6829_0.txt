My girlfriend and I stopped over here for lunch. We literally had the place to ourselves and were able to order off the lunch menu. The spicy items are marked accordingly and on the other side of the menu were Thai inspired dishes.\n\nFrom her vantage point she could see some people coming in for take out. The lunch prices are very reasonable. With your choice of entree you get a choice of soup or eggroll, white, fried, or brown rice as your side. With your check you get a store bought fortune cookie.\n\nShe had the General Tso's chicken with rice and eggroll. I had the chicken and shrimp entree mixed with vegetables. Needless to say service was fast and the food very tasty. My friend told me that her General Tso's was not overly spicy. I enjoyed my dish as well. I was please with the portion size as I normally do not finish the rice when I order. Here it was just enough.\n\nThe eggrolls came with both the duck and hot sauce almost combined but you could tell the difference just by looking at it.  The waitress was very attentive to our needs and did ask if we wanted to split the check. I refused but was grateful she had asked.\n\nThis is a nice option when dining on Mt. Washington since Shiloh St has a lot of eateries as well as the Grandview bakery and love Pittsburgh shop. Street or lot metered parking is available. If you heading up that way avoid Sycamore St since part of that road is closed. Shiloh is a one way St so it is best to head over to Grandview Ave and proceed down from there.\n\nWe had a good lunch at a very reasonable price.
