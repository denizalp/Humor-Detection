This place changed owership between my last two visits and it was really felt hard... the new owner seems to be driven by angst instead of wonder and the prices went through the roof.\n\nThey took something magical and pooped on it.\nI will never go back.\n\nP.S. - This note is from late summer, 2010 - the old name was \"Suite Lorain\" and my 4-star review remains on that listing to honor the establishment it once was.
