What a disaster.  I don't get the love of this place at all.  I'll agree with Patrick L on this one: William-Sonoma with a hot case.  That's all this is.  Where do I begin?\n\nFirst - the layout.  This design might be nice when one or two people is in the store but on a Saturday afternoon, this place had 30 people in it and was insane.  The layout does not help.  Not only are there three sets of lines that merge into each other creating all sorts of pile-ups but there is no where to go that you aren't in the way.  Racks of food act as line partitions more than they act as display cases.  It is really a nightmare.\n\nSecond - quality for the price.  It is a ton of high-end stuff and that's okay.  I have no issue with high end products but ... where the hell do you get off charging $5 more than some place like Delicious Dishes?  I can get the same products at a LOCALLY OWNED store for significantly less.  There is nothing special about what you stock.  You don't make these cheeses yourself.  These aren't your livestock being slaughtered.  You get this stuff from the same supplier that AJs, Trader Joes, and Petit Fromage do yet you charge like you're the only game in town.\n\nFinally - You call that a deli counter?  The girls working here have probably been using a meat slicer for 2 months and couldn't tell you the difference between mortadella and sopressata.  I'm sure they don't know how to cook it and can guarantee that they don't know proper pairings.\n\nNo thanks.  I'll stick with Delicious Dishes in Phoenix and keep my money local.
