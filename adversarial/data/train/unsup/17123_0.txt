Ok seriously. Every bite of food I put in my mouth ended up with a WOW in my head.\n\nI'm usually skeptical of \"fusion\" places or restaurants trying to do twist on asian cuisine because it usually doesn't turn out well. But Odd Seoul didn't disappoint. \n\nWe got the buffalo tofu, scallion and avocado slaw, OS chicken wings and the spicy chicken bowl. Hang on, I'm saving the best for last, we actually started with the torched mackarel - torched for a while at our table and of course causing the fire alarm to go off :) But mm mmmm mmmm so meaty and delicious! Fish done well\n\nI have to admit even though it was right in front of our face, we couldnt tell which one was the restaurant. I understand being hip n ' stuff but a small sign would help :) \n\nOne of my friends said he will definitely return to dine here; and I wouldnt mind as well!
