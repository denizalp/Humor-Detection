Oh Publix, why are you not closer to my house?! Like in place of the Food Lion on Eastway or the Plaza\/Midwood HT?! OK so you aren't really THAT far from me but still. I won't hold it against you though because your store is like a grocery wonderland. Beautiful meat\/fish section, a cheese section the way it SHOULD be and an awe inspiring produce section. Sure you take a little getting used to, layout wise, but this is why you have a team of helpful friendly folks to guide newbies like myself through your well thought out space. Would be nice to have one of you in the strip on Independence that is set to be newly developed near the terror of a Walmart. You know, to bring a little sunshine to the area. Just an idea. In the meantime, see you on South.
