I got tattooed by Tyler about a month ago and i could not be happier with how my tattoo came out. I gave him an idea of what I wanted, and let him come up with his own creative interpretation of what I wanted... and it turned out to be perfect!! I am so in love with my tattoo! And not only was the tattoo super quick, it was also enjoyable conversation, and a comfortable environment. I get compliments daily about my tattoo -- about how vibrant it is, how clean the lines are, and how it looks so original and unique. I can't wait to go back to Tyler for my next tattoo!!! :) thank you Black Lotus! I definitely recommend this shop to anybody.
