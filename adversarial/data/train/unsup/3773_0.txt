The perfect after work bar for Calgary in this moment. Bright, bare and lively-loud with a mix of draft and semi-craft cocktails, and decently priced, really well made low brow street food. The menu stretches across the globe for tasty casual dishes without seeming forced. I wanted everything on the menu, but picked the na-cho-tots and Reese's blonde sundae. The tater tots were crispy, topped with a vibrant and spicy mix of fresh jalapeños, tasty guacamole with a heavy cumin accent, sour cream and assorted veg confetti. It'd be easy to make this dish bland with pickled jalapeños or having soggy tots or a packaged guac, but they really put the effort in. The blondie was warm and peanut buttery, with a good quality ice cream and a generous amount of chocolate fudge sauce, a good deal for $5. Will definitely be back to try all the other offerings I saw going by, like the Nashville sandwich or the jerk chicken!
