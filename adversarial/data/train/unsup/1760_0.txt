We thought the Caf√© 87 was named for the nearby highway of the same name, but as it took about 87 minutes for the 2 of us to get breakfast, we're not sure anymore. Granted the place was packed, as the $3.95 steak & egg breakfast attracts lots of cheap folks like us. However, our waitress left a lot to be desired: she was virtually non-existent (playing Keno or the slots maybe?), she was slow taking our order, then when it finally arrived, failed to notice that my steak was well done versus the ordered medium - fortunately I was able to track her down before she was able to head off to place her next bet. \n\nShe returned very promptly with a medium steak, but I noticed it was the same plate (whereas they should have cooked a fresh meal); now the eggs and hash browns were only lukewarm. I would have sent the entire thing back, but we had to check out by 11! And yes of course it took forever to get our check. \n\nMy wife's steak was properly cooked and she really liked it.\n\nIn addition to the service problem, there were a lot of flies in the restaurant (it is not an outdoor restaurant.  Plus our recently-cleaned table was so wet so we had to use our napkins to dry it off.  All of this was a shame because it really was a modern, nicely decorated restaurant.
