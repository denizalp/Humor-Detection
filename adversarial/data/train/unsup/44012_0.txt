I'm from Illinois, and have eaten more than my fair share of Chicago-style hot dogs throughout my life. And this place really isn't bad in comparison to that standard. Obviously it can't fully live up to Chicago, but if I want a real hot dog or pizza, I shouldn't be living in Madison.\n\nI liked that the fries are actually thick-cut potato wedges. But my fries were pitifully undercooked.\n\nReally, you could make a hot dog of similar quality at home, but this isn't a bad place to drop 6 bucks at. You'll leave feeling pretty full.
