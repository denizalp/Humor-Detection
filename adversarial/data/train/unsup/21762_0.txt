$6.95 for sandwich or salad or 1\/2 sanwich and soup\/salad combo!\nTortellini Florentine soup was tasty, plenty of tortellini, flavorful.\nChicken twist was excellent\/healthy chicken salad.\n\nThis reminded me of sandwich bars in London, with better food, fresh ingredients, and reasonable prices.\n\nI would give it 4.5 stars if I had that option! \n\nResponsible organic food, reasonable prices. Must try!
