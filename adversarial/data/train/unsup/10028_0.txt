Oh, God. How I love Lush! Seriously. I've dealt with sensitive, breakout-prone skin since I hit twenty. I was about ready to throw myself into traffic until I finally listened to my best friend, and walked into Lush. I dropped nearly two hundred dollars the first visit, en route to an Iron Maiden show(of all things!), and it was money well spent. First of all, the Enzymion moisturizer is a godsend. I could never use moisturizer because my naturally oily skin would only be amplified. When I said I wanted skin \"like buttah,\" I didn't mean \"closely resembles melted butter on a hot Arizona day!\" Enzymion not only keeps my skin hydrated during the long, humid summers, but it absorbs oil and prevents me from breaking out.\n\nOther products I enjoy are the Tea Tree Water Toner, the Coalface cleanser, and the Mask of Magnaminty. These all are excellent products for breakout prone, oily skin.  \n\nI still suffer from the occasional breakout, but I no longer feel that my face looks like a topographic map of the Andes--knock on wood!\n\nI give Lush four stars out of a possible five only because of the two hour drive it takes to arrive at the Scottsdale location from Tucson. I knoooow I could order online, but have you tried ordering perishable products via the internet during an Arizona summer? Yeah, I thought so.
