Ever since this place opened up, I haven't stopped coming here. I love how they're open early enough so I can make a stop here before work, as well as being open late, compared to the traditional hours of a bake shoppe.\n\nIt sits in the main Chinatown plaza, which is really close to The Strip. It's easy to find and parking is never a problem. The establishment's interior space is pretty small. So during their busy times, the place can get squishy and there are not that many tables and chairs to begin with.\n\nOnce you enter, you will see a set of reusable trays and tongs for customers to use. This makes it hygienic and easier to hold several pastries at a time as you're picking and choosing from the open display cases. My family's faves are the cream puffs, croissants, and strawberry cakes. Their house coffee is pretty good too.\n\nCustomer service hasn't really been a problem, but there are times when some employees could offer better service and be more appreciative when it comes to tips. I've seen it so many times where a customer will hand a tip directly to a worker and nothing will be said by the employee that is receiving it. No thank you, eye contact, or even a smile. Not really good mannerisms. :[\n\nI love the convenience of the location, the hours, and selection of menu items, but customer service can be a lil bit better. The interior space could use some planning as well. But if you're in the area, give this place a try!
