This is possibly one of the most excellent coffee shops I have ever visited anywhere in the world. It's ADORABLE, the staff are wonderfully friendly, the coffee is FANTASTIC and I cannot say enough wonderful things about this place. It seems like this place is owned and operated by a family, and stepping into the shop is like visiting their home - from the VHS tapes to the fun Polaroids on the walls. If you're in Montreal, definitely stop in for an afternoon and feel at home and happy :) I recommend the Nutella latte!
