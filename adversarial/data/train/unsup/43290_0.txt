Me and my buddies came out to Montreal for our annual summer weekend. We almost always stay at the Quality inn on Crescent st . We never knew this basement pub was there. We stumbled across this place looking for a couple of cold ones and cheap eats , we where not disappointed the staff was awesome , music great , beer cold and you absolutely need to try the Homer Simpson burger for just $5 with fries ( pic shown )
