We hit up nakama in the southside for my birthday.  Went on a friday night, the crowd wasnt too bad.  Nakama is a place ive been by a bunch of times and always wanted to give it a try.  \n\nFor the money, what it was, and coming from Westmoreland county it was really not worth it for me.  The habachi was decent but no different than the places in monroeville or greensburg.  We also had sushi was was decent but nothing fantastic.
