I WILL NEVER USE DISCOUNT CAB AGAIN AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE ELSE USE THEM EITHER! I ordered a taxi home Friday night from an app on my iPhone. Got a call confirming that a taxi was on the way. Was standing outside of the bar waiting and a taxi pulls up. Driver asks me, \" You ordered a taxi?\" I say yes and jump in. It was a Discount cab and was dirty and the guy had the AC OFF and the windows down - it was frigging HOT. For SURE not one of those fancy hybrid green cars in their ads. About halfway home (4 mile ride), I get a call from another cab co saying the taxi I ordered was waiting for me at the bar... Dude totally tricked me into his cab. I ask the driver if in fact this was the cab I requested and he starts acting like he doesn't know what Im saying. I say, \"look, whatever - do you guys give free rides back to my car in the morning?\" he says yes and I ask him what I need to get that - he says just call in the morning, don't need anything... I ask for a card and he doesn't have one. Next morning I call and 1st guy says he needs the job number. I don't have one and explain what happened. He says he at least needs the pick-up address. I say I'll get it and call back. I call back with address and lady tells me that won't work. I ask for supervisor and explain the whole thing and he says there is nothing he can do for me as they do see one pickup for that address, but that it had been canceled! So driver not only tricked me into car by making me believe his was the cab I ordered, he also canceled it in the system and pocketed the fare. Nice. And now on top of that, I have to pay another company to take me back to my car. \n\nI'll use VIP from now on.
