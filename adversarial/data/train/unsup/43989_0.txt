Lower prices and less traffic than parking at a lot near the airport. I snagged a 5% discount on total amount from online and saved a bit. Buses arrived soon after I parked and not long after I arrived at airport. The bottled water at checkout was a cool touch. I'll continue to use this lot more often when I travel. Cheers***
