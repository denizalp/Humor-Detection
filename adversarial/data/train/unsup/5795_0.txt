Surprisingly I found this hotel\/condo on Craigslist, and although I don't normally recommend this method of vacation rental, it did work out for me. Bluechipvegas.com. We rented the 2 bedroom 3 bath and 2 kitchen condo which was GREAT for our family of 8. Beautiful condo and I would recommend it to anyone that doesn't mind the 10\/15 minute walk to the MGM. If you like the convenience of jumping on the elevator and dropping into the casino, this isn't for you. There are 3 towers (#1 closest to MGM) 4 pools ( if you count the MGM pool) available to guests, 2 fitness centers, a deli and a Starbucks.\n\nBear in mind that there is NO self park at the signature, valet is mandatory.  There is self park at the MGM, but in my option..... Shell out the $2 you cheap ass.\n\nAlso, there isn't much within WALKING distance of The Signature, rent a car 'cause a taxi will cost you more or heat stroke will get you an express ticket to the ER.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate staying here again. GREAT customer service, beautiful facility and overall awesome.
