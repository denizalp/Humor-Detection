Pittsburgh Bound!  Part XVI\n\nI moved to Atlanta in December of last year from Pittsburgh and had yet to be back.  Virtually every Labor Day weekend of my entire life was spent in Pittsburgh with my parents, as my birthday falls within the window.  I promised my folks that I would make a long weekend out of it, and head on home.  The following reviews are a step-by-step account of the long weekend.  Enjoy!\n\n(For Part XV, go to http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/review_share\/GuWbgXDIi5lmHttow9pWhA\/review\/QQDBXqJ4PNSyH48DBedqhg?fsid=qGcsH56SzZAN2LuCQyTPTQ)\n\nThe Pittsburgh International Airport is a little bit of a mess.  If you park in the lots, you enter on the first floor, check in on the second, and go through security on either the first or third floor.  On this trip, I timed my security check and found it to be considerably easier than I'm accustomed to there.  9 minutes and through which has to be a record time.\n\nThe only noteworthy feature worth mentioning is that every traveler that goes through the Pittsburgh airport must pass a series of Madame Tussaud-esque statues featuring Franco Harris reaching for what would eventually be dubbed \"The Immaculate Reception\", and George Washington.  \n\nOnly in Pittsburgh.  Being a native, I fully understand and agree with the decision, but from an outsider's perspective, I'm sure they are thinking of how enormous the balls of this city's decision makers must be to pair up a legendary football play alongside a founding father of this country.  The statues have been in place for years, but eventually will have to change.  I'm guessing that the next pairing will be statues of Ben Roethlisberger shaking off a defensive lineman with Jesus just off to the right. \n\nThe long and short of it, Atlanta, here I come.
