None of our party of 10 have participated in an escape room before. We were not sure what to expect. \nFirst, let me say that we were visiting WI from MD. I spoke to Renee on the phone before our trip. I didn't even really know what to ask, but she gave me lots of information. \nWe got WI and I was able to communicate via text with Renee. We were able to book our room on a Monday night. \nWe had a blast. We did the Sherlock room. The puzzles were challenging, and one lead to another. Chris and his helper(I can't remember his name) made sure our game ran smoothly. I highly recommend coming here for some great fun!
