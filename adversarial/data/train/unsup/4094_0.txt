Anyone who knows me and knows my eating habits well, knows that breakfast is not only the most important meal of the day, but it is also my jam!\n\nI've seen a lot of my downtown buddies post photo after photo on instragram about this this lovely little cafe that I just knew I'd have to get my eat. on and get it on with the quickness.\n\nFirst and foremost, bring quarters. All the parking near the restaurant is quartered. When we arrived we didn't have quarters. As soon as we walked in, the lady who greeted us with a warm smile, saw the two dollars in my hand and gave me change, saying she was \"prepared!\"\n\nMy friend and I were seated quickly and given menus that had us drooling and boggled as to what to order. EVERYTHING looked so good and the dishes fellow patrons were munching on looked divine, too.\n\nOur food arrived quickly and promptly. It was love at first bite. You can taste the freshness and the quality of the food. Each dish was made with love. Even the homemade jam had that je ne sais quoi magic to it.\n\nThe service was amazing, there was a great sense of teamwork among the staff, I felt as if we had a not one server, but an entire crew.\n\nThe cafe is beautiful and modern. Black and white, with bright green flourishes. The kitchen was open and clean. Nothing hidden. The lady who greeted us, came over during our meal and introduced herself as the owner and thanked us for checking the place out. I was thoroughly impressed.\n\nFrom great service, to great food, to a locally owned place. I love eat. I can't wait to head downtown and eat here again.
