If you don't know, just ask anyone and they'll be less than happy to show you the entrance. This place is jammed packed with a line to the front of the long hall around the middle of the night when people are tired of Marquee. Expect slutty dresses, stinky feets, and people who can't stand straight and jibberish talkers. However, if you're like me and also one of these club go-ers, then it's just a hot spot for a late night snack before heading back to the room. :)\n\nPizza can be sold by the slice or as a whole. By slice is about $4 and is comparable to the size of Costco's pizza. They have a higher end quality in toppings than Pizza Hut and Domino's. The lines may be long but usually it moves fast, unless of course you got someone in front of you whose so drunk she can't tell she's at a pizza place. But what are the chances of that happening, right? Haha. Considering the prices of nearby food places, especially in the Cosmopolitan, Secret Pizza is the cheaper choice. \n\nBut, there's still some of us who prefer the late night steak and eggs special in other various Vegas locations!
