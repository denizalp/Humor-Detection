I first thought this place is a small sushi take-out place, but it turns out to be a nice restaurant.\n\nOn a Sunday evening when we got struck out from another AYCE place, this place is plan B. the place was pretty quite, with only 25% of tables filled with different types of customer. (Families with young children \/ baby who would like to have their nice Sunday dinner, to a bunch of teenager who looks like they are just came out of a hunger strike)\n\nThe servers seems to be all Chinese, but they all speaks english in a gentle voice. I guess because of the neighborhood are with less Chinese speaking asian, so unless the customer speaks Chinese, they would use English when they approach the customers. (+1 stars)\n\nThey offer a la carte or All You Can Eat, as we wanted AYCE, we decided to go with AYCE and will come back if their food is good.(+1 stars)\n\nThe food was pretty good, and because they show how many piece in one order, you just order 1 if you just want to try something for the first time. Like the \"cooked tuna sushi\", I guess it's for someone who doesn't like to eat raw fish? ;)\n(+1 stars to the menu option)\n\nThe place is nice restaurant rather than a fast paced AYCE who just want to kick you out, place looks really clean, services was on point (didn't miss anything I ordered), and they accept credit card!\n(+1 stars)\n\nA nice place for AYCE, will come back on a different day (may be lunch) again.
