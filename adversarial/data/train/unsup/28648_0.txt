This past weekend, we decided to take a self guided history tour of Waxhaw (you can print the PDF from the city website) Naturally, when visiting a new town, one must try the local eatery. We settled on Maxwell's Tavern because it had the best reviews on Yelp. As usual, my fellow Yelpers did not disappoint!\n\nI was concerned there might be a wait when first walking in, but we were seated immediately. The atmosphere was typical of a local tavern with a full bar and strategically placed TV's. Our server was very friendly and made certain to bring us water before asking what we wanted to drink. She recommended the Black and Bleu Burger which my fianc√©e ordered. I ordered the special which was the Jiffy Burger. \n\nThe food came out just as we were finishing our beer. Both burgers were cooked to order (medium and medium rare) and were topped generously. Mine was topped with peanut butter and cheese. If you've never tried this combination before, give it a shot! You will either love it or hate it, so you might be better trying it at home. I love it and find that, if a menu has a burger with peanut butter, I will always order it.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place if you find yourself in Waxhaw for the day.
