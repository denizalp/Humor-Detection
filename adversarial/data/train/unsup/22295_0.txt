Waited in line forever for this place!! I think it was about an hour and a half. Their craftsmanship of the desserts is amazing and I really enjoyed watching them work while I sat waiting for my order. I was quite disappointed, though, that they had run out of many things when I got a seat. I didn't have a choice, basically, in what I got. The dessert with Hennessy was terrible. All I tasted was alcohol and I couldn't really eat it, even though they tried to burn off the alcohol. The two desserts we had were just okay, I didn't really enjoy either of them too much. It was quite disappointing for me.
