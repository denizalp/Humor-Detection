I had to go back to Sweets Raku just to see if my first visit last summer wasn't a fluke.  And I'm glad to say that it wasn't.  In fact, the second visit was even better than the first!\n\nMy first visit to Raku really came to a surprise since I didn't know what to expect.  Now that I was fully aware of what it's all about, it's become a must-visit for me now, especially after dining at Raku.  I just can't go to one without the going to the other.\n\nJust like the first time, I went with the 3 course Prix-Fixe menu once again.  But this time I decided on the The Carib (Coconut Panna Cotta), which was actually my second choice last time behind the Stella.\n\nThe edible menu with Apricot Sauce --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1zaE3la\nThis still amazes me even though I've had it before.  This time I had it with their apricot sauce.\n\nEdible Menu opened up. --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1v6cH9t\n\nFirst Course: Mango Sorbet with Mint Jelly --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1v6cNOg\nThey always have a unique flavor combination with their sorbets.\n\nWatching the pastry chef put together the Carib was a great show in itself. \n\nChef putting together the Carib. --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1zaEgEV\nThe Carib --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1v6cW4p\nPouring sauce on the Carib. --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1zaEkoo\nThe sexy food porn shot. --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1zaEmN4\nCarib after chocolate has melted --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1zaErQK\n\nThe Carib was an amazing dessert.  Very tropical as the name suggests.  Plus I'm always a sucker for a good panna cotta.   This one has so much going on inside that glass it's like there's a surprise with every spoonful you pick up.\n\nFinal Course: Vanilla Creme Puff with Black Currant Filling --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1zaExHY\nIf it ain't broke why fix it?  I pretty much opted for the same creme puff I had last time and it was just as good!\n\nSweets Raku is really good!  It really compliments Raku very well if you visit them after dinner.  Or even if you don't go to Raku, Sweets Raku is a great restaurant on it's own.  You'll definitely be impressed and it's a great spot to bring your friends and family along to enjoy the confectionery show.  Even if you're not a desserts person, you need to come by here just to see the pastry chef in action.  She's quite an artist!
