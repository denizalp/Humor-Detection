If I could have given less than one star believe me I would. This was my one stop shop for groceries meat and produce until I saw the most shocking nastiest thing a person can ever do in a grocery store. I witnessed an employee cough up Mucus and spat right beside the sea food counter. I was in disbelief. I thought how often does this happen because if he can feel that level of comfort to do something that disgusting in my presence then it's a norm there. I called the store manager informing her of what I had witnessed she calmly dismissed it claiming that she's gonna look into the matter but that they usually wash that area down daily I said just so you know I'll be contacting Toronto public health. Which I did they did an investigation and made contact with me confirming that they will follow up after the holidays. I visited the store to see if there was any improvement and to see if the guy was still there. I didn't see him however I did see expired oil for sale sitting there like nothing. DONT SHOP AT THIS GROCERY STORE THEY ARE NASTY AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!!! This place needs to be evaluated more often. If possible shut down until they meet the following requirements.
