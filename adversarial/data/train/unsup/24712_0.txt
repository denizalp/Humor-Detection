Food was rich and flavorful.  \n\nFor 4 people, we ordered:\n\nShisito Peppers - good but heavy on the oil, and some of the peppers were spicy which is unusual but the server said it was due to it being near the end of the season for peppers\n\nRoasted Corn - comes with melted cheese on the side. This was delicious but very greasy. \n\nGrilled Asparagus - also greasy - standard - nothing to report here.\n\nSteamed Branzino - the belle of the ball.  This was the best dish of the meal. Good amount of meat on the fish and flaked off perfectly.  The flavor was infused throughout.  \n\nJidori Chicken - I was so looking forward to this dish because I love jidori chicken, but it was disgusting. I think that the jidori chicken was possibly steamed or baked - not sure.  The rub on it was terrible.  I felt like I was eating a cajun\/creole dish.  Not what I was expecting.  Also, the texture of the jidori chicken was rubbbbbbbbbery and not soft.  It makes me gag to think about it still. The portion says it is for 2 people, but it easily fed 4 of us in my party.\n\nGinger Scallion Noodles - this is a strongly flavored dish.  Seeing as how I am Korean, I love the flavors of both ginger and scallions so I am not sure where this dish went wrong.  The flavoring they added to the ginger and scallions were so pungent and not in a good way.  I ended up eating just the noodles without the fix-ins on top.  Again, another oily dish.\n\nPork Belly Buns - very fatty and very little meat and greasy.\n\nShrimp Buns - not actual shrimp, but a shrimp meatball-like square patty.  This was okay - I wouldn't order it again.\n\nBirthday Cake - $14 a slice - jeez louise. This cake was just very confusing. The first bite punches you in the face with such intense sweetness that you will be completely satisfied with one or two bites.  Shouldn't a cake that is so satisfying make you want to eat more? It didn't.  This cake should instead be called Ironic Cake.\n\nI would recommend coming here for lunch since dinner prices are $$$.\n\nLocation: Cosmopolitan, to the right of Milk, 2nd floor
