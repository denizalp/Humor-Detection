Wildflower offers a healthy, price competitive alternative to the ho-hum sandwich and soup guys!\n\nThis past Saturday, after running around, we decided to take a break and have a lite dinner.  We arrived a little after five, having debated if we wanted to go to Paradise Bakery.  \n\nParadise is not our favorite soup and salad place, because of the ever diminishing portions.  I'm waiting for them to downsize the chocolate chip cookie next!  \n\nFor some reason, we always forget about Wildflower.  It's mostly because of its location, parking and access from FLW and Northsight.  Probably not the best reasons, I know.  As always, we enjoyed the food and it wasn't crowded that night.  \n\nWe both believe the Wildflower's Chicken Pistachio Pomegranate Salad is wonderful!  It's has shredded Chicken breast served on top of some Arugula, with feta, oranges, olives, red peppers, red onions & toasted pistachios with a Pomegranate Vinaigrette, all for $8.29\n\nWe also had the Rare roast beef, gorgonzola, roasted red pepper, red onion, romaine, tomato and herb mayo on Sourdough bread that they advertise as 94% fat-free for $7.49. I love anything with gorgonzola cheese.  So much nicer than blue cheese!\n\nIn summary, our bill came to $21.74 with both the salad and sandwich being delicious, with some unique flavors and tastes that linger.  We also bought some bagels for breakfast.  Nice.\n\nEnjoy!
