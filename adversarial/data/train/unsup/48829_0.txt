Easily the best hotel for the price (I would have paid more for what you get). I just recently returned from a Friday-Sunday trip and was shocked at my 950 sq ft room. Beautiful rooms, bathroom equipped with a shower and hot tub bathtub (felt amazing), and the staff was a lot of fun! I will definitely be coming back here! Oh and did I mention it's about half a mile from the strip! Way too easy to get around!
