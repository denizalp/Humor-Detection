Once again, I get on the lightrail car 110B and drugged out people are sleeping in the bike area and 2 security guys ignore them while I stand with another while we both have bikes hanging up. Not leaving my bike because people will snatch them and run. This mid-day 1:30 pm on way to work. Do the people sleeping work-NO. Dirty, smelly and in a drugged stupor. One says her stomach hurts. Why are you on the train then? Maybe you should visit the emergency room.
