I won't even give them one star for how bad customer service they have; filled with rude people. \nI had my appointment today at 3:30 which was confirmed by the receptionist John, at exactly 2:15 I left my house and my car broke down in the middle of the road due to snow and poor weather conditions it took me a while and I called them that I might be a bit late so the guy John said 'yeah no problem' as I told him how bad my situation was but I still made it around 4pm which is 30mins late.\nThe girl jennele left the salon already and was enjoying in a Vietnamese restaurant. Anyway this extremely rude girl comes to the reception and tells me that jennele cannot do your tattoo as you are an hour late?? I was like what? An hour? And she said my appointment was at 3pm not 3:30, now I told her that I already confirmed my appointment 2days ago and John said 3:30.. she kept on giving me unreasonable excuses of how jennele cannot do my tattoo and it has to be rescheduled. I don't get it..\n1. She was rude\n2. She had no manners\n3. They literally don't know the meaning of customer service \n4. She lied to me on my face about appointment timing\nAfter this disappointment I asked her to give my deposit back as I don't ever wanna come back here EVER! And she denied of that too.. I mean it's all their fault if she couldn't do the tattoo then she could have told me on the call when I told John I was gonna be late. They did nothing in my favour instead booked me on 7th feb two months from now. PLEASE DONT BE FOOLED AND NEVER EVER GO TO THIS PLACE THEY WILL ONLY FOOL YOU AND NEVER ENTERTAIN THERE CUSTOMERS
