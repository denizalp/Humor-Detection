I affectionately call this place \"The White Trash Bar.\"  Dive is quite accurate.\n\nDrinks are super cheap.  Depending on the crowd, service can take a while.  Also if you don't mind having a sock wearing dancer dancing above you, you might be fine, just be sure to cover your drink...don't need anyting 'extra' dropping in there.  \n\nDownstairs is just a simple dive bar with a jukebox.  Good for relaxing.  Upstairs is somewhat of a dance club setting.  The dance floor however seems like it is a springboard that could fall apart at any moment.  Avoid the bathrooms downstairs, use the ones upstairs, a tad more room.  Careful on the steps as well, I've seen a few people take a tumble down them (yes, I laughed at them).\n\nNever paid a cover here.  Cash only, ATM located inside.  Avoid the food sitting out.  Go the right night you may get a glimpse of the owner and her dog (yes, her dog comes in every so often).
