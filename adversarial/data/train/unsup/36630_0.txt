No matter how many times you have seen the show on other trips, the Fountains of Bellagio are always something you should take time to see. \n\nThe show and music does seem to change so even if you've seen it in the past, it's likely that the current show is different.\n\nThe shows occurs more often at night than in the day. I believe it's every 15 minutes and every hour respectively. \n\nWe were lucky enough to be at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant for one of the shows at lunch time!!
