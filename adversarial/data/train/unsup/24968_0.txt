The best value is their large \"a la carte\" box of cookies. They will be about .84 cents a piece.  Then there's another huge box of cookies featuring all flavors for nearly that price per cookie, but you don't get to pick and choose what you want. Most people buy the pre-packaged boxes because they're so cute and are great for gifts.  There were Las Vegas themed cookie boxes, and even a dice-shaped box with mini cookies in them.\n\nThey've done a good job in making their product exclusive.  There's only one store on the mainland (this location) and the rest of their stores are located in Oahu and Maui.  No plans to go the Shake Shack\/Dunkin Donuts route and expand their empire, at least that I heard of.\n\nThe shortbread cookies have a light buttery flavor to them. Some are dipped in chocolate, and others have a dried fruit in the center.  I could easily trick myself into eating half a dozen before realizing I've probably ate a whole stick of butter.\n\nThe samples here are individually wrapped. I wonder if studies have shown that wrapping them reduces the amount of samples a customer takes.  I kept looking and wanted to try them all but didn't want to deal with unwrapping each tiny sample. I truly have first world problems.
