This is the best place I have ever stayed at hands down.  My suite at the Wynn on the 32nd floor of the resort was perfect.  It overlooked the golf course and the amenities were amazing.  Everything was worth it and the hotel staff was great.  As a result, I got some amazing sleep (electric blackout curtains are a must!).  My only gripe was the lack of an ice machine on our end of the resort.\n\nThis place far outstrips any other hotel in gambling ($10 min craps even on Friday night outside of XS including fast complimentary drinks), food (Society Cafe), pools, and entertainment (XS, Tryst, & Blush).  \n\nI definitely wish I stayed and just got faded at the Encore pool instead of wasting time at the Tool Academy reject party at Tao Beach.  The adult pool at Encore is fun.  You can hop right out of the pool and gamble.  Towels and water bottles are provided poolside which is a great service for guests.  Don't expect topless at the European pool - its mostly plastic cougars milling about for guys on 'roids.  I'd also advise hanging out at the Wynn pool if you have a large group since there will be plenty of space for you.\n\nUSEFUL: Go to the \"Drug Store\" - ask around... the small bags are $10 and the large ones are $50... j\/p.  Anyway, the pharmaceutical-less \"drug store\" is a misnomer but it is what they call their little convenience store on the casino floor.  By the register they will have free passes to tryst, blush, and XS.  This will save you the stress, time and $ to get into any club there.\n\nOh yeah, I also saw Tony Hawk with two slooters and a corona while we were checking out of the tower.  My g\/f said \"I don't think that's his wife.\"  I replied, \"I don't think EITHER of them are.\"\nI'm funny.
