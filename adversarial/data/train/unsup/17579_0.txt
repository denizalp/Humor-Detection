The Palazzo, aka The Venetian's slightly cheaper and less crowded sister hotel, has always been one of my favorite places to stay. Although it's a little bit further down the strip then I'd normally like, it still gives you access to some gems- by being near the mall, some food favorites, and of course, the Wynn and Encore. \n\nI have never understood anyone who books a room at the Venetian when they can have identical accommodations at the Palazzo without the crowd. Do you have to walk further to the pool and shops? Sure. But at the cost of saving some dollars and saving yourself the headache of congestion, why not stay at the Palazzo? Free valet, lots of self parking, a casino with all your favorite games- it's got most of what you want. \n\nI will say these elevators can be a nightmare at around 10-11am on Saturday when there's a huge flux of people checking in and out. However, kudos to the Palazzo for allowing us to check in 3 hours early last time we came. \n\nAlways a fan favorite, and of course one of my favorite places to stay in Vegas.
