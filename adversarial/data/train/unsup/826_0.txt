Utterly disappointing.\n\nWill keep this somewhat short\/sweet.  Pros\/Cons are probably the same as everyone else that didn't love it.  I'm shocked that anyone gave it 4 or 5 stars, especially since they really had nothing incredible to say.  \n\nPROS:\n- Calvin Harris on 6\/8.\n- I used the elevator.  I really don't understand all of the complaints about stairs.  \n- People were genuinely nice.  Table minimums that night started at $6K, so the guys at tables had to buy ridiculous amounts of alcohol to meet it.  At those minimums, everyone was very happy to share since that buys you a LOT of booze.\n- That's all.  Seriously.  Sooooooo underimpressed.  \n\nCONS:\n- This is an ugly venue.  Seriously.  When you have clubs out there like XS, Tryst, Surrender that are visually gorgeous and have outdoor areas (Steve Wynn, you are an effing genius), why would you create a boring, giant box of a nightclub?  Atmosphere is terrible, and it looks like it's been there forever.  Nothing modern about it.  The creators should honestly be embarrassed.  Also, lots of little ramps\/ledges throughout.  Terrible (and unsafe!) for girls in 5 inch heels.  Watch your step ladies.\n- Promoters and staff at the door are awful.  As a girl, I've never had to wait.  Or pay.  At Marquee, XS, or any of the premium clubs.  By 10pm, the so called guest list line was out the door.  We didn't need to pay cover, and moved through the line at a decent clip for awhile, but reached classic \"at capacity\" 3 or 4 groups ahead of us.  For well over 30+ minutes.  We heard one of the girls in the group at the front ask how much longer the wait would be with no attitude.  The bouncer's first reply was \"Most people would kill to be standing where you are.\"  Not cool dude.  Your attitude, in addition to your greasy ponytail, needs a makeover.\n- Water situation - it really is nonexistent.  We managed to get a barback to sneak us some tap water while we were at the bar doing a round of shots.  Bartender was really nice, but didn't budge on the no water policy.  I highly doubt that they are counting on making profits as a result of water sales, so this is just bad service.\n\nI cannot believe that they are positioning this as the hot new spot and that it's working so far.  If they didn't have the DJs that they have this year, this club would be a flop.  XS and Marquee are still much better options.  Don't waste your time on this one.  Go somewhere with a beautiful atmosphere that still brings in awesome talent.
