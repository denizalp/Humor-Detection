Ive been here a few times and I will never go to pet smart or petco again for my dog supplies! Cant imagine going anywhere else anymore. Literally the things I find here ive seen at other stores for a lot more. Prices are great. Selections are good. They have anything and pretty much everything you need for your dog (:
