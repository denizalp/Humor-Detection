I usually shy away from Thai cuisine. Yes, there is a reason. I find most Thai restaurants to be completely predictable. Everyone sticks to the same traditional dishes, never daring to lean slightly to the left or right. Quite frankly, I've become bored of it all. \n\nNoodlehead has given Thai new life. The rustic barnyard decor, the modern take on traditional dishes; Is that green curry linguine? Fried chicken noodles? Yep, this is what creativity looks and tastes like. \n\nFood:\nPork bun - A warm pillowy soft bun, but rather than pork belly, the chefs have chosen to go with pulled pork. The pickles and cilantro come through just enough to give a perfect balance. I must admit I am never a fan of pulled pork, but I'll eat these all day! \n\nChiang Mai curry - the most popular item on the menu, and with good reason. A hefty bowl of noodles, chicken, crispy shallots, yellow curry.... Simply delicious \n\nTip: For noodle dishes, you get to choose your heat level. I'd go no higher than medium. You've been warned! \n\nNoodlehead is a breath of fresh air. This is like your Thai grandmother finding the fountain of millennial youth. Except the cash only policy. I'm sorry, that's older than even your great grandma.....
