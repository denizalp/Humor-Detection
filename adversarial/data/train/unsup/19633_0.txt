Guess who's back? Back again. Brady's back. Tell your friends...actually, I only had a few reviews before, so no one really missed me. But still, first review since last year? It's kind of a big deal.\n\nSo Catch 22 is no more and no less than a sports bar, which can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for. I was looking for a spot to watch my beloved Ohio State Buckeyes knock out the Kentucky Wildcats. Spoiler alert.....we choked and lost. Oh well, UK's coach lasts 13 seconds during sex (Google it), so I know others have bigger problems than a lost bball game.\n\nAnyways, you are here for a review. Catch 22 is pretty good, not great. The happy hour prices were solid across the board in drinks and food, so I started off with a tall Kiltlifter and a $4 queso dip. Both were pretty delicious, so it was a nice way to start a disappointing sporting experience. The full price beer was a bit more, but certainly comparable to most places (less than $6 for a tall 24 oz). For my meal, I ordered the Emmitt Smith, which was a bacon cheeseburger with chili. I was pretty satisfied with the burger and fries; the spuds were crisp and seasoned well, and the meat was cooked correctly and the chili was very old school, filled with beef and beans. Maybe not the best chili burger ever, but not too bad for the price.\n\nOverall, the experience was quite enjoyable, minus the f'd game my Buckeyes played.The food and beer was solid, the TV screens were large and plentiful, and the servers were certainly attentive and pretty damn cute. The meals won't blow your socks off, but if you want a solid meal while watching a game, Catch 22 is definitely going to handle its business.
