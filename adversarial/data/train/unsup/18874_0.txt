This is bigger than any other indoor play area I've been to in Calgary. In no particular order, there's \nA massive jungle gym with a slide\nA toddler play zone\n3 Party rooms\nVideo games (tokens needed)\nA shooting gallery \nSeating area with tables and booths for ~100\nFair assortment of snacks, food and drinks \nTons of other games and play areas\n\nI came here on what I thought was a normal Sunday and it was so crowded we couldn't get parking.\n\nOnce we got in, it was super crowded with screaming kids everywhere. The one thing I didn't like was that there were a lot of adults\/parents in the jungle gym with the kids (helicopter parenting at its finest). No visible presence of staff members overseeing the activities.\n\nThis definitely is a fun place to be for the intended demographic. When it was all over -after a gruelling 122 minutes- I could safely say that my kids had a fabulous time and I needed a stiff drink.
