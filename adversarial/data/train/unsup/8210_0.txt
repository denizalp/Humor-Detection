California Pools was fantastic from start to finish. The first indication of how positive this experience was going to be was when my wife and I were put on a group text with the designer, supervisor, and construction supervisor.  This allowed direct communication so all our concerns would be instantly addressed. We were constantly kept informed of the construction schedule and when we were told crews would be here, they were here, on time. They left the site clean at the end of each day. Most importantly, the project was completed on time. \nIt is nerve racking when you spend serious money on a pool and all you hear is horror stories about other's experience. California Pools did everything to make sure our pool\/spa and landscaping  was done correctly, professionally, on time, and always minimizing the stress to me and my wife. That is priceless. I would highly recommend California Pools.
