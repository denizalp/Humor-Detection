I was feeling really beat down from drinking whiskey when my friend called me at noon on Saturday. He asked if I still wanted to go the the museums. I didn't want to. He said we can drink some coffee and he will share some of his Jack Frost donuts. They were the fuel I needed to get back on my feet and walk around. They really are the best donuts that I have ever had. Some flavors I tried had crushed peanut butter cups and crushed oreo cookies along with frosting. At around 60 cents a donut, you will be very happy!
