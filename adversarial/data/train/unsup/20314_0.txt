I was deceived by Priceline, when they offered this hotel as 4 1\/2 star accommodations. \n\nUpon arrival the parking lot is a good hike away from check in, and the entry is very easy to miss. We drove around in circles 4 times until we found the way to go.\n\nEntering the hotel, the stench of too much air freshener burned the inside of my nasal canals. Its a mix of rubbing alcohol and mens cologne. A huge turn off, gave me a headache, and made me sick to my stomach (luckily I wasn't hungover on top of it.) I get it, you're trying to hide the cigarette smell, but haven't you heard the phrase \"A little bit goes a long way?\" \n\nThe check in counter is easy to miss, a small desk with 2 front desk agents. It was empty so check in was fast. The woman who checked me in was pleasant, and had a nice smile. She told me since I was checking in early that they didn't have a room with 1 bed available. \n\nI had requested a room with one bed because it was our 4 year anniversary, so we wanted something big and spacious. I then asked if since it was such a special occasion, and since it was a Monday, if we could get upgraded to something with a bathtub.\n\nI was declined, unless I wanted to pay an additional  $150 night. \n\nThe pool was closed down due to a private event, on both Monday and Tuesday. \n\nI then asked if I could use a cart to bring up my luggage, they said NO, it was only for Bellhop service. I then asked for a bellhop, and they said they were short staffed and that all were \"too busy to assist me.\"\n\nWhen I did get a bell hop, he questioned me, asking why I had so many bags. I think he was joking, but the way he came off was rude, and I already had a bad night previously, along with not having eaten yet, that I was not in the mood for his remarks. \n\nWe get up to the room. I have to say, the decor is very cool. Very swanky. The plush purple leather headboards, the hollywood type vanity mirror, the purple velvet wing backed chair, the old style bluetooth radio, and the Two-Way shower mirror. Very nice touch. \n\nI was told that there is no late check out due to the fact that it is a Boutique Hotel, and that housekeeping needs all the time possible in order to \"DEEP CLEAN\" the limited amount of rooms that they have. Well, I have to say that the \"Deep Cleaning\" is bullshit. Because there was smeared sticky white stuff all along the bathroom sliding door, handle, and shower wall. \n\nThe vanity had hair and beauty products, all available for purchase, all of the security tabs were tampered with upon check in, so I called the front desk to let them know. \n\nThe hot faucet in the bathroom sink, was stuck, and extremely difficult to turn on. You would require super human strength in order to use it.\n\nThey offer complementary tea and coffee on the 5th floor. Every time we went to grab said coffee and tea, they were out of cups, or out of coffee, etc. When we informed someone of this, they said that they were again too short staffed so they don't know when they will be able to replenish that area.\n\nI did not complain about these things ONCE to guest services, because I wanted to try to be positive and enjoy the room and our stay. Since it was our anniversary, I wanted it to be pleasant.\n\nUNTIL... The Private Events at Drai's went on at all hours of the night. We weren't even on the top floor, and I can feel and hear the bass permeating through our walls and ceiling. I Tried to tough it out, I even tried to ignore the earlier noise of the street performer pounding the same exact beat on his bucket drums for hours.. But I had enough. I couldn't just pretend that I was enjoying my time. I was tired, and it was nearing 2am. \n\nI called the front desk, they said the club was going to be going on until 4am. I asked what my options are. She said Earplugs.... yep... earplugs. I have very petite ears so earplugs don't fit or work for me. Unless it is the wax type of earplugs that you can form to your ear, the others will give me an ear ache and\/or pop out all together. This was not an option for me. \n\nI again asked for a later check out.. since I was unable to get sleep. Mind you this is on a Tuesday Night.\n\nShe said \"Well I don't see any other complaints on your file, and we don't usually do late check out, but I guess thats fine.\"\n\nNeed I say more?
