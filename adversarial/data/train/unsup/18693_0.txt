Moving on month end, and weekend is a mover's nightmare.  So when I called Move4Less per high marks on yahoo.com's local business site, I wasn't that surprised that they only offer 3 persons crew for weekend rate of $107.  The lead guy was very professional, called a day before to confirm my 3 stops.  They were early on the day of the move which we were pleasantly surprised.  All the guys are young and polite, no thug looking guys that make you wonder if they would show up at your house the next night uninvited. Moving speed was good and very careful with things. They also took direction and special requests well, meaning without attitudes.  3 hours minimum was informed in the booking and the lead made sure I understood the rate structure. The 3 guys were an excellent crew.
