I was thoroughly unimpressed with the staff here. I came in to have something removed and have a rash looked at. Dr. Racette came in with a couple of medical students and an inexperienced nurse. He was curt, unfriendly, and did not make the situation comfortable. He quickly removed what needed to be removed, had the nurse bandage it, and failed to notice that she didn't cauterize the site as needed. Thus, I got up and began to bleed a decent amount, staining my boots and having to return to the exam room. It was fixed, but it didn't help my impression of the place.\n\nDr. Racette was fairly pompous and clearly enjoying his title of \"Top Doc\". Don't let it fool you. \n\nI gave this business two stars because they did fix the problem. It was just poorly executed by the not-so-friendly staff.
