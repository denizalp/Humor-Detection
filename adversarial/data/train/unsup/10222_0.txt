Only my 2nd time at Craftsteak - and it was even better than my first!!!\n\nStunning interior decor, romantic - excellent for groups too. \n\nSpectacular service, outstanding A5 wagyu steak (8oz for $250), vast wine selection. The A5 melted like butter in my mouth - so tensely robust in flavors. Loved our velvety smooth Opus One 1997 - just couldn't get enough.. Spectacular combination together Opus One 97 + A5 wag = Memorable Indulgent MUST!\n\nWas so stuffed, couldn't even try the monkey bread dessert towards the end.\n\nCraftsteak is definitely lick..
