Warning, some may get offended with this review. My wife and I went here today for lunch. We went a little crazy ordering $110 worth of food. We started with a $17 soft shell crab appetizer, the most expensive we ever paid anywhere; it was good and larger then most sushi restaurants hence the price I guess. I had the lunch special $20 for rice noodle soup, grilled steak and 3 pieces of California rolls and 2 pieces of special maki roll. Great taste and excellent value. My wife went a la carte nigiri sushi and ordered, giant clams (geoduck) $10 per piece, surf clams, snow crab legs, tako, scallops and octopus sushi. She described it as the best sushi she had in a long time. Both our meals came with salad and miso soup. \n\nRestaurant was packed with suits from the surrounding office towers. Extra busy because of the coming holidays. Service was discrete and efficient.  \n\nWe eat a lot of sushi and why this restaurant is extra special because the owners and all wait staff and most important the sushi chefs are Japanese. Ta Ke is one of only a few Japanese own and run Sushi restaurants in Toronto.\n\nToronto has become saturated with Sushi restaurants, most are not authentic and run by Chinese and Koreans. I am Asian and we can tell the difference. Now having said this there are some good Korean run sushi restaurants, MiNe Sushi in Aurora is very good. \n\nThe best Italian, Chinese, Mexican or Thai restaurants are own and run by people from their specific ethnic groups.  So if you want great authentic Sushi go to Ta Ke and please remember to not mix wasabi into your soya sauce.
