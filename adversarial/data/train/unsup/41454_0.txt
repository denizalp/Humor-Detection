I've been to this restaurant twice. Both times the service has been awful. Trying to get the waiters attention is almost impossible. They made several mistakes both times. I waited a half an hour for samosas and over an hour for my main chilli chicken dish. The samosas were dry and very peppery. My girlfriend ordered a dish that smelled so awful we had to send it back. I won't be coming here again and if suggest you stay away too.
