This review is based only from the Midway and the Adventure Dome.  \n\nAt the Midway, I was a bit sad that a lot of the games were closed down. Some of the prices also got smaller.  It is harder to get the large prizes. I feel like the crane machines are all rigged in someway because none of them grabbed anything. The crane would just fit perfectly around the prize and then just swift off without even moving it. What a rip off!\n\nLuckily, the Adventure Dome was a lot better. Though chaos was closed everything else was like how it usually was. There was a new Lazer game which was cool. It reminds me of secret agents. \n\nThe whole place is just starting to look old compared to all the other buildings at the strip. It still is good ol' fun but be prepared to spend a lot of money for cheap and almost unreachable prizes. \n\nOh and the parking lot is creepy. Always go here with other people.
