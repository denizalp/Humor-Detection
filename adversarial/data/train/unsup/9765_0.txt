This is not really a review of Subway, as Subway in itself is disgusting. Why anyone thinks over-processed luncheon meat is good is beyond me. Actually Subway found a way to make things even worse. They used to sell fresh avocado on the sandwich. Now, they use a disgusting, bland green glop that resembles guacamole but tastes worse than Elmer's Glue. Have you ever noticed the odd smell that accompanies a Subway?\n\nAnyway, this review is specifically about this location. To the short, fat ugly employee that works here around noon - lose the attitude. It makes the experience even worse than it is. It is not mine, or anyone else's fault that you look like you do, and the universe has set your employment at a Subway in the heart of ASU. Its not our fault that your days are spent serving some of the hottest girls on the planet while they ignore your questions and continue to text on their iphones. They are busy, planning their photo shoots for Playboy and their weekends in Vegas.\n\nUnfortunately this is where you are at this point in your life, so get over it. Serve the incredibly hot Delta Gamma's and chubby Delta Theta's. Don't put so much mayo on my 6\" roast beef and move on. We can make this whole experience so much better without the attitude.
