Nordstrom was once my favorite place to shop for clothes. I received personal attention, snacks when trying on clothes, and maybe given a lunch voucher after I made a good purchase.\nI've noticed over the last few years they have gone downhill. Whenever I walk in there a salesperson latches on to me and is anxious I give the sale to them.\nI am the customer. I feel if I make a purchase then it should go to whomever I choose and not someone who is trying to make their daily sales quota.\nThey have lessened their perks and the clothes are nothing spectacular. It was once a wonderful experience to shop there. Now I only go in if there is something I really need.\nThey are not what they used to be.
