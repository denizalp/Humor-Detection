Let's just say that every time I make a trip to phoenix I must stop by Green! This place is positively fantastic. There is honestly nothing on this menu that has ever let me down. I especially love their black jack pita! Prices are a little higher than the college budget, however their customer service is nothing short of exceptional. This vegan\/vegetarian joint has something for everyone in your party. Get there early because this place fills up fast and for good reason. See you next time Green!
