I have come to the conclusion that not one single restaurant in Paris Hotel Casino Resort is edible.  Not the cafe(s), nor the buffet, and now add Mon Ami Gabi to the list.  \n\nI've been staying at this hotel\/casino for 5 days (Thanks for the Comp Red Room, Paris!).  Our last night here so I thought I'd give this place a try.  I was hugely disappointed at my meal.  We were seated in the 'Atrium Room' with direct view of Bellagio Fountain.  Yes, it was nice but I came here for the food.  There is a door opened out to the outdoor seating area and the constant chill wind which cools the food very fast was not 'cool'.  \n\nThe Jumbo Lump Crab Cake (celery root remoulade, gribiche sauce) was really average.  I'm glad it was grilled and not deep fried. \n\nThe Butter Lettuce & Honey Apple Crisp Salad (roasted beets, aged goat cheese, apple cider vinaigrette)  was also forgettable.  I could barely taste the dressing.  \n\nThe Roast Chicken & Frites ( all-natural roasted half chicken, mushrooms, bacon, pearl onions) - oh pleeeaaasssee!  Costco's Rotisserie chicken had more flavor than this.  It was dry and tasteless!\n\nThe Filet Mignon (merlot butter, red wine reduction) which is their signature dish and you would think it should stand out!  First of all, I ordered it medium and it came as medium rare.  The sauce was supposed to be merlot butter but it was so bland that I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to flavor it.  But after about 3 bites, I had to trade it with my fiance for his Roast Chicken which was even worse!  \n\nAnd those FRITES, what the hell were those?  String potato chips?  You could have served it with FRENCH fries and that would have been better.  \n\nService was friendly but I wouldn't say it was attentive.  The waiter was more interested in talking to his fellow servers than to his guests.  \n\nIt's food like this that reminds me of why I don't care for French restaurants!
