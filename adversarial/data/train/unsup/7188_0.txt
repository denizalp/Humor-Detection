Decor : 4.7 stars\nService : 5 stars\nFood : 5 stars\n\nLocated closer to the strip. Parking spots are big enough so no worry for parking.\n\nEver since the old location closed down, I've been waiting for the new location.\nThanks to my yelper buddy, Peter S , who updated the new location. \n\nLunch time was packed and I didn't make any reservation but I was lucky I got the table.\nGreeted with smile by the host ( who I didn't know the name), she took me to smaller dining room.\n\nMy servers, Bank and Tai were both professional and attentive from taking orders, serving food, packed my left over until serving my dessert.\nI met them at the old location and it seems great to see familiar friendly faces.\n\nSo, thank you to both Bank and Tai for making my \"first experience \" superb and enjoyable in the new location .\n\nKudos also to the Management who maintain the quality of work and quality of food taste.\n\nMy food were seasoned pretty well and delicious as usual so I know the restaurant strive to keep the great quality like in the old location and even more if it's possible.\nI ordered Garlic Prawns, Drunken noodles with beef and Thai tea crepe cake for dessert.\n\nThe price only few dollars different than the old prices so Not a big deal. I definitely got what I paid for.\nRecommended to all who love food, try the Northern Thai food. From curry, seafood, basil sauce , the taste are a lot better.\n\nCheers!!!
