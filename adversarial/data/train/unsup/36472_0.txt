I have never had a great experience at this bar due to the bouncers.  One of my friends has a tiny puzzle piece tattoo behind her ear, seriously so small I didn't even know she had it! And she wasn't allowed in because \"the manager doesn't like neck tattoos.\" The irony of the story is that the TWO BOUNCERS telling her this both had large, visible tattoos on the side of their necks!  HA. Due to this experience and the way that the bouncers handled the situation I will never go back and would never recommend the bar to a friend.
