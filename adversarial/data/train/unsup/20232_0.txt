If you drink on a semi regular basis you know that cab fares can add up!  My typical 6 mile ride costs $10 with Sunrise and $14 with Discount.  From what I can tell, these cabs are all former fire chief 1980's Chevys painted white (the inside door jams are still red).\n\nThey are perfect when you've been drinking and are less likely to care about the exhaust fumes and are a great option to driving drunk when you want an inexpensive cab and don't care who sees how you get home.
