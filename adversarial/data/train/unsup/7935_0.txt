For the most part the biggest gamble I'll take is a road side taco stand. Just not a betting girl.\n\nBut our company has had a few outings here. None of them were Siegfried and Roy though. But I did get to see that show once. I remember whispering to my boss, \"This can't end well in time.\" Huh. I'm sorry but white tigers were not meant to live around tourists in Old Navy shorts and crappy flip flops.\n\nI prefer The Venetian. Where the biggest gamble you can take is hitting on 16. The Mirage needs a facelift. Badly. But I give them kudos on the room-service. It's actually quite good.
