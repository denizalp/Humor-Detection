I read several reviews on this cute cafe and decided to make it over.  Being that it is in close proximity to my abode I figured sure why the hey not. Wink.  I walk in and first thought was wow this place is smaller than what it seemed like but it's charm via decor brightened this place up- made it inviting and quite cozy.  It has a very chill setting where people come in and just deflate-after-their-day kind of spot...\n\nSo I went in around 7 on a Wednesday evening and it wasn't packed.  Based on a recommendation I decided to try the honey bread and hot green tea latte.  The honey bread was lightly sweet...just right! Delicious, but not out of this world.  The green tea latte was simply \"ok\", could have been served hot and a stirred better (but that's just being knit picky) Wink.  \n\nI would return there to meet or converse over coffee or tea and just mellow out with a friend or solo.  Ambiance is chill but it's not like \"omg I have to go there for the honey bread!\"
