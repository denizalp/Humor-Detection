Bar service was good and ambiance was modern and clean.  I enjoyed the Hearth Eggs Benedict very much.  The Hollandaise sauce was just great with proper taste and appeal.  The biscuit was thick and fresh.  The meats supplied as well were real and not some pressed substitute.  In all, I was quite happy.
