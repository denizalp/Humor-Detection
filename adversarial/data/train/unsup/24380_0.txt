3.8 for Vegas with the following notes:\n\nIf Ichiza were in Fountain Valley CA,  it would be like the Clippers and Shinsengumi\/Honda family would be like the Lakers.  People will go to the Clippers game for the Clippers only if they're not playing the Lakers, but if Lakers are playing...we think \"who are the Clippers again\"?\n\nIchiza holds its own in Vegas, and offers something different and relatively cheap alternatives compared to the $$$$ restaurants in Vegas.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nYellowtail tar tar (we ordered 2)\nThe monstrous bread dessert thing (see all the other reviews)\nUni with ponzu (although, it was a teaser given the size)\n\nWhat I'll pass on next time:\n\nRed Snapper Carpaccio (I could do without the daikon)\nPan fried gizzards\nFried roe (lacked flavor), nice concept though\n=================================\n\nOur meal ended up being $75 which includes tax, tip, 1 L Asahi and 1 S. Sapporo.\n\nFor all you big Shin Sen, Kappo Honda, Honda Ya fans.. I would still encourage you to come here if your goal is to have decent food that's reminiscent to what you're used to in OC.  With that said, don't expect anything beyond or even on par with what you're used to at home.\n\nNote to the owners:  Kind of cool concept to put stuff on the wall, but it's a bit intimidating to stand in the middle of nowhere, trying to look behind a group of 30 people to see what to order.  For people with a mild form of social anxiety...this is not cool
