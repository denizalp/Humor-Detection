Previously I ate at Earl of sandwich at Newark Airport location which was really bad. So bad I thought this was the norm for the chain that I wasn't really interested in coming back. Then after discussion with a work colleague he mentioned it was one of his favourite American sandwich chain shops. So I decided to give it another go. \n\nThis location was in Caesars just before the Forum Shops in the Forum casino area food court. Probably the cheapest food options in Caesars Palace. \nOutside the restaurant order and receipt area was some of the most comfortable booth seats I've ever sat in ever! \n\nI decided to order a soup Broccoli-cheddar with a 1492 sandy on brown bread. The soup was very think, cheesy and had very small bits of broccoli. It was on the average side of okay but nothing stellar 2.75\/5. The sandwich (not huge) was actually decently good with a healthy serving of roast beef with a creamy horseradish sauce. Expectations were lowered so I'd say I was adequately content but wouldn't consider it a memorable meal. Overall it was a solid 3\/5 \n\nPersonally I prefer Jimmy Johns or Firehouse subs. Earl of Sandwich is more Earl of Ordinary to me!
