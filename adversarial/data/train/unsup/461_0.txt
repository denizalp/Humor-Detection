As I mentioned.. I'm a fan of Capriotti's! Now they are open 24 hours so you can get your BOBBIE and CAPISTRAMI fix any time of the night! The staff in there is extra cool.. always prompt in making your sandwich and really cool about making sure you get exactly what you want. \n\nNow that they are open late, I'm there.. maybe too often.. But I do love it. If they had a wheat bun, whole wheat..i;d be stoked.. but sometimes 'good' is good just the way it is... \n\nHappy Eating!
