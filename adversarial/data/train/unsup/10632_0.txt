I cried upon leaving this store. Why do you ask? Because I couldn't afford the Campers pumps, the quirky open-toed flats - beige with UFO burgeondy disks, or the sexy but walkable soft-leather turquoise heels. Oh, and let's not forget to mention the exitable jewelry and accessories (no really, they make you feel all happy and exited). \n\nSo, I can't afford this stuff - not because it's over-priced, but due to foolish career moves. Pavement makes me wish that I had more money. That I became a selfish, stingy capitalist so I can lavish my fortune on these wonderful items. Of course, shortly after these purchases, I'd realize my wicked ways and become a community activist. All the while, I'd be defending civic rights in my cute little shoes.\n\nPavement Shoes - I love you.
