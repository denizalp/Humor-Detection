I was in here once before. Today, a monkeywrench in my schedule caused me to head to work early, thereby creating an excuse to try this hole-in-the-wall joint  yet again en route to my sucky job.\n\n The first time I went a couple years ago, I enjoyed their hot sausage and meatball sammiches. \n\nWell the meatball was still quite good. The balls themselves were spicy, yet rich like a moist cake of beef. Ground meat is one of my weaknesses-I can't resist. The bread was thick and absorbent of all the juices. Speaking of juices, this isn't a tomato sauce that's poured over it. It's more like a broth of some kind chock full of onions and peppers. \n\nHey, think outside the box will ya? They don't all have to be smothered in mozzarella and baked.   Anyway, it beats Subway. To a pulp.  \n\nWhen I walked up to the counter, I was unsure of what to get since I don't like to order the same exact things everytime I go out to eat, except when I do.   Nonetheless I said to the gal behind the counter, \"I'll get the meatball since I know it's good.\" \n\n\"Hon, everything here's good,\" she replied with a hand on her hip and a twinkle in her eye. \n\nI ended up getting the footlong hot dog also, complete with chil 'n' cheese. It was...toasty, and I'm not talking the bun. I'm guessing natural casing? It didn't snap but rather crunched lightly. It looked like a bloody cigar and tasted somewhat like a fat Slim Jim.\n\nAnd by that I mean it was a pretty damn different and therefore pretty damn good dawg. Messy too. \n\nThey say a change in your routine can improve your life. Well, I can't say my unplanned visit to Frankie's was a life-changer, but man their homemade fast food was a day fixer for me. \n\nEat 'em up yum.
