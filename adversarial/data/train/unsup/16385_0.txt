Like other reviewers, I'm unimpressed by Lulu's Noodles.  I've been there once, and that was enough for me.  I ordered a noodle dish of some kind, and it was bland and salty, and the ingredients were sub-par.  It's a far cry for authentic Asian food, and, having traveled several times to East Asia, I know what that is.  I also ordered the bubble tea, which was decent--however, there's now another place half a block down where you can get that for take-out or eat-in.  Based on the quality of the food, I'm surprised that this place is always packed.  Then again, I suppose it appeals mainly to the college student crowd, many of whom care about inexpensiveness over food quality.  If you're on S. Craig and looking for somewhere to eat, give this place a pass.  There are several better options (see my Craig St. restaurant list).
