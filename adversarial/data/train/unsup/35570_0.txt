I was a customer of massage envy for about 8 years. You get a different story every time you talk to someone. I've had to argue about the number of massages left on my account, lost massages, and my rate. I'm done with massage envy and you should be too. There are much better massage options out there. \nThe rooms are very bare bones, the massages mediocre, and usually you can't even hear the music. Spend an extra ten\ndollars and go somewhere that's relaxing, minus all the arguing with the front desk.
