Yum!! I tried the croissant with fish egg and wasabi (can't remember what it was called). I didn't know what to expect, but I was actually very pleasantly surprised. The wasabi flavour was just right - evenly spread, and not too overwhelming. I asked for it to be heated up and it came out nice and crispy. Really unique pastry that I haven't seen anywhere else in Toronto yet. \n\nI also tried the black sesame tofu cheesecake which was also awesome. The black sesame taste was not too powerful or subtle. And I also liked that it was not overly sweet. However, I think I would have preferred if the graham cracker crust was a bit thicker or more substantial. \n\nI tried a bite of my friend's cheese tart. It was ok - not outstanding. Tasted kind of like egg tart.
