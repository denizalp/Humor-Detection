Although I do like most of Liberty's restaurants this one falls just a bit short. The venue is amazing like other Liberty venues but I really did have quite the bad experience when dining here.\n\nOccasion one: After waiting a regular 10-15 minutes for a 2 top table in the lounge area it took about another 10-15 minutes for the server to initially greet us. This was the single only time I have thought about walking out of a restaurant. My partner was also ready to leave but just as we were set to leave the server finally came by and we decided to stay. However, the food was just not that stellar. Pasta and chicken were nothing to rave about.\n\nA couple months later I decided to give it a second try, as I had a friend in from Montreal and was showing him around Yorkville and Ciao caught his eye. It was patio season now, so we took a seat on the patio. Service was volumes better (it was a lot less busy) but yet again the food was just not that great. \n\nAll in all I recommend Ciao if you are looking to enjoy some drinks with a date in a well designed venue but I'll pass on the food.
