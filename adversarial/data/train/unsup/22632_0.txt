So impressed by the amazing Christmas spirit and so proud to say this is right in my neighborhood! Marc Savard's is a strip entertainer and every Christmas for the last few years spends hours upon hours slaving putting up thousands of lights and syncing it to fun music. Besides the traditional holiday music, he also throws in other fun songs too to keep everyone on their toes. It is fun to grab some hot cocoa and find a spot to park and watch the show. Not sure how many songs he has now but it has to be over 20. In front of the house there is also a sign telling you which radio frequency to tune in so you can rock out full blast in the comfort of your own car. This year I took my friend visiting from San Francisco. She face timed her 3 year old so he could see and I could here the delight as he was screaming \"Woooooowwww!\" I will probably go by at least two or three more times this season too. Thank you Marc Savard!
