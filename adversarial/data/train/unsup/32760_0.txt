This place was delightful! The fried green tomato BLT with pork belly and homemade pimento cheese was a surprisingly delectable combination of flavors and textures. We ordered the chicken, waffles and watermelon they boast is their house favorite and it did not disappoint! Big enough to split with half a chicken, pressure fried so that it is juicy and flavorful all the way through... apparently just like grandma used to make it! The waffle was light and fluffy and the watermelon was refreshing with a slight kick from the dash of cayenne that goes perfectly with the lemon, lime and mint! I highly recommend this place! Strip pricing but one of the few meals we had that was worth it!
