I haven't been in awe throughout an entire show in a very long time. This show, which I saw on a Monday at the Mirage in January, blew my mind since the first Beatles song played. It was a bit loud but I got used to it as the show continued. I was mesmerized by all the colors and costumes the actors wore in each and every direction. I was about 6 rows back from the stage. I believe I had a good view even though I had to move my head left, right, up, and down just to see all the dancers work on their amazing acrobatics.  I wasn't quite sure where to focus my attention. I'm pretty sure I missed a lot of stuff since there were so many things going on. \n\nThe choreography was amazing. I haven't seen a Cirque du Soleil show in a very, very long time and this show makes me want to see more of their shows. I knew a lot of the Beatles music that was played. The show transitioned the songs well. \n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this show.
