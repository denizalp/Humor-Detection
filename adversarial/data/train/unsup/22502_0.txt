I don't think you can find another gym with better value. The equipment and gym is much cleaner than more expensive alternative. The staff are always polite. I wouldn't say Planet Fitness has the best or most equipment but I do believe they cover all the basics. \n\nIf you don't need all the bells and whistles and only want to do cardio or lift weights this gym is hard to beat.
