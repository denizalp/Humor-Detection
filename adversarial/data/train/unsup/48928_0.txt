I have stayed here several times and the hotel has been consistent.\n\nRooms are clean and there is one elevator, although it is out of the way at the very end of property. It is a pet friendly hotel (I don't have pets) and only one time did our room smell of animals. We have never found any bugs in the rooms. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe breakfast area seats a decent amount of people, although like any hotel it can get crowded. The selection of food is better than most - eggs, biscuits, gravy, sausage, several cereals, whole and 2% milk, standard breads, waffle maker, a surprise pancake machine, fruits, juices.\n\nPeople do smoke a lot in the hallways and open areas, but the smoke free rooms are ok.\n\nPrice has always been reasonable. I will stay again when in the area.
