Came here for Monday trivia night and I can't wait to go back. Can't comment on the food as we just did drinks (which were reasonably priced), but other people's looked good for pub fare. It was such a fun night though! The trivia runs from 9 - 11 and the MC was hilarious and kept it running smoothly. It seemed like there was a lot of regulars, and who knows maybe I'll become one.
