Stopped by this cute little place after taking our dog to the dog park across the DVP. I was instantly attracted by the outdoor patio - reminded me so much of Paris!\nThe inside of this place has a relaxed, casual feel - which is great is you're feeling lazy and need to get work done!\n\nI love the tea and coffee here. We stayed for a couple of hours so I ordered both, hehe! I also loved the adorable dog water bowl they have outside, very thoughtful and useful. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because we found the pastries (specifically the muffins and croissant) were not fresh. Which was slightly disappointing. Maybe it was the time of day that we went but I just wasn't feeling it. They tasted a day or two old. I'd absolutely go back for the beverages and overall vibe.
