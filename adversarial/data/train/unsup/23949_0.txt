Do you see the single star on top of this review?  I don't want you to think of it as a star - giving Purolator an award of anything remotely connected to light would be an insult to the concept of illumination.  The single star here represents a black hole which is, coincidentally, where many packages shipped via the Official Courier Service from HELL spend an indefinite amount of time.  \n\nAs much as I would enjoy excoriating the whole of Purolator, I am going to focus my wrath on the customer disservice centre and why when you have a choice you should ship by ANYONE ELSE.  The people who operate their \"delivery\" vans would be appropriately called \"drivers-by\" as that is, apparently, their job description.  To do a drive-by of the titular delivery address- maybe pay some guy a $5 to slap a post it on now and again - but WHATEVER HAPPENS - do not get a package into the hands of a customer.  Then - when you follow your parcel down the rabbit hole you end up at Mad Hatters Ball - the service centre.  I could tell you stories - oh - there are stories.  My favourite involves there being a crowd of people in the waiting area and me and the Purolator guy yelling back and forth as I described what I thought the package \"might\" look like - \"Bigger!\" I kept yelling - since by his own admission \"I don't know where they came up with this tracking number\".  \n\nFrankly - I marvel at their continued existence ... \n\nOh yeah - I am now official a  Pur-O-hator.  Word.
