Never been so disrespected in my life, I'm a repeat customer but I guess that doesn't mean anything because we don't tip? but last time I was there I didn't even receive my side of fries such a simple order but yet nothing, so why would I  tip? hell even confronted the bartender about it but she was very rude about it , I even had the receipt ! but I guess receipts dont count?  I've spent hundreds of dollars on their slots before , been going there for 3 years now, you guys say its dirt cheap but i guess my money was not good enough for the bartender, i wish i knew her name but i know its not Ciara she's awesome, i  dont have a problem with stone house i just have a problem with that new bartender .  GET IT TOGETHER
