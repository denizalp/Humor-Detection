My son planned this club hop. We didn't know what to expect but met Buddy at the dinner. He was welcoming and joins us as our group was not big.\nDinner was well worth it! Meat was cooked to perfection and the salad\/side bar was abundant and delicious! \nThen we saw the party bus! What a beautiful ride! The interior was lit up and had a Dj booth and full all you can drink bar! Exterior was clean and awesome! Our driver was cheery, nice and accommodating. Did I mention a good driver!?!\nThe club entrances were free quick and easy with Buddy! We were treated like VIPs. They were prompt picking us up and taking us on to next venue.\nI never would have thought of a party bus but I am glad my son did! \nI really recommend this to everyone who likes to party in Vegas or if you want to experience more than one club in one night. I could get pricey but not. With. This company!!!!!\nWe had a blast and would do it again!!! But only with Buddy!!!
