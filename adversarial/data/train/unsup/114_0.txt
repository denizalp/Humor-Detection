Great place to hang out after the pinup show or before or after dinner.\n2 for 1 drinks really get this bar going. Bar staff is actually pretty good. It's too bad the bar is located away from the window, because it would be nice to look out at the view.\n\nI had a dirty martini and it was quite good. \n\nOnly downside is the bar is kind of small, there's not a lot of room to sit at the bar. Although it seemed like there was a lot of bar tables.
