The kids and I stopped here for dinner and enjoyed our food.  The atmosphere was nice but a little heavy on the color mauve for my taste.  \n\nWe had paht thai, sticky rice and evil jungle noodles with tofu.  We ordered the paht thai with no spice to the kids preference and the evil jungle monkey noodles I ordered mild.  The red curry & coconut milk broth of the evil jungle monkey monkey noodles was very aromatic and flavorful.  \n\nI found that even mild the evil jungle monkey monkey monkey noodles had a distinctive spicy hotness.  The red curry used in the evil jungle monkey monkey monkey monkey noodles continued to build in hotness as I ate, so I would keep that in mind if you order the evil jungle monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey noodles.\n\nI would definitely recommend Thai Rama when you're in the mood for Thai.  The next visit I will try other selections from their menu, although I did find the evil jungle monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey noodles somewhat compelling.  I do find the name of the dish to be sort of odd.  What's evil about a bowl of noodles anyway?  \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nMonkey.
