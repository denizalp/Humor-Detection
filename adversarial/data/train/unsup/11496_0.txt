the decor is amazing. went here last night for the neon party. all in all it was a fun time. i love the concept of handing out shirts for party goers to wear, that was awesome.  But for the bartenders... no knowledge whatsoever. \nthey were deliberately ignoring girls for the last 20 minutes of the open bar and were so unfriendly. \ni will defiantly return but only go if i get a day bed\/table.
