This course is one of the few that DOES NOT include range balls with the $100+ greens fee. $18.50 for range balls is not right. I have been here twice in the last 2 months from out of town. They don't seem to really care if you are a return guest or not. I brought a foursome both times...$800+ range balls...THINK ABOUT IT FELLA's...if I don't bring a group back here it's because of the range balls...There are 200+ golf courses to choose from here. Happy to drive to  Estrella and pay less and get range balls for free. Serious. Or drive to Long Bow (yes they charge for range balls but the greens fee is 1\/2 and the course doesn't have power lines). \n\nNot sure I will be back.
