My husband is a disabled vet and this company was able to help him out with his SSDI. We were worried about what we would do, since we initially did research and it didn't lead us anywhere helpful or specific. We actually learned about Disability Help Group through a friend that recommended them based on her families experience. \n\nShe couldn't of been anymore right! They are rockstars that got my husband approved! They explain the process very well and keep you informed so that you know what's going on at all times. They know how to maintain their clients peace of mind. \n\nWe recommend!
