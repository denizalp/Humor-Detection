Blowfish BBQ is an amazing food truck.  Their drumsticks and mac and cheese are crazy good.  I first experienced them at Weather Permitting.\n\nI felt their portions were great.  Some food trucks leave me wanting more.\n\nI had a drumstick, mac and cheese, and slaw.  Each item was crazy good.  The drumsticks are a dry rub, but they also have some liquid sauces for people who want some sauce.  I used the spicy sauce on the mac and cheese and it was perfect.
