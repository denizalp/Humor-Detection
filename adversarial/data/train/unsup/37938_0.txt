Have eaten here many times, not only at this location in Gilbert but others as well. Everything was great accept...I called in my order for pick up and Maddilyn said food will be ready in 10 minutes. I waited about 25 or so. Got there to pick up my food and it wasn't ready, on top of that there was hardly anyone in the place. Safe to say she forgot my order since I had to wait another 15 minutes?!?! At least my food was good and hott! :)
