We were visiting Toronto so purely by name, we decided to try the Toronto (or perhaps it was Ontario?) roll cake with strawberries in the cream. The roll wasn't overwhelming sweet and extremely moist, which were the two best features of this cake. Enjoyable but nothing extraordinary. \n\nWhat I enjoyed the most was the Kyoto matcha green tea latte. It had some bitterness of the matcha which is rare to find and the sweetness-level was just perfect. Loved the woody-atmosphere of this cute little shop.
