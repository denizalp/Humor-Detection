Much better than Cantina 1511! The salsa verde was really good. I was a bit disappointed at the fact that they had to smother my enchiladas in queso to make them vegetarian - where's the enchilada sauce!? - but it was pretty decent. I will likely go back ... and next time, have a margarita. They looked yummy.
