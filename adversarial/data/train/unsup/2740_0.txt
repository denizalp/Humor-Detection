The only reason I ever go here is because people I'm affiliated with go here. That being said, my last experience ruined my mood and the mood of everyone that was with me. I was up here with a group. The one bartender who works there (her name is Lisa), has said alot of bad things about my friend and I when we first started going up there so for whatever reason, she already hated us (I'm sure she talks about everyone). So my friend and I, while minding our own business as most everybody does, kept noticing her looking at us. So after so long of this happening, she walks up to my friend out of NOWHERE, accuses her of talking about the other bartender, says if we are then she can leave, and that she didn't like the \"vibes\" from her and our group. My friend and I had to explain to the other bartender that nobody was talking about her at all. The whole thing was ridiculous. So if you go here, be careful of the \"vibes\" you give off, or Lisa will be there to harass you.
