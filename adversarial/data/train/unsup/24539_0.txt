Was on Decarie street near Cote Vertu, hungry, whipped out my phone, Yelp app, made decision, Maison Mignon. After scrolling through the menu I knew that I had to get the infamous beef soup. The rich and steamy beefy broth accompanied by thick noodles was the perfect remedy to the mild cold that I was fighting. \n\nIf you ever ask the staffs what the street food-like stand with little cast iron sockets is for then they'll tell you it's for the pancakes that come in three different fillings: custard, taro and red bean. The first one has a beautiful hint of vanilla with the right amount of sweet, the second has a subtle floral note and the last one, well... It's red beanish. \n\nMaison Mignon was a pleasant discovery and I'd definitely come back to see what the menu is hiding from me.
