This place came highly recommended, and with a 4-plus star rating.  I'm not sure why.  I sat at the bar on a Sunday just after noon, and waited for 5-10 minutes to be acknowledged.  The bartender was abrupt and uninterested, but I was hungry.  I ordered the chicken pesto flatbread and was very disappointed.  is was soggy, flavorless, and the chicken tasted like it was previously cooked and then frozen in a factory - I bet there's a big plastic bag of it in their freezer.  That and a soda cost $19!  The bartender never checked on me once, and then disappeared for 10 minutes while I waited with my credit card in my hand.  Fail.
