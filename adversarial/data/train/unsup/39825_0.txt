I was referred to this establishment from Cowboy Caio as they didn't have their Buffalo Carpacioo. So I went to the house brasserie for their steak tartar which was a mistake.  It was a \"FAIL\" for anyone looking for a traditional steak tartar as it came with fries, a small pigeon? Yolk (overdone) which didn't add to the moisture of the dish which was more of a pate than a tartar.  Very disappointed!
