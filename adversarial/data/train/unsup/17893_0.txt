Came here with a group of 6-8 people and ordered the most expensive dishes on the menu .... sashimi, sushi, pasta, etc\n\nThe sashimi platter was about 50$ and had very little fish. Each raw fish was placed on a cucumber and some of the cucumbers had PLASTIC wrapped around them\n\nThis means they don't wash the garments they use for the raw fish. Totally unhealthy and gross....\n\nPretentious and overpriced. They even wanted to charge us for entering the rooftop patio after spending 200$+ on the bill.\n\nSave your money and go for real sushi restaurant and your local bar.
