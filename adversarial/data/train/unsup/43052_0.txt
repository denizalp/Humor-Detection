Have not had work done, but saw this truck on our street and I approached the tradesman, and he offered to have a look at my job after he was done with his appointment. He came by within 20 minutes and I felt comfortable enough to hire them to do some work for us. He even offered to contact someone to do some other work we need done that he doesn't do. I see they have a 4.4 out of 5 rating on Google, yet a low one here due to 2 poor reviews. I would like to comment on the $68,00.00 job review with the obviously missing zero. Considering the size of your house and the extent of the issues and work you had done, as shown on that Global footage, you'd have to be pretty naive as homeowners to think it was going to cost $6,800. I have a 750 square foot house, half the size of yours or less, and we've had a few quotes to do our roof, which averaged out at $12,000. You should have questioned the obviously missing zero, instead of taking advantage of it. The mistake the company made was not asking for a deposit and trusting you.
