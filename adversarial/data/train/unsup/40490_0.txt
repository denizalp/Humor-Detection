I have to say I was quite pleased with my first visit to Gadzooks. Had the tortilla soup with chicken as well as a bag of chips and salsa. The soup was quite hardy and the chips were excellent. I'll definitely be returning soon.\n\nThe only thing that looks like a challenge might be the parking on a busy Friday night, but I went at 9:30 when they seem to be winding things down.
