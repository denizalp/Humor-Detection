Stephanie Balck was a referral to me by Wells Fargo bank Mortgage dept in Phoenix. She and two other companies. I reached out to all three and she is the only one that reached back.  Glad she did.  Within 6 weeks of signing I was already seeing not only my scores rise but collections melt off like butter. All my scores were low 5's. I had hospital bills. Repossessions. Payday loans anything you can imagine a young kid would without thinking of the consequences.  Within 9 months you would have thought by looking at my credit report that I was a perfect citizen. I bought a house with a median score close to 700.  I've been in my home for over a year now and have continued living by the simple rules that I learned from Stephanie. I have one score that is 788 one 770 and the other over 750.  I can't believe i have good credit. I will never mess it up again and if I do. I know who to contact. She is worth what she cost times 100.  The money that she saves you alone on collections is staggering upwards of 20k she saved me. Her fees are very fair because she gets result.  Enough said. Highly recommend.
