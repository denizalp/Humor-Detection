I had the fish stew and it was awesome- lots of fish, clams, mussels, shrimp and red potatoes in a saffron broth- delicious. However, who ever heard of happy hour specials on drinks and food depending on what area you are sitting- unbelievable. I went to the bar to get the special price. When my friends went, the waitress busted them. I paid half the price that my friends did. Happy hour prices should be fr the entire pace. IF I go back I for sure will sit at the bar.
