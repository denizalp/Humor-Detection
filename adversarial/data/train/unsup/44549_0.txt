Valley Permaculture Alliance is a 501[c]3 in Phoenix valley with an online presence, whose mission is to inspire sustainable living through education, community involvement and creative cooperation.   VPA is seen throughout the valley at regular event, such as: Tour de Coops, Tree Growing Classes, How to create your own salves from herbs, Gardening, How to butcher a chicken, Alternative Energy, How to make food from mesquite beans and many other topics....\n\nThis online community helped me save tons of money on organic chicken feed and save quite  a bit of money.  There was a blog calling Local Backyard Chicken Farmers, to pool chicken feed volume to make one large purchase for our group, which gave us wholesale prices due to our volume.  It saved everyone involved a significant amount of money.  It is simple and great!  An idea that was meant to come and stay....!  I order chicken feed with the group every two months.\n\nIt is a great organization and I am very happy to have met this group of like-minded people who working together.  If you find yourself to be eco-conscious this FREE community is likely to have something for you.  \n\nA few months in, I have actually been learning quite a bit about health, diets and GMOs from some of the members who I have met through VPA.  Great Community and Resource!\n\nPermaculture is generally described as, \"The Art and Science of Living with Nature\"
