Alright so this place wins. It wins the prize for the most expensive grocery Market in The Valley. If there is a higher priced one, I have not been there yet.\nAlthough, it has not stopped me from going here. \nEvery time I do ,I say why??\nYes, they have a lot of amazing ,pure ,and healthy foods. Yes, the store is clean and you can find anything you could ever want here as well.\nIf you are too tired to cook anything you can come here and get anything you want , cooked and ready to eat, or take it home and heat it up.\nLoads of fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as anything else your heart could desire. \nYou get .10cents off for each bag you bring in. \nThere is lots of parking in the lot. They are in the same parking lot as Trader Joe's which seems a little odd. But, that is major comp. there.\nIt certainly is worth a visit.
