Update: just reading threw some of these reviews it's insain that some people find the need to nit pick this place for every last detail! Seriously people complaining about not having a big enough onion on their burger ?? R u kidding me ! People not used to vegan cheese saying it tastes funny, complaining about it being busy ??its the 1st vegan drive thru in Vegas hellloo  it's going to be busy. Can people leave constructive critisism? ....having an opinion  is one thing but knocking a place that's promoting compassion to animals that's just asking for bad karma. Seriously let's appreciate the fact that we have a vegan drive thru in our city....if u dont like Vegeway take your wining to McDonalds! \n\nAnd fyi... The burgers are freakin bomb here! Chef Kenny is bomb, and the customer service was bomb!
