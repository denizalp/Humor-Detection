Happy Dog never lets me down. It's a bar that serves hot dogs and tater tots. The awesomeness of Happy Dog is that you can choose between a different bunch of toppings from Andy's Hot Fries or slaw to fried egg. The tater tots comes with all kinds of free dip - chipotle ketchup, garlic aioli, sriracha, truffle mustard. It's not gourmet, but it's good.\n\nTrivia some nights, Classical Revolution once a month, random acts throughout the week. It's a Cleveland landmark in my opinion.
