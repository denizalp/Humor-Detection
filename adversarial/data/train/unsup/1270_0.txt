So two years later, I'm back at Meat & Potatoes for brunch on a beautiful sunny Fall Sunday. My friend and I felt lucky to have been able to make a reservation at 12:00pm on a Sunday with such short notice. Somehow -- they had a table for two available in the next 15 minutes! Sweet! \n\nThe best part? When we sat down. Such comfortable seat cushions. We were seated next to the DJ, which for some people would have been less than ideal, but we enjoyed the music and were still able to have a fine conversation without yelling, so I think the volume levels are set just right.\n\nThe menu features Eggs Benedict, shrimp & grits ettouffee, chicken and waffles and a few other things. Those who don't prefer eggs for brunch may feel limited in scope for choices (as my friend), but mostly everything on the menu is incredibly delicious (I say with confidence), so how can you go wrong?\n\nI ordered the Thanksgiving Benedict, despite already harfing down 3 soft boiled eggs for breakfast earlier that day. I could eat 12 eggs a day. This was eggactly the eggsperience I was looking for (shoot me now please), but in all honesty: the Benedict was INCREDIBLE. Stuffing - delicous cuts of turkey and perfectly poached eggs with house made cranberry sauce. It came together divinely and was the ultimate comfort food. I tried my friend's shrimp etouffee as well and it creamy, tangy and delightful.\n\nFor dessert, we shared something only God could whip up in heaven. The problem being is that I was so damn engrossed with eating it, that I sort of forgot what it called on the menu (dessert menu changes practically daily). All I can say is: if there's a mix of ice cream + a brownie with nuts type of biscotti -- go for it! Or really trust your servers recommendations (like we did). So. Divine.\n\nThe price was super reasonable as well. Definitely recommend M&P for brunch -- don't know about dinner\/lunch, but I would imagine they can do no wrong!
