Once in a while I get an ultimate craving for all-you-can-eat sushi. I feel like it is sushi junk food and I basically try to order everything creamy, crunchy, and baked! During a recent trip to Vegas I met two of my best girlfriends at Yama Sushi to stuff our faces, and that we did! You just have to know that when you go to an all-you-can-eat sushi place it's not going to be the most amazing sushi there is, but this place wasn't actually bad. The best part was seeing my girlfriends again and the heart-warming conversations we had about what we have accomplished over the last several years. Time sure flies by! Photos on my blog...
