I've been wanting to come to LJ for months now after reading all of the raving reviews and my expectations were set high. Of course, I had to order the soup dumplings to start off my meal. They lived up to their hype! I would've preferred a little more broth in them, but the dumplings themselves were delicious and flavorful.\n\nI decided to order the Shanghai pork and veggie wonton soup as my entree. Honestly, I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. I liked the soup broth but not the filling in the wontons. I would not order this again.\n\nTheir signs are a bit misleading. They have pictures of bubble tea on their wall, but they don't actually serve bubble tea. So don't expect to be able to order everything that is pictured on their wall, because you'll end up disappointed. LJ Shanghai is a great place to go for your xiao long bao cravings, but there are still some areas that I feel need improvement.
