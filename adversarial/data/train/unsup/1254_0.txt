Shang's commitment to quality ingredients, friendly service, and reasonable pricing will hopefully have more eyeballs looking their way soon.  I would go here over Noodle Man any day of the week.\n\nOne standout is their freshly made \"Spicy Wonton\" appetizer, which offers a comfortable heat that is accessible to most palettes.  I loved the silkiness of the wonton skin as my teeth broke into the delightfully, juicy pork center.  I also enjoyed the thick skinned \"Beef Pancake\" (eat these in small bites or the juice WILL shoot out the other side!) and the fantastic \"Beef & Onion potsticker\".  Those deep fried \"potstickers\" you've been eating elsewhere?  Total garbage!!!!\n\nTheir signature noodle soup, \"Shang Beef Noodle\", was sumptuous.  Not spicy or robust like the Taiwanese version, but the beefy flavor I sought was well pronounced.  That had everything to do with the braised beef brisket combined with all that delicious bone marrow broth.  And THEN there were all those hand pulled noodles underneath it all!!  Slurp after slurp, bite after bite...wonderful.   \n\nOther items:\n\nSliced Beef Shank: Served chilled and topped with balsamic vinegar sauce, this was another great starter.  I appreciated the tender and slightly gelatinous texture.\n\nShang Fried Rice: The preserved bean sprouts were the dominating flavor, which may not be a hit with fans of Americanized Chinese, so the Yang-Zhou version would probably be preferable.  I liked it, but it's not for everyone.\n\nCucumber Salad:  The combination of cool cucumber, tasty sesame sauce and the slight heat of chili oil on the bottom was a winning combination.  \n\nOn my \"to eat\" list for future visits is..........the rest of the menu!!\n\nOther tips:\n\n- Do not let the noodles sit for long (ahem phone pics, cough,cough) as the texture will change and they are best as soon as served.  \n\n- The \"Hot\" items are not that spicy, just flavorful, so specify if you actually want HOT.
