We went in with a $40 Groupon, and ordered up the Mediterranean mix, as an appetizer, and a Greek Pizza, and a plain cheese calzone, along with a couple of beers.\n\nIt was all so good, but impossible to finish, so...\n\nWe had delicious leftovers the next day.  I thought the staff was friendly, and even though we were there too early for dinner, everything was great!!
