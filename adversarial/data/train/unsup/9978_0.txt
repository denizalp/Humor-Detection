I have been meaning to try Divino for AGES and finally got around to it last weekend for date night. I was actually quite worried because it was snowing heavily and I know the area can be super tricky for parking. Luckily we got a spot right on 8th, but plan for extra time as we were still about 5 minutes late for our reservation.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, we were surprised at the size - it looks so small from the outside! The atmosphere was very warm, cozy, and intimate. Perfect date night spot! We were taken to our table at the back, which was unfortunately right under a cool air vent. Our server came around to take our drink order and ultimately, I was disappointed with her - I'm usually pretty upbeat and I like to engage the server in some banter, but she was very abrupt. I don't think she smiled once, and on more than one occasion, she walked away before we were even finished ordering or asking a question.\n\nWe started with a selection of cheeses, which were all very nice. However, I don't understand why they only give you like, 2 crackers, for 3 slabs of cheese. I had the Onion Soup for an appetizer - which was more cheese than soup - and Josh had the Buffalo Tartare, which was simply to die for. The Saltspring Island Chevre went SO perfectly with the meat, it was quite possibly the best tartare I've ever tasted! Our mains were absolutely delicious, but I would go back for the tartare alone.\n\nOverall, the experience was really nice and the food was really good, but our service was so unremarkable that it didn't leave a lasting impression on me. It was very pricey, so I'm not sure I'd return for a full dinner - maybe just a glass of wine and some tartare!
