This review is primarily for the service rendered by the manager \"Faith\" who was on duty on 03\/02\/2018. The food and waitress\/hostess service overall is pretty decent. \n\nOn the day prior, I had phoned in a takeaway order for two burgers, and their usually superb pretzel appetizer. My girlfriend and I picked up our order from the waitress (middle aged Asian female) & left a good sized tip (50+ total $) and made our way to a work conference within the Palms. Upon opening the food bag at the conference I noticed that it lacked the pretzel appetizer. It's not a big deal to me as I understand issues happen. \n\nSince I'm staying at the Palms Hotel which contains this establishment, I stop by to notify them of the above and to possibly procure the pretzel appetizer. \n\nAfter advising the hostess (younger female White) who was not there the day prior, she tells me she does not have the authority to comp a pretzel and says she has to get the manager to make that call. \n\nAfter waiting 5 mins, the hostess and the manager return and I again have to relay the same story. The manager Faith asks me if I had called the Cafe yesterday in which I did not, since I took my order and went straight to my work conference where we cannot make phone calls. \n\nFaith then asked me if I have the receipt for my order in which I did not. This order by the way was placed onto my room account and was later on my hotel receipt, so I am almost positive that she could have looked that up in their internal database. These questions asked by Faith came across in a tone that was very accusatory and skeptical, like I am trying to hustle them out of a free pretzel. \n\nI noticed the very nice waitress who had handled my order and pointed her out to the manger in order to verify that I had indeed placed an order. She recognized us and greeted us then said that the hostess (older female White) from the day before called our room after we had left with our food because she had gotten the order confused; the hostess got our pretzel burger bun and pretzel appetizer discombobulated. It happens, again I understand. The waitress also advised that we were not charged for the pretzel appetizer. Side note: once this scenario was over, and I went back to my room, I did not see a blinking red light or message on my hotel phone. \n\nAnyway, to make a long story longer, Faith, the manager appeared to be delighted to hear this updated news from the waitress and her dour appearance changed to one of pleasure. Obviously after seeing how this whole order was a boondoggle, the hostess then said to Faith, \"should I go ahead and get them their pretzel now?\" in which Faith responded, \"No. They never paid for one in the first place\".  There was then a brief period of awkward silence between all involved parties due to Faith's response and I interjected with a \"Alright. Thanks for everyone's help. I'm going to move on\". \n\nI am very dismayed at Faith's lack of leadership, ownership of her employee's performance and most of all, her communication toward customers. If I were in her shoes, I would have apologized for the mishap, refunded the food or offered a new one and then out of public view, reviewed the incident with the involved employees and ensured this would not happen again, or place procedures in place to ensure proper future performance. \n\nI stay at the Palms Hotel frequently and have eaten at the Cafe in the past but after this incident, I will no longer partake in their services. Thank you.
