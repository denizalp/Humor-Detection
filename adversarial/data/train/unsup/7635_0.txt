Makino Sushi off the strip of Las Vegas offers a casual and comfortable Japanese buffet. An all-you-can-eat-sushi bar, salad bar, hot entrées, dessert bar and a lot more.\n\nOur local friends treated us for a dinner which is why we came here. I was impressed how busy this place was, indicating there were many good eats to try.\n\nI'm not really a buffet person because I get easily overwhelmed with so many selections. At this place, the food counter stretched from one end of the restaurant to the other! \n\nWith over a hundred food choices, I particularly enjoyed the crab legs and seafood entrée, Japanese fried rice and teriyaki selections. I appreciated the attentiveness of the waiters by removing our used plates from our table in a timely fashion.\n\nFor $25 per person, I will definitely visit this place whenever I'm in Vegas.
