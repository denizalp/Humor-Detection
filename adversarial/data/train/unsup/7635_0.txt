Decent cut, but when I got home I found scrapes and razor burns all over my dogs stomach. The vet bill was $141 and Natalie refused a refund or to pay the vet bill. My dog could not sleep and wouldn't eat for 5 days because of the pain. They cost me $189 and an injured dog and refused to correct the problem. I DO NOT recommend this place.
