The rain in Vegas has stopped and we have retrieved our car from Mandalay Bay to head off the strip to check out this Barnes and Noble.  Why?  Because it's weird there's a B&N in Las Vegas and we needed to find our next book to read and we wanted to find it in Vegas.\n\nThis is a one story B&N in a shady part of town.  We were there around closing time so we browsed and selected Don Quixote as the winner and searched the clearance racks and found a few more books all at a $35 price tag.  \n\nThey have a decent clearance selection and free Wi-fi, plenty of room to roam around but no comfy chairs to plop down and check out your selections but that's ok.  We just needed our books and we were off to the strip again.
