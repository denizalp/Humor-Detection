Where do I begin.We had a reservation and walked up to the desk to check in when we looked over to the left at the bar the waiter was getting a glass of red wine and basically was smelly it with his entire nose in the glass. That was the first incident. We proceeded be seated in the back booth looking at the Chef's cooking everyone's food. We ordered the filet and New York steak one cesar salad and one chopped salad also scalloped potatoes. We received our salad my cesar salad had a sardine on the side with head chopped off of it  I couldn't believe it. The chopped salad was not appetizing either. The main course came the steaks and potatoes. The scalloped potatoes were soggy and watered down so bad I can't even explain like soup. Upon eating we seen the head chef eating and not but rinsing his hands not washing then another cook back behind the line eating also. So we complained to our waiter that we seen maybe twice and he already knew about the potatoes and he took them off the bill. We finished our meal and asked for the check and he brought it and stood there and waited for the money! Who does that! Not impressed would not eat there again.
