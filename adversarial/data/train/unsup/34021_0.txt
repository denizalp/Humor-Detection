What happened to Mimi's? The menu has changed again and not for the better.\nWe arrived at 9PM and no one was at the door to greet us...for a long time we waited, then I wen tin search of someone. Finally found someone and I asked if they were closed. He said no and sat us. The restaurant was pretty empty. I never saw anyone else on the floor working.\nThe server was not friendly at all. Service very slow. Then again this might be a management problem too since one person cannot do everything in a full service restaurant and do a good job.  I ordered the chicken crepes. They were pictured on menu and looked good.\nI received a hot plate with cold food. They were actually cold inside so I am not sure if they sat that long or if they are premade and were not heated through. \nIt took a long time but I finally got the attention of the waiter and asked him to please heat them up. \nHe grabbed the plate and came back later with them hot. The crepes were still undercooked and mushy but the inside was hot.  The salad was wilted when he returned.  The waiter never said he was sorry or is it better or kiss my behind.  He just dropped it off and went away.  I did eat a couple more bites and decided that I was not willing to eat calories when the food is bad so that was the end of my dinner.\nMy husband had the Tuna Sandwich and it was different then they used  to make it and no longer on the menu that he could find.\nWe waited a long time again. Finally got his attention and asked for the check.\nHe never asked if we wanted dessert or asked if I wanted the mushy mess to take with me, or at least ask what was wrong with it.\nWe finally got the check, paid for it before he could take off again and left.\nMimi's used be so good. Maybe the economy has made them cut down on labor to try to make a profit. The bad thing about that is you cut down on service too.\nI never thought I would prefer IHOP but the food is hot and the service is better.
