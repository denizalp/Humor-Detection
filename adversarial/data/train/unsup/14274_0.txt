We ordered catering from this local deli for an office lunch meeting.  They're pretty solid - definitely a step up from Subway.  The bread is nice and fluffy with a decent crust - it reminds me a bit of the classic Leidenheimer bread used for poboys.\n\nI tried two of their sandwiches, the classic Italian and the Cutlet Parmigiana.  The Cutlet Parmigiana was a \"hot\" sandwich with a fried pork cutlet and tomato sauce - I thought the cutlet itself was a bit dry, and the sauce a little too sweet for my liking.\n\nOn the other hand, the classic Italian was nice.  It had a good combination\/variety of meats and was definitely not skimpy on the portions.\n\nOVERALL: 3\/5.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it's definitely a nice option for a quick lunch that's better than the regular fast food fare.
