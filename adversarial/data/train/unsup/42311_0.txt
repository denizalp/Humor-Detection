Joseph Haas Insurance Agency is the best of the best and then some! The staff here is amazing!!! I was referred by Rob & Casey Lambson of Speedy Car Loans and man am I glad the referred me!! Everyone on the staff is truly nice and compassionate. They made sure that I got the best rate I could possibly get. Most recently I ran into technical issues between Farmers and my bank. To put it nicely... it was a \"cluster f*#%\" and through all this, Allison Levy redefined to me what customer service is. She was beyond professional, she was patient, sympathetic and extremely kind while I voiced my frustration regarding this matter. She's been available every time I have called, and even when she was busy with other customers she made sure she got back to me that very same day. Allison kept me updated every step of the way during this matter, and answered every question completely and thoroughly. Allison made sure that I fully understood my options as well as, reassured me that the error that occurred had nothing to do with me and that regardless of what was going on I would still be in good standing. Honestly speaking, at some point I thought the \"niceness\" and tolerance would wear off, but it didn't!! You see, thats really the type of person Allison Levy is; and thats truly the type of people that work at the Joseph Haas Insurance Agency.
