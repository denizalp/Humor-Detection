I've always had a decent experience at this No Frills. However, I must say, it has definitely gotten a lot busier throughout the years. \n\nI remembered when it first opened, there were tons of parking spots, Markham Road was a smooth drive to get across, BurOak was smooth and easy too. However, with the addition of the new apartments, there's a lot of traffic around this area.\n\nNevertheless, this No Frills has all the groceries I'm looking for, it's clean and easily accessible. It's rarely ever sold out of the on sale products when I look and there's a rack of out dated seasonal things after I visit. \n\nI think the lines have gotten much longer over the years, when I go, it's not usually terrible, but it's been pretty long recently which is why I stopped coming here.
