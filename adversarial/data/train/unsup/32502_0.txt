I went here for lunch after reading the reviews. I ordered to dine in and they took my order quickly. The sanitation score was 96.5 so that was a good sign. The food was brought to me buy a server (somehow she remembered who I was) and I dug in. The chicken was tasty with a nice crunchy texture. Some people don't like it like that and prefer it more tender. The rice and broccoli were tasty too. I asked for spicy but it wasn't that spicy. The wings were delicious. I will be back. Nice people running the place.
