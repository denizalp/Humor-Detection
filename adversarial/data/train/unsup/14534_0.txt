I love living next to Frick Park.  This park is absolutely massive and so lovely.  \n\nOverall, I feel like there are typically fewer people here than Schenley Park, but there are often big events near the Blue Slide Park.  The A-Z Alphabet Trails in September feature arts, crafts, experiments, performances, and fun for kids, and it is all provided by local non-profits.  Shakespeare in the Park also performs here.\n\nPersonally, I spend most of my time at the dog park and walking on the trails.  After recently returning from hiking in the Rocky mountains, I would say that anyone can do any of the trails here.  They are very well-traveled and not too steep.  However, most are not very well-marked, which is just a caution.  I often discover new trails by accident, which is kind of fun.  Many people bike and let their dogs run off-leash so be cognizant of other people.\n\nThe dog parks are very nice.  There are two different ones, at least that I know of.  Both have some shade and benches to sit on, and there are always quite a few dogs for your puppies to play with!  Most of the dogs are bigger, but there are small dogs too sometimes.\n\nOverall, a great park in Pittsburgh.
