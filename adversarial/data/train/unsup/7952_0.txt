We were regulars because of the extensive song list and great food. That's gone now. So sad! \n\nThe song book is cut by 2\/3 - they don't even have standards like Ring of Fire, Eye of the Tiger, or All That Jazz. And the food? Rubber calamari with marinara. It was so bad, after a full 5 minutes of chewing the first piece, I gave up.  \n\nMara FREAKING nara with calamari? WTF? Ick! \n\nOh, and they mute the mic to the point you can barely hear the singers - good or not.\n\nIt wasn't broke, what were they trying to fix? Whoever took over ruined a good thing. You lost the locals. If that was your goal, mission accomplished. \n\nOur drink server was good, that's the second star.
