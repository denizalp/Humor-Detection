Per previous reviews, I was looking forward to trying Piedmont Social House. My party of 2 arrived around 8pm, it's was pretty busy, no surprise being a Friday evening (6\/26). Given wait time for a table was 30 min, very acceptable. During the wait time, it was noticeable that no other waiting parties were called. Piedmont Social House has a lot going on, bowling parties, multiple bars, large parties, and being very new. There was a sense of miscommunication between the hostess station, bowling lane station, and management on what parties to seat. During the 30-40 minutes I waited, zero parties were seated. It was by, which I completely understand, however, buy observing what was going on I had little confidence I would be seated anytime soon. We went to cross our name of the wait list, and before we could the hostess stated it would be another 45-60 minutes...told them to cross our names off, Piedmont Social House seemed happy to have less names on the list...no apologies, no other options, just a thanks for leaving....I wasn't the only party to leave, 5-7 parties in front of us on the list left as well. I was there about and hour, more parties on the wait list left than were seated (zero). I would describe Piedmont Social House as a less organized Park Ten Lanes...not a place to have dinner. I still want to go, I'll just go for lunch...and I'll adjust review after trying the food...only fair.
