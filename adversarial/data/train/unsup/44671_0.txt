The pasta and fish at Zucca is incredible. Pasta melts in your mouth and fish is extremely fresh. I love their daily specials - creative, but still authentic. Staff are very attentive and service is quick and accurate. I go back all the time. Reservations are required, so don't forget to reserve at least a week in advance.
