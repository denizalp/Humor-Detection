****SAVE YOUR MONEY AND AVOID YOURSELF THE DISSAPOINTMENT!!!****\n\nOne star does not even come close, I rate this place MINUS FIVE STARS! \n\n1. It's like walking in to your closet.\n2. Very over priced $19 for just \"The experience\" let me explain to you what the experience is..... once you walk in, you literally turn right and that's the end of \"the experince.\"\n3. You cannot even take your cellphone in, that way you are forced to buy their over priced pictures.\n\nMy boyfriend and I did not even last 5 minutes in this joint once we decided that it is not worth the money we just paid ($40) just to walk in and walk right out. LITERALLY, no exaggeration. I asked for a manager to address my problem, and once she came to me, she tried to justify my issue and said,... \"Well you have to see it as its hand crafted; someone actually did this by hand.\" Which I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND that they are trying to sell the art, BUT I would like to see MORE of that \"art.\" I pictured an entire maze that would actually \"wow\" me, but honestly.... IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH IT. I don't like the fact that the manager still didn't give me a full refund, she only refunded me for one admission. I am in the customer service field, and if the customer is not satisfied, you have to go out of your way and make it right! I guess our customer service is on totally different levels! They are lucky I don't dispute that charge! This review should be enough to help others avoid themselves the dissapointment. Hope this helps, btw this is not the only negative review. Take my word for it, ALWAYS read reviews before you visit a place that you have never been to before, IT HELPS!
