I suppose for people who insist of spending a fortune to get their pets some super duper organic cleansing foo foo magic food, perhaps this is a good place. I, on the other hand, just popped in to check whether they carry the cat litter that I use. It's unscented and regular stores like Walmart and Target tend to run out of it constantly. I ordered some online from WM but while waiting for delivery I thought I'd see if I could grab a box at this store. \n\nI normally pay $11.67 for a 25 lb box. At this store...28 lbs was...$28 and some change!!! \n\nListen...I understand that it's a specialty store blah blah...but this is the exact same product sold at Walmart for 47 cents per pound and here it's OVER A DOLLAR A POUND! For something that my cat is going to pee and poo in, a dollar a pound seems pretttttttty steep! Marking things up more than double what other stores sell it for can't be good for business. \n\nI honestly don't understand why someone would go to this store unless they had money just burning holes in their pockets and needed somewhere to throw it away.\n\nThe customer service was...ehhh....the guy looked up when we walked in, said hi, and said bye when we walked out. I would hope that if I had paid $30 for some kitty pee pee sand he might have been more friendly. They must do SOMETHING that makes customers come back after getting ripped off like that, right??\n\nPS: All you people spending a bazillion dollars on bullshit fancy food for your pets...they're ANIMALS. In the wild, they would be eating dead rodents, birds, etc... Dogs eat turds for crying out loud! I'm pretty sure they can eat like, regular pet food from a pet store or even the vet where it's MUCH cheaper than this joint. Will I go back? Uhhhh...no.
