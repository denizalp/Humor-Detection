Absolutely amazing! This was an incredible experience. This was my first time at a Karaoke Bar and I'm officially addicted and can't wait to book my next reservation. J Karaoke Bar was perfect! The food was incredible, service was top notch, and everyone was so attentive. The rooms are perfect for groups. We had a group of 8 and enjoyed every minute. The sound was perfect! \n\nWe will 100% be back. We loved the happy hour and stayed for about 4-5 hours. #LOVEDIT
