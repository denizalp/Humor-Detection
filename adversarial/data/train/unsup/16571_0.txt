We have been watching Criss Angel show on Spike TV for a while, we really liked it, that's why hubby bought tickets in the front row in the center, we wanted to see if we could figure out some of his tricks on the stage! \n\nThe ratings are so low, but it didn't worry me, I like magic shows anyways. It was like a museum of Criss Angel bikes in there, very cool and nice bikes! Too bad no photos allowed. Got two frozen drinks and took two shots before we went in, huge theatre, the seats were very comfy. \n\nI liked it there was NO naked guys on the stage, Criss Angel 's tall blonde assistant was so beautiful with perfect body.... I think I was staring at her the entire time.... The show was fun! Loved the horror bunny theme, the performances were crazy! The final trick of cutting the girl into half was so scary! I think I figured out a few tricks, but some tricks were really cool! No idea how he did it?\n\nThey were filming his Spike TV show right after the live show, audiences were welcome to stay, we didn't want to be on TV since we were right in the front show, we had to leave:(, other ppl in the back took our front seats as soon as we left, they must love Criss Angel that much huh... \n\nI bought one of those bunnies at gift shop, soooo cute! And both of us loved this magic show, we definitely enjoy it!
