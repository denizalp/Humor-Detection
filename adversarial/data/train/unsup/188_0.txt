What a beautiful place to study at! \n\nIve been here multiple times since it opened and the place is just as nice as it was brand new. During the day time, its quiet, well lit, and have many available tables to study at (group\/individual). They even offer private rooms that you can request if you're as easily distracted as I am even by the smallest movements. \n\nGreat selection of books (both old and newly published). I appreciate the testing books the most especially while I was in nursing school. Though Im not sure if people still watch movies on DVD, this place definitely has large aisles filled with them along with some books on tape and music cd's. Children's books are available in another area of the library where they have their own little spot for story times. It gets a little crazy in that area when they kids and their parents are around but its refreshing to see them play and read.\n\nThe front desk is always ready to help if you have questions. They've printed out the number on my library card multiple times already because I keep forgetting mine at home. They also sell $1 recyclable bags to use when checking out your books. \n\nComputer labs are available for those who need it. Theres always someone in there supervising and available to help, especially with printing or navigating issues. Ive seem them be very hands on in teaching older patrons with computer use which is very good customer service on their end. \n\nWhat I like most about this library is their additional tables on the outside hall of the library for more seating. Vending machines are also available if in need of snacks and books on sale displayed for purchase.
