I can't be any happier to show up and found out that Jennifer is the owner of this restaurant. I've met her few years back at a different sushi restaurant and she made you feel so welcome no matter where she was. I am honored to be eating at her restaurant this time. \n\nWe ordered total of 3 rolls: caterpillar rolls, spicy tuna rolls and Hawaiian volcano. They are all equally delicious. I ordered ice green tea for drinks and it is refillable. Service is outstanding. I haven't seen my girlfriend for over 6 months and they basically left us alone to catch up for nearly 2 hours. Not even once Jennifer made us feel rushing out the door and I enjoy every minute of it. \n\nBefore we left, I saw some delicious sashimi combo that someone else's ordered next to our table. I'll definitely come back to try other dishes here and to see Jennifer sweet face again.
