I was STUNNED at the prices I was quoted for frames and ESPECIALLY for lenses here.  This optician is MAKING A KILLING on his shockingly high prices.\n\nI was almost speechless when he told me that single vision high index lenses could be as much as $400 - just for the lenses!  That is INSANE.\n\nI checked this place out because they are close to where I live - but I'll NEVER shop there - especially when I discovered that for about one eighth the price you can buy your glasses online at Zenni Optical.\n\nSo if you CAN'T wait a week to get your glasses mailed to you - go ahead and throw away $500 on glasses at this place.\n\nI just can't understand how people can be so blind as to shop at this rip off.
