Sooo delicious. Nom nom nom. Comes in tiny to super large portions. Do you know how cute a tiny hamburger bun is? I do. It's adorable. This food was what I needed after drinking so much.\n\nThe guy at the counter was super fast and focused. Not something you see much these days. I'd say fair prices considering where you are. \n\nBeware of the bathrooms. \n\nVegetarian burgers are an option.
