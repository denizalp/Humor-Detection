First time here, and definitely won't be the last!! It's hard to find good quality BBQ in the area, without breaking your bank. This place is the perfect balance. Because they have a simple menu, they are able to concentrate on the high quality of product. The ribs were tender and fall-off-the-bone, the brisket and pulled pork where outstanding, and even had those beautiful smoke rings. The BBQ sauces are kept warm, nice touch!! They even offered pieces of their chocolate chip cookies sprinkled with a little bit of salt!! The only thing that could have been better was the corn muffins. They were flavorful, just a tad bit on the dry side. I cannot wait to come back and try more, I'm already looking forward to my next visit, and thank you to everyone there for the amazing service!!
