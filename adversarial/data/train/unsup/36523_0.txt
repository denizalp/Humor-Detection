I got a two for one coupon when I stayed at the Mirage and went to dinner at Cravings.  The selection is outstanding and the room was filled with hungry diners. It seems like anything you want to eat is there and many items are delicious.  However, many items are sub par like the sushi.  I've eaten at many sushi places and the sushi here is a D- on the A-F scale. It doesn't compare to the Bellagio buffet
