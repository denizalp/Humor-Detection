I had highlights done here about two months ago. They were very nice about taking me for a same day appointment. When I called, and during my in-person consultation, I explained that I wanted some very thin very light highlights to try to blend in the few minor grey hairs that I have. The owner recommended doing highlights with two different colors because my hair had some new growth as well as some previously colored areas. I agreed. Unfortunately, they did so many highlights that it basically looks like all over color and it was a lot warmer than I had asked for. It doesn't look bad, it just wasn't what I wanted. I was disappointed that they wanted to charge me extra to blow out my hair. Since I was just going home I told them to just dry it. What they did was insane. Two women were standing on each side of me and basically knocking my head back and forth while they blow-dried it.
