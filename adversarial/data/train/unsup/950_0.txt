Hypnotic tattoos does a wonderful job with both peircings and tattoos.\n\ni was there to get a vertical hood peircing done.\nthe peircers name was victor.\nhe had a wonderful personality, was very professional, and made you feel comfortable (which is something i look for in people at any shop i go too).\n\nthe only odd part about it was that they do not have a private room to peirce in. They use one of the tattoo booths and pull curtains on both sides so customers walking in cant see. STILL, the booth is not fully enclosed.\n\n\nbesides that, victor was very thorough explaining everything he would do, and then gave step by step instructions on how to care for the peircing properly.\n\n\nI would highly recommend it, and plan on going back to get my tattoos fixed, and possibly a few more peircings.
