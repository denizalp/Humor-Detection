Everyday Noodles has a lot going for it:  Fast, friendly service, attractive decorations, impeccably clean just renovated interior, reasonable prices and convenient location.  They only have one issue, bland, plain food.  The textures and temperatures were right, but between us, my dinner party tried about a dozen appetizers and entrees and the flavors were consistently very simple and tame.  \n\nPlenty of people don't like intense flavors, and this would be perfect for them.  When they go, they'll only spot me at Everyday Noodles if I'm walking by it, on my way to How Lee or the Raman Bar across the street for more flavorful, adventurous fair.
