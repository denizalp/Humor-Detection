Ok so the location maybe a little shady and you may think this place has an infestation of roaches.. THINK AGAIN!  You know what they say never judge a book by it's cover... This place has amazing tacos and chicken quesedillas! I ordered the chicken quesidillas and it was amazing! really delicioous.. I also had a taste of the mira beef tacos and really good.. For drinks i had the Horchata of course.. Who wouldnt order that when in a mexican restaurant?! This place is quick and down to eart whole in the wall.. I give this a thumbs up! Si Senor for PePe's tacos!
