Ah Cumberland Terrace. My coworkers and I lovingly refer to you as dirt mall. \n\nCumberland Terrace looks exactly like the (already at that point) run-down-outdated mall that my mom used to take us to get groceries at in the mid 80s. Exactly. So it fills me with nostalgia. More importantly, it is filled with ad-execs and young suits grabbing some lunch in the food court at lunch hours. The food is horrible mall-food-court variety, no name restaurants, delis, clothing stores that sell items for less than $10, knock off purses.\n\nMost importantly, you can walk across Bloor from my office, Go into the HBC concourse at park and emerge at Holt Refrew all via Cumberland Terrace. Perfect if you want to shop, or hit the TD Bank without seeing the outside world (snowing.)\n\nBonus Points\n- Suits! (what can I say - I work in a jeans and Tshirts office)\n- There is a science\/puzzles\/smartkids store\n- There are TWO shoe repair guys\n- There is a fun Tibetan store that sells things like singing bowls\n- You can visit a myriad of things without having to go outside. \n\nMinus Points\n- don't get me started.
