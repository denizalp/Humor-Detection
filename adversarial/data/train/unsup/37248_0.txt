We checked in online and arrived 10 min before our appointment. We were greeted by the nice lady at the front desk and sent to triage within 5 minutes. Our daughter needed stitches for a cut but it wasn't really an emergency. Nonetheless, she was taken care of immediately by Dr. Armaghan, who is very nice and efficient at what she does, and we were out in 30 minutes or so. We are very pleased by the care our daughter received from Dr. Armaghan and her communication skills- addressing \nall of our questions and concerns. We will definitely return if needed and recommend it to everyone.
