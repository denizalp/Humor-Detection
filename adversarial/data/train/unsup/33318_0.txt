This was my best dining experience in Vegas.  The staff and servers (mike and jose!) were awesome.  As soon as we said we were vegetarians they gave us recommendations some of which were not even on the menu.  We got a veggie platter with plantain empanadas, sweet corn tamales , potato tacos, poblano quesadillas, and the black bean dip.  I can't even tell you how freaking good the quesadillas and tacos were.  The sweet corn tamales were so flavorful.  I usually dislike fancy Mexican but this was by far the best fancy mex I've ever had.  The service was so wonderful and the salsa trio that they give you was incredible fresh and zesty.   Thank god it was too much food that I had leftovers.  I'll be stuffing my face tomorrow morning .
