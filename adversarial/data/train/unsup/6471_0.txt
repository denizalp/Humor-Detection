Quite and dignified. Don't normally write reviews of funeral homes but this one is outstanding.  One of my neighbors for the last 17 years passed away last week and the memorial service was in the Raymer-Kepner Funeral home in Huntersville today.\n\nVery professional and the took excellent care of the family.  There were some unusual last requests involving bagpipes and his beloved Golden Retriever but the Funeral Home honored them.\n\nI've probably been to at least a dozen funerals here over the years and they have always been done with dignity and compassion.
