Definitely something for everyone.\n\nI was always big fan of Cyndy's old place, Suite Lorain. I still have the vinyl black and silver ottoman I got from there in my living room. Deering Vintage is just as swank, if not even swankier (is that even a word?).\n\nThe space is huge and well lit and everything is laid out beautifully. Items are arranged neatly by color and subject. Nothing is worse than going into a vintage shop and everything is piled on top of each other in no particular order. \n\nThis is a must stop on the Tremont Art Walk circuit. You are just about guaranteed to find a unique must-have item. I know I've found a bunch!
