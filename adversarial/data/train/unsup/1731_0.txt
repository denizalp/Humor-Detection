I am giving this restaurant 3 stars because of temperature.  I really do not like high end french food so if you are a foodie you should ignore my review.  I was more cold at this restaurant than I have ever been other than in my grocer's freezer aisle.  They brought me a shawl which was nice but it could have used a trip to the dry cleaner.  But the fact that they have shawls on hand is also concerning as you think they'd just turn down the AC--obviously!!  I think this is a good place for uptight guys in fancy suits - with cashmere jackets.  Your dates will be cold...tell them to bring some fur.  I ordered the squab bc it was the only thing on the menu I could decipher and it came very very rare.  I guess that is how fancy people eat squab.  I would have preferred a cheeseburger.
