I am so impressed by this play place, there were quite a few changes from just a couple weeks ago. I guess some people had some complaints, management totally listened and made changes!  As if this place wasn't already great, I mean come on they have staff that watch and play with your children, they care to go above and beyond to make sure your voice is heard and that parents are happy!!  Thanks Kangamoo for another great morning!!
