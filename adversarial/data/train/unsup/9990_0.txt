Yummmmm. My girlfriend took my husband and I here on our last day in Vegas and I honestly wish they had one in Seattle. It is a \"barstaurant.\" We had their kalbi jjim, budeh jjigae, and their rabokki. Everything was delicious and really spicy, just as requested. Would definitely go back when in town again. Nom nom nom.
