Wasn't clean.\n\nI've been here a handful of times and every visit went just fine until the last one. I know that going into these places there's no guarantee that you'll get consistent results unless you are seeing the same nail tech each time you go. I've been a walk-in and thus been seen by a random nail tech each time. \nThis last nail tech who did my manicure (just a standard manicure with regular polish) didn't clean up her station at all and used the same tools she'd just used on her previous client. I really did watch her tell the girl before me to get up and go sit under the UV lights and then usher me into the chair not even a moment later without moving anything. There were nail clippings on the little towel laid out on the table and I could feel the gritty acrylic dust (she had just been using a dremel tool on the nails of the client before me, which was still sitting out in front of her) as she rubbed my hands over. She clipped my nail cuticles with a cuticle clipper that already had little bits of cuticle in it (not mine) and she accidentally cut me twice. She also filed my nails in a back and forth motion which you are not supposed to do. I was feeling too timid to say anything, but I really should have. I was too much of a pushover.\nI think that because I have had good experiences at this establishment previously I wouldn't go so far as to rate it one star, but I would've hoped that this particular nail tech I dealt with would be better trained. Even if it wasn't her training that was lacking and she just happened to be very lazy, I think her co-workers (if not me because I'm a little pansy) ought to have reprimanded her.\n\nFor reference I am referring to a young girl with reddish hair. I know that's vague, and I apologize. There is an older woman there who has done an exemplary job.
