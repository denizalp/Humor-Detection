I've been to this location of Copper Branch a couple of times. The food quality and preparation is comparable to other branches. Featuring burgers, soup\/chilli, their infamous salad bowls that are available in small or regular\/large size. There are for choices in themes\/veggie base , then you pick your grain and protein. The large size of the sled bowls are pretty filling, I can never finish them. The price ranges 12-16$. \n\nThere is plenty of seating indoor and outdoors. There is a sink for customers get water and empty cups which I thought was a nice touch.I wouldn't say their staff cleans up often because I saw bowl toppling over with a full garbage and recycling bins. However for vegan fast food I can't expect anything less for cleanliness.
