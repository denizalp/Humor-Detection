This place is terrible. I'm begging you to seriously not go here! \nMy mom and I waited 15 in the water for the ladies to start on our toes. They rushed and we paid for the extra massage and they hurried through that. The lady who did my pedicure was talking to the lady next her and kept rubbing my leg with the sugar scrub in the same spot over and over and rubbed my leg raw! \nNext, after the lady put my nail polish on I didn't like the color bc it didn't match my dress for the wedding I'm a bachelorette in ... so I asked for them to switch the color. She said oh... I cover up for you. So she \"covered it up\" \nI was pissed. \nDon't go here, you'll regret it.
