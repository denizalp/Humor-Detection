Read up on the reviews since the wife and I moved here recently and enjoy breakfast out now and then. The reviews - all of them, are spot on. It's exactly as everyone described. The food was great, and at a great price. The decor and the staff were just as everyone had described.  \n\nIf, when reading the reviews you are turned off, there's a nice place down the road by the 101 called the Rustic Cafe, where it's spotless inside, air-conditioned and they play Jesus music and all the church goers head there for brunch. \n\nIf you're still intrigued, like we were, then take a chance on the Wagon Wheel and you won't be disappointed. \n\nWe showed up at 7, and the lot was near empty but it filled up fast. We sat on the outdoor patio, a porch describes it better, since it was cool out and we could watch the passersby. Food was quick coming out, and it was delicious. Forgot our cash, so had to run home quick but the waitresses were understanding. \n\nWe'll definitely be back!
