Tried the Chickery twice now (once through Foodora and once in person) both have been subpar.  Though the staff if friendly the food is just below average at best.\n\nI tried everything from the roasted chicken, chicken sanwhiches, tenders and most of the side dishes and dips.  Sad to say but if you want chicken tenders popeyes has better. Want rotisserie chicken? Swiss Chalet.  Chicken sandwiches? Anywhere else probably.  \n\nThe sauces are commercialized too sweet and too salty. No real flavour or spices coming through just a mouth full of sodium.  I must note that the mustard sauce is probably best if you have to pick one.\n\nThe sides are the redeeming factor here, the Mac and Cheese is not cheesy but good. Potato salad was actually really good.  Others less notable but OK.\n\nI wouldn't recommend going here I just can't justify the prices.  For the same amount of money you can have a more elevated to-go meal or find chicken that is much juicier.  They don't offer anything special that would warrant a revisit.
