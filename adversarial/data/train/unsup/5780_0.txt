I've been here multiple times and still haven't written a review? I think it's time I get on it. I've been on this healthy eating streak so when I was on this side of town and wanted to meet one of my favorite yelpers for lunch after my hair appointment, this place popped up automatically. \n\nIt can get busy during lunch time, but we were surprised to walk into an almost empty place on a Saturday afternoon. It's a cute little spot. Simple menu with reasonably priced items. You have to remember you are eating healthier, so expect to pay a little more for your meal. It's delish food, so you won't be disappointed. They have all their specialty salads in front of you so and all their items are made fresh to order. \n\nI defaulted to my Green Eggs & Ham flatbread. I always want to try other things, but it's just so good I order it every time. Flatbread topped with roasted red peppers, ham, eggs over medium, cheese and pesto. I also ordered their special salad, which I was told they were only going to have for one more month. It had figs, edamame and seared ahi tuna tossed with a teryaki marinade. OMG everything was so good. You can really taste the freshness of the food. I ate all of it and I was so full, but I didn't get the fata$$ feeling I get when I devour that much food. \n\nLoren ordered the vegetarian sandwhich. I didn't try it, but it looked amazing. Huge sandwhich packed full of vegetables. So colorful too. I did order a Ham & Cheese Please sandwhich for the bf. I didn't get to try it either since I had to drop it off to him at work, but he said it amazing. I will definitely have to try it next time, especially since they put Funions in it. Yes, that's right, Funions!!!! \n\nThe employees were super friendly and helpful. And you get $1 off your bill when you check  in! How can I not come back?
