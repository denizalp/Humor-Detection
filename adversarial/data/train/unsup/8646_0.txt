Items Selected:\nDate with a Nutty Pig\nOrange Marmalade\nApple Pie Fritter\nButtermilk Bar\nMaple Old Fashioned\nBlueberry Cronut\n\nDropping a friend off early at McCarran and finding Flour & Grounds Bakery apparently already shuttered it was to Las Vegas favorite Pink Box's Henderson location that I turned for breakfast and arriving just after 7:40 with the kitchen still baking the results proved to be the best experienced from the doughnuttery since my first visit to the Lake Meade location just weeks after its original opening.\n\nEver a pleasant operation, the young female staff here as smiley and polite as the other locations decorating the valley, Pink Box Henderson offers the same large selection of flavors and styles as that which is found Northwest, and having already sampled much of the stores wares on my last three visits it was in a few new items as well as old favorites that appetite was invested, the $9 tab proving quite fair.\n\nStarting first with classics, a buttermilk bar and sourcream old fashioned topped with maple glaze that trends far more natural than other places around, time seems to have improved Pink Box's cook times and with far less grease than average both items were amongst the best to be found in the city, the Apple Fritter unfortunately still less crisp than one would prefer though certainly not oily and absolutely rife with both fruit and spice.\n\nGenerally excelling at filled offerings while simple yeasted and frosted versions have, in the past, seemed a bit doughy as a result of the brioche-style base, it was with the celebrated \"Nutty Pig\" that the tasting continued and with the blue cheese and balsamic even more poignant this time around the Pink Box signature remains one of those 'destination' items, the weekly special of Orange Marmalade offering another complex taste with the slightly bitter jam offset by custard filling and piped stars of cream.\n\nPreviously disappointed by 'cronuts' that were flaccid, oily, and almost inedible despite people actually waiting in line for a taste at 9am, it was with some surprise that display versions on this visit appeared far more fanciful amidst a variety of toppings, and opting to give blueberry a sampling the results were admittedly quite shocking, the layers featuring an unprecedented degree of separation with a crisp exterior and plenty of butter beneath subdued sweetness provided by the natural fruit glaze. \n\nPerhaps a result of arriving just after opening, while all items were still fresh, or maybe a sign of improved recipes and craftsmanship as the Pink Box brand expands, suffice it to say that as far as \"artisan\" donuts go there are few better than those being offered by Pink Box Henderson today, particularly considering the cost - a repeat trip to the flagship soon warranted to see if similar can be find much closer to home.
