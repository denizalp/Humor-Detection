I came here with my bf to check out the hype! The reviews are true, the portions are huge here. I was craving for short ribs so I ordered the kalbi with chicken teriyaki. Oh my was it delicious. The chicken was super tender and soft, not rubbery like other places. Kalbi was kalbi! The macaroni salad was a bit different than what I'm used to, but it was just as good. TBH I wanted to try the chicken Katsu and hoped they had a kalbi\/katsu combo but they didn't have that option on the menu. However I read a few reviews saying the katsu wasn't too great so I guess it was meant to be. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the beef and gyoza bowl and holy cow was it huge. He usually doesn't eat much, but he finished the whole dang bowl! I guess it was that delicious. \n\nThe restaurant is quite small but when we went to dine in there was nobody else dining. The tables have buttons that you can press for service, I didn't really get to use it since we were the only ones there. The server was quick and friendly. Overall not a bad choice if you're super hungry, you'll definitely get the bang for your buck.
