Came here on a Saturday night. Definitely nice to have a place like this in Brampton--let's face it, there aren't that many food choices in Brampton. \n\nThey have $4 bar rail drinks on Saturday, perfect for a ladies night. My friend and I shared a few items. We had mussels, fish and chips and bacon-wrapped shrimp. Everything was good; no complaints.
