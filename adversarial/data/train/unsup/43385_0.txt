This is the first time I've been to this location and it's was awesome. The employees were so nice and having so much fun with guests.  It's so refreshing.  I usually go to  the Eastern and Serene which I hate that i do because they are awful and nasty and that's being nice.  This location will definitely get my business over Eastern.  This location should train others.
