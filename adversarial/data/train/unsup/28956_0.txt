Nice ballpark but the team looks like a bunch of quitters that lay down in the late innings. I don't go to their games anymore. They haven't had a winning season since they deleted their $1 seats. They have quite a few ball players with ability but as a team they \"choke\" way too often. What does it tell you about a team that leads the majors in runs scored in the first three innings but has a losing record (by 5 games at this date). This team needs to play baseball every day. If they won't play during the game, have team practices AFTER the game!!
