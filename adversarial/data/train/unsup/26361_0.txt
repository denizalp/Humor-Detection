Ok this was our first time there tonight and I had to come home and write a review. They were so nice from the moment we walked in. We waited for our party at the bar. We had a few drinks while waiting.  .  Server was very nice. Very fast. The man who seemed to be the owner was talkative and friendly. \nWe then were seated at the table our chef AUSTIN was super nice friendly,talkative and made our table laugh. We looked around and none of the other tables chefs were talkative. But they were doing cool things. Food was beyond AMAZING!!!!! Full of flavor! forget all the other reviews that say bad things. don't let them push you away.  Very good entertainment ! Keep up the good work! And ask for Austin! From Cali! Lol \nSo nice!
