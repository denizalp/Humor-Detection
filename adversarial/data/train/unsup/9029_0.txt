I'm not going to review the food, I've eaten at both the Tempe and Flagstaff locations to know that Oregano's in general is OK that's about it, it's not life changing so that said here's the issue with this new location.\n\nWe arrived at 4:03pm, walked up to the hostess stand where clearly written all over the front in a huge sign it stated \"We Open At 4pm\" this is where I have a major issue... the hostess tells me that there is already a 90 minute wait to which I didn't hold back I left out a LOUD \"WTF\" followed by \"You just opened 3 minutes ago and there's barely anyone here! \n\nThe manager who happened to walk up at that exact second tells me that they have been taking names on the wait list since 3pm... now again the issue, if you don't open till 4pm how do you have a list started at 3pm!!! \n\nThis isn't Studio 54 in 1979, or for anyone that can't get that reference, how about a red velvet rope around Radius-Axis Scottsdale which last I checked is still closed .. let's hope that this type of behavior doesn't piss off the residents of Goodyear to the point that they shy away from this place. \n\nThe bad news, I won't be back there for months... many months, the good news, there are 10 other restaurants within 500 feet that I haven't been turned away from 3 minutes after they opened the door.
