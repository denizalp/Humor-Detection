Yay for seafood!\n\nThis new captain's boil chain opened up in lieu of the golden elephant pho place. Good change? Yea, I'd say so.\n\nWent here with a friend and we ordered 2 lbs of clams, 1 lb of mussels, and a Cajun fried rice. Needless to say, we were both stuffed to the max, and our bill came up to be around $48 for 2.\n\nThe captain's boil sauce is bomb! It's so good. However, if you taste it for too long then it can get gross because it tastes very buttery. Imagine the calories in that sauce....\n\nMy overall experience was pretty good, but 1 star off for the gross fattening feeling in my stomach that's still lingering... and it has been at least 5 hours since I've eaten at captain's boil.
