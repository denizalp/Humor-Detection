Hate to admit....been here about 12 times in the last two years.  Guess when??...you're right, when friends and relatives come visit. Everyone wants to see Chumlee. It's the Old Man that I have yet to have seen.\n\nRead the reviews and you'll notice something in common. Pre 2011, you see the cast and crew every once in awhile. Now, it's like spotting Big Foot. \n\nMy opinion, this place is a trap. A tourist trap. Usually during the weekdays, it's free. But expect to pay a few dollars when it's busy. Lines can be intimidating, but really goes by quick. There's really no reason to be here longer than 15 minutes unless you're buying, pawning, selling, or hustling. But if you haven't been here, you should try it at least once. \n\nIt is pretty cool to see the items that they bought on TV. Especially cool to see how much they jacked up the prices. I use to see the crew all the time, but now they have made it, good luck.\n\nTIP:  you know one of the main members are there just by checking out the first couple of parking spots. If you see the nice black luxury cars, most likely they're in.
