Great service! I unfortunately had some damage to my windshield and needed the entire sucker replaced. The good was that they were able to get me in fairly quickly, the bad was that I was stuck there for 2 hours because I had to let the glue dry ( not a bad thing but this place is not close to anything and it is not by any means the fault of the techs) Luckily there was free wifi and  some great shows on TV that made the visit go by very quickly. They kept me informed of everything that was going on which was great. I have used Safelite before to repair a chip and I will definitely continue to use them in the future.
