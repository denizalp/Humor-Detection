I've been to a few drive in movies in my years.\nWe usually go once a summer up to the one just outside of Newmarket.\nWe decided to try this one, brought our new dog along for the night.\nGot a blanket, some tea.\n\nIt was ok for the most part. Managed to get a good spot until a guy pulled in about 10 mins into the first movie in a truck two rows behind us and left his lights on for the entire movie. Not the fault of the venue, but I expected that at some point someone from the staff would have asked them to turn it off. Not hard to miss.\n\nWe relocated to another space halfway through the movie.\n\nThe big disappointment for us was when the first movie was done.\nWe wanted to switch to another screen because the second movie on our screen didn't appeal to us at all. \n\nAt every single drive in I've ever been to you were allowed to do this.\nNot at this place.\n\nWe were forced to leave.\n\nI really don't see the issue of switching screens. If I pay for two movies then let me see whatever two movies I want.
