So I'll start by saying I'm happy to have a new place to go when visiting NDG friends. I like oysters a lot, and wine outside, and crazy Ceasar cocktails with crab legs poking out of them, and very friendly knowledgeable charming service. Lucille has all of these things in spades and these are great ways to win my heart. \n\nUncrowded on a weekday 5a7, the patio bakes in the sun for the first hourish but then the shade hits and the spot becomes more comfortable, and the crowds come sauntering in. The inside is cool, literally and figuratively, though walking sort of through the kitchen to get to the confusingly signaged washrooms is perplexing and of dubious hygiene. \n\nMy biggest gripe: the oysters were overpriced and 3\/4 of the ones I tried had shell in them. I don't mind paying for perfect, but this wasn't it. I had a lovely time anyway, but man, nothing sticks in my craw like grit in an oyster.
