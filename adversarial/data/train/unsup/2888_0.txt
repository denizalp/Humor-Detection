Excuse me as a wheeze through this review. My stomach has completely taken over most of the room usually reserved for my lungs.\n\nI came here with Chad, Nicolle and Danielle for some impromptu vegan feasting. As an appetizer, we split some fries that were basically the vegan version of Taco Bell Fries Supreme, in a very VERY good way. I basically lived off those in high school, and I've been craving a vegan (or at the very least dairy-free) version for years. The sour cream alone blew me away. We also split an order of wings, which tasted just like meaty hot wings, though I suspect it's because of their liberal use of Frank's Red Hot sauce.\n\nI ordered the Unchicken n' Waffles and they were DELICIOUS. In fact, I have half the order sitting in my fridge right now, mocking me. Everyone else at the table loved their meals. Chad and Danielle had the Unchicken Sandwich and both were very very happy with them. Nicole was also very happy with her head-size Po'Boy sandwich. The people in the kitchen appear to have some kind of magic power for breading, because all the unchicken things were deliciously and incredibly breaded. I usually hate breading, but I LOVED this.\n\nUnfortunately, neither of us had room for dessert.\n\nThe service was cordial and friendly, and everything came out at a good rate. The prices were also quite good for the amount of food.\n\nI will definitely be back again, and soon.
