I adore this place, and most especially I adore the matron owner who I lovingly refer to as Madam Mao. I am continually disappointed with the Chinese food in Las Vegas. Vegas has some great Asian food, but for some reason Chinese food is often little better than fast food quality, or chain style Americanized Chinese. Sadly, after visiting China a couple of times I have become a Chinese food snob. \n\nWelp, Bobo satisfies my Northern Chinese food needs. The quality of the food is fresh and well made. The meals have a a good, strong, Chinese flavor. The meats are not over cooked and the veggies remain crisp. The sauces are succulent and not full of sugar which is so often he case in American Chinese food. For the food alone it is worth the trip across town. Couple this with the fact the proprietor hasn't raised prices in more than 6 years. You can get in an out with a huge delicious meal for two people for less than $25. \n\nThere is a down side. The dining room is tiny. Just four tables. Most of their business is takeout. They do a brisk take out business so you have to be wiling to wait for your main dishes as they only have one cook and one server. \n\nSpeaking of the service, the proprietor is a bit of an acquired taste. Some might view her as abrupt with little tolerance for indecisive customers, but I adore her. She can cast a disappointing gaze in your direction if she is not happy with you. However, she is also very kind and rewarding if you are a good guest. She has an excellent memory for good guest which has helped her create a very loyal customer base. Half the reason I enjoy eating there is because of my totally inappropriate crush on Madam Mao and loving sternness. \n\nif you are craving Chinese it is worth a trip to check out. You might not get a seat right away, and you might get dirty looks from Madam Mao if you decide to wait instead of just ordering the food to go, but the food and for show are the best you are going to get for the price.
