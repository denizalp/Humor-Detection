My husband and I went last Sunday around 12 noon and we didn't have to wait. There were a few tables inside and outside.  We chose to sit inside because it looked so charming. Loved the ambience and decor! We ordered 2 classic crepes (butter\/sugar) and they were delicious!! We ordered a fresh OJ which was cold and sweet (I hate when restaurants serve warm OJ!). Cappuccino was perfect! We would definitely come here again! Loved how it was just off Spadina but yet was so quiet!
