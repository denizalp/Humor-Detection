I usually wouldn't write about a large-chain fast food joint like Jack in the Box.. but the conversation through the drive through was one I've never heard:\n\n\"Hi, I'd like the #2, no bacon and Dr. Pepper please.\"\n\n\"Ok, do you want any sauces with that?\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah, ketchup.\"\n\n\".........uh... What did you say?\"\n\n\"Ketchup.\"\n\n\"Chicken?\"\n\n\"No, KETCHUP.\"\n\n\"Oh..... okay. Can you do me a favor? Can you look on the screen and see if you're order is correct?\"\n\n\"Yeah, uh-huh, it looks fine.\"\n\nI drive up to pick up my food and the girl is trying not to laugh as she is putting my food together... She hands the bag over to me and says 'she put something special on there for you.\" I was like, ???... and said \"What did she put on there?\" (Thinking it was something nasty or weird). \"Oh, she just a smiley face on your food\". I look at the box that burger sat in and there was a smiley face drawn on top with a sharpie. OK..... \n\nDid not know what to say to that. I drove away a little confused and laughing on the inside.
