Picked this restaurant based on reviews and had family come to town to celebrate my daughter's 25th birthday. Atmosphere is what we expected and all steaks were cooked to perfection. Unfortunately the sides were served luke warm. The creamed spinach tasted more like a dip and the mushrooms were cold.  Our bread came late and the server just didn't seem like she knew what she was suppose to do. We never did get cheese and crackers.It was a busy night but shouldn't be an excuse.
