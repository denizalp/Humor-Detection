I went here to pick up some dessert before going to a family dinner.  The dinner was for three so I wanted to pick up something small.  I went around 5 PM and at that time, most of the stuff was gone.  I ended up getting cake truffles.  I got 8 different flavors but only tried three.  They were decent - moist and rich.  I couldn't differentiate between all of the flavors though.  A little overly sweet for my taste, but I'm not a huge dessert person.  My guests enjoyed them though.  I got a box of 8 for about $13.  I originally wanted only 6, but the box that they put them in was far too big, so I had to add in two so that it didn't look as if I ate 2 cake balls in the car.
