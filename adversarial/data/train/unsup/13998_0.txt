Polish old. Manicure for natural nails terrible. The woman taking care of my nails kept trying to upsell me to a gel manicure four times I had to tell her no I did not want it\n\nThey charge $12 for a natural manicure polish is super old it's already bubbled they don't let the coats dry in between putting the next layer on I'm going to have to take the polish off tonight myself\n\nWoman taking care of me wouldn't even talk to me or look at me she kept looking out the window every 30 seconds like he was thinking somebody was going to walk up to the window with the gun kind of wake me out. Very nervous and inattentive \n\nThe drying is disgusting and dirty as well as the bathroom I had asked them to wipe off the driying station because it had all kinds of oils and disgusting to Breonna I wasn't going to put my hands on that to dry my nails\n\n\n\nVery dirty
