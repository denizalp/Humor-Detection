I've got to say that I was very underwhelmed by my eggslut experience. Perhaps my expectations were too high from all the hype.  I had the fairfax which I found messy, very greasy, and unpleasantly mushy. I would have honestly preferred a Mcmuffin from Mcdonalds. On the upside, the presentation was adorable and it kept me full for a good 8 hours!\n\nThe wait wasn't too bad so thankfully I didn't feel like I wasted too much time on this disappointing experience.
