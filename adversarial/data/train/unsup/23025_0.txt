With the addition of Over Easy last week, 40th Street in Arcadia is becoming more and more of a hip restaurant row. Retro chairs [see photo] and space-age stools dot the interior of the cozy joint owned by Sol y Sombra chef Aaron May.\n\nThe place, which is next door to The Vig, recalls a Matt's Big Breakfast feel (and was so alluded in Java magazine) for this side of town and manages to do so in an old 1970s mission style Taco Bell. \n\nI wouldn't have been able to tell if I didn't know. Regardless, the food here is delicious and compared to other places I did not feel like I ingested a tub of butter. I ordered the hearty Wolf Pack with a pancake on the side and I was in heaven. \n\nTwo (count them, TWO!)  layers of hash browns [see photo] with two scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and strips of bacon in the middle. The eggs were just the right consistency and hash browns were browned just right and tasted terrific with garlic salt and pepper. A fluffy griddled pancake with syrup on the side, fresh squeezed orange juice and a complimentary New York Times at the counter also greeted my morning grumpiness and I was quickly satiated.  Altogether the meal came out to $12 + tax.  A bit pricey, but worth it knowing you get what you pay for.\n\nI briefly talked with the chef's managing partner who went into detail about the tater tots with tomato jam (that I missed on the menu) and the bacon reduction sauce that comes with the brioche.\n\nMy only complaints would be minor.\n\nSmall quarters: With about half of the seats outside on the patio, it's probably a few seats more than MBB.  There was brisk business yesterday on a weekday morning, but on the weekend I can see how the crowds would grow.\n\nA la carte-like menu: This is a trend I'm not particularly fond of, especially for breakfast. Several of the entrees don't come with either eggs or potatoes. The Loretta breakfast sandwich are examples of entrees that don't come with eggs. The Over Easy brioche and omelettes don't come with potatoes. The wait staff just shrugged it off as, \"Oh you can just order [blank] on the side.\"  I disagree, especially when you're paying nearly $10 for an entre or omelette.\n\nSemi-scattered staff:  Everyone was friendly and engaged in small talk with people at the counter.  But after asking twice for my check, I figured it was a small blip in the overall experience.\n\nDelicious breakfast food with a cool hip feel? This neighborhood will be all over it.  I'm looking forward to the next visit.\n\nEDIT: 1\/19\/08 -- OK, I'm upping this to 4.5 stars.  Service was excellent today.  And the country fries (and tater tots with tomato jam)  were outstanding.  They were deep fried with seasoned salt, parsley...yum!
