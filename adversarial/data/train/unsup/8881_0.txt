This place is awesome!!  I just went there today, I was there around 10 AM (Friday morning).  I just needed to renew my health card.  I was in and out the door in less than EIGHT MINUTES.  I had all my documents as requested so that helped things out.  There were two people ahead of me in line so I actually had to wait for a couple minutes.  Four or five of the counters were open?  Not sure, didn't think to count.  The lady at the counter was incredibly friendly and nice (but not overly-annoying friendly which I dislike).  I usually dread this type of thing because the people who work there are usually not very nice but this was a great change.  She reviewed my documents, took the picture, had me sign a couple things, and I was out of there.  It was great!  I will definitely be back here ... in five years!
