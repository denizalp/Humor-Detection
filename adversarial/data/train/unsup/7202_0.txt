We came to Moira sushi for a friend's birthday.  We didn't have any issues with service - our waitress was prompt and friendly.  We had a great bottle of Seven Hills wine.  The sushi was good, but not better than many cheaper places in the Valley.  We had a cool appetizer where you cooked your own beef on a hot stone, but the amount of food you get for the price you pay isn't ideal.  Still, it's a prime area of town at a classy joint, so you're probably paying some for ambiance.  \n\nDecent food for a somewhat expensive price.
