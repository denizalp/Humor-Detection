3.5 stars, rounding up to 4 because I am giving Ho Ho Cherry House the benefit of the doubt. \n\nWhy, you may ask? Well, ask yourself this. How many crappy Chinese take out places have you been to\/ordered from in Charlotte? \"Too many,\" you say? Exactly. That's why Ho Ho Cherry House is deserving of 4 stars! It's reliable and fills that Chinese food craving that we all have with great food. It blows away the Chinese takeout competition in Charlotte easily.\n\nPros: Good prices, pretty good portions, delivery radius is pretty big compared to other delivery places, food was solid\n\nCons: Delivery took a while, took about 1 hour 30 mins when the expected time was 1 hour, so the food was not as crispy as it should be\n\nRecommend: General Tso's chicken (pretty hard to mess this one up), crab rangoons, fried chicken wings\n\nLong story short: Good, reliable Chinese take out in Charlotte which, from my experiences, is quite rare. I will be ordering again!
