I was just here this past weekend and I LOVED IT!  \n\nBeing in my late 20s and having lived in SoCal my whole life, I was never really into clubs and so, I had never really gone to a real club in Vegas.  \n\nI always had this perception that Vegas clubs was just long lines and crowded venues.  \n\nMy friend had bought tickets prior to the event which was Battletrack: Hip Hop vs House I believe.  IT WAS AWESOME!  \n\nI was so pumped up when I was waiting in line nearing the entrance.  I could hear the music and see the lights, it was absolutely amazing when I walked out to the venue. I did a 360, looking from my left to my right and all the way around.  I just had to take it all in.  \n\nI loved how it was 85+ degrees outside, I definitely got a work out from all the dancing I was doing.  I have to say that I had never had that much fun dancing in my life.  The music was so good that I had to take off my 4 inch heels (which I set aside with my friends) in order to fully bust out my dance moves.\n\nThere's tons of seating if you get tired from standing or dancing which is great, it's horrible when the only seats available are those with table service.  \n\nThere was also a semi-covered area where the DJ was which was air-conditioned.  Although I definitely prefered being outdoors instead.  It gave me more of a carefree feeling and it didn't feel as crowded.  \n\nI remember that there were a ton of pretty girls...I didn't notice as much eye candy for myself....but i think it might have been because I was too preoccupied dancing by myself within my circle of friends.  \n\nI think this is a must try if you're in Vegas.  I have already told a bunch of my friends about it and I want to go back already! \n\n3 blisters from dancing by the end of the night = A GREAT TIME!
