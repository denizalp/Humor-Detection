Despite my harsh past review (which, I totally think is justified btw), I decided to give Bolt another go a few months ago when I had a craving for a freshly squeezed juice, and since then I have been a frequent customer. So there you go Bolt, you converted me, and I'm sure you're happy about it. Since then I have ordered the freshly squeezed juice, smoothies (different flavours, and not the one that I previously wrote about that I didn't like, the Lemon something is really really good). And actually, I have developed a taste for the Acai bowls which I have fallen in love with and give me great joy. I even started making them at home (I got the acai smoothie packs they use and I had the other ingredients) along with coconut whipped cream, but something I still like to get them when I'm downtown for work on the weekend (its a 5 min. walk), and sit outside the restaurant). Last time I went I even shared the oatmeal from the acai bowl with a cute birdie who really enjoyed it (did you know birds like raw oats? now you do). This place is expensive, however, I think some things are justified and some things arent. I picked up a teenie tiny brownie (looked like a half a regular brownie), for $3, and half a chocolate bar for 6.50, lol. I don't regret it, but it's pricey. For what goes into the acai bowl, I think the price is justified because they use great ingredients. I really think that there's something for everyone here, even if you aren't vegan\/gluten free\/dairy free\/refined sugar free, etc. Bonus points for everything being gluten free here as well. This place is truly unique and offers something different.
