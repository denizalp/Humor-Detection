I used to be jealous that the east coast had whitecastle. Having had some, I've changed my mind. \n\nFresh ingredients, never frozen patties, fresh cut veggies and fries made to order, and great shakes. At a incredibly affordable price for the top quality food you're getting. The wait is usually longer, but that's how it should be. Real food should not be made at microwave speeds.  They also have the infamous secret menu. \n\nMy usual order: #3 (hamburger, double meat, whole grilled onion, and fries well-done)\n\nSimple. Fresh. Cheap. Convenient. \nThis is the pinnacle of conventional fast-food establishments.
