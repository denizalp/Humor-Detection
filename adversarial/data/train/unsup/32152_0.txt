One time here and I quickly found that I am a believer! Boy, is the food fresh and yummy! I ordered the guacamole appetizer, which was served with chips, though it was so wonderful I just ate it with a spoon. The salsa is hands down, the best salsa I've had! You can taste the fresh ingredients in every bite! I think the guacamole appetizer was around $4 or 6, which is a great price considering it is a large serving. I also ordered the chicken fajita, which was packed with vegetables, chicken and oil- completely satiating and full of flavor! Everyone's food looked excellent, there was nothing that didn't look completely and utterly appetizing. The restaurant is cute inside- it looks like a smaller operated chain so it isn't extravagant or over the top. In fact, much of the decor is rather random and looks handmade, but still gives you an authentic vibe. I really enjoyed my overall experience here and am looking forward in being a regular here!
