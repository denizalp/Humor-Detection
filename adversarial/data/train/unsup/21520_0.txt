Dear Barry--\n\nI have an observation, more than a review.\n\nWhen we first moved here nearly five years ago.  The only place in town to get some Chicago food was Luke's.  Then Al's opened, but failed miserably and closed quickly.   You can still see my Two Star review.  \n\nThis time last year (December 19, 2011), you took over and re-opened Al's, making it a genuine Chicago place. \n\nKing Scott and I came by after the re-opening and thought it was just as good as the one on 1079 W. Taylor Street,http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/als-no-1-italian-beef-chicago in Chicago's \"Little Italy\" near UIC, or the one on West Adams http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/als-italian-beef-chicago \n\nWhat really knocked me out, were all the One Star, No profile Picture, One Review Yelp'ers who wanted to dump on your (Barry's) parade.  Who knew that Chicago dogs were so competitive here in Arizona?  \n\nI myself got a bunch of \"Neg-heads\" writing private messages, saying they couldn't eat here, never had a bite of the food, but thought the place was crap.  Or, the cheap-ohs who thought the prices were too high.  Geez!\n\nI just came back from having lunch ($9.50) here and had a great time.  I ordered the Italian combo dipped, with gravy on the side.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!\n\nI still go to Luke's from time to time, but Barry (Al) please know, you make a good Chicago Italian Beef! \n\nCongrats to you and thank you for persevering!  \n\n--R\/Georgie
