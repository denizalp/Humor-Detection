So glad there's a good sushi place in the neighborhood! Came here as a recommendation from a family member. Came for a quick lunch..but was surprised! Definitely not a dine-in restaurant (yet!). No tea or water  is served with your meal (extra $).  Seems like it might be a take-out concept. They're still on their soft opening, so I'm sure lots will change :)\n\nOrdered 2 rolls and a sashimi bowl. Was happy with the quality and pricing! Will definitely be back!\n\nTip - 10% off when paying cash.
