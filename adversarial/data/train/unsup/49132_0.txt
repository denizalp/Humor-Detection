I find myself walking around Kierland a lot to window shop or meet up with some friends. Kierland is a great browsing mall because:\n* It's not to big\n* Interesting shops\n* Lots of good restaurants\n* Nice atmosphere\n\nOne of the reasons I find myself at Kierland so often is because it is literally five, if that, minutes from my parents house. Some of the stores I like to go in are Crate and Barrel, Z Gallery, 42 Saint, Cos Bar, Anthropologie, a huge Barnes and Nobel, Coach, and J Crew to name a few. It's a nice and relaxing experience unlike most malls which are crawling with teenie boppers.
