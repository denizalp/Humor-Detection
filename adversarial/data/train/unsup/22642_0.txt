Well, I finally went on with some friends and had a BLAST! Going in the middle of December means you're getting blasted with tons of cold air! I had tears coming down my face and red cheeks after, but it was so worth it! The speed, pauses, thrills, and loops were just right! It was $14, but a good price to seek some Vegas coaster thrills! It was super nice going back into the warm arcade after! They made us put everything in lockers even though my friend accidentally had her phone in her pocket during the ride and it made it through! Hmm...
