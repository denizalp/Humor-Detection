I discovered this restaurant actually at the Taste of Cleveland, where I tried some delicious gumbo at their booth.  There's a good reason why they keep on winning each year for best entree at the Taste of Cleveland festival.\n\nAfter eating at this restaurant tonight, I can honestly say that I've had\n\nThe best jambalaya I've ever tasted\nThe best red beans and rice I've ever tasted\nQuite possibly the best fried catfish I've ever tasted\n... You get the point, right?\n\nEven the bread served with the jambalaya was delicious.  2 thick slices of French bread, grilled with butter and soaked with honey on both sides.\n\nOh, and the salad that came with the jambalaya- so good!  It was a giant salad filled with that type of \"Spring mix\" salad, with strawberries, carrots, cucumber, raisins, apples, and toasted pecans.  The fruits were arranged in a decorative pattern on the salad, and it came with a spicy herb vinaigrette.\n\nService is a little slow, but worth the wait!
