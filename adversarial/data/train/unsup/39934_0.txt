Good dim sum, not too expensive, out in Mississauga but worth the trip. \n\nOur family spent many Sunday brunches here and I always love going with a big group so we can order a larger variety.\n\nI think it's consistently good, not consistently great but good and clean and busy which means the food is usually fresh. When I lived in Taipei we would never eat anywhere where there wasn't a wait because that meant the food usually sat around. Which is a policy I usually stick to for Chinese Restaurants. \n\nI'm giving it 4 stars mainly because if I want dim sum in Toronto it's usually the place I think of first. But really maybe it should be 3.5?\n\nNot sure about the service or non-dim sum menu so this review is just for dim sum.\n\nI like anything with bbq pork, especially the bbq pork wrapped in thin sheets of rice noodle, and baked bbq pork buns. I also love the rice noodles with a side of xo sauce, wrapped sticky rice, Chinese broccoli and deep fried sticky rice ball with sesame or red bean paste and egg tarts for dessert.\n\nNot sure how useful these descriptions are because I only know the Chinese names so I'm describing the dishes... sorry but if you've been to dim sum before you might be able to figure it out. Next time I go I'll try to update the names.
