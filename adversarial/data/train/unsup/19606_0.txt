The lunch was pretty good and I loved the desserts. I'm a creme brulee addict (and yet I haven't had it in years).\n\nThe breakfasts, however, are worth skipping. I was hoping for a fruit salad or some yogurt. Instead there were melons, apples, and whole bananas as well as lots of eggs, meat, potatoes, pancakes, etc. The cream of wheat was pretty horrible and the \"eggs benedict\" seemed like a microwave-version of what it's supposed to be. That's what I usually order when I go out for breakfast, so I was pretty sad to find a stiff egg blob on top of ham and a biscuit that I couldn't manage to cut with my knife.\n\nThe service was being served drinks and having them pick up plates... and that was hit or miss. One server stole a ketchup bottle from a table with people sitting there (which I thought was odd) and kept forgetting our drink order (and thinking \"tea\" was \"iced tea\"). Another waitress was great. \n\nI was kind of happy they never pushed getting beer or mixed drinks with our meals (juice\/water\/tea\/coffee\/soda are included in buffet price --- booze costs extra) because I was thinking my parents would give me funny looks if I kept ordering cocktails for breakfast and\/or lunch.\n\nThe buffets got us so full that each day we generally only needed to eat a late breakfast or lunch and then just have small snacks in the room.\n\nWe ate there a couple times because my parents didn't feel like going to restaurants or going far from the room, so .... this was kind of it. I think my parents liked it more than I did, but.... apparently I'm just pickier than they are?\n\nIt was about $11.95 for breakfast, $13.95 for lunch, and.... well, I never had dinner there.
