Coming here for the eight or ninth time for dinner, we knew the food would be fantastic, but more importantly, we were mentally prepared for poor service. \n\nThe Persian Room bills itself as a fine dining experience , but we know better, and thus were not expecting stellar service. Hence, when it took 45 minutes to receive the hummus \/ yogurt platter, we did not become upset.  The two types of yogurt were creamy, had enough lemon, and were quickly gobbled up by our party of eight. Drinks were brought out haphazardly and often forgotten completely.  The wine pours were the least generous I have ever seen. The specialty drinks were mixed well.  Sixty five minutes after we were seated, we were asked if we were ready to order. We replied that we we still waiting for our second appetizer, the Tah Dig.  They acknowledged that they forget and rushed the order.  It was, as expected, delicious.  The meat was cut with your fork tender. By now, the manager and two other people were trying to do good, comped our forgotten appetizer's ( we didn't ask)  and were falling over each other trying to redeem themselves.  As I mentioned, it was not a big deal since I expected the poor service knowing thr food would more than make up for the deficiencies.  \n\nThe food is great Persian food, likely the best in Arizona and would probably rank high in the LA area also. Four stars are strictly for the food.   I keep coming back with the expectation of relaxing, let the mistakes happen, and enjoy the tasty food.
