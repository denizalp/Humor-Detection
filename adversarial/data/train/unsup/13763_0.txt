This was an ok place for us. I sort of took a chance on it. Here was our experience.\n\nI was running out of time for making a reservation for two nights. I based my decision on reading a few reviews, rated 4.2 out of 5 on Expedia, the low price and the location. \n\nRoom: We had an updated unit that had been modernized and was clean. Everything worked well. But the sheets\/mattress pad didn't look like it fit on the mattress properly. One does not want to be reminded about what might be under a hotel mattress pad. The beds weren't any worse than what we had experienced the previous 2 weeks at various hotels. The lock on the door was secure and the hotel appeared to be fully booked. Very quiet.\n\nService: Friendly and helpful and got the job done. Not your typical customer service pro desk staff. They allowed our early arrival without an issue.\n\nThe grounds were well maintained and the pool and the bird cage were nice. There clearly has been a serious effort to modernize this property since it looks like it is from the 60's era. The bar\/restaurant is nice but had few customers. The location is in the middle of a street of car dealers and strip malls. One massage parlor with its rear entrance faces the small parking lot creates its own issues, as it appears to bring down the level of trust one might have when assessing this facility. But, perhaps that is a plus for certain customers. I'll leave it at that.\n\nImpression: It was OK for our purposes. None of our worries or apprehension about the place came true. Would I stay here again?  Yes, possibly, if the price was right and my wife wasn't with me. I would spend a little more time searching online now that I have a better idea of what is available in Scottsdale and surrounding areas.\n\nIt is three stars because we had a nice room and the drive to the airport for an early flight was very easy. It is not 4.2 stars.
