After a 45 minute wait, my mom and I were finally seated in a comfy booth amidst its too-modern-for-me decor. \n\n(Note: you're not allowed to bring outside food or drinks into this place (health code apparently?). I've never been told that before so that was news to me. Besides, what were we supposed to do for 45 minutes?)\n\nAnyways, the service was kinda odd. It looked like there were 3 people cooking, 3 people hanging out beside or behind the bar seating people, and 1 person serving. Huhhhhh? But besides that oddity, our server was pretty good. I even saw her make my Caesar. You go, girl. Way to multitask!!\n\nSo you're probably wondering why I gave this place 4\/5 stars? It's the food.\n\nThe food was so delicious: Caesar, huevos rancheros (with chorizo), Spanish hash, and a side of red velvet pancakes. The huevos included deliciousness layered between crispy nachos. I enjoyed the successful flavour and texture combos. The hash was a tad salty but still yummy. The pancakes and cream cheese frosting...wow! A tad crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. \n\nI highly recommend this resto. I was thoroughly impressed by the taste and quality of the food here. Definitely worth the wait.
