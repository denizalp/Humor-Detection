The instructors here are great, they seem well-trained and knowledgeable.  I appreciate that they seem to know the theory of yoga - i.e. what the poses will do for your energy\/mind.  The instructors are encouraging, but don't push people past their limits. In terms of facilities, the studios\/changerooms are clean with free lockers.  They offer complimentary tea and have a little shop with yoga gear\/cosmetics.   However, if you don't like the spiritual side of yoga, this may not be the right place for you
