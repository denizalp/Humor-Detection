First time at Ncounter and seemed super popular if the line indicated anything! You stan walk up and order your good, get a letter, and they bring it out to you. The restaurant was clean and they ran it smoothly. \n\nThe food was super tasty and all I had was a salad and a cup of soup!! Definitely recommended!
