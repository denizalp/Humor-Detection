After having good experiences with aesthetician at Afif, I decided to treat myself and get a pedicure ($40).\n\nGetting a pedicure here is the ultimate experience! Cinzia did my pedicure. She brought me downstairs in the spa room where she had me sitting up on the spa bed- yes, you have your spa room instead of sitting on a massage chair like in other places with other people hustling and bustling about around you. The room was cozy, super clean, stacked with the latest magazines and air-conditioned! A bubbly warm foot soak was prepared for me in a portable pedicure basin and Cinzia presented a large box of OPI polishes for me to choose a polish. Also, you get a complimentary beverage- I had a delicious cappuccino dusted with cinnamon.\n\nCinzia took her time with my pedicure and used great products to ensure my feet were left soft and supple. The foot massage was heavenly and lasted a good amount of time. My nails were done to perfection and I truly loved how my feet were taken care of. The best part was that my pedicure lasted for almost two months!\n\nIf you're looking for the true spa pedicure experience, ask for Cinzia at Afif Salon, you won't be disappointed.
