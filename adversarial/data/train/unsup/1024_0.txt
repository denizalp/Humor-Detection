This rock meets western themed restaurant is a fun place to enjoy a good night out! The service is top notch and the food is amazing! I highly recommend their steaks and you MUST add truffle butter and garlic shrimp. Very delicious. We were  brought over a giant pink cotton candy along with shots for free on the owner!!  Can't beat service like that!!!  Ending your night riding the bull is always the way to go...
