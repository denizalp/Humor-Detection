I was here on Tuesday (Uptown location) for the 6:00 pm class.\n\nPros:\n- Good place for starting off. \n-There are 3 locations, uptown being the largest. \n- Punching bags are off to the far side away from where classes take place which is nice.\n- Change room is clean and there were enough lockers for everyone. \n- Lot's of room. \n- At the Downtown location, I was immediately welcomed at the door. \n- The pace is good for those who are just starting to work out. \n\nCons:\n- You really do need to buy gloves, even if it's a trial class because the equipment  (spare gloves) smells really awful. And no, it's not the smell of sweat, it's a scent that's rather indescribable. \n- The claim for TKMT is that no one is judgemental however the instructor said I looked horrible. I don't think she meant it to be offensive, but I was embarrassed since the whole Level 1 class turned their heads to look at me. I think the word was just a negative connotation is all. \n\n\nI suggest you bring a friend for the first trial for a comfortable experience.
