We stayed here since it was close by all of the events for the Rock 'n Roll Marathon. We may be a little jaded since we have stayed at some of the nicest places in Vegas, but the Flamingo was a big disappointment. The casino needs better ventilation for all the smoke. The room we initially went to was not clean, so we were \"upgraded\" to a room higher up that was next to the elevator and our view was the back parking lot. The photos online make it look like the entire hotel had  renovation, which I think was just some new paint and a bedspread. The room was still very old. We had to laugh when we saw the shower head (see photo), which was actually a bathtub faucet with a shower head attached to it. Overall, I doubt we would stay here again.
