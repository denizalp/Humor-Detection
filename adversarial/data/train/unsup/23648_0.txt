Open until 10pm on Sundays? It doesn't get any better than that! \n\nI always keep this store in mind when I want random holiday goodies such as Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's wall clings and other seasonal decorations. Somehow, I always end up leaving with things I didn't even plan on buying like cookies and coconut water. \n\nThey have a decent produce selection: bell peppers, cucumbers, bean sprouts, artichokes and plump eggplant- to name a few. I might not recommend purchasing your entire groceries here, as they add up quicker than you think, but it's a great option to grab an item or two.\n\nHey, you might not even need anything but this store is always fun to browse and kill time - why not see what useful\/useless gems you can find!
