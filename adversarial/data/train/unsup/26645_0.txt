Your expectations going in will be important. Name of restaurant is the key. It is a hole in the wall so don't expect \"four seasons\" service. It's a crowded lil place and the servers do the best they can. Food is better than average and you get salad, bread, and wine with your meal. Bread was Awesome!!!!
