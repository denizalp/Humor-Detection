Jos A Bank's is not the best men's store in the area, but from time to I have found some things here that make for nice gifts.  I bought a couple of cashmere blend sweaters that were on sale. While they weren't the best quality in the world, for the price point, they were really not bad. I have found the service in this store to be a little better than I experienced at other locations.
