This was my 17th trip to Vegas and my company booked me at this place. I can't imagine what they paid for it, but really no price would be a good price for this place. I could write a book about what was wrong with it but I'm just going to limit myself to a few aspects that stood out: \n\n1) They gave me a room in the pyramid after the company paid for a room in another part of the hotel and told me it's the same price - definitely not and there is no window...or not a flat against the wall window. So the window is slanted against the ceiling in a weird angle at which there is no real view and the sun doesn't shine in. WOW. No. It' can you make feel CLAUSTROPHOBIC.\n\n2) NO ROOM SERVICE AFTER 2PM??!?! And very limited places to eat in this hotel. WOW. If you like junk food (fried chicken, nathans) then go ahead...of course, it's a nice quick walk to the Mandalay bay but there's nothing around here. \n\n3) Just an old spot - which is fun for about 5 minutes if you want to reminisce about old school Vegas and then move on. They need to renovate A LOT.\n\n4) No one helps with bags or luggage.\n\n5) Rooms don't feel clean at all...shower is pretty gross and looks like it was built in 1962. \n\n6) One decent bar as the other that I went through closed at 10PM on a Saturday.\n\nOverall, I am not too picky about my hotels when travelling for work because I'm in and out but this is the type of place that you don't want to be in at all. Our company booked over 20 rooms and everyone complained. (The sushi restaurant was the one shining spot...until a HUGE piece of dust fell in my food...check the other review). \n\nNever again. I'd rather book my own room somewhere else and pay the difference. \n\nSKIP IT.
