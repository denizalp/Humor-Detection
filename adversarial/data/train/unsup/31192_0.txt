In a town that sometimes seems to run on quarters, this is by far the best place to spend them.\n\nI am a pinball fan.  I have been a fan since the days that I had to stand on a milk crate to see the whole table.  This place is Mecca, and a required stop whenever I'm in Vegas.\n\nI haven't seen this many different working tables in one place since the arcade boom of the 80s.  You haven't either. And these are maintained far far better than anything you'd find in the wild, now or in the past.  This place is amazing.  (And it doesn't have the crowds of CA Extreme or the Pacific Pinball Expo)\n\nAn easy bus ride from the four corners, a world away from the strip, and the highlight of many many peoples' trip to Vegas...  if you haven't been to the pinball hall of fame, you haven't really played pinball.
