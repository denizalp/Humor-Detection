This was a neat spot in Phoenix adjacent to the Phoenix zoo. I first saw this place from an Expedia travel video and it looked very intriguing to visit. We had some time in the morning of our last day in Phoenix so we decided to visit this place.\n\nIt is definitely deceiving that this place is listed as a hike on yelp. If a 0.1 mile walk to the top of the hill counts as hiking, I guess I hike to my house as well. Hole-in-the-Rock is more like a viewpoint or a landmark. \n\nGoing up to the top, you can see a panaramic view of Phoenix, Tempe, and Scottsdale. The desert view doesn't really appeal to me but it could be more appealing to others. Either way, it was a unique viewpoint.\n\nThe Hole-in-the-Rock isn't just a hole in the rock. There's plenty of shaded space to sit and relax around it and even a little room to roam around on the rock. It could be a good spot to relax in the shade for some time. \n\nCool spot to see once, but probably won't come back!
