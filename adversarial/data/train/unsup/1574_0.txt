For such a beautiful place, they had the worst service I've ever seen!  I took my dad out there for his birthday, and the waitress was rude from the beginning.  She wouldn't take half of our drink orders and she didn't get out dinner orders right.  We were still patient and calm until she decided she wasn't going to fix our orders and she wouldn't bring us more drinks.  When I asked for a manager she said she was the manager and there was no one else I could speak to!  I've never witnessed something like that at a restaurant and they should be embarrassed by their service!!  It blows my mind!  There are much better restaurants in the area that are guaranteed to have better service.  Fast food restaurants have better service and nicer staff.
