I'm not sure what to say about this place... The bagels were ok... I love the fact that you can watch them being made so you know they're gonna be fresh. I felt like they kind of lacked the flavor I was craving though. The staff was interesting, I found that when I walked in they were all standing around talking and I had a weird suspicion they were talking about me... Maybe I'm paranoid but it's just how it felt. I do love the plateau area though!!
