I was in the area and wanted a good gyro for once in Charlotte.  This was the place for it.  The tea was good too.  I had the knafeh dessert for the first time.  It was light tasting but something about makes me want it again.  It was pretty too with orange coloring.  The waiter I had was attentive.  Next time I'll try a national dish like that shawarma as he suggested but I was sort of time for a big meal.  I have better faith that the shawarma may be good here than another place I tried days later.
