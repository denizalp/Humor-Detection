Have a tradeshow in Phoenix? Then stay here or the Sheraton down the street but this place is closer. \n\nIf you're in Pheonix for ANY other reason than a tradeshow, then stay elsewhere, like a hotel in Scottsdale. The thing is, its located in an area that doesn't have much going on, unless you're going to see a baseball or basketball game. No decent shopping, activities, restaurants, grocery stores, spa... you get the picture. \n\nThe hotel recently went through major renovation in 2008 and its nice, clean, modern, friendly service, gym, small pool and again, its right across the street from the convention center. Other than that, there are five restaurants\/bars outside of the hotel that you can walk to. The gym might be the best part, the machines are new, the hotel provides workout towels, ice cold hand towels, water, headphones and each machine has its own built in tv.    \n\nIf you reserve a business package then you're staying on the 7th floor. Internet is $13 per day. Each room has a plasma, hair dryer, no fridge, no mini bar, there is a lock box and iron. \n\nThere hotel itself has a gift store, rotating restaurant on the top floor, sports bar downstairs and a bagel shop. Overall a decent place to stay, but I have no desire to voluntarily visit Phoenix again.
