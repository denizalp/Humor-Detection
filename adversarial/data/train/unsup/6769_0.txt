Customer service at its finest! This company gets an A + in my book. This morning, our garage door decided to completely break, leaving me stranded with a car in the garage and no way of getting it out. I called our warranty company who commissioned Advanced Garage Door Service. I called them directly after speaking with my warranty company and told them about the urgency. This was at about 11:30 and they were to our house by 2:00 the same day. I have never experienced such a quick turnaround! It was such a refreshing experience! They showed up and within a half an hour, had fixed the garage door and had it back to mint condition. It was seamless. I will recommend this company to anyone down the road who needs a garage door company. Thanks for saving us!
