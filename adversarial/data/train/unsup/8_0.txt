MoRoCo is a chocolate salon like none other. First, the entire staff looks as if they just participated in a walk-off on the set of Zoolander that ended in a TIE. Not only is the staff beautiful to look at, the decor is luxurious and chic. And if this gorgeous visual arsenal isn't enough, the sweets are FANTABULOUS. \n\nThis place was the last stop on Rita E's Great Macaron Crawl of 2010, and saving the fanciest place for last was definitely appropriate. Rita, Jon K and I each ordered two macarons; Rita and I had a little booze to accompany our sweets. I chose a mocha and a vanilla macaron, and they were both good. I like the size of the macarons here; they're about three times the size of your typical macaron. Since you get more than a couple bites, the pleasure of eating one isn't as fleeting as it normally is; however, the macaron isn't so large that you get sick of eating it by the time you're done. I especially enjoyed the vanilla, which was nicely creamy and bursting with true vanilla flavor. \n\nFor my libation, I chose a Frozen Chocolate Martini in Chocolate Rush, which was made from Valhrona chocolate, Bailey's, amaretto and cream. It tasted like a slightly boozy, melted chocolate milkshake. Absolutely delicious and perfect for such a warm day. I could have had about four of them, but at $16 a drink (!), it's probably not a good move. :)\n\nService from the gorgeous fem- and man-bots was just okay; we had to flag down our servers to get our water refilled, and the water wasn't really cold. (Normally, I'm not the type to complain about water but when you're eating super-sweet things, the water shouldn't be in short supply!). \n\nWhat a great place for dessert. The prices may make you want to barf into your (faux) Hermes Birkin bag, but the sheer deliciosity and fabulous atmosphere makes MoRoCo a worthwhile visit.
