A bit dear for this poor yelper, Teatro Verde is a repository for all tastes Lucullan. Need a Chinoiserie vase? It's only $750. Or you could pick up the latest issue of Visionaire for only $468. Yes it's expensive but still a worthwhile inclusion in your gifting safari.\n\nThis two-storey store is the former Mount Sinai hospital. It originally cost $12,000 to build in 1922, but today you could flit through that on a couple of Swarovski bookends ($2,900) and an antique spoon chandelier ($4,900). OK, OK, I'll stop. It's a beautiful space and filled with all kinds of giftables ranging from home d√©cor, beauty, books, art, and their specialty, elegant bouquets and flowers. \n\nNot everything here is priced to murder your wallet. You can find some nifty finds around the $50 mark, and you'll never tire or looking at their amazing selections. This is the place to shop for someone who has everything. \n\nObligatory Title Pun: Better bring the GREEN.\n\nMenu Readability: I usually don't like mixed case type -- particularly when small caps are involved -- and their wordmark is no exception. \n\nNeed to mention: No refunds or exchanges.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I am the 99%.
