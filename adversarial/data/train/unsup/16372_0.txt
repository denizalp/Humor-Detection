Circus Circus is an aging, dying casino... we all already know that.\nHowever, this past weekend, I got to experience some next level Circus Circus... it's called the \"Manors\".\n\nWhat a dump!!\n\nIt's a 20 minute walk from the front of the hotel through scorching hot parking lots.\n\nThe rooms smell like cigarette and weed, you have to unplug everything to free up a couple outlets for phone and laptop, the non-flat screen TV has 8 channels. There's no food anywhere nearby.\n\nThe \"Manors\" at Circus Circus are absolutely terrible and they charged us almost $160\/night when their normal pricing is $20-$30.\n\nCircus Circus was already low on my list since all it is a playpen for unsupervised children and the fact that it's super FAR from everything that's worthwhile in Vegas. But having stayed at the Manor is a new low in my Vegas experiences.\nWill never stay again, no matter how low the pricing is.\n\nAlso, the WIFI is garbage.
