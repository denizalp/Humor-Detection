The server Amanda was what was lacking here.  The food was a little pricey and tasted fine but the server,  she was rude and slow and made our entire table feel unwelcome. \n We came on a Tuesday night when they were not particularly busy.  It seemed there was only one server for about 8 or more tables. We waited awhile until Amanda came to our table.  She seemed highly annoyed and was really short with us.  We felt like we were bothering her.  Two pizzas and two appetizers took 30 mins to appear and someone in a suit brought it to the table.  There was a nice bus boy that refilled our water and was doing all the busy work for Amanda.  I work in the foods industry as did everyone at my table.  We could tell Amanda had a lot of tables but we watched her make this poor bus boy do all the heavy lifting while she just kind of drifted around the dining room.   When one of my group asked her for a to go box, we got  more attitude.  Amanda was annoying,  inattentive and lazy. When I come back I hope she's not there.  The service really overshadowed the food this time.
