This is the giant orange in the middle of a busy street.  Never tried any food here, but have had their delicious and unique orange julep many times.  Very refreshing, very unique, very yummy!  Imagine a thick orange juice that is somehow extra sweet and almost creamy in texture.  I have yet to taste anything like it.  Still not sure what their secret ingredient is.  \n\nA little pricey for just a bit of juice, but you pay a premium for a unique product.  If you haven't met your vitamin C quota for the day, grab a drink here.
