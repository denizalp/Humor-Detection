We recently worked with the BREL team (Mel and Brendan specifically) to sell our Leslieville Townhouse. We were very impressed with the marketing materials, staging, and candid advice from Mel and Brendan. We consider ourselves challenging to work with at times, and we wanted to make a significant profit on this sale. Mel and Brendan were incredible as they coached us to hold on for our desired price, through several discouraging occurrences, and a longer than expected time on the market. In the end, a client within their close network of realtors purchased the home, and I'm confident it wouldn't have worked out this well without them. The BREL team made all the difference selling our home, and I would strongly recommend working with them.
