Tasty classic meatballs, and...\n\n5-stars for the Chicago Cracker Thin pizza. This is the ONLY pizza to get here IMO! I've had it twice now over the course of 3 separate visits. \n\nGetting the Chicago Cracker Thin 'Old Chicago' style means it comes with: tomato sauce, mozzarella, provolone, garlic, Italian fennel sausage, sliced meatballs, ricotta, romano and oregano. Perfect! The cracker-thin crust is spot-on and just like my favorite hole-in-the-wall pizza joint near Midway Airport in Chicago. It comes out perfectly toasty and savory, and cut into squares as it should be. You will not feel stuffed, just satisfied.\n\nIf you're up in the air as to which style pizza to get because there are so many to choose from, you GOTTA pick the Chicago Cracker Thin pizza. Walking through the restaurant on the way to the men's restroom and back, I wish everyone had a Chicago Cracker Thin pizza on their pizza racks instead of the more traditional pies they chose. From the looks of it, the average person likes bready pizza with pepperoni on it. Or at least that's what they think they like.\n\nChicago Cracker Thin. The only way I rock Pizza Rock.
