I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet! How is that possible, this is one of my SPOTS! Its possibly the best place to get tacos in las vegas. Ask anyone! I've probably go 2-3 times a month to this place simply because its the best. No one ever says no to el gordo... it will thwart any good dieting intentions, melt away your convictions but leaving you with no regret. just sweet satisfaction\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're new to Mexican food you're going to love it here...I am from Canada and had no IDEA what real mexican food was like. Definitely not a lot of authentic places at that latitude. But I instantly loved this place, and you will too! I recommend you try the The tacos adobada  or adobada fries... with everything on it... but MAKE SURE you ask for them to put PINEAPPLE on it. seriously its a game changer and if you don't ask for it specifically you wont get it.  If you get the fries, you may want to share it with someone.. even the 1\/2 size order at $5 is crazy huge and shareable. \n\nAlso for something different to drink, try the orange whip fountain drink. Its a very rare drink to find in restaurants, so take advantage of it at El Gordo... it tastes like a creamsicle!
