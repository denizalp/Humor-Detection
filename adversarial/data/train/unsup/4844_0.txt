Lost a screw on my Spy sunglasses nearly a year ago and I just recently decided to get them fixed. The service and timely manner was worth the $5 for a new screw! The gentleman who helped me was very nice and attentive. He let me know what I was paying for, put in the new screw, and he had me out the door in a few minutes!
