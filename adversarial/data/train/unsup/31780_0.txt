the only problem i have with this gym is that the cardio equipment and weight machines are starting to break down more frequently. when a particular weight machine is out of order, it takes two months to get it fixed.and the recumbant bikes and precor elipticals are making abnormal grinding and popping sounds. they need to have scheduled maintenance on these cardio machines but they don't. other than that problem, i love going to my gym every day.
