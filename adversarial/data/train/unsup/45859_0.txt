The service was not great and the food was great to fair, depending on the item. I had the soup dumplings, which were delicious. I ordered bok choy, and they brought me steamed veggies. I had to send it back, but when I got it, the bok choy was delish. My friend ordered shrimp and scallops, and the sauce was so overwhelmingly thick and sweet, it brought the quality of the dish down. My entree order was messed up twice. I asked if they could give me the green chicken curry spaghetti with fried shanghai noodles instead of spaghetti, and the waitress happily said, \"Sure!\". I received the order with spaghetti. I flagged her down and reminded her that I asked for the fried shanghai noodles, and she suddenly seemed confused. She then went to her manager, and she came over and asked me what was wrong with the noodles. I explained that it was not what I asked for, and told her that I asked if I could have the green chicken curry with the shanghai noodles. She looked pissed, and took the food away. About 10 minutes later out came the dish with fettuccine noodles rather than spaghetti. Rather than send the food back again, I just ate the chicken and veggies, leaving the bowl of noodles. The waitress nor the manager came back to ask if everything was ok with the second entree. Also, they don't take Amex. Ridiculous for a restaurant in the middle of a major downtown city.
