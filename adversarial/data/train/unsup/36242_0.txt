A nice selection of beer on tap and in bottle, few wines. The food was good and our server had some good insight into the menu. Only a few local breweries on tap and a bummer is there is only one dessert on the menu.\n\nA lot of televisions to watch sports and it was a bit empty on a Saturday evening.\n\nOverall a nice place to grab a beer and some good food.
