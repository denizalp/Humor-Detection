Yes, I'm admitting it, I'm a cliche. \n\nI had a date to meet my guy at the Grand Lux. I didn't think I'd need to specify which one, although I did (which he denies). Haha. As you can imagine, the obvious error occurred. I was sitting outside the Grand Lux at Venetian (with no cell service, go figure) and I couldn't locate him. After 30 minutes I was finally able to locate a spot on the casino floor where I could get service. I called my man and tried to describe where I was in relation to him as he said he had been sitting inside the restaurant all this time. This being his first time inside either the Venetian or the Palazzo, was easier said than done. I finally convinced him to head to the other Grand Lux, which is where I thought I was. 10 minutes later, still no sign of him. Seriously? I was getting agitated. I finally got service again and was able to contact him. He described where he was and I was able to ascertain that he was actually at the Grand Lux opposite from me. Ooops, we were both at the same location from the beginning. I'll own it, that was my mistake. How he walked passed me without me noticing him on his way to the other Grand Lux, I'll never understand. As there are two locations at adjoining casinos, I have to hope that I'm not the only one this has happened to, or are we just that dumb? \n\nFinally, we're seated and ready to eat. I've been here a number of times before. Usually for some late night grub. The food isn't spectacular. I had a very regular omelette with no bells or whistles and my guy had a very regular sandwich. The food is standard cafe fair. I like the food ok, it's just nothing amazing. If I'm in the area, I'd probably prefer to go to First Food & Bar for their amazing strip views and fun bar foods, but this is a good alternative as well. There are lots of desserts, so check those out as well.
