First of, the interior and the ambiance is quite cool. The server was very nice and accommodating considering she's manning all the tables alone! We ordered the elotes a la parilla (grilled corn cobs), choriqueso (cheese dip with mexican sausage) for starters. The corn is sweet and tastes okay although the portion is quite small (they cut a whole corn in three) for the price ($9.75). I liked the choriqueso although my friend didn't enjoy it as much. For the main dish, I ordered chicken burrito and my friend got the chilaquiles con pollo. Both dishes are okay, taste wise. Although I would've preferred more flavour, sauce and filling with my burrito. All in all, a pleasant Mexican experience but is not included in my favorites.
