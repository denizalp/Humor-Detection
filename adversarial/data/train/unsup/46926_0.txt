I have been to their other restaurant on the east side many times and I love it but it was a bit far from where I live.  I was so excited to hear they just opened a new location in the west side right in the walmart plaza on Ft. Apache.  Had to try to see if its just as good and it was the same amazing taste.  Their pizza's are the best in town.
