I have seen this place so many times, and I always wondered about it as I love a good chicken souvlaki but I never decided to drop in as it's always during the day  when I drive by.. \n\nWhen I decided to try it I discovered they have werid hours! They are only open during the day... werid, huh? But they do very good business.\n\nSo I tried it for lunch one day and I have been hooked on it ever since, the chicken is always good, never overcooked and the rice is so delicious! \n\nWhen I'm in the area I always try to stop in for some chicken soulvaki!
