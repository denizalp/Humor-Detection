I usually recommend this restaurant to all of my friends and family because the food is always exceptional however, I'm disappointed to say that I can no longer recommend this place. The food is still good and I've never had a problem with my waiters but the hostesses.... holy moly. There is a major attitude among them and a serious lack of communication and as a consequence of this, the wait time for myself and my family went from \"10-15 minutes\" to almost 45 minutes today. I'm surprised we even stayed. The hostess would point to a table that was being cleaned and we would be next to sit. Our table was given away, this happened twice. Then one hostess said there was a table available but it was unlikely that a highchair for my baby would fit.... well obviously that doesn't work. This sort of instance has happened too many times and I'm sad to say that it's unlikely we will be back to this location.
