Way too much soda in the food. We went in for a buffet on a Sunday. Naan's texture was good, mango lassi wasn't that great. After 2 pieces of naan, my stomach was full. The dishes were decent, nothing I would write home about.\nPost meal all of felt so uncomfortable. Plus the food was so expensive. Must have just gone to the well trusted Gandhi.\nAnother restaurant to the no go list.
