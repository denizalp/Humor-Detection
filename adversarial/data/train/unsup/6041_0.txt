I wish I could rate with negative stars, I took my girlfriend to this location so she could get help with her chronic bronchitis. She has been suffering, hacking up thick brown mucus and can barely breath for over a year. We have been to many doctors and been given many different antibiotics  and medications that did not help. She has had xrays and still no help. So we try a new doctor, you would think you could be honest with your doctor, she has been in the past, but you cant with this one.  She has been prescribed many different anxiety medications for her bipolar disorder, Dr.Chiesa saw these meds on her sheet and assumes she she is just a druggie. All in all she ended up with a worthless work excuse and a prescription for asthma meds we already have. I would highly recommend going somewhere other than ppcp bridgeville location if you are sick.
