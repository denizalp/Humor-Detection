Oh my goodness. I love this place so much. One of the best late-night eats you can find. And when I say \"late,\" I mean, they are open until 4am on weekends.\n\nThe shawarma, oh the shawarma ... I am craving it right now thanks to having to write this stupid review. But luckily for you lot, I am willing to suffer through the pangs of hunger to tell you about the glory of this place.\n\nI recommend the Mix (chicken & beef ... $10.50), with everything. Ah-bup-bup-bup! ... no, don't skip that topping! ... I said, \"EVERYTHING.\"\n\nWhen you let them make your shawarma with no holds barred, the layers of flavour you will experience from that delicious wrap will envelop your tastebuds like a tasteable symphony. Savoury and spicy, sweet and sour, hot and cold, soft and cruchy ... IT IS SO GOOD.\n\nPortion is good, menu is simple, place is clean, staff are super nice ... STOP READING AND START EATING.
