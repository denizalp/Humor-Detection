I just paid $35 for the worst pedicure ever.  Avoid this place at all costs. \n\nMy tech spoke no English at all so she just ignored whatever I asked for. Then she cut me so badly that I bled for half an hour. No one apologized she just giggled and kept doing her thing. Since she spoke no English I couldn't get her to put pressure on it, she just kept dabbing it with alcohol which just made it bleed more. I had brought my own new bottle of quite expensive nail polish and she poured a bunch of nail polish remover into it. I have no idea why she did this but it is no good now because it is so thin. I was just looking at my toes and there is polish all over the skin and cuticles and the color is all washed out because she thinned it down and only did 2 coats. \n\nSummary: 1) ignored my requests 2) no English at all 3) ruined my own bottle of expensive polish 4) did a terrible job, leaving polish all over my cuticles and virtually no polish on my nails 5) cut me so badly that I bled for half an hour and have a big ugly blood clot on the side of one toe and 6) no one apologized for any of this until I told them off on the way out the door\n\nOne other customer told me that I should be used to being cut if I get pedicures. \"You have to live with the blood to look pretty\" so I guess this sort of thing is par for the course at this substandard salon.
