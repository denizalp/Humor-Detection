This little gem is just off Rue de la Gauchatierre in downtown Montreal. It's the only restaurant in that strip that's open at night, and was recommended by a client. The entire staff is Japanese, and you might wonder why that matters, but only until you've been to a different sushi joint where the guy behind the sushi bar was a tall redheaded farmboy and the sushi was just what you'd expect from that kind of a guy (ran into this in Kentucky, not a hotbed of sushi).\n\nThe manager himself made me up some sangria (not a normal staple in a sushi joint), and it was fantastic. Yeah, it's hard to screw up, but this was good. Their miso soup was good. Hard to screw that up too. I ordered the Duo, which is a mixed bag of maki and nigiri put together by the chef. When it was brought out, the manager explained to me what all I was eating. He pointed out the one kind of sauce you use for the maki, and the other for the sushi. There was one item he said to eat without any sauce. Wish I'd saved that for last, since it was incredible. \n\nPrice was pretty good, $28 for the Duo, service was good, although it wasn't crowded. Highly recommend. Quick walk from the Marriott Chateau Champlain, which is a great hotel as well.
