This Fantastic Sam's has a sign on the door 'Independently Owned' which in Vegas must be code for Licensed to RIP YOU OFF...my girlfriend wanted a color job...the stylist quoted $49.99...she did the color...had to use extra color even though her hair is fairly short...then after rinsing it out towel and blew it dry...the stylist said there was a $10 charge for the extra dye...$59.99...the Manager\/Owner came over and tried to get the stylist to add other services...right in front of us...she asked if she cut or styled it...she said no just blew it out...the Owner said that constitutes a style so we should take the package price of $80.00...I told her she was not adding $20 for a one minute blow dry...gave her $60 and told her to take it or leave it...very shady business practice...STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE OR GET A QUOTE IN WRITING!
