Visited with a friend due to solid reviews online - we weren't disappointed! I had drip coffee, she had a latte; both were wonderful. \n\nI had a beautifully flaky chocolate croissant with mine; I'd recommend it but would love to try some of the sandwiches next time. \n\nMy favourite thing though, by far, was the atmosphere. Super friendly baristas, quick, friendly service, and vintage decor with exposed brick walls. I'd definitely recommend it to friends.
