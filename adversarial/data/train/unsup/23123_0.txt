This review is strictly for the longyards.\n\nOur group purchased the Groupon deal for $13 for a longyad.\nWe got a 40 oz. beer bottle-shaped longyard.\nBefore we purchased the drinks to put in our longyards we got to sample all the drinks they had to offer. My two favorite was the Strawberry & Happy Ending which was like a sweet tea lemonade. But we decided to just have strawberry which was pretty yummy. \n\nI will say that their claim of there being 4 & a half shots in each yard is BS. We bought an extra shot just incase & good thing we did cause that thing didn't have any kick at all.. oi.. I shared with one other person & didn't even feel a slight buzz. LAME! Needless to say we didn't get a refill because it just made us bloated with liquid & no buzz. =[ \n\nPLUS! The beer bottle yard can be used as a piggy bank too! [=\n\nOh! If you \"like\" their fb page you get a FREE order of sweet potato fries, I think hm?
