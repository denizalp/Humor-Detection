I would rather run around the I-10 blind-folded and naked in the summer than deal with these clowns again. Run away! 'Nuff said. \n\nI had a flat tired and called up my insurance company and they said it would be an hour. Great no problem.\n\nI called Quik Pik an hour and 30 mins checking to see the status, Dispatcher said they had an emergency( some wonderful little rugrat was locked in a car). Once again, No problem. She said it wwould be 25-35 minutes. The driver called me 45 mins later and said it would would 45 \n\nProblem. Big Problem.\n\nI said excuse me?!\n\nHe then goes just keeps saying sorry sorry. Another 30 mins later and the driver calls. \" Im in the Johnny Rockets parking lot\"\n\nThat would be wonderful if I lived near one, but I dont. He want to Tempe, I live in central Phoenix. Blamed it on the GPS.\n\nI was livid. He then said he was going to get to my location right away. Must have some magic potion, because he clearly doesn't know where I'm at. I asked him to tell me my cross streets. \n\nGuess what?\n\nWrong again. I give him turn by turn directions and hung up then called the dispatch again. Asking for another driver. \n\nThey said he was the closest. WTF. You dont have a driver in the phoenix area. I told her she better pull someone else from another call and get them to my place asap! 25 mins later another driver said he was 10 mins away. NICE! making progress. He rolls up in 10 mins and I don't know what mechanic school he went to but these fool first put the jack on my car in the wrong spot. I told him there are indents for jacks and got on the hot asphalt and showed him. Why did captain magoo still place it in the wrong spot. Guess what happes when you put pressure on plastic! Bend! Opps. I again show tell him where to put it. After 4 times of his jack coming off the ground and me moving my car he finally gets it right. Oh he whips out his phone while he is jacking, yeah thats safe!\n\nIf your insurance uses these clowns, tell them to call someone else
