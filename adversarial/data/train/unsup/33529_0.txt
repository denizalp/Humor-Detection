Came here on 'Ladies Night' not realizing it was and they had a 45 min wait for a table. It was cold and we didn't fancy prowling the streets of Willoughby looking for food so we propped ourselves at the bar, ordered a cocktail and a pizza for a starter. \n\nThe pizzas aren't huge, but they come on a thick base. The pepperoni & italian sausage pizza was excellent (once we let it cool). When we were done, we didn't need a main (or a table) so stayed at the bar and ordered another cocktail and rather average cheese plate instead.  I'll need to go back to try the interesting looking entrees another time.\n\nThe food isn't bad, the ambiance is great, but it can get rowdy, but the best thing here are the martinis. Don't visit without trying them.\n\nWill definitely go back.
