So....I'm shocked that this place has no reviews! \nI lived in these apartments from 2011-2012.  \n\n**THE GOOD** \n-Maintenance requests were always handled in a timely manner\n-They gave back almost all of my deposit when I moved out\n-Gated area, conveniently located at Green Valley & Sunset \n-Quiet neighbors (when I moved in)\n-Plenty of sidewalks and grass to walk my dog. \n\n**THE BAD**\n-Pervy office worker named Jay\n-The dang noise from the planes going over every two minutes.  It rattled the windows!\n--I paid $650.00 a month for a one bedroom apartment and they charged $25.00 a month for my dog. Why should I pay an extra fee per month when I've already given you a pet deposit??? \n-Got new upstairs neighbors towards the end of my stay and I'm pretty sure they had pet buffaloes or installed a bowling alley.  And they liked to smoke pot on their porch.I never complained about them cuz hey, I ain't no snitch.   \n\n**THE UGLY***\n-Once I was walking my dog at night and a completely naked African American man began to chase me.  Didn't feel so safe after that so I moved. \n-Huge cockroaches!!!  Like the size of your thumb!!  \n-Here's the coup d'Ã© tat...there are two pools in the complex.  The pool directly behind my apartment was broken for months with no signage so people were still swimming in it.  I got a staph infection and treated it with antibiotics only to get another staph infection a month later from this pool.  I hope they got that fixed or at least shut it down.  I feel sorry for other people who may have gotten infected.
