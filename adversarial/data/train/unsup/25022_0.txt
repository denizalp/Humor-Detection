I was looking for a good Chinese restaurant near my house and saw that this place had great reviews on Yelp.  My husband and I decided to stop here for dinner tonight and I'm so glad we did.  What a little gem this place is!  Its a small restaurant in a strip mall, but the food more than compensated for the ambiance.  We tried their General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef and garlic Szechuan green beans.  The spicy chicken was so tender, and had a nice light batter on it.  The beef was even more tender, if that's even possible.  We loved the green beans too, and enjoyed the sauce which was a nice combination of spice and sweet garlic.  We got there before 6pm and the tables filled up pretty quickly after we got there.  They do an amazing job on takeout orders too, as I noticed there was a steady stream of people heading out the door with their bagged up food.  I'll definitely be back, and see some takeout food in my future too!
