Came there for a take out... Ordered a sandwich, two lattes and a slice of cake. The cashier asked whether I wanted everything together and I said yes. Two minutes later my lattes arrive, the first cup is 50% and the other 80% full. For the sandwich they tell me to wait for 15 minutes. 7-10 minutes later they bring the ugly plastic bag with my order. I take it to my room and realize they never put the cake in there. The total for all of this was slightly over $30. Very very disappointing experience
