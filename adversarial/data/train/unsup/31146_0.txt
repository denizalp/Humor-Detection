Awesome! Really good quality food and tea, which I love, but what makes this place stand out so much is how lovely all the people who work here are, when I am on queen and need a tea, I will always go here over any other coffee shop in the area because the people are always so sweet. They go above and beyond in friendliness and making you feel wanted here, love it so much, thanks guys :)
