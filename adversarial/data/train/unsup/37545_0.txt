I went to Chili's today for an early Mother's Day dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the promptness of the service.  They have a great menu; however, we haven't been to this one in Las Vegas but used to go back home.  The food was pretty good and but the service was on point.  Our server was very attentive.  I enjoy this location.
