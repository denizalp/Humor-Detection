Out of the 4 \"Asian-$20\" foot spa places I've tried in Vegas, this has got to be one of the best so far. Although the atmosphere is \"interesting\" (hello hella LED trees all over the place), you get the most bang for your buck. \n\nWent there on a weekend about 2pm, and it was busy, but we only waited for about 5 mins to get served and I thought we'd be placed in the huge general room area, but instead we got a private room in the back which was cool. As all of these places, they start with a foot soak and head massage. Because I let them know I\"m pregnant, they did not recline me all the way down but kept me at a 45 degree angle and only worked on my shoulders\/back in a sitting position, versus them having you lay flat on your stomach. Here's what I liked best:\n\nPros:\n-Cheap, $20 massage and was a really, really good massage. They massaged the whole time. Did not get up and walk away etc. (I've had that done to me in other places)\n-Hot stones! Yup, so far, this is the only place I've been to in vegas that busted out hot stones for your back (my dad got it, I couldn't tho because I'm pregnant)\n-Quiet technicians and atmosphere. THey were not talking to each other and soothing music was playing throughout the place. Even the workers walking by kept conversation to a minimum. \n-Free parking. open lot\n\nCons:\n-Well, call it a pregnant woman's bloodhound nose but ventilation was not that great as I could smell all the workers lunch. lol. So I'm skewed on that one. \n-A little further down on Spring Mountain from the Freeway but eh, not too bad. \n-It's not really a con, but the ambiance is so weird to me! I do like the LED light trees but it's just....funny. lol. \n-They pretty much tell you how much to tip. Now my pops and I got EXCELLENT massages so I gave them a good tip, but it'd suck if we didn't.
