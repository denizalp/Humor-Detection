800 Degrees has a very special place in my heart because I frequented its other location in LA so often (probably 4-5 times a month I wish I was kidding) being that it was in my alma mater's neighborhood (UCLA\/Westwood - GO BRUINS). This is comfort food. It brings back college nostalgia. Also it's really high quality pizza. It's almost like a fast food joint, but it's too fancy to be one? \n\n800 Degrees is not like the other make-your-own customizable pizza places like Blaze or Mod or Pieology, because I think the toppings and bases are a lot more gourmet. I don't think this place is comparable because the quality is higher!\n\nI always get the margherita base, so I did the same for this location. On top, I added butternut squash, mushrooms (there are literally 5 types of mushrooms in their blend like are you kidding me), pine nuts, soppressata, broccolini, corn, and arugula. Yes - my pizza is aggressive, but it's so good. After you customize your pizza, it is wood fired for a short time and your food is ready. \n\n**Note: You can have your pizza cooked a little longer to make it crispy because the toppings tend to slide off pretty easily since the pie is very thin. I always eat my pizza with a fork and knife to get all the toppings in one bite. \n\nOther bases are marinara, verde (pine nut pesto), and bianca (white with no sauce). There are a ton of meats to put on top of your pizza, and the cheese selection is also great - I have added fontina on top of my pizza before. \n\nAlso, I can eat an entire pizza by myself in one sitting, but I am pretty stuffed by the end and thinking of names for my food baby, so be warned that you will be very full.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this location 4 stars instead of 5 like the LA locations is because Vegas is a little more expensive. Makes sense given the tourist location, but still sad.
