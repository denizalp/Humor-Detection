OMG! you need to go here every time you are in vegas. it's definitely going to be our go to for brunch when we are in vegas.\n\nthe bourbon maple sauce goes amazing with the chicken and waffles. the honey hot sauce brings out the flavors of the fried chicken. fiancée's cousins took us here for our last vegas trip and it did not disappoint. \n\nyou could not go wrong with any beverage on the brunch drink selection. i opted for the classic mimosa and fiancée opted for the blueberry bourbon. bloody mary's can be a hit or miss sometimes. it had just the right amount of tomato juice. \n\nthe butter lettuce salad was melting in your mouth. it was so light and with the grilled watermelon, i wanted to eat the whole thing but we were sharing. \n\nso glad they are opening up a location at the beverly center!
