I'm sorry 2 report that I cannot recommend this outfit 4 ur pool care needs. Things 'appeared' good @ 1st but it wasn't long b4 I discovered just how little was actually being tended 2 4 $100 a month. I was away from home @ work 4 most of his so~called visits (if 1\/2 of them even happened). Many reviews here r a good indic8ion what not 2 expect w\/ this service ~ the 1 posted from RaNetta H. from Gilbert sums it up very accur8ly. Here's mine...\n\n   Fairy dance around the pool any1? Seriously, this is the best description I can give 4 what I saw looking out the window 2 my backyard. Obviously the guy figured I wasn't home since my car wasn't parked out front (was in my enclosed garage) & then he knocked on the front door & rang the door bell (probably 2 ensure if I was home or not) which I didn't answer. He then proceeded 2 haphazardly sprinkle a little of what I assume was chlorine over my pool doing his best imit8ion of Tinkerbell who then turned in2 Flash & was gone. \n\n   Really?? That's what my $100 a month gets me? I stopped paying as of that moment & then they tried billing me a last time which I just sh*t~canned ignored the 'invoices' when they attempted 2 collect by sending these notices about 5 months. \n\n   They might've also been trying 2 collect in person as I wasn't home a lot back then & didn't have my home surveillance yet, but it's probably a good thing 4 him I wasn't as I woulda given a earful why I don't owe\/wouldn't b paying anything more & they're quite lucky 2 have gotten what they had 1\/2 yr b4 I discovered what I woulda been better off taking my chances doing myself. The only reason I'm giving 2 instead of 1 star is 4 the other Xs I can't account 4 but @ least didn't come home 2 a green pool, so spend ur hard~earned $ 4 peace of mind w\/ those who actually earn\/deserve it, not shady character con~artist posers w\/ their hand out 4 doing virtually nothing!!!....
