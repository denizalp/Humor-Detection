Came here with my boyfriend when we visited Montreal and it was awesome. Food was so delicious and service was great. Seriously no complaints. We got the garlic cheese bread and Caesar salad as a starter and I then got the steak and Cajun shrimp with the garlic mashed potatoes (seriously amazing) and my boyfriend got the 10oz filet with the same side. Everything was seriously delicious and the portions were great. Prices were normal for a steakhouse. Great location, great service, and great good. Will 100% come again!
