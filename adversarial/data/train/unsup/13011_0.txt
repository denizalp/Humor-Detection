It is what it is. \n\nFor tourists who aren't extreme foodies, it's probably a nice cheap eats spot but it isn't anything remarkable. There's a good variety at least with some 10 or so booths, chains like your typical Subway or Panda express to non chains like a Mediterranean place and a crepe\/boba place. \n\nI'm kinda concerned with only one thing when I head to malls- shop and get the hell out! (eat elsewhere) Sometimes a gal needs some snack fuel and I appreciate there's a Hot Dog on a Stick. I love me some lemonade and a pepper jack cheese on a stick! \n\nIt's just A-OK since nothing particularly is interesting to me but Hot Dog on a Stick and the Crepes.
