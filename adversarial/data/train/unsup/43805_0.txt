I have been coming to this place for almost 40 years. Every few months I must have some of those ribs.  Tonight was the night.\nThe ribs were as usual, the waitress I has never served me before or remember ever seeing her.\nIn addition to the ribs I ordered a lb. of wings.\nAs soon as I tried them I noticed that they did not taste as they should have tasted.  They tasted \"fishy\", I told the waitress about the unusual taste but she was INDIFFERENT to my complaint. our small group were all of the same opinion but we covered the fishy smell with plenty of sauce.\nAgain I asked if fish had been fried in that oil and again the waitress paid no attention to our comments. My belief is that a waiter or waitress with that kind of attitude should not be in the service industry. I paid, gave her the proper tip and left. In future, if she is appointed as our waitress I will politely ask for a different server.
