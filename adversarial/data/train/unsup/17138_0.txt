The building occupies a chunk of real estate and for the longest time I thought this was the flagship restaurant.  I was so wrong, cause the actual shop space is miniscule. You got an edge counter for 5 and no stools to sit?!    what's all that space for? potatoes?\n\nAnyways, I ordered reg sized veggie deluxe poutine. It came dressed with caramelized onions, mushrooms, peas, cheese curds and smothered in veggie gravy.. I liked it,  pretty good tasting combination and not overkill in the salt department.
