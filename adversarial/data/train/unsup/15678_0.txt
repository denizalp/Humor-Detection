Hmmm...the overall rating for Crispy Town is only 2.5?  Good thing I didn't let that deter me.  I had a great experience.  \n\nHubs & I drive all the way from the West side in search of fried pork skin & fried chicken skin to go with our weekly dose of papaya salad.  Crispy Town had both...yay!\n\nThe friendly counter lady allowed us to sample everything in the warming trays.  Everything was indeed crispy...but a bit salty for me.  Hubs loved it all though.  So we bought a little bit of everything & A LOT of the fried chicken skin.  That was the clear winner :) \n\nEven after a week, the chicken skin remained crispy.  To freshen it up a bit, we'd throw a batch into the toaster oven for about 5 minutes on \"light toast\" right before service...yum! \n\nGlad I gave this place a try.  Will definitely go back for all things crispy.
