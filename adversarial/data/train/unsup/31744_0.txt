Their pies are so SO good! After my first trip, I was back within a week!\nI tried the braised beef and the pulled pork pie, with my favourite being the latter. Both times I got thick cut fries on the side which did not disappoint. The most impressive was the speed of my order - I didn't even have enough time to sit down and check in! I love that this location has seating for dining in compared to the Queensway location, but I think the prices may be a bit higher as a result (~$0.50-$1).
