Did a quick check on this new place owned by the guy next door. They have good happy hour prices on domestic drafts as I have been seeking the elusive $2 happy Hour draft. There are other discounts on craft beers also, but only four specials on food for HH and the back patio  only has tables and nowhere to mingle to just enjoy the weather. The big smoker also takes up a good chunk of the patio. The rest of the interior looks like they spent no money as it is basically the same look as the last tenant. Not a fan of this sort of BBQ (and frankly this style is not something that needs to leave CA), but the good HH should get me back a few times. Taco Haus failed in North Scottsdale, but if you have money to throw around, you try again.
