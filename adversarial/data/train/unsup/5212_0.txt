We were passing through Boulder City and decided to eat at a Triple D joint but it was closed.  Our closest option was Milo's.  We were a party of 7. Service was great. They immediately accommodated us. All food was fresh and everyone enjoyed their meal. The wait staff was very informative and attentive.  If you are in Boulder City it is a good choice to eat at Milo's.
