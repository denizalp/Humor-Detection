Oooooooooooooh wow!!!!! Yum Yum YUMMY!!!\n\nI had the Bocca di Rosa from the peccati di gola menu (direct translation: rose mouth from the gluttony menu, but actually it was the eggplant parmesan on a baguette with a side salad) and it was like a delightful, light, flavorful party in my mouth. The baguette is perfection and tasted just like my favorite french bread from down home in Louisiana (I know that isn't exactly italian but I don't give a damn, this was quite possibly THE BEST bread I've had since I moved to Arizona).\n\nI'm not really sure why the other reviewers were taking the eggplant peel out of the sandwich, you're supposed to eat the peel, but whatever, to each their own. The (tender) peel and the insides of the eggplant were deliciously prepared, tender,     thin(ish), soft, and to quote Cara S. 'melt in your mouth' fantastic. It was quite possibly sauteed, I don't know I'm not a chef, but I know when something tastes good. All I know about it is that the eggplant was not fried and coated beyond recognition.   If that's the kind of eggplant you are looking for, why bother with eggplant? Why not just deep fry a dishrag and put it between a couple of slabs of Wonderbread you neanderthals? But I digress...Did I mention how tender the eggplant was, because I meant to mention that. My biggest eggplant pet peeve is undercooked veggies. There was NONE of that problem here. \n\nMy coworker had the Ciao from the peccati di gola menu (direct translation: HELLO! from the glutton menu...or Goodbye, or whatever you want it to mean...but it actually was flavorful thinly sliced beef, provolone cheese, sauteed onions and spicy-ish (to him) peppers and completely heavenly. \n\nAt present time, a sandwich and a side salad is under $10. And you won't regret it, unlike *some other* places in the near vicinity. In fact, I think everything on the current menu is under $10. \n\nAndreoli, you are now in the lunchtime rotation (and dinner if I happen to be up that way).
