Locally Sourced & Homemade = Delish!  This spot is the perfect ice cream spot for this Summer.  They have dairy and non-dairy options, a variety of flavors...something for everyone!  We tried their butterfinger bliss, Dutch chocolate, mint chocolate chip, salted caramel.  All were great but butterfinger bliss won me over.  We will definitely visit this spot more often now that we have discovered it (follow me @foodievida).
