Went here for a linner (lunch\/dinner) and it was great! The shopping plaza Merci is located at is undergoing construction-- and has been for awhile. It's right next to a Subway... You're being fair warned... Just prepare your nose for Subway stench assault before you walk into Merci since it sneakily creeps over to their front entrance.  \n\nThe cafe is \"cutely\" decorated. I love their bright colored placemats. Menu is to die for. There's something for everyone's different taste buds. I got the asparagus, salmon and mozzarella quiche with side salad. It was delicious and just the right size. Their pastries also looked super delicious in the cold case but my tummy was too full. \n\nThey have a square card reader so when you're done eating just head to the front and pay then you're on your way.
