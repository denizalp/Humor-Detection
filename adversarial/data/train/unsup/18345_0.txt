This is the first 5-star review I've given in a long time.  It's hard to live up to the hype, especially that PGH yelpers tend to label everything the \"Best in Pittsburgh.\"  In my experience, that label has been placed on very questionable places.  This place, however, is a homerun.\n\nFor a Sunday brunch, I couldn't be happier.  The much-touted mussels were as great as advertised.  The mussels are in a brilliant and delicious broth, which you just want to drink straight up.  And the bread is a perfect fluff with a crunchy crust to soak up the juices.\n\nThe serving sizes are large -- and for around $10-14 per entree, it's head-scratching how they can make a profit.  You get a LOT of smoked salmon with your eggs benedict, you get a LOT of lamb with your Moroccan eggs, and you get a pizza sized Torte Flambe.\n\nIn addition, the service was excellent.  The food was out quickly, the waitstaff walked the tables offering coffee refills (a welcome change from having to track them down!), and they were friendly and helpful with the menu items.\n\nBased on all the previous reviews, there are several items I'm eager to try next time.  I don't think you can ask for anything more.
