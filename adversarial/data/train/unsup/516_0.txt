I could probably get my elite status revoked for saying this...but it dawned on me that as much as I've eaten here over the years I have never reviewed Valle Luna. Valle Luna is one of those places you just kind of take for granted. Like a sweet guy who maybe isn't exactly your type and is in the friend zone and  is always around until he disappears and then you are like \"Where'd you go?\". My analogy isn't the best,,,but I know what I mean!\n\nSo it always makes me smile when people \"tell\" me about Valle Luna. \"There's this good little Mexican place on Cave Creek\"....\"Oh...Valle Luna?\"....\"Yes!\"\n\nValle Luna is a place where I have had many a happy hour and super casual dinner. I prefer the cantina as I feel the service is slightly better in there...(not that I have had poor service in the restaurant it is just \"happier\" in the cantina.) Like my daughter told me just last night when I pointed out I like the cantina better...She said, \"Yeah...the restaurant is for old people\". I replied with \"Yeah, and we are NOT old\", which is funny because...well...I am actually old and was appreciative that my daughter didn't point that out like she normally does.\n\nI love their seafood taco dinner with cod as well as their steak tacos. I also love that you can substitute calabicitas for the rice\/beans. That gives Valle Luna a star right there. They have a really good Happy Hour menu too.So if someone mentions a Mexican place they want to go to on Cave Creek-by all means check it out!
