I went back here, and it turns out I was wrong. Way wrong. I do not like the way this shop is ran. The high prices are still high. The management is not friendly, nor are they cool. I really missed the mark on that one. Don't waste your time with this place, pick up a cigar down the street and smoke at Remedys right next door to this place...more comfortable and with less aggravation to deal with.
