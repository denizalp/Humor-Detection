I've stayed here 3 years in a row and things are starting to go downhill.  Service is always friendly and prompt and the breakfast is pretty good, but I gave up on getting my tea here though because the hot water at breakfast tasted very strongly of coffee. In one of our rooms the pillows smelled really bad and had to be replaced. In another the mattress sank so much in the middle that we were touching, and everyone's sheets were tucked way too far into the mattress (short sheeting). The worst part was the strong musty odor in the lobby bathroom. They also started charging $15 a night for parking which we didn't know ahead of time.
