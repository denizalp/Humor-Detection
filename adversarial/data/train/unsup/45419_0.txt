I'm here in Toronto on business and was desperate to find a nail place that did gels. One of the places that was highly recommended on yelp Nailsense was my first stop. I called first to ask if the did what I needed. They responded yes. When I arrived. I was informed they didn't provide that service, though could do a pedicure. Which was mediocre at best. There place was sterile and unfriendly. I asked for a recommendation, they referred me to a place down the block that had the worst reviews on yelp.  While getting my toes done in searched on my iPad and stumbled on Dream tips. Barely waiting for my toes to dry. I jumped in the car and headed over.  I walked in no appointment and they were able to take me.  The place was clean, the staff was friendly and they did a great job.  They will be my nail place whenever I come to town!
