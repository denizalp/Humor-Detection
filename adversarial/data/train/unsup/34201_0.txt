I don't even know how to update this review at this point. After the incident, and NO CONTACT from Residential Gourmet I called my credit card company 5 days after the purchase and filed a dispute for the purchase. The credit card company then charged RG back for the amount of the \"sale\" and I did technically get the money back when there was no response from Residential Gourmet.\n\nSo, did I get my money back? Yes, but NOT as a refund or cancellation from Residential Gourmet. I got my money back after I had to go through my credit card company and file a dispute. Would they have given me my money back if I had not done that? I have no idea. No one from the company ever contacted me at all. Terrible. \n\nIf they would have contacted me even ONCE and let me know what was going on, I would have updated this review with a more positive response.
