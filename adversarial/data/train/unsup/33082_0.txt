I visited last weekend with my boyfriend and I must say we had some pretty awesome and attentive service from our server Austin. We shared the Chopped Salad with grilled chicken (modified to be gluten free) and the Ganache Torte. Upon making a joke that the dessert was far too small, Austin surprised us with a second round on the house. Not good for the waistline but we appreciated the gesture and ate that cake as well. Austin ensured our needs were taken care of. I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews, perhaps I popped in when it wasn't as busy but either way I found the service and food to be on point.
