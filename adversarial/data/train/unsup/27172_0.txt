This store sets an example in what customer service should be.  My cat has food allergies and requires a unique and difficult to find diet. With that said, this store has always gone out of their way to help me. I've gone through so many brands of food and am still struggling to find something that agrees with my cats system. I've had excellent service at Summerlin and the south west location off Tropicana.  I love these people and I can tell they love the pet food industry.  Their top priority is foods that are healthy for your pet.  \nI highly recommend this place to ANYONE who wants quality pet food with the best customer service.
