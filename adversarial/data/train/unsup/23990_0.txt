Never coming back to this location again! We stopped here to get a few things and used two carts, my infant in one and my 3 year old in the other. When we left, we had left my 3 year old's sippy cup in the basket. When we realized this, we returned to the store (25 minutes later) and my husband asked the clerk if someone had turned it in. She calls the manager who says nobody turned anything in. He comes back out to the car and see the cup in the bushes! He takes a pic and goes back in to tell the manager. The clerk calls the manager to the front and she could've cared less. He showed her the picture and she just shrugged and said said she'd talk to the clerk. I know it's \"just a cup\" to you, but it's my sons special sippy cup and the least the courtesy clerk could've done is turned it in, not littered their own property with it. Shame on management for condoning that behavior as well.
