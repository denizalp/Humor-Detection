Went for lunch yesterday with an equally conservative female co-worker after deciding we were getting tired of our stand-by lunch places, so we decided to throw caution to the wind and try the Tilted Kilt.    \n\nWe were initially put off by the mere  thought of a Tilted Kilt taking up a building that had previously been Fuddruckers (loved) and Barrio Cafe (eh).   We were keeping our fingers crossed for something good to go in, since the Tilted Kilt has a reputation of being a \"Hooters\" type place, which I avoid like the plague. \n\nNow, I am a curvy plus size (& perfectly fabulous, thank you very much) woman, so chomping on a hamburger with size double-0 servers running around is not usually my idea of fun, but I have to tell you, I REALLY liked this place!\n\nI love the Irish-style  based menu, which has some traditional Irish fare, with some excellent and different bar & grill type food.   I ordered the spicy sausage sandwich and a size salad and my co-worker had a steak sandwich.   Mine was EXCELLENT!   The sausage was just spicy enough and grilled to perfection with melted provolone cheese and grilled onions (ordered without peppers).   It was a nice generous size portion, both the salad and the sandwich were so large that I couldn't finish it all.  \n\nThe decor is fun and interesting... Tons of TV's with sports channels going.  Great fun, warm, & welcoming environment!  \n\nBest of all, the service was fantastic.  Our little tiny size double-0 server was cute-as-a-button and was engaging and delightful enough that I didn't even notice (or care) that her entire uniform wouldn't fit on my left breast.   \n\nI am  happy to say that we are definitely adding Tilted Kilt to our regular lunch rotation!   Welcome to the PV area T.K.!   I'll be seeing you soon!
