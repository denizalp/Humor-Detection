We wandered into Sweet Box looking for dessert after eating at Shang Artisan Noodle next door.  I'm so happy we did!  We tried the Nutella bread box with strawberries instead of banana and it was fantastic!  We also had the watermelon latte and blueberry latte which were both amazing as well.  Service was quick and super friendly.  I'll definitely be back!
