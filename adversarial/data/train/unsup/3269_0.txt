There's this movie called Big Trouble in Little China. Kurt Russell plays a truck driver with a mullet and a best friend that owns a Chinese restaurant. I know the movie is set in 1980s San Francisco Chinatown, but I like to think that it's actually QQ Express.\n\nQQ is quintessentially Chinese American. This isn't the Chinese American at the mall, but Chinese American with loud ladies yelling \"next?!\" over and over through a busy lunch service. There are steam trays full of food, but they're constantly being emptied and refilled. It's not appealing to Americans. They are unfazed. The lunch line is full of fobby* kids and engineers. None of them care, or, if they did care, knew how to express it.\n\nThe food is kind of the same way. Chinese American. I watched a youtube video about Asian parents complaining about things. \"American food is too sweet\". This food is definitely too sweet. I wonder if someone in the restaurant could put together something amazing, but since I only have thirty minutes between classes, I will never find out.\n\n*Sorry
