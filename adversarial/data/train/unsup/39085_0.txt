Coming from Hawaii and living in Vegas for 8 years this is the very first place of any kind of business that made me and my three boys feel the \"aloha\" spirit. \n\nThe owner of the business, Casey Halstad is a very remarkable man. He is a person that can relate with anyone. From his students to his UFC fighters he knows them all individually. He not only has gym's in Nevada but has gyms in California and Arizona as well, and is opening up another one in Downtown Las Vegas.\n\nCoach Casey is more than just your typical jiu jitsu coach but more of a LIFE COACH. Whether it's him giving his Motivational Monday talk on YouTube or talking to my boys like they are somebody that really matters to the school is amazing. Watching him work with soooo many other people is truly unreal!\n\nWhen my boys joined the gym, they knew nothing. But Casey has the right kind of people in the right places. Coach Mike, Coach Doelle and Coach Jordan are just that. \nIncredible coaches. \n\nSo if you are interested in learning jiu jitsu COME down to 10th Planet Las Vegas, but if you want more STAY and learn what it is all about!
