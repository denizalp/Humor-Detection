Taylor's is a consistently wonderful place for breakfast... probably my favorite. The mimosas are more champagny than juice-y, which I obviously enjoy. The servers have always been sufficient, if not friendly and kind. There's not a single thing I dislike about Taylor's, really. Even the children that are occasionally scattered about seem well-behaved. Maybe this is Stepford breakfast, who knows.
