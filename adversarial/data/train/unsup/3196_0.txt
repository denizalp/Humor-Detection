Let me start by saying the food is amazing and it brings me back to the NYC delicatessens that I grew up with in the 1950s.  Their corned beef sandwich is the size of my first born (16\" Long and 12lbs 3 oz.) Because I am a large and religious man I do the Noah Philosophy (eat two of every everything) at other restaurants, but due to the portion size I only eat one of everything here.  The last sandwich I ate there should have just been placed in a hub cap because a normal human size plate could not handle it.  \n\nNow here is why I gave it 2 stars: it's because of terrible parking lot and the old people that go there.  Over the last 10 years I have been waiting for these blue haired people to die off so I can get a parking spot, but I swear they are multiplying. Maybe Joe has found that fountain of youth because no matter what time I go there, there is some old man with a walker rolling into the place.  There is never a parking spot and when one does open up, the old farts somehow beat me to the spot.  Last month I circled around for, no joke, 20 minutes. At the end I was following some old women with two bad knees for 5 minutes to get to her car (the car was only 30 feet away when I started to followed her). Then I waited another 5 minutes for her to get in the car and back up.  When she finally pulls out of the spot, a 200-year-old dinosaur steals the spot with his 1980's 4-door Cadillac.  I left the parking lot and have not returned.  Maybe I'll try to come back in another 10 years when I'm in a wheelchair.
