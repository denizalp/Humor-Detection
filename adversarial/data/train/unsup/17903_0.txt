4 out of 5 Stars....This place is a Shit hole!!!  With that being said, I absolutely loved this place.\n\nWalking in, the first you do is get a big whiff of some funky butt lovin!!  I dont know exactly what that is but it just hits you in the face.  After you take a minute to adjust to the smell, you notice that its not that big, but it has pretty much every table for gambling.  If we still lived in the dark ages, this is where the common folk would hang out.  You dont have to be a high roller, you dont have to have a huge bank roll, you dont have to dress to impress, you just have to want to have fun.\n\nI think the best part about this place is that they have beer pong in the back (technically it is called beirut).  They also have a Burger King and a Subway restaurant in the back too!!  So when lose your money at the tables, just go in the back and get a Whopper...probably the best money you will spend for what you get hahaha.  \n\nIf you are looking for a place with down to earth people that just want to have fun, check this place out.  The place might smell like old cheese and the tables might be stained with spooge but it has a homey feel to it.  I will certainly be back and try to actually win money.
