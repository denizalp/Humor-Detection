It really pains me to do this, because Andy himself is such a cool and friendly dude, but after eating at Penn Ave Fish Company for so long...I just can't bring myself to get his sushi anymore. It's... just... not that good.  \n\nIt all snapped into place for me one day recently.  The sushi rolls he makes are massive, but the taste just isn't there.  He's rushing to make them so fast that as soon as you put your chopsticks around them they completely fall apart.  And the most important part, the fish, doesn't seem all that fresh.  Definitely not as fresh as Penn Ave., which is weird considering he \"lives\" in a fresh fish mecca.  But the thing I think I've really grown to hate that weird brown sauce he puts on everything.  Yuck!  I just can't stand it!  I know I can ask to have it off, but as soon as I seem to remember, it's on there in a flash.\n\nI know it may be cheap and it may be fast, but to me it's just not worth it.  Penn Ave IS right down the street...and I PROMISE you'll love their fresh and delicious sushi!
