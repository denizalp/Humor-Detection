Nice big sports bar, great for watching the game, or hanging out with friends after.  Service was fast & friendly.  Great happy hour specials, and hours, starts at 7pm.  $2 cheeseburgers or $5 wings (6).  The cheeseburger was delicious, tasted like a real fresh burger you would make at home, not your typical restaurant, frozen\/low quality beef.  Definitely recommend getting a burger!  The appetizer sampler was a unique selection, your choice of wing flavor, fried provolone triangles, battered onion rings, & battered dill pickle spears.  The wings weren't crispy, & the battered items weren't fried long enough, too light in color and when you bite into them, still doughy.  The fried provolone was amazing and a refreshing difference from typical mozzarella.
