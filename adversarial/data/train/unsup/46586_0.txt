I've passed this store many times and strangely only recently dropped in for the first time.  I was on my way to meet a client for a meeting and noticed I left my eye drops at home, so I needed to buy some before my meeting.\n\nI dropped in here to pick up eyedrops and ended up doing some shopping.  The store is organized well and the products that were strategically positioned on the end caps and main aisles caught my attention.  I ended up buying some snacks for the office....doh, they got me again!\n\nFry's - 1, Me - 0\n\nReturn Factor - 75%
