Very disappointed with this practice.  Waited an hour past my appointment along another patient and when we inquired we were dismissed.  Had lab work done and never heard back from office.  Finally called for lab results and the staff was extremely rude.  Requested my results and the doctor never called me back.  These people do not know how to run a business.  The visit was a complete waste of time and money.  Do not recommend.
