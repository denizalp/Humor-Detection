Pricey and not thorough at all. Drove across the entire Midwest and came here to clean off the bugs. Got most of them off and I even told them that was my only concern. He said he'd make a note... but never made a \"note\". They dried the car off and I inspected the front to find more bugs remaining. I asked the attendant if they could address my concerns. I got a half ass'd yes and wipe down. Poor customer service. $20 roughly for an almost clean car
