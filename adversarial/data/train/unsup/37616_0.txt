I wanted to order take out. They are usually closed at 11PM. I walk in and all of these workers stare at me like they've never seen a customer before. Extremely rude. Then they said they are closed. \nI brought up the fact that they are closed at 11. They said, they are closed for floor maintanence. What is \"floor maintanence?\" \n\nLooked to me that they were just a bunch of lazy people who were looking for an excuse to close early
