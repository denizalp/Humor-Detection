\"You know how cute I always thought you were...\"\n\nWith those words, Phoebe Cates set hearts racing in 1982's  \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\"*.  Then, as now, she is smokin' hot.  Even I can recognize that she is stunning**.  \n\nWell friends, PNC Park reminds me of Phoebe Cates, and not just because they both have the initials \"P\" and \"C\".   Let me explain...\n\nAs we've established, Phoebe Cates is spectacular.  And I would imagine even if you ran into her one morning after she'd been out all night, hungover, no makeup, hair messed up, clothes wrinkled, she would probably still be breathtaking.\n\nAnd this is where I draw the parallel to PNC Park.  Without a doubt, this is the most beautiful park in the major leagues (and I've been to about 24 of them).   Anyone I know who's been here says the same thing.  So it follows that no matter how lousy, pathetic or embarrassing the baseball the Pirates organization puts on the field, PNC Park is still heart-stoppingly magnificent.\n\nThe views are impressive, the prices are reasonable (I paid $60 for seats five rows behind Pirates dugout!), the food is good, the beer is good, the entertainment is first rate.  The only thing I can complain about is that when I took the stadium tour we didn't get to go into a locker room like at other stadiums.  Quite simply, it's the standard by which all other ballparks should be measured.\n\nI absolutely love this park...win or lose, it always looks like bikini Phoebe in my eyes.\n\n--------------------------------------\n* best red bikini ever (excellent use of the Cars \"Moving in Stereo\" by the way) http:\/\/youtu.be\/PqMIfeTc-CM\n** those who know me (or who have read my reviews) know I'm not exactly her target demographic  :)
