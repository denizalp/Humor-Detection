Yelp reviews did not let me down. The food was good for an airport restaurant. Service was great too. \n\nI was here for breakfast. My scramble was as Ordered.  The mini croissant was fresh, and the grapes were yummy. \nI also order hot tea. The main reason I decided to eat here was because I saw a customer drinking herbal tea. Any restaurant that has more than just Lipton tea deserves a second look, in my book. The jasmine green tea I ordered did not disappoint. It's always the little things ;).
