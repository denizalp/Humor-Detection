I recently moved to the desert and was very particular when it came to finding a new stylist. I found Deana through the Yelp reviews and was thrilled that she met up with every single review. My previous stylist who I had been going to for years gave me a very creative (i.e. Uneven) cut. Deana was able to flawlessly match my roots and recut the not so great cut.  She is attentive and great at what she does...very detail oriented.
