I couldn't think of any knocks against this theater.\n\nFirst, it is not your traditional theater. It is age 18 and over only. So kids and crying babies are not allowed in the theater (except on Mondays when kids eat free) They also have a $5 movie night on Tuesdays and other special events (check the site for these. Ex. Breakfast club on Sat and Sun and College night with $2 domestic pints). The concept is a movie theater you can go kid-free and enjoy a drink and even food during the movie.\n\nWhen you walk in you can see murals of classic and blockbuster movie posters lining the entire place. It has a very cool vibe for nostalgia. The lobby is very open and comfortable with a bar in the middle serving your favorite drinks and a lounge area complete with pool table. At the bar, they have TVs showing silent movies.\n\nOnce inside the theater, the rows are spaced nicely and each has a bar area complete with menus, condiments, and they even thought to put a roll of paper towels underneath the bar. Waitresses pop their heads in from time to time and you can signal them you are ready to order just by putting your menu vertical. They are very discrete taking your order so not to interrupt the movie for others.\n\nAnd the food? I went to an event where we got to sample many of their offerings. I did not have one bad thing. The pizzas, sliders, grilled cheese, brownies, nachos...all were delicious. I would easily consider this an all in one destination if I were to decide on a dinner and movie night.\n\nAnd because of the bar area and lounge area in the lobby, you could make this a stress free dinner and movie date place.
