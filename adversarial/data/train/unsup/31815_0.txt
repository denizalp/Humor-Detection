Each season my boy wait for this spot to open! They never fail us! The snow is always so fine that it literally melts in your mouth. There are so many different combinations of flavors that you can use to crest your own. You can add ice cream or cream to your snow cone as well. The employees are always happy! This place is always jamming which is always a good sign. Be sure to get your lunch card to earn your free snow cone! AMAZINGLY GOOD!
