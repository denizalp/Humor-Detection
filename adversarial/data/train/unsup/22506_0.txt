An unbelievable selection on beers. Very thorough. \nThat being said the food that I had is where the stars were lost. The Mac n chz was interesting. Sweet and spicy. With the all the chz the sweet component was way too much. And DO NOT get the \"prime rib\" on it. Now the \"roast beef \" that I got was tender. A lil bland but tender. \nI'm sure it's a prime rib cut BUT when u over cook it it becomes jus an average roast beef. I should've tried the pizza.
