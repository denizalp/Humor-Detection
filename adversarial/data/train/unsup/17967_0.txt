While visiting Toronto, this experience was sort of icing on the cake for us.\n\nAt 19 were crazy enough to drive to drive the 9 hour ride through the entire state of NY...pretty much to sit down at a bar and have a drink! Seriously, before we even got there, I didn't even know anything about the CN tower. I can recall seeing the structure miles away and quickly had to search to see what that was.\n\nWe were also crazy enough to go during the middle of winter, so we had NO wait lines at all compared to what others have stated. I'm sure lines are much longer during the Spring and Summer. Nothing at all like the 4 hours to see the Empire State Building. Within 5 minutes of walking in, we were on the elevator (which is partially glass so you watch yourself go up) and it is very fast. Your ears will pop going up, much like an airline experience does, so be prepared. \n\nThe glass floor isn't the entire floor, but I didn't think it would be. Too many people would panic and my partner wouldn't even go close to it. \n\nOverall, the CN tower was a neat experience that I will never forget, and those sort of moments are worth more than the pieces of paper it cost me.
