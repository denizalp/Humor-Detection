If you are a guest at The Venetian you gain a complimentary pass to Tao. There is also a separate line for entry if you are \"a guest\".  This club is for sinners; it is hedonistic with a LOT of synthetic body parts and 36DDs exposed and on parade for all the horny men as they walk by, wobbly in their unfamiliar hooker stilt shoes.. Their dresses are very low and on the reverse VERY high and they are very tight. If your waist is around a 26 and you are nubile, this is where it's at for you...well, you know what I may be saying, but this is the reality in this vein environment.  My trainer said I will have to work harder before I go. It is definitely a fun place and the club and partygoers are pulsating by midnight.  Cash your dividend check before you go otherwise you won't have any real fun. Know going in you will drop some seriously \"bigly\" coinage here. Have a wholesome budget in cash (that's impressive here) and know it will go fast. You cannot cut corners ($$$) here and they don't accept coupons. If you don't participate and are just a looky-loo you will end up standing in the corner all night with a dopety look on your face. \nIn conclusion, don't look surprised at the high numbers on your tab after it is handed to you by a hot full bosomed girl with a deep bend...that's the good part. \nI wouldn't recommend a girl going solo. It's the best when you experience Tao with someone you are freshly falling in love with.  It is a seductive place and it will create a hot memory.\nTHEY HAVE THE BEST MATCH BOXES...GRAB A FEW....great souvenir actually.  Don't forget to pick them up on the way out cause this is proof you have been there..  \nMinus 1 star cause it has a skanky smell and some skanky women. It is easy to find someone here to get laid if you're halfway good looking.  The rooms are a convenient few steps away.\nThis not a conservative club!  Not really for people from the red states.
