While I really like Lowes, this store has given me horrible customer service twice in a row :( I brought in pictures of some molding I needed to repair and the gentleman who I asked assistance from barley glanced at them, then told me to purchase these tubes of white lighting adhesive, saying \"That's what I always use\". (the product is this: http:\/\/images.lowes.com\/product\/converted\/023275\/023275362222lg.jpg) \n\nWhat he failed to tell me was that I also needed a special gun-like too to dispense the adhesive. So there I am, 930 at night with hopes of painting the next morning (needing 5 hours dry time for this stuff) and I had to get this stuff out without the proper tools. \n\nNevertheless, I was livid. So I went back the next day and told his dept manager what had happened and simply said \"I just wanted you to be aware of this, so that you can tell him to be more complete in his instructions!\" and do you know what he said? \"I'm sorry, but I don't know how you wouldn't know that you needed a tool for that\".\n\nWHAT?! I am 24 years old! I just bought my first home!? I CAME TO YOU FOR HELP WITH PICTURES BECAUSE I AM THAT LOST ON THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM!!!\n\nAnd you're blaming ME?! \n\nI can't go in to the mental profanity that went on inside me after he said that, I simply walked out and will never return to this Lowe's again. Home Depot Wendover forever!
