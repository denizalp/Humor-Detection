One of my friends who live in Vegas recommended this restaurant so I had to try it. Also heard that this is the 45 best restaurants in the US! The wait can be a little aggravating but you can put your name on the waitlist online and it'll tell you the wait time. They also text you when your table is ready and if you need a little more time to arrive. \n\nI got the tom yum soup and the garlic prawns. Both were very delicious! The garlic prawns were really crunchy, which I liked. They also have a huge selection of wine for those who love wine. \n\nThe service was actually okay. Maybe because they were so busy but I didn't mind as much since they were friendly.
