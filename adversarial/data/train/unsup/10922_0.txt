Vodka, vodka, vodka! \n\nIt is so easy to pass this place as there is not a large sign that reads \"Rasputin Vodka Bar\" on the front but says Try Stoli Here, or something like that (what is it with Queen East that does this). Once you walk in, it's very cozy, not in a bad way. Walking up a few steps takes you to the main bar which is stacked with different types of vodka. The little mini chandeliers hang in between large mirrors. Walking towards the back you notice a Soviet era military coat, love this! There are tons of couches and chairs to lounge on and it was no problem for our large group of 15 or so. \n\nThe vodka selection is extensive but they may not match what is listed on the menu as we were informed that many on the menu had run out. But the bartenders were great! I watched them pour each drink and every one of them was more than an ounce of vodka. More like all vodka, splash of [blank], which is how all drinks should be.\n\nThere weren't as many vodkas as competitor vodka bar Pravda has but there are many different kinds. From the organic vodka from Oregon called Square One to the Roberto Cavalli Vodka. \n\nWhile seated, our server brought us little snacks. Some pickles, some bread and lots of corn nuts. I love corn nuts! The bread was gross, do not eat it but the pickles and corn nuts were so good, especially with a drink in hand.\n\nOur server was pretty consistent with checking with us and bringing more drinks and remembering individual's tabs. It was a great atmosphere with splashes of USSR, there was even an ancient cash register in the back by the couches. There is a 2nd bar in the back but it only opens on busier nights.\n\nNot an ounce of snottiness or douchebaggery in this place, although I'd have to come on a busier weekend night to really tell. But as far as I'm concerned, this place is better than Pravda, aside from the minimal vodka choices in comparison.
