The new facility is stunning. So clean and fresh. I am so glad they have the well and sick waiting areas separate from each other and they also have a moms nursing room which is so cozy and private. The doctors are all very thorough. Dr. Caplan is great. She listens to the concerns and also respects the parents input and preferences. High quality care here for sure.
