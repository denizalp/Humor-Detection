I am absolutely not comfortable in stores that sell electronics. I'd generally prefer to get in and out as quickly as I can without being noticed. If I'm spotted, inevitably salespeople start asking me questions I don't know the answers to and I feel like the awkward electro-moron that I am. \n\nLucky for me, someone directed me to Bay Bloor Radio when I told them I was in the market for some new headphones. The store itself is clean and bright, though walking through displays of electronic things and past the special rooms for listening to speakers was intimidating (that's my issue, not theirs). \n\nThe staff (and I say staff instead of salespeople because I didn't feel at all like I was being sold to - I felt like I was being helped to find the things that I wanted) were friendly and casual. They steered me in the right direction but also allowed me time to just stand around and listen to headphones without hovering over me. They answered all of my (unsophisticated) questions and helped me find headphones that I am completely in love with for exactly the amount of money I told them I wanted to spend.
