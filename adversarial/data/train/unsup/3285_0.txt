A little expensive but the Cluckitoes are light and crispy, covered in cheese. Mmmm.... The Super Clucker and Great Gobbler are delicious as well.\n The fries are seasoned perfectly.\n Not sure what a child could order except the chicken finger meal.\n The owner will make sure everything is perfect when he's there, otherwise check your order. Small, only 6 tables inside, drive thru, small parking lot.\n No vegetarian choices, they do offer desserts, ask when you order a drink, some come in cans.   :\/
