This place was astoundingly rude to my boyfriend and I. The salesman's personality was slimy right out of the gate. We just wanted to test drive a specific car, and it took us less than 10 minutes to be so turned off by this place we turned around and left.\n\nFirst, we were looking at a really nice car that was in the show room. It was locked, and my boyfriend asked to take a look inside. The salesman replied with \"No, it's too expensive\". I may not be rolling around wearing Prada but it's absolutely rude and insulting to assume someone's budget. \n\nNext they tell us that we can't test drive the car we want because we wouldn't give the salesman our phone number. He said it was in case we \"hijacked him\". First, how rude to treat us as if we're criminals. Second, he had my boyfriend's driver's license. They could practically apply for a credit card in his name- a phone number (which we could have given a fake one anyway) doesn't make their salesman any more safe. They clearly just wanted contact information to be able to try and get us back in if we didn't buy that day. I personally just bought a brand new car after looking and test driving for MONTHS, and nobody EVER denied me a test drive because I wouldn't give my number. Heck, I don't think anyone else even asked for it at that point.\n\nAfter the manager confirmed with the salesman that they wouldn't allow us to test drive without a phone number, we left. You'd think that with car sales at such a low, they'd at least have the common sense to treat customers with a little respect.
