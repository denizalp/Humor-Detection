I would give a 0 if I could ! Do not go here if you have high expectations ( as you should),in a healthcare provider!!!! The lack of communication between the Dr.s, nurse practitioner & front office staff is mind blowing. I had to constantly follow up on my labs and request a call back. I had labs done weeks ago and barely heard from their office yesterday. Only for them to refer me to urgent care.
