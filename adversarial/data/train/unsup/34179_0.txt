Even cooler than I had imagined. Every pinball machine you can imagine. I really liked the arcade games. Ms. Pac-Man, Centipede, Space Invaders, Frogger, etc. Took me back to my childhood playing these classics. Bonus they were working on a machine and I got to see the inside. I will definitely recommend to friends!
