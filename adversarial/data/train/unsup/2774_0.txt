Finally, a taco to be proud of in our city!\n\nCarnitas taco is amazing along with the Camarones a la diabla.\nNothing to complain about, except the first time we went, my boyfriend (who is Mexico so spice is in his blood) and I got all ballsy and put A LOT of habanero salsa on our tacos, and it was too hot to handle.\nThese gringos do it right.  Super friendly and efficient with the small work space they've got.\n\nOne thing, which isn't criticism of this place but of the 214 Augusta complex, is that the patio could definitely use some sprucing up and while they are renovating the interior, it could use some love as well. \n\nAnyway, I hope to see this place evolve and grow and will definitely be giving it my business for times to come.\n\nThey also have aguas frescas (horchatas, aguas de jamaica etc.) that change from day to day and are a steal at $1 a glass.
