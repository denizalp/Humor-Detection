good affordable vegetarian restaurant with attitude (where the customer is not always right).\n\nfor example:\nthe decor is eclectic\nthere is only one menu\nthey charge for water\nyou can get you meal in three sizes, all cost the same\nyou have to eat everything on your plate\nyou cannot add salt or pepper to the meal\nif you don't finish your plate you will be lectured\nif you pay by visa or interact, you will be charged extra\n\nthese guys know wasting food is a crime and they will charge you for it. so if you feel like being a smart-ass, this is not the place for you...
