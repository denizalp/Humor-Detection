Dr. Ince and she staff were very friendly and efficient. I stopped by while in the area shopping and they had no issue setting up an appointment convenient to my schedule. \n\nWhen I came in for the appointment, they were ready for me and took x-rays, cleaned my teeth, and did two fillings in less then an hour and a half!\n\nThey did all this in a friendly, comfortable environment. I highly recommend using them.
