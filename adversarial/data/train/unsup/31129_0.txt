My husband surprised me for my Birthday and took me here. We sat at a special table right in front of the fireplace, It was very romantic! The service was impeccable, we were treated very well. Not only was our waitress amazing, so was the rest of the staff. \n\nThe Food was even more amazing. I had the scallops with grits, and my husband had the 20oz Ribeye with horseradish mash potatoes. For our sides we had the fried rice, cauliflower, and the macaroni and cheese (each had a delicious unique flavor). For dessert we shared the donuts, they had a perfect crispy outside with a delicious fluffy inside. The sauces that accompanied the donuts were a perfect match. I highly suggest this restaurant for a date night or a night out with friends.
