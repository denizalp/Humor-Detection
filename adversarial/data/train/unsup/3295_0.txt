It's the Vegas tourist version and if you've never been to Rao's in NY... then you have no way to compare. \n\nFirst, it's huge and pretty. But mostly huge. Like the portions other than chicken piccata which I'll get to later. \n\nNY Rao's is a hidden gem and invitation or a lucky call to get in. Very inside and protected. Vegas is open to the world. So, be prepared to wait even with a ressie. The bar is also huge and a good spot to hang or even eat. Fun vibe. \n\nOscar did a nice job as a server and handled us and a crazy group of 18 guys behind us. Loud? You bet. \n\nStarted with wine by the glass and shared meatballs as big as your head. One each. Just ok. \n\nVeal piccata was great with a zucchini perfectly cooked. But not enough to share. \n\nSo, all that for about $180. Hmmmmm, oh well you only live once. \n\nI think I'll wait for the next lucky NY call.
