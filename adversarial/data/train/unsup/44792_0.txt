This hotel is great.  Great views, great service, and everyone was very friendly.  The only thing I would change are the bathrooms, which some of them have a frosted glass window and some of the showers aren't designed very well.  \n\nThe location and views are incredible.  The price is right, too, for this category of hotel.  Everything is brand new.  It's also one of the quietest hotels I have ever stayed at -- you can't hear anyone else from your room.
