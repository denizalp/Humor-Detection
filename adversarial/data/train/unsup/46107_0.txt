Was looking for a place to mix up traditional deep tissue massage with more muscle manipulation.  I have had a few Thai Massages in the past and I would say this was one of the better massages of this style.  It was clear the provider has had many years of experience and quickly worked the muscle groups into putty.  In my mind Thai Massage should be low-frill low cost and this place hits the mark.  I managed to sneak in without an appointment but I understand that is pretty rare, better book ahead!
