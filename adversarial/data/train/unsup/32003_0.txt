Love this place. When I need my Indian food fix, this is where I go. Great location, too. Right by my house! I went in on a busy night and it took a little time for someone to notice us this time, but they looked slammed. (As a restaurant owner in the Central Phoenix area, I can understand this. It happens!) They sat us shortly after and then our server suggested wine and apps. We loved everything! Get the samosa chaat and ribs!Â #buylocal
