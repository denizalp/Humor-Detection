Hands down best butter chicken I've ever had! Everything from the saffron rice to the cheese paneer dish was absolutely stunning. Delivery was quick and free. I'm only ordering from here going forward, everything was totally perfect! No idea what the people below are complaining about. This place makes the absolute best Indian food, and we have been to plenty of restaurants in the city. Finally found our gem.
