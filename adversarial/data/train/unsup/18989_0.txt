Reservations required on weekends!\n\nDimly lit jewel in corner of strip mall.  Enter and enjoy another world from the extremely limited shared parking lot.  This one of my favorites as it's close to home and still a world away in terms of ambiance. \n\nCRISPY OCTOPUS - nothing short of fantastic\nBAO SLIDERS - nice starter\nSCOTTISH SALMON - over forbidden rice is a no brainer perfection\nSMOKEY BEET SALAD - smoked flavor, but drowned in a yogurt that i didn't care for, is shareable only because neither of us liked it.  \nBRAISED DUROC PORK BELLY - over cauliflower puree, kabocha squash blew my mind!\n\nGood date night spot or chill out and enjoy libations without all that noise.
