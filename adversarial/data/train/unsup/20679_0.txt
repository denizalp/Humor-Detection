I was on a mission to deliver some food for a starving friend and a quick search on Yelp led me here. Overall very pleased with the service and food!\n\nMarket Grille Cafe is located in a plaza on Rockspring Rd. and can easily be found with their humongous signage. Dine-in, take-out and catering available. \n\nI ordered based on my friendly server's suggestion and got their Traditional Gyro (beef and lamb). Also picked up a soup since my starving friend is a huge soup connoisseur.  \n\nTheir traditional gyro comes in 7-inch pita bread and is packed with loads of beef and lamb. They offer a choice of hummus or yogurt dill sauce but my server was kind enough to include both sauce on the side. Gyro itself is a big portion but this can also be made in a combo platter which comes with Greek salad, basmati rice, pita bread and hummus for additional charge of $4. Meaty, filling, and packed with flavor. Highly recommend. \n\nThe soup I picked up is called Avgolemono and is also known as lemon, chicken and rice soup. This soup is similar to porridge and it is very lemon sour. You can get this in small ($4) or large ($6). \n\nEasily my top favorite place for gyro. Must try for any Mediterranean food lovers.
