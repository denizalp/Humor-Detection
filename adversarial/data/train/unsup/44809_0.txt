I give this place a solid three stars...it was a pretty typical breakfast place, nothing special.  I had the vege skillet which was ok except some of the potatoes were undercooked and some overcooked...GF had eggs Benedict an the eggs were over done as well.  Hollandaise needed more lemon:  I would eat there again but it's not  the best breakfast I have ever had!
