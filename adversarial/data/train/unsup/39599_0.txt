3.5 star...we did some minor yelpsearch before heading over to this place for my burpday dinner...so I had expectations coming in...maybe that's just not the right approach....?\n\nSo we ended up ordering calamari, octopus, seafood risotto, We pretty much ordered alot from the Yelp recommendations except for the catch of the day....cuz I wasn't attracted to sea bream...the service was pretty good as they checked up on us quite frequently...olives and bread was refilled promptly... \n\nNothing really Wow'd me in general... everything was a balance 3.5 star well deserved...the.seafood risotto was filled with seafood but the ratio of risotto rice was not there.. it just felt more like a seafood only dish.. not risotto... \n\nWe ordered one prix fixe as one of the guest wanted to try it so we gave it a shot...agree with Jennifer K.  that it wasn't good at all.. you can tell the difference in taste and in plating... \n\nPrix fixe is probably made by the sous chef or something....\n\nAll in all,  it's an A-ok place....
