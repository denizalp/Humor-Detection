So this is an interesting place. You order your pizza, either create your own or choose one of their specialities, and they prepare it for you but do not cook it. There are no ovens in the place, you bake everything at home! The pizzas come in a ready to cook pan, so you just pop it in the oven when you get home. So cool! They also have cheesesticks and chocolate chip cookie dough, as well as dinner salads and sodas to make it a meal. \n\nOn Tuesdays all large pizzas are $10, including specialty and build your own up to 5 toppings. You can get an extra large for a few extra bucks, but they don't have anything smaller. My boyfriend built his own-double sausage, steak, pepperoni and extra cheese. I went with the Angus steak and roasted garlic specialty pizza. It has garlic sauce, Angus steak, roasted garlic, mushrooms, green onions and parmesan. It was supposed to be on a thin crust, but it came on original. They also have pan crust if you desire. \n\nAlthough this is a cool concept, the execution failed for me. The original crust pizza is too doughy for my liking, and the pizzas were not very flavorful, even with all those toppings. The pizzas also could have used a lot more sauce. I was very disappointed, but glad I went on Tuesday when it was only $10. I might try a thin crust next time and see if that is any better, but I won't be rushing back.
