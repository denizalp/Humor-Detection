I made a same day appointment and took my one year old son in for his first haircut! \n\nI LOVE the layout of the studio, which is retro\/rockabilly themed, but not in an overkill way at all. Very slick lookin'!\n\nJulia was his stylist, and I couldn't be more thrilled with how my son's hair turned out. \n\nHe wasn't scared at all but she still got him warmed up to the idea of the buzzing of the clippers by holding the vibrations of them against his arm. \n\nShe was able to effortlessly work through his squirms and wiggles that started happening toward the end to achieve the look I was kinda going for! \n\nAs we were getting ready to leave, a younger girl brought out a \"First Haircut\" certificate and a little clear bag to put a lock of hair in, which almost made me cry. So sweet.\n\nThe whole experience lasted about 15 minutes or so!  \n\nI'm very happy with our experience, and we will definitely be back!! My son looks SO FREAKING CUTE!!
