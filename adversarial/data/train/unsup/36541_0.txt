Amazing.  When we arrived they explained the hour wait and said to come back in about 50 minutes because the pagers only work in the restaurant.  We walked around the mall and then came back in time to get to our reserved time.  Everyone loved their food, the service is impeccable and the cheesecake (or other dessert) is divine.  The menu is a touch overwhelming, but there are options for everyone.
