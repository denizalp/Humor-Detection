I think their burgers are good, not a fan at all of their fries, but my wife and daughter are!  We aren't what you call regulars here but we are not strangers by any sense of the meaning.  They are fairly quick with their orders, unless you order a shake and then we actually completed our meal before the shake was done.  I guess that is because the cashier was the one to make them and we had to wait until the line allowed her to do so....pretty strange way of divvying up the work responsibilities.  They are a fail safe if you want a quick bite and a descent burger...I am sure we will be back!  OH BTW....  do NOT approach if you have peanut allergies they are ALL over the restaurant for free appetizers
