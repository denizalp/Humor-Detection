The room was spacious and clean, but very overpriced.  The coffee was BAD.  I like that the servers take orders for the hot food in the so-called breakfast buffet so you don't have to stand in line, but when I arrived there was nobody there to greet, seat, and take my order.  It is also not included in the price of the hotel.  The location is great, but I will stay at a different hotel next time I'm in the area.  There is nothing wrong with this hotel except it is not a good value at all.
