Ok we were recommended to stay here because we needed to stay on Boulder highway. Meh. When I checked in it was your usual KOA employees in their yellow shirts that were very friendly. \n\nI'm giving this KOA 4 stars because if you pay for say 5 nights and only stay 4 if you come in by 11am they will give you your $ back. I don't know any campground that does that!! Kudos to you Sam's Town KOA. \n\nThey have 2 off leash dog areas and several dog stations. Couple of pools and laundry facilities. Although we used neither but they were available along with showers and restrooms. They have gravel FHU sites some pull thru and many back ins. \n\nIt is close to the airport so you can hear the jets but it's not really bothersome. The trash man comes through every other day and I mean he flies through here like its a race track probably a good 30mph. Zoom...... Posted 5mph. It was really full when we were here didn't look like any full time residents in here if so it didn't show.
