BEWARE!  worst hotel I have stayed at in Arizona. I tried giving the hotel a few chances but always disappointed me because stayed there out of convenience but never again. The last straw is when I forgot my card key and they wouldn't let me in the room because the room was under my husbands name. Clearly we were married same last name. The staff is rude and they knock on your door before check out trying to kick you out of the room. The vibe and energy is low. Never staying there again!!!
