My first and last time! I went to see Alison because I was referred by a friend, I asked her if she could get my hair as light as the picture? She replied yes if I did not have any other hair color on my hair in last 2 years. I never had i have only Balayage done. After my hair was done I was so upset by what I saw she made my hair more yellow with warmth after I specifically said I don't want it with the warmth and yellow. She kept trying to convince me that she did make it look like the picture. I was in shock because I do hair as a hobby and was amazed how she was trying to make a fool out of me! She found it insulting that I did not have a license to do hair. But when you do something you love you can do it better then what a license can teach you. On that note she said she was insulted because I did not have a licensee and told me that she wasn't going to charge me and to get out! Pictures say a 1000 words. First pictures is what my hair was before she touched it second picture was of what I showed her I wanted to look like. And last picture is what she gave me! I am also including the messages between us. She also blocked my from Instagram but people will find the truth.
