I bought Daikon radish here.  Well, I am pretty sure that is what I bought. They were out of it at Far East.  When I look it up on the web it is skinnier and white and more carrot like:  this was not quite the same thing, it looked more like an overgrown turnip and more tubular. I read it burns fat.  We shall see: I already need to go get more. They keep the coffee candy right next to the register.  I love the ginseng root in a cute little bottle.  Tastes like dirt.  I would like to repurpose the little bottles and fit them with corks. Paul and I also walked out with a 20lb bag of rice. We were told it will be sticky rice.  We are accustomed to long grain.  Seems to be the place for rice if it is a diet staple for you.
