My boyfriend and I love this place. We live a 2 minute walk away and go here 3 to 4 times a month. I would highly recommend the 19th Street Burger and the Eclectic Mac n Cheese with Buffalo Chicken. The onion rings and fried pickles are made in house and are absolutely to die for. Everyone here is always nice. Katie is our favorite server. They also do take-out and delivery if you want a good meal and are feeling lazy.
