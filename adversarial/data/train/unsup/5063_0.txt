Holy s**t, this Walmart is filled with the most incompetent employees ever. I didn't run into just one. There were THREE employees I had the joy of encountering that made me say to myself \"are you f***ing kidding me?!\" \n\nEmployee #1: I saw an employee stocking shelves with product that were in plastic storage bins. And it just so happened I needed to purchase said storage bins. I kindly ask where might they be located in the store. She looks at me and says, \"what storage bins?\" I point to the bins that she is pulling product out of. And she says, \"um I'm not sure.\" Sure enough, about 15 feet away, I find them. \n\nEmployee #2: I'm paying for all my merchandise and I tell the cashier to please put all my food items in the plastic storage bin and use my reusable bags for the rest of my items. (I hate plastic bags FYI). She says no problem. She puts the eggs, bread, bananas, cookie dough and black berries in the bin. Mind you these are all delicate items. She puts my candles, shampoo, conditioner and baking soda (which are all heavy items) in my reusable bag as I requested. She then proceeds to put the heavy items ON TOP of the food in the plastic bin. I stopped her just as my bread was about to get smooshed. She then apologizes and says she forgot there was food in there.  Are you that stupid?!?!?!?!!??!! Jeezus!!!!!!!\n\nEmployee #3: Final story of the last incompetent employee, and this includes the same cashier that just rung me up. As I'm putting my wallet back in my purse, this male employee cuts in front of the people behind me so the cashier can ring up his water. He says to the people behind me \"I just have this so it'll be real fast.\" They looked irritated but didn't say anything that an employee had just cut in front of them. I wouldn't have been that nice about it. And the same cashier started having a conversation with him like they were on lunch or something. \n\nI gave them 2 stars because I was able to find everything on my list and the older Filipino gentleman at the door was very friendly. I don't live anywhere near this Walmart. I was only shopping here because it was on the way to my dad's house. Next time, I'll just stick to the location on my side of town.
