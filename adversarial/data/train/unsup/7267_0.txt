Our order:\nSml Caesar Salad---$8\n\nMy daughter said \"it did not taste good.\"  It was a Caesar Salad; so, the dressing or something else was off.\n\nRoot Beer---$3.50\n\nComes from a bottle.  Pretty high mark up for a regular bottle of root beer.  Really?\n\nHot Chocolate---$2 (x2)\n\nOkay hot chocolate that comes in a paper cup and plastic lid.  Pretty expensive for instant hot chocolate.\n\n2 Seared Scallops & 4 Shrimp (they do not tell you how many you get) w\/ mac & cheese and garlic mashed potatoes---$24\n\nShrimp had pretty good taste, and the scallops had a nice sear, but the main course was really skimpy.  Both sides were very bland.\n\nSalmon with Crab (sides were Garlic Mash and Braised Mushrooms).  \n\nFish was bland.  Garlic Mash bland. The mushrooms were atrocious. \"Absolutely disgusting\"\n\n*they charged me $2 for a soda\/tea I did not reviece.  With horrible food like this, they need that $2 more than me.\n\nWe will never come back here again.  \n\n\"We should have gone to 5 & Diner instead\"
