Holy mole is this place good!  A group of us from work went to try this place out since I kept reading some awesome reviews about it.  And it's everything it states it will be plus more!  We got there around noon and waited about an hour to place our order.  The nice part was they gave us cold water bottles while we waited in line and gave us a tour of the smoker so we could learn how they cooked the meats and why it was so good.  Once inside the guys are super nice and let you try the meat if you ask for a sample.  Since we didn't get in the door until close to 1 they ran out of fatty brisket and turkey.  But I had a lean brisket sandwich and it was still so moist!  Also had the potato salad and I'm already craving it for the next time.  The other tip I learned while there is Tuesday is their slower day so maybe only a 30 min wait?  Everything was awesome!
