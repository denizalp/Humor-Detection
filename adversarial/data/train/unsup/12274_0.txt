Luckily I wasn't here for an emergency...\nCame in late one night looking for the sleep clinic. It was around 10-11PM and I entered through the only lighted entrance, the emergency department.  I figured I could find it myself using a map or posted signage, assuming the place would be busy.\n\nThere was no signage. There were no maps. It was not busy. Yet no one asked me if I needed help, no one  even looked up when I was walking around, and when I finally asked for assistance, no one knew where the lab was. Eventually I found an elevator and the lab was listed on the directory for an upper floor. \n\nI am grateful that I did not need medical attention here, because if the staff are this incompetent at simple tasks I'd hate to be at their mercy with a real problem. Maybe if I came in an ambulance or with a visible wound, I would have been attended to.. but bedside manner is comparable to customer service, and the night staff here seem to be lacking in that regard.
