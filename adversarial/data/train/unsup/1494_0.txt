I don't understand the concept of this place. The night I went there was 4 other guests. It smelled so bad like cat food. I'm not trying to be funny it really smelled like cat food. The display case at the entrance had baby bottles in it and the other one had random medical supplies. Me being a nurse was very confused by the items in this case. They obviously didn't have a medical person to consult about the items in the case. We didn't eat but we wanted a drink so we had wine. In a baby bottle. Why what is this supposed to signify the wine tasted like shit very cheap blaaaaahhhh. We didn't stay and my friend got violently sick. It was also over priced. I won't be going back and I won't be telling any to go here either. One star for the wait staff and the security guy he was very nice
