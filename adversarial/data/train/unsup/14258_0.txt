Thankfully, my grandmother has basically no concept of the internet. I don't think she has ever been online before. And most certainly she would think that yelp is something a dog says.\n\nI can't stand this place. And she just loooooves to come here. I have probably eaten here at least half a dozen times (once on Thanksgiving of all days). The food is pretty good. It is a buffet after all, so it isn't totally trash. But just looking around the place, I want to call in the special investigators of the fashion police. There is just something about the place that irritates me. But hey. As far as everyone else knows, I think this place is great. If my grandma likes it, I like it more. Whatever makes her happy.
