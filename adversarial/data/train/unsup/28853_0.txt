After about 20 visits to Public School I can say this is one of my favorite restaurants. I'd say only once have I been disappointed in something I've ordered. The atmosphere is casual but you'd feel comfortable in date wear or a casual day shopping wear. The theme inside is grade school stuff like gym floor panels, globes and math flash cards. I love the community style high top tables in the bar area and the USB ports found underneath the bar (*hint: the bar area is open seating if there is a wait to be seated). They have a great beer selection including a rotating tap list. \n\nLet's talk food now, my tops picks that I order almost every time:\n\nBuffalo Cauliflower appetizer is amazing! Its fried and tossed in buffalo sauce and served with blue cheese sauce. \n\nShrimp and Grits is everything sweet and salty with tender bacon, floating in a moat of savory gravy surrounding a brick or grits and topped with the juiciest pieces of shrimp and crisp corn!!! \n\nKale Cesar Salad w\/ Pan Seared Salmon. The kale is shredded and massaged so it's really tender and easy to eat, tossed in Cesar dressing with shaves of parmesan cheese. Both the salmon and salad are very large portions as well. \n\nCheesy Tots are basically a loaded potato toppings rolled into a tater tot and fried to a crisp!\n\nBrown Bag Fries... honestly they're just French fries in a bag and they're fantastic!
