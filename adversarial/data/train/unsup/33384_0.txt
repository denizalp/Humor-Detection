We stayed at the Hotel Palomar Phoenix Kimpton July 15-17 for our sons orientation at Grand Canyon University. It's a pleasure today our experience has been nothing short of outstanding. The Palomar Kimpton has by far the best service I've ever received form a hotel. Everything I requested was handled quickly and with a smile. The room was very well appointed and pool a lot of fun. We ate at the Blue Hound Kitchen and Cocktail the restaurant at the hotel and it was also fantastic. I will definitely stay here again and look for a Kimpton Hotel on our next trip.
