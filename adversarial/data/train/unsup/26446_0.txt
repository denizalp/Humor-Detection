Stopped by here before we started our day. I wasn't too hungry for a big breakfast plate so I figure I order the pizza. I should have just paid a couple more dollars for the breakfast plate instead. Would have been more worth it. \nThe pizza was about 11 inches cut up in 4 peices. It was soft and chewy and tasted very generic. I make better pizza in the oven buying it from the store.  \nIf I ever came back, I know not to at least get the pizza. \nMy guy had burger and garlic fries.  I didn't care for the fries but they were VERY greasy! So just a heads up for that one.
