Yes, I did get some culture while visiting Las Vegas.  After trying to find the lithograph museum at Paris Casino (gone to make way for a buffet) and the Guggenheim exhibit at The Venetian (closed for installation of a new exhibit), we FINALLY found a place that would provide a little mental stimulation at the Bellagio.\n\nAt the time I visited they were hosting an Ansel Adams exhibit.  The exhibit itself was nicely put together with good flow and a nice mix of famous and not-so-famous photos.  The audio tour, I'm told, was lifted directly from a famous Adams biography.\n\nThe space is very conducive to art displays - generally circular with several connected but not completely separate spaces, neutral walls and nice high ceilings.  They have an audio tour option which is included with the price of admission.  My only issue (well, besides price, which I've learned to just ignore in Sin City) was with the lighting.  I felt as if the gallery was ever so slightly too dark.  I kept squinting.  And no, that is NOT because I'm cross-eyed.
