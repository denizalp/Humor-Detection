Service was terrible. The prices are great and the quality is decent. But you need more than that for a good store. You'd think with a \"grand reopening\" sign out front they'd have an emphasis on customer service. But the cashier and bagger treated me and my girlfriend so poorly. Suspicious of stealing, treated us like idiots, and I even heard them talking ill of us \"stupid young kids who never bring their own bags.\" Fucking awful, there's a hundred other cheap Mexican markets around and I will drive the extra five minutes. Shoutout to the deli lady though she was nice.
