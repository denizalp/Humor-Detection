Nice, clean, and spacious Korean BBQ place on the strip, open 24 hours! Andrew got the Bulgogi which we chose to cook at our table. The bulgogi was soooo tasty, very tender and perfectly flavored. The meal also came with banchan, which was okay. I liked the cucumbers but found the other vegetables to be too heavily flavored, all in that spicy sauce. Our waitress was really nice and attentive too, and helped us cook the meat properly. I was pleasantly surprised to find good quality food open 24 hours...unlike at Irvine ;)
