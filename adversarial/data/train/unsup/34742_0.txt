Pros: \n- cheap food and drinks\n\nCons:\n- Tired and dirty atmosphere.\n- food is average quality for what you pay\n- very, very slow and indifferent service...most of the times the waitresses and bartenders seem to be talking with friends and ignoring customers. \n- very loud music...especially on karaoke nights \n- low standards attracts a sketchy clientele. \n\nThe Fossil and Haggis used to be a decent place when it first opened. I live around the corner and used to go fairly regularly for wings and a pint. In the last several years the overall quality of food, service and cleanliness has declined. It's gone from a nice British pub to an unwelcoming dive bar. Unfortunately there arent many other options in this area. Best bet is to get some takeout chicken from the Popeyes next door and drink at home.
