It was my first time ordering from this place the Delivery was fast and delivery man was very polite, pizza was hot it was so yummy! I've tryed a lot of pizza places in Las Vegas and heanderson area and this is by far the best pizza place ever! paid $29.00 for 2 large pepperoni pizzas so worth it, it's so flavorful and cheessy great sauce and crust, best part is that it's right down the street from where I live.
