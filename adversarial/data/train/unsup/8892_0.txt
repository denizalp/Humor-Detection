I've been coming to this office for over two years now and I have nothing but good things to say about it. I've seen different dermatologists over the last fifteen years and for me this is the best. This wasn't the first Derm I visited in the area either. I had a horrible experience at a different doctors office (there's a review somewhere for that too) and after that visit I went looking for a different doctor and found this place. I have seen two different Drs here and one Physicians Assistant. Both Drs are Bunimovic Mrs and Mr. All of whom have listened to me and actually carried on a conversation about treatment options. I can tell you this is not the case everywhere. I also like that I can message back and forth with my Doctor. If there's something I have a concern about I can take a picture send an email and I normally get a response within 24 hours. Also when I have had tests done I have received calls from my Dr. Not his nurse or an office person but my actual Doctor. This is a rarity now a days.  I do have to say sometimes you might have to wait a few weeks for an appt but they do have a waiting list you can go on and they'll call you if a place opens up. If it's something you feel is urgent let them know and they will do everything they can to get you in asap. This particular office is more for the medical side of dermatology but they do have another location that focuses more on the cosmetics side of things. If you are like me and need to see a Derm on the regular I cannot recommend this office enough.
