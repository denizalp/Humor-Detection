Ask yourself, does your typical 1 hour massage always feel like a basic \"rub down\"? It sure does for me, it's never consistent and I've tried out many places including big name spas.\n\nI no longer go to the Vegas outlet to just shop.  Every time I'm in pain or due for a quick (15-30) min neck\/shoulder massage, I think of David\/the owner.\n\nDavid is EXTREMELY hands on and knowledgeable of his craft, he is also experienced in many styles of therapy to fix you up and trust me you will feel it!!  Give him 15 mins and you will feel brand new!
