I like to think of myself as an intelligent person, who can express his thoughts well with words.  \n\nBut all that comes to mind about this joint is \"comically bad.\"  \n\nI went with people from my office to this location for lunch.  It took a while for a server to come to our table (the place empty- only one other table of patrons) and it took a while for our drinks to arrive.  \n\nWhat truly made this experience was how long it took for us to get the check.  Our server just walked out.  Like, just walked out.  \n\nOur drinks never got refilled, we never got a \"Hey folks, I'm heading out for a while,\" nothing.  \n\nSo, we try to pay.  We go up to the counter, and say we want to pay.  The girl there just shrugs, yells back, \"COUNTER!\" and walks off.  No one comes from the back.  Someone from our group flags down someone who had on a PH shirt to try to get her to ring us up.\n\nThis girl manages to get our ticket up, and asks for my ID to pay for a $5 pizza with my card.  If I stole a credit card, I would find better things to do with it than buy a small pepperoni from Pizza Hut.  \n\nThe girl tries to ring up the order with my card.  She has to swipe it a number of times.  Then, turns around and walks off.  No explanation.  A woman returns with her, who is giving me seriously dirty looks, and asks to run my card again, that it didn't take before.  \n\nI hand over my card, and think, I can't wait to get to Yelp.
