I will recommend this place to everyone. I was traveling into town for just a couple days; and I had a pesky molar that needed to be taken out the day before Thanksgiving. Even though they weren't able to assist me with the extraction they did everything they could to get me an appointment at their sister dentistry that hour and ensured I had everything I needed to make that appointment a breeze... and it was! I was in and out in 7 minutes; I timed it! And I wasn't even in a rush!\n\nThe ladies were very attentive and kind. Dr. Sharma was really sweet and gentle. Josselyn gave me some awesome tips to help insure my teeth will be beautiful and healthy for a long time!\n\nThank you Rancho Plaza!
