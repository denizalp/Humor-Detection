Took my four little grandsons here this past Thursday, July 11, 2013.   We were all pleasantly surprised to find such a nice, clean, and very well organized store with whatever anyone could be looking for.  It was fantastic.  We could have stayed in there for an hour just browsing.  The prices were right and not overpriced.   We bought three X Box games and they were in mint condition.   When we have more money we will be going back for some Nintendo 64 games.  The staff were very helpful but not pushy whatsoever.  They were very nice and appreciative of our checking their store out.  We will be going back soon without a doubt. It has parking right in the front and easy to find.  The location is close to ASU.   We live in East Mesa but it wasn't too far to drive.  It had a much better selection then the other places we have been to.
