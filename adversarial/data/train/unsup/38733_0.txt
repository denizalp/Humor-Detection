We just got our new RV 10 ft wide gate installed yesterday July 14th and could not be more pleased ! From my initial contact for a quote the staff was awesome to work with,  they came out exactly  when they said. Salesman  Mike who provided the estimate  was professional  and not pushy but the quality  of  product sales itself. They provided  drawings and samples for HOA approval. They also provided  a temporary gate after removal of existing  gate.  The customer  service  throughout  the process including  accomodating us with working around pool construction was impeccable. The craftsmanship  of our gate and the installation  of it was 100 % the definition  of perfection!  I highly and sincerely  recommend Steel  Creations  & Fabrication.
