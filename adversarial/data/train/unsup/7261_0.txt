First of all the food is OK. I think people who haven't experience authentic Mexican food will think this place is awesome but for me it was OK. The staff however is some of the worst ever. Guy took my order and seemed like he did know what I was ordering. Asked for a lunch burrito and got a breakfast burrito. Not the brightest bulbs in the box but what do you expect.
