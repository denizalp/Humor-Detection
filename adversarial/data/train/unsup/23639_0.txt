What a fun adventure right in my Las Vegas backyard. The hike is ranked moderate but I would say that some areas are way more advanced. This could also have something to do with me recovering from back surgery but still.\n\nThe other itself is rocky but relatively flat most of the way. A few steep rock climbs are along the way so I would recommend you bring someone with you, especially if you're a novice. \n\nIt's a bit dry this time of year so head out earlier if you're looking to see some waterfall magic. \n\nThe views are beautiful and the rocks are fun to climb. Enjoy friends!
