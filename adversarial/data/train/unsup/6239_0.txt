We were staying at Stratosphere Hotel and were offered a very good price for the tickets, so decided to try this show.  We didn't have much of an expectation because of the price we paid, but WOW, what a pleasant surprise it was!  The dancers and the musicians were all extremely talented, and we thoroughly enjoyed the show.  No, this is the not the best Vegas show you'll see, but if you get good prices for the tickets, it's worth checking it out.
