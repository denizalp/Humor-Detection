I shared a room with my dad here. the rooms are small and seem even smaller because the windows are small. I was not a fan of the black and white mod decor. The \"door\" to the bathroom is a sliding mirror that does not lock...wtf. Also, the lobby and hallways reeks of a heavy powdery floral scent (carpet cleaner?). The valet attendants, concierge, and other staff members were very nice and helpful.
