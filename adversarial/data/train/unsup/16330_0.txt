October update: officially have to update my review to 5 stars as it being my favourite restaurant for laksa noodle soup. \n\nI would have given the review 4 stars but as of yesterday's visit it has lowered 1 star because we noticed they started to reduce their portion of soup.  Since its opening my family and I have been here about 13 times because it tasted very good.  Markham needed another different noodle customization restaurant aside from Deer Garden.  I loved this restaurant and have been eating their Laksa noodle soup every time that I've visited.\n\nThe staff is friendly but this restaurant can get quite busy especially on Fridays and weekends.  I really like the fried cuttlefish balls (side dish) and five spice chicken wings.\n\nI will be visiting again and hope that they don't continue to reduce their soup portions because sometimes a little goes a long way.  The owner is nice and takes the time to explain if he sees you're new to the restaurant and need a little guiding when ordering.
