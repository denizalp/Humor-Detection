Terrible experience. Told the dude to cut my hair one way and he cut it completely different. The whole time he was cutting my hair he was on the phone and he constantly complained my \"hair was hard to cut\". Even the other barbers in there were looking at cell phones while cutting other peoples hair. Completely unprofessional staff. I'll never go there again and would never recommend to a friend.
