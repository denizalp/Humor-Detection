We had a very positive experience from start to finish.  I called and was quickly connected with their designer who came to my house. She took the time to listen to our needs and was very knowledgable, patient and helpful. Miles Park Window Treatments had a large selection and within an hour I had chosen several options.  They were great about getting me samples, and after we made the final selection the order was placed quickly and efficiently. It was filled quicker than promised and installed by a very prompt, friendly employee. I would absolutely recommend Miles Park Window Treatments!
