This Best Western is on point! They have lightning fast Internet (able to stream FHD Netflix), social hour (free beer), a pool & hot tub, and a solid spread of biscuits n gravy, bacon, sausage, egg, oatmeal for breakfast. Now it is going to be at least 100$ a night on the weekend (not a budget location). \n\nThe rooms are wonderfully clean and smelled very fresh. The water pressure was good and the showers were able to provide ample amounts of heat. There are fridges in the rooms which was quite a relief as some hotels seems to forget how important a fridge is (in my opinion). \n\nThis specific BW pays a fair amount of attention to details. Staff was helpful and friendly with zero issues during my 2-night stay.\n\n I would recommend it! Hit that thumbs up button if the information I provided was useful!
