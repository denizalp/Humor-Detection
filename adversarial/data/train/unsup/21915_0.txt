This time of year my allergies start to kick in.  I don't know if it's because of the extreme change of temperature.  You know, walking into an air-conditioned place from 110 degree weather.  Whatever the case may be, I needed to pick up some over the counter medication to combat my allergies.  So, here is my simple and quick experience to this Walgreens.\n\nI had a Walgreens gift card, which was given to me on Christmas.  So, why not use it?  I got a bottle of Antihistamine and some Vaporub.  \n\n*Side note: Vaporub is awesome! Cleared up my sinuses and helped relieve my chest.\n\nAnywho! I don't think I said one word to anyone while I found my items.  Checked out at the counter and nodded to the woman at the register, after she asked me if I found everything alright.  \n\nSo, in and out, back home... rubbed on Vaprub, took pills and went to bed.  Good Stuff!
