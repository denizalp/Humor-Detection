Venetian is pretty amazing with their quality layout, design and housing my favorite Las Vegas restaurant, Bouchon.  The shopping area is similar to Paris and the Ceasar's Forum with the faux sky, but what sets this place apart is the indoor\\outdoor gondolas rides.\nI really enjoyed it, although it can be a little awkward with all those damn tourists taking pictures of you while you are chillin' during your 15min ride.  It cuts into your wallet with $15 per person price tag.  Do it for your lady!
