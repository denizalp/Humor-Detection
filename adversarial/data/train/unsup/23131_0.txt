The BEST place to rent in the SW Las Vegas area! Overnight security, gated and QUIET community. The leasing staff is very courteous, fast and efficient (especially the Assistant Manager)! I've been living in Vegas for years, this is by far the BEST apartment complex to live at. Not to mention how close and convenient EVERYTHING is! =0
