Location is 5*. Plus not busy compared to the Tim Hortons next door making it pretty underrated! Got the Bougatsa (custard filled phyllo pastry) and a spanakopita (spinach filled pastry). They were both pretty good, but not the best I've had. The bougatsa was dry, when I usually eat it, it's topped with a syrup. Didn't bother to go back and ask for it. \n\nOh and they take Debit or Cash only
