Overall Love these restaurants, I have food allergies and they have always been great to accommodate in delivering a safe meal for me. The fact they have a food ingredient book makes life a lot easier and gives you a piece of mind when ordering; knowing exactly what is in the dish.\n\nThe Queen location is quite noisy in the winter time but its been basically sold out anytime I have gone to be a guest. I do enjoy the Fresh restaurants a lot, especially in the summer the patio on Queen is amazing. Especially if you want a romantic touch, take a stroll through Trinity Bellwood's park afterward!\n\n The food at either restaurants has always been amazing for my girlfriend and me, never had a major issue with the food. The icing on the cake for me has been their Almond milk latté, as it is one of the best lattés I have ever had. I usually have or even two whenever I go to eat there.\n\nOverall I think everyone should give Fresh a chance, even the carnivores out there!!! I love meat just as much as the next carnivore, however balance is everything, not every meal has to have a 12oz prime rib, or we would all live a short life!
