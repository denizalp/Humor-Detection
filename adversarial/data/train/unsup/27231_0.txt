We stumbled into this place by accident (and I'd say we lucked out) while wandering in Old Montreal this weekend.  \n\nWe were looking for a dessert spot, and despite our being somewhat underdressed, without a reservation, they welcomed us to sit at the bar for dessert.  We had the chocolate club sandwich (served with a melon salad and some amazing \"pineapple fries\"), and the hazelnut-praline and chocolate mille-feuille, caramel with salt butter glaze and another on with lemon .  Both were excellent, and the bartender was quite friendly as well.  \n\nOur only complaint is with the fake candlelight effect that they have going on with the bar lighting.  It worked for the insets behind the bar, but the flickers in the overhead track lighting were a bit distracting. \n\nThe dinner menu looks to be pricy, but if the desserts were any indication, it's probably worth a splurge!
