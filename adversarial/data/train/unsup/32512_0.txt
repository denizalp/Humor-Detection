I have stayed at THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay at least four times in the last six months. Usually the experience as been a positive one, no noise, non gaming hotel, without the smoking odor that many hotels have. However my recent stay was horrible. The express checkout through my mobile app did not show my actual bill, I was hung up on three times attempting to check out and then told I was checked out and my bill would be emailed to me.\n\nAfter twelve hours and still no bill, I called THE Hotel and spoke to a man who was reading the bill information to me and my concern immediately skyrocketed because there were charges that were not mine...then he called me by the wrong name and realized he was reading a different customer's bill.\n\nLastly, the bill he emailed me did not have my dining charges removed (as I had a $75 resort credit). I explained this and he updated the bill immediately but said the charges were already processed on my credit card and the credit issues would not appear for two to three weeks!\n\nI cannot say how simply horrible the entire customer service experience was during this recent stay. I am in Vegas frequently for business and have decided to NEVER stay at this hotel again. I have booked at a NON MGM property (The Encore) for my next trip and hopefully it will be the start of many repeat stays.\n\nTHE Hotel...you lost a very loyal customer...and I would not recommend it to a coworker or friend.
