UPDATE: my piercing nearly got infected because the piercer used a bar that was too short during the healing process!! Made it super painful as the cartlidge swelled after piercing.. went to malefic tattoos down the street to get to check up and changed it to a ring.\n\nIve been to many piercers around sauga and I wouldn't recommend skintricate. Here's what happened..\n\nI called into skintricate first to make sure the piercer is in and we could do a walk-in, the reception would only give a yes or no answer and after speaking to him once and phoning him again he never answered. \n\nI went here to get my cartridge pierced by a lady I presume is Anna.\n\n-the place felt like a mess, and not an organized mess either. There was half eaten food on the counter, dirty dishes and dirty mop buckets with cleaning water still in it next to us.\n\n-we walked in and walked out with Anna using the same gloves THE ENTIRE TIME, she'd touch jackets, hair, chair, open drawers close drawers, and everything with the same gloves.  Which should be changed throughout the whole process.\n\n-upon letting her know i wanted a cartlidge piercing repierced, she said it was 'fucked up' area to get pierced at the cartridge (but legit located where the industrial piercing is) and then assumed I got it done by a piercing gun (which I didn't, it was by needle proffesionally but unfortunately closed up after time) \n\n-She marked where the piercing would go, but then pierced it off the mark.\n\n-i listened to her and instead of getting the curve done and pierced straight through my cartridge flat side. So it ended up swelling a lot.\n\n-she did NOT even go through what size the needle she was using\n\n- the whole thing took less then 10 minutes, it felt completely rushed and it was pretty apparent that she was bored or tired of answering the same questions.\n\nWhat shocked me the most was hygiene, most piercers would disinfect chairs, wash hands wear gloves in front of you and would regularly change them. Even a cartridge piercing would require more than just one cotton ball and a needle. \n\nI wouldn't reccomend skintricate, to  others.
