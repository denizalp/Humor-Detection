This Harkins holds a special place in my heart because I've been seeing movies here since way before Tim Allen put on the Santa suit and became papa to a North Pole full of elves. When visiting AZ as a kid, we would stay in Old Town and there were plenty of times that I would visit the movie theater for an afternoon matinee. Something about this theater makes me happy and the smell of popcorn lingering through the mall adds to its charm. This is a movie theater without thrills so don't come here expecting the dine-in experience that's so popular or trendy treats. Here you will get movie theater seating, buttery and delicious pop corn and sweets like gummy bears and sour patch kids. If you ask me, you don't need much else in a movie theater!
