This dining experience brought us back to nights in Italy; truly a diamond in the rough experience. We were asked upon entering if we preferred to eat indoors or out -the indoors looked inviting and warm but as soon as we saw the tree and hanging light lined patio the choice was immediate (would not have been so much if the option had been outdoors overlooking the parking lot where some guests were seated). \n\nAfter being seated, our waitstaff was friendly and attentive, pointing out we could either opt for the paired wine option with our meals or choose from the wine\/cocktail list which all four members of my party selected to do.  All selections, except the main course - which consisted of  meat, seafood or pasta -were pre-set and did not disappoint in the least although my friend's husband felt the butternut-squash ginger soup - with maple glazed prosciutto garnished with pumpkin seeds - was a bit on the sweet side.  This was followed by a locally produced arugula and beet salad with blue cheese and plum prior to our main courses. Our companions devoured their seafood selections and my husband and I our filet mignon, cooked to perfection medium-rare as ordered.  The meal was topped off by dark rum cake with toasted pecan butterscotch, just the right proportion.  We'd have liked to have been offered beverages to accompany dessert, however, once we asked our waiter for our choices they were promptly delivered although my first pot of tea was lukewarm and had to be replaced, with a reminder to bring a fresh cup.  Still, such an oversight did not detract from our overall enjoyment of the evening. If not for the rather high price of the evening, we'd be back sooner rather than later -- but we will definitely return.
