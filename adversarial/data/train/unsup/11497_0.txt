Get very close...  I am going to tell you a secret.  A great Oakmont secret.  The bakery has the best, freshest, fastest breakfast sandwiches in the city.   I know that you are thinking \"there are so many more things to talk about, donuts, bagels, cookies, etc\"  No, I am serious.  You can build your own on a kiosk that puts other touch screen ordering to shame.  There are so many options, , breads, bagels, meats, cheeses, condiments, vegetables.  Then you are given more options to add extra meats, cheeses, condiments, vegetables.  Sandwiches are so fresh all the time.  \n\nExtra added bonus secret... You pay in the fast pass line, so you miss the hub bub of the bakery patrons.  I was there today Saturday about 8:30:  30 plus people in the bakery line.  Sandwiches and specialty coffees in less than 10 minutes.  Devoured in less than 10 minutes.
