Went in not expecting much; the decor is kind of typical Japanese. So when they brought out elegant dishes of great modern Japanese food I was impressed.\n\nWe started with a Kaiso Salad and Sushi Pizza. Both were good. The Sushi Pizza was a tad oily, but I think I'm saying that only to criticize something.\n\nFor rolls, we had the Sky Dome and the Volcano Roll, which looked like an erupted volcano on the plate -- covered with the minced tuna\/yam filling. The Sky Dome roll was a really nice mix of sweet and savory with tempura'd shrimp and japanese pickles. \n\nThe portions of everything were pretty generous and were great at decorating dishes, which I'm curious to see if they can keep up as it gets busier.\n\nBest part about the night: the staff uniform is miniskirts!\n(Really, who wears miniskirts?)
