This salon is one of the best in the valley. From the hairdressers to the nail techs to the massage therapists - all top notch!\n\nNail techs Sandy, Angie, Lorrie, and Wendy are some of the best you'll ever work with. The price is right too. When comparison shopping, be sure to compare apples to apples. These ladies do SO much more in their pedicures for a \"regular fee\" than most places would ever think of. The last place I went charged extra for a citrus scrub or a masque for your foot (wrapped in a hot towel), or a special nail design. Not these ladies!  It's all included. They are efficient, but never rushed. That means they booked plenty of time for you. This place is like a big family. They treat each other and you with respect. Going the extra mile is the rule rather than the exception here. My nail tech, Sandy, has worked on Sundays, has stayed late in the evening (8:30 and 9:30), and has even offered to drive me home once. (I was her last client.). She has squeezed me in for emergency repairs on numerous occasions.  Their generosity to  clients and their support to the community is well known.  When you're here, you're family.
