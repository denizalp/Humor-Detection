I am in love with 'Pomo Pizzeria! They had me at \"Ciao!\"...\n\nI love this place, cause for a moment in time-- I get transported back to Italy. Everything is authentically Italian. Certified Italian -- the only restaurant in the entire state of AZ that has been through the rigorous requirements to be certified Napoletana. As others have mentioned, the 6,000lb pizza oven is even from Italy. The quality ingredients in their plates -- all imported. Even chitter chatter in the restaurant -- in Italian - l'amo. \n\nFor Valentine's Day, I surprised my hubby with a dinner date here. I knew that he would fall smitten in love with their autentico Napolitano blistered-crust pizza. \n\nFortunately, I found this place the week earler - as a referral from an esthetician. When I dined here the first time solo, I had wonderful and friendly service dining in the bar area. \n\nI loved hearing the cooks & service staff speaking in Italian. I enjoyed the small, cozy atmosphere of the tables. I loved the wall mural of the Italian street scene complete with Vespa (minus the real toxic exhaust fumes). Yes, I fell in love with this restaurant my first visit. \n\nEnter Valentine's Day -- the restaurant was filled, and our reserved table was waiting for us. Again, love the atmosphere here. All servers were friendly and very hospitable. \n\nWe kicked off the night with a bottle of Soave - -  Tedeschi, I believe. Very good... light, white wine with some flavor. \n\nFor starters we had the Caprese - - lovely buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, and also some sliced bread drizzled with EVOO. Delish! I requested extra of the OO with the red peppers... very tasty to dip with. \n\nThen on to the pizza - - we tried the Don Alfonso this time. It was very good -- however, I think the pizza I had the first time was even better. (I can't remember the name.... uggh! ... but it had prosciutto, salami creminilli (which was off the hook!), and a bunch of other meats for $16.95.  Next time we go back, I'm getting that kind again. \n\nDolce... of course! Due espresso, another sweet wine for me (forgot the name - - but it was good.) Not too overly sweet....  But the Tiramisu! Si, the Tiramisu -- was as delicious and divine as I was hoping it would be. My husband is not a big Tiramisu fan, but he said that it was probably the best he's had. Dusting of cocoa powder on top, moussy layer after layer -- love their Tiramisu!\n\nIt was a great evening -- great food -- great service! No brainer that we'll be back. \n\nVa bene!
