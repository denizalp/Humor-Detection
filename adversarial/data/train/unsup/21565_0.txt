Hyde is a cool bar and lounge that even a crabby, old, club-hating guy like me can enjoy. They brought out the big guns to design the interior. Philippe Starck, the firm that did Bazaar and Katsuya in LA, did a wonderful job creating an intimate, inviting, and sexy atmosphere. Plus, you can't go wrong with a patio that overlooks the Bellagio fountains.\n\nBetween 5 and 10 it's a lounge. There were several places to sit, chill and grab a drink. The specialty cocktails are $18 (it is the Bellagio afterall so you know it isn't gonna be cheap) and the three I tried were all amazing. Their version of a Moscow Mule was the best of the bunch.\n\nAt 10 the place turns into a club -- DJ, table service, etc, etc. But, there's actually room to dance and walk around, unlike other clubs. The specialty cocktail menu goes bye bye, but the bartenders will be somewhat happy to make whatever you want. The waitresses are all hot and wear freaky masks (think V for Vendetta... or maybe that changes nightly?). It makes for a good show.
