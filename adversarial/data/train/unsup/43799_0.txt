I am so glad I found this place!  Yes, it is a warehouse style - however, I know what I'm there to get...and that is HAIR (and makeup).  They are super friendly and helpful - they even remember me when I walk in.  Huge selection of lace front wigs at great prices - I've bought about 4 in the past couple months, right around $40\/each.  I also bought more clip in extensions - 18\" for $80 a pack.  They are nice enough to let you feel the hair from the pack before you commit and explain the different brands and quality.  I know I am getting a great deal whenever I come here.  Plus, they have a large supply of NYX makeup!  This is my one stop beauty shop!  I love that they are family owned and know their customers by name.
