Great late night option for pizza.  I was visiting the area and wanted some pizza late at night.   I ordered a small pepperoni and mushroom pizza.   I phoned Tom's House of pizza and ordered a small for $11.30.   I was literally in shock when I saw how small the pizza was.......I live in the states and its the size of a pizza we call \"personal.\"    A pizza this size would run $6 in the states.  I was absolutely shocked at the price for the pizza.  I gobbled the pizza in no time flat.  I'm finding everything here in Calgary is expensive though.  It's REALLY expensive but they do do pizza and do it well.
