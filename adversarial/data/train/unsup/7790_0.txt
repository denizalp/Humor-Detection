Never thought I would review a golf tournament or a golf hole, for that matter.  Oh, where to begin?  I know....\n\nI attended the Phoenix Open a couple of weeks ago. My perspective is not that of a person who plays golf or even a spectator!  My perspective is that of a reveler.  I went to the open with no intentions of seeing a single ball hit or a golfer play.  Some guy named Phil Michelson was there, but what did I care.  (I know who Phil M is.  But what about that Tiger Woods guy?)   I had my cocktails, my prime seat and all the drunk revelers to watch.  Needless to say, I had fun despite it being rained out this year.\n\nFor the sheer size and volume of people, this event is well organized.  The event planner did a great job moving a few 100,000 people in and out of the course over the week long tournament.\n\nTips for the ladies:\n1. Wear heels at your own risk.\n2. Don't bring a big arse purse.  You can't take it in the tourney.  You will have to leave it in your car.  If you have a small clear purse, use that.\n3. Wear sunblock\n4. Look nice.  Dress comfortably cute.   \n5. Get a pass into somewhere.  \n\nMy return factor: 100%
