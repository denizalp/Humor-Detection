We were on our way back from a trip to Mexico and Cuba* when we arrived here for a short layover. This airport is easy to navigate, especially when you are coming through immigration -- there are lots of signs telling you exactly where to go. \n\nThere was a long line at immigration but it moved fairly quickly. My honey and I had all of our research license paperwork in order for the Cuba portion of our travels in case we were asked for it** but the not-even-a-hello immigration officer guy just scanned our passports, looked at us with his best stern face, and stamped us on our way. We then picked up our checked suitcases, zoomed right through customs (after handing over our customs form) and rechecked our bags. \n\nThe part that ended up taking the longest amount of time was going back through security, thanks to long lines. I do have to say that the security personnel were working very hard to move everyone along and were really nice as well.\n\nIf we had more than 5 minutes to spare, I would have picked up some local BBQ to eat on our San Francisco bound flight. Thanks a lot, security line. \n\n*You won't hear much more about our trip to Mexico and Cuba since they don't have Yelp. (At least not yet.) I'll just summarize to say that almost everywhere we slept, ate, drank, visited, etc. were unquestionably five star. \n\n** Apparently Beyonce and Jay Z did as well. http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2013\/04\/09\/entertainment-us-usa-cuba-beyonce-idUSBRE93600V20130409
