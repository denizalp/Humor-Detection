As far as bar food goes, Winking Lizard has one of the better menus. There is a great variety and the quality of the food is better than you'd expect for a sports bar at a reasonable price. My favorite is the white pizza--I think it's better than some of the pizza joints around. The beer list is extensive--enjoy trying new drinks every time you go! And if you are an avid beer drinker, you should sign up for the world tour of beers so you can win lizard swag and go to the tour party at the end of the year.\nBe forewarned, the service can be a little slow at times and tables a little packed, especially on game days. Monday and Tuesday are wing nights, a pretty good deal for pretty good wings (but no doggy bags). Overall, a pretty solid choice for a pre-game dinner, small group dinner, or just catching up for drinks.
