First time we checked this place and we have an hour before they close. Long line at the door. Took us almost 40 minutes to get to the cashier to do our orders. I give four stars because the drinks are yummy. Plus We understand they're newly opened. \n\nMy only complain is that they make drinks\/orders not in order. We were numbers 50-53. The people who ordered after us got their orders first before us.
