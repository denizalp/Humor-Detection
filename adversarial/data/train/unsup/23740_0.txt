found a cockroach crawling on my room table while eating.\n\nafter a LONG wait and hassle of misscommunications waiting in the room, i finally had to go to the front desk to get my room switched.  Then that room had a very loud annoying sound the whole night from the lights outside.\nThe only thing they offered me was a 2 for 1 buffet ticket for this whole debacle.\n\nNever again will i stay at circus circus. \nAnd i will write reviews for every review website i know of, and this is my first time writing a review.
