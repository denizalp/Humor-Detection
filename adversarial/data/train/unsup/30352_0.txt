Worst service I've had in a very long time. It started with an argument with my friend that he's not allowed to put a lemon in his beer because it will \"ruin the glass\". We moved upstairs to the patio. Waitress forgot my drink. Which is fine, it happens from time to time. But then also forgot my fries for like an hour and a half. And then proceeded to give me stink eye for the duration of my stay. Wait. What? You're mad at ME because you forgot my order??!? Find a new line of work. Gave them a 2 because the fries were good and the other server was nice.
