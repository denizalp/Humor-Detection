Always changing up their beers which are brewed on site.  By always, I mean always.  Each time something new is on offer.   Some are wickedly strong (such as cockpuncher) and many are seasonal appearing only briefly.  It's fun to get a flight of different offerings to match whatever they happen to have on tap.  The food is decent but you come for the beer.
