Im one of those guys that made it in Manhattan. As a young man I pounded that pavement and made every dollar doing honest hard work. I enjoyed Carnegie Deli pastrami countless times. After moving away to Central Florida I miss my beloved pastrami on rye. Nobody here makes it even close. \n\nSo now im in Vegas and they ha e a satellite location in the Casino. I ordered the sandwich and root beer, then took a seat. My friendly server brought me a sandwich which looked and tasted just like home.\n\nEureka!!!!!!!! We've struck pastrami gold!
