Some of the better rock and roll songs pay homage to women. Jenny, Jenny, Valerie, Roxanne, etc.  It may be time to pen a classic after Gina in the Target Optical Center at Lake Pleasant and Happy Valley Road.\n\nWhile the name above the door may say Target, the Optical Center is sub-leased by one of the world's largest optical providers, Luxottica.  Luxottica also owns Lens Crafters, Sun Glasses Hut and some of the most famous brands such as Ray Ban, Oakley, Persol, Coach, Chanel, and at least another dozen high end brands, most of which are available at Target. \n\nThe Princess and I had some extra money left over in the HSA account and needed to get our annual eye exam and glasses taken care of.  The embedded Optician gladly took our insurance (Avesis) and we moved to the next step of picking out glasses.\n\nThis is where Gina comes back into the picture.  She was an absolute gem to deal with.  Complete pro and got our four sets of glasses (gotta have sunglasses in Phoenix, right?) done quickly and accurately.  The best part? The glasses were done a couple of days later.  After a lifetime of glasses, contacts, Lasik, et al, this was hands down the best experience I've ever had getting new glasses.  Already looking forward to next year!
