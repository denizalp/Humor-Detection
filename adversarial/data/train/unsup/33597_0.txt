The Bear has great breakfast and a typical Diner environment. The food is very consistent every time I visit.  They keep it clean and the staff is usually very nice.  If you wanna get breakfast on the weekend get there early or your going to wait a little while for a table.  They don't have enough parking so you might end up parking at the hotel that shares the lot with the BB.  I go for breakfast mostly but I have had some good dinners there as well.
