I've wanted to buy a home in the Las Vegas area for a very long time but since I lived in another state it made it difficult. Every time I saw a house I liked online it already had an offer on it. One day Rod Blake from the Ballen Group contacted me and asked if he could help me find a home and I said yes, I would love that and he connected me with a wonderful mortgage broker to get things going. A couple of weeks later I saw a brand new listing of a home in Henderson with a gorgeous pool and great city and mountain views and knew if I wanted it I had to make an offer right away. Since I was still in California I wasn't sure how to make an offer  sight unseen, long distance so I called Rod Blake and he said no problem and helped me make the offer that day and the next day it was accepted! There were a few issues along the way which Rod handled very professionally. Today I'm enjoying my new beautiful home, pool and the gorgeous views of the Las Vegas valley and I don't think I'd be here without Rod's help. I highly recommend the Ballen Group and Rod Blake if you want to buy a home in the Las Vegas area.
