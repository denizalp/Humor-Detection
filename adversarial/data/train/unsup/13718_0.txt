Its really no wonder why this restaurant has such high rating... Everything from start to finish was superb. \n\nI called at 6:30 pm for a reservations, the guy who answered said they were fully booked and I inquired about walkins and he was honest and advised it was a small restaurant but there might be something available around 9:30. So he took my name and number. Around 8:30 he called back to say someone canceled and there's a table reserved for us. I know to some this might not seem like a big deal, but quite often the person on the other end of the phone lacks customer service. \n\nWe got there, ample parking in the back. Its easy to miss amongst all the other businesses on main street but a simple u-turn solves that issue.\n\nThe food... My oh my...\n\nI got the udon carbonara. Creamy and delicious. Lots of mushrooms and sausage. Plus beef. It came with an egg. It arrived at the table steaming hot, but i really couldn't wait. It smelt so good, I had to dig in. A few burns later, some mishaps of noodles on my face. It was a large portion and I'm still stuffed 3 hours later. \n\nDave got  the INSP burger. The burger was cooked to medium. Fried egg on top and what to me sets it apart from the rest, the pork belly. He ordered it with a side of duck confit frites. Everything was served on a wooden board. I asked him for his review, he said really good. \nDuring dinner we planned our next visit, so that means we really did enjoy the food.\n\nThe bill came to $50 including tax and tip.  It bad for low key, don't want to go Downtown kinda Saturday night.
