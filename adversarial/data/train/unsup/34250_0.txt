I didn't know that most places are closed on Sunday in town, I think there was only 3 places open for breakfast, the first one had a line so I tried this one but still had maybe a 20 minute wait to get in. The servers were fairly attentive but it was busy so they were going all out. Food was OK, nothing special, I was just glad to get breakfast before noon.
