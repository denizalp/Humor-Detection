I'm a big fan for the Original with white boba. I have tried pretty much everything from the creamy menu, and I love mostly all of them. However, Matchacha is not my taste. The Enchanted Chai is also good. Staff are amazing with outstanding customer service. By far this place is the most favorite boba stop for me, even better than my stop shops in Socal.
