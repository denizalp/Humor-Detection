This was a stupid show. I can't believe people rave about it but okay. It has its funny moments but I'm talking about a few cute\/silly moments but nothing extravagant. I wouldn't waste my money on this if I had to give a recommendation to someone\n. I personally couldn't wait for the show to be over. Disclaimers: I was super sober and I'm also a difficult person to impress and entertain.  So if you're skeptical, give it a try and review for yourself.
