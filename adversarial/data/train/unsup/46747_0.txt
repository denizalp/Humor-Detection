Scheduled a repair appointment with Ace through American Home Shield for warranty work on my dishwasher.  Took a half day off work to accommodate the repair window.\n\n15 minutes into my repair time a very rude woman calls me to say that \"a van broke down\" and that they don't know if they will make it on time, they will get there as fast as they can.\n\n6 hours later, no repair person, no phone call. Calls to their number were answered by voice mail.  I have now left 4 messages and have not had my calls returned.\n\nNever again.
