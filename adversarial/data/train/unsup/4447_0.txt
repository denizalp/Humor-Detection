Equal parts old-fashioned soda shop, restaurant, bar, and hangout. The location is absolutely crucial here. Located in one of the more walkable parts of South End, Pike's is a gem with a hefty menu complete with plenty of sweets and southern treats.\n\nHaven't been to Pike's in quite some time and this was my first go for lunch. Decided to dine al fresco and enjoyed every second of it. This time 'round, didn't go for anything on the sweet side of things, but rather went for the lunch menu solely. \n\nStarted with the mozzarella sticks. Both myself and my dining counterpart were shocked that they weren't the \"out of the bag\" variety. These appeared to be hand breaded with a higher quality cheese than typically served. Marinara was standard, but the mozz sticks themselves were great. They also weren't covered with the typical panko, moon dust, crappy breading like usual.\n\nWent with the buffalo chicken sandwich for my entree. Holy craaaaaap. Ditch the bun, eat a few of the house-made chips, and enjoy the chicken. Not only is this sucker lightly breaded and flavored well with the buffalo sauce, it's straight up baptized in the sauce. Swimming, rather. I'm usually not for a pool of sauce, but this stuff was fantastic. It acted as a nice residual dipping sauce for the remaining chips. \n\nService was friendly, outside was perfect for the present weather, prices are fair, walkability is always a plus. Find a parking space along Camden or near Atherton and you're good to go.
