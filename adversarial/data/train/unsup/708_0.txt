Before I jump in to this greasy spoon review, I need to warn you... There is nothing nice about this place. It's a bit grimy, very old school and nothing even close to fancy. I, however, have a huge soft spot for places like this. You have to hand it to Zupa, they're holding strong in one of the priciest hoods in town, doling out cheap lunches daily.\n\nI had the poutine (a sloppy salt pile, gross but I loved it) and a greek salad (decent). My baby daddy who works nearby had the club sandwich. He loved his club so much he's been back since for one. He, too, has a soft spot for weird, greasy spoons.
