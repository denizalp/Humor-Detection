Good Lord this place is fantastic!\n\nIf you've had poke before, then don't bother reading the reviews, go get some!\n\nIf you're on the fence about trying poke from here, don't be. Drive over, swing in and try the samples. They'll let you sample anything prior to buying it. Best of all, when they run out, they run out. No lowering quality just to make a buck. They seem to keep a high level of quality control.\n\nI've gotten poke from here any time I'm in the area. I've never gotten a bad order or have been disappointed. They've even helped me pack an order for my family to transport to Colorado. Very good service.\n\nOkay, is this place like eating in Hawaii? No. You're in Las Vegas. Surrounded by deserts. Tuna has to be sent here frozen, so taste will drop. That's not to say this place isn't tasty, because it is. Just realize that the negative reviews may be placing unrealistic standards.\n\nBottom line is to go here and try the poke for yourself. It's good!
