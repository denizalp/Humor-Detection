As a Bluegreen share holder, this is was the first time I visited this particular Bluegreen resort. \n\nWe stayed here a total of 5 days and 4 nights. We never visited Las Vegas before, and figured what the heck, have a timeshare there, might as well check it out.\n\nI'll lay it out easy, and this is all subjective.\n\nLocation,\n-----\nThis is NOT on the strip. You will need to use a taxi daily, or rent a car like we did. My wife and I were aren't old, and still spry, but unless you want to walk a round trip from center of the strip of 6 miles daily, then you'll want to figure out transportation otherwise. \n\nThey do offer a shuttle, the times are a little silly, and I've heard not reliable.. so be wary of that. \n\nOther than that, if you plan to go beyond the strip, the location isn't bad.. close the airport and major highways.\n\nAppearance\n-----\nClub itself looks sharp at night. It seems to be in the middle of what appears to be leveled land for future development. \n\nThe lobby is no Wynn or Bellagio, but it's functional. \n\nWe had a small studio which fit us just fine. Decent bedroom, little living area and kitchen. Full size fridge and everything. \n\nThe choice in style is not my type, but it's not appalling. \n\nAmenities and staff\n----\nThey have a decent gym and pool. But it's also very awkwardly spaced out. The main elevators are a pretty good long walk from the hotel check in desk. The gym is on the 2nd floor... and the pool is on the 4th located all the way south in the hotel. \n\nSo getting around to those location doesn't even seem worth it if you're not near it. \n\nThey do have some shops located in the hotel and access from outside. The ABC store is pretty nice, and one of the highlights of this place. There's a decent pizza place, subway and some future spots. \n\nThere seemed to be a coffee place also, but we never went there.\n\nStaff was ok. Nothing out of the normal. Didn't feel they went above and beyond courtesy. Most of the time the morning staff appeared half asleep. So wasn't too impressed.\n\nThis is a Bluegreen resort, so if you're not already a timeshare holder, be forewarn of the sales tactics, the meetings they'll want you to attend and blah blah. If you're already going to blow it off, just try to deal the best you can, and get your free crap and go. \n\nI have nothing bad to say about Bluegreen, thats for another review though. keep to the hotel.\n\nSummary\n----\nIn the end.... like my review probably shows.. the place was just really... blahh... at best. The location is weird for walking to the strip, the hotel was decorated half arse in my opinion, staff was ehhh... unless you plan to buy something, then those guys were all perky and happy. The room was decent, but left something to be desired. \n\nThe area was ok, unless you were walking around at night. That close access to the airport leaves a lot of stray bums. The hotel patrons themselves, unless it was just the weekend we went, seemed to be filled with a bunch of hoodlums and rednecks. But maybe I'm just a bastard snob, haha.\n\nIn the end, if you're a bluegreen club owner, then this a decent place to have access to Vegas, other than that.. save your money and probably go elsewhere, unless you got it as a free trip for the timeshare meeting.
