We come here often for happy hour and today we ordered potato skins which were cold in the middle.  We told them this and they took them away and a few minutes later they bring the SAME ones back as the half eaten one was still there.\n\nMy friend immediately went to the manager as this was unacceptable and there was cheese dripping out of the one which could have touched anything.. VERY unsanitary!  The manager then stated she would get fresh ones out right away.\n\nWhen we asked for the check we asked if they are taking the skins off for us and the new bartender said \"I'll get the manager to come talk to you about this.\"  As a manager myself that is the worst thing a guest can hear.  After having to send our food back twice I think the last thing they can do is remove the charge for this item.  The manager finally came over and said \"oh yes I was going to take these off I was just going to tell you\".\n\nProbably won't be back..
