'Tis the Teason for boba and tea in the Hendo hood!  Teason is the latest boba tea to open up here in Henderson! There's this one Yelper (looking at you Chris V) whose been lamenting for years.. well there you go, boba here and there and another shop coming soon! \n \nOK the positives:\nmade to order - check \nfresh fruit - check\nopen late - check (open til 11pm)\nunder $4 - check \nrewards program! 10 credits earn 1 free drink! \n\nThey win in best boba pearls so far... Soft, smooth, chewy... the other wanna-be Coffee now Boba house too place take note! \n\nLove the portability of their containers. The capped plastic bottles make it easier to take it to-go, or pack it in your lunch\/ gym bag.\n\nMy fave, their Taro Slushie.. Mr B. likes their mango.....it's not all fresh fruit ..Telling sign was separation of the fluid.. all good though! \n\n3.95 across the board for all drinks... add on xtra charge... the days we went had specials though. ie 2 free add on and 10% off Yelp... and BOGO Weekend... so check their IG for specials. \n\n\nNEGS\nStill not as blended as they should be.. sippin on bits of ice. \n\nCould be made a lil more quicker.. luckily the times we went there were only one person ahead of us.. if it's busier, you might run into problems. \n\nLOCATION \nWarm Springs \/Arroyo Grande across from Green Valley High School. Some may be familiar when this place was 808 Island Craves where Rudy use to fry up them malasadas in front while we look out for HFD.. lol \n\nSo there's your unsolicited review from another local.
