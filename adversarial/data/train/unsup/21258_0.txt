Popped in after a visit to the Magical Forest and enjoyed a couple drinks while chilling in this hip boba \/ Thai food spot. We tried a Thai tea with honey boba 4\/5 and a mango peach smoothie with honey boba 4\/5. \n\nInteresting that they had Bill Nye the Science Guy playing on the TV and enjoyed watching a few episodes. Hilarious and surprised he was still on TV and had a show , I remember watching him for school papers back in the day. \n\nGood drinks and cool spot with a couple couches and plenty of seating. They also have some board games you can play. Allison was a nice server and very helpful.
