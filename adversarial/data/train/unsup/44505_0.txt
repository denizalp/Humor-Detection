I love this style of pizza and I think they do a great job making it. I will say though that the pistachio pizza was incredibly over-salted. \n\nI give them three stars for ambience. There's a lot of underutilized space. The lovely brick wall is not emphasized at all. They're currently using their dining area as storage space. The lighting is very, very bright.
