This place was recommended to me by a friend, I had never been but have always wanted to go, I had driven by 100 times and seen a ton of people on the outdoor patio and I love a good burger, and this place supposedly has one of the best in the country...\"The Ivan\" $13.00...to say the least I was not impressed. I have had better burgers at pretty much every other place around here, OHSO, Delux, Christ even the Chicago hamburger company down the streets sliders tasted better as far as I am concerned. Myself and my gf came on a Sunday afternoon, as I was walking up the stairs I stepped in a huge piece of fresh gum, obviously some uncultured swine that had just frequented the place must of spit this out, to say the least it was pretty gross, it took a minute to scrape off the bottom of my shoe, and was not the best start to my experience...we walked in and the bar was moderately busy... and all the tables were taken, I am not sure if there is suppose to be a hostess, there was no one around so we decided to seat our selves on the patio, to what seemed to be dismay of our server. She was horrible. Dulce. Poor attitude and not very friendly. Had to get up to ask for drink refills, also seemed like there was a huge issue with asking to turn the misters on outside, they turned them on and then a few minutes later turned them off, where I had to ask to turn them back on again it was just over 100 outside.  It took forever for our food to come out. On appearance alone the Ivan which probably stands close to 6 inches high looks pretty impressive, but taste wise...I was really not impressed. My Gf had the same thing...she too was not impressed, and she did not finish hers. The fries were mediocre...and as I said in general so was this experience here. Probably will never go back.
