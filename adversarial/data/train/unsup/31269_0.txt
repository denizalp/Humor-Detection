On vacation, I wanted to get a quick tattoo as a commemoration of my trip.  I'm pretty covered, so if I'm not in the process of a big tattoo, the only things I can get  done are small, fill-in pieces.  \n\nI wrote to them on Facebook prior to the shop opening that day and received a quick response.  They had time right as the shop opened and Tanner worked on my arm.  He was cool, did a good job on my piece, and didn't seem to have any problem at all with my early drop-in (some artists do exude attitude over these types of things, but Tanner was great).  \n\nI'll be back, as my family has a house in Scottsdale and I plan on coming back often.  Thanks guys!
