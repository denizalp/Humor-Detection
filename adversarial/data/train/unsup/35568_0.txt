Let me just tell you a little story. \n\nThis past Saturday, we planned a double date with our friends. They made a 5:15 reservation for all of us. Due to some scheduling conflicts, they arrived at 5:15 and we couldn't get there until 6. In the meantime, they ordered drinks and appetizers. As soon as we arrived, we order more drinks, dinner...everything was great. \n\nAround 7:15, dinner was winding down and we were looking at the dessert menu when a manager came over and informed us we had five more minutes at our table. Apparently, another party of four was there with a reservation so they asked us to leave. We stated we were about to order dessert and he repeated that we would have five more minutes. \n\nI might understand this if we'd been sitting at our table for hours after the plates had been cleared, but this was minutes after we'd finished. Perhaps they were annoyed that part of our party hadn't arrived until 6, but our friends had ordered plenty of food and drinks in the meantime, ensuring they were making money from our table. I don't think it's unreasonable to spend two hours at a nice dinner with friends on a Saturday night. Lingering over a glass of wine and dessert is one of the perks of going out in the first place. There were other four tops that had arrived at the same time as we did that weren't asked to leave.  \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be back.
