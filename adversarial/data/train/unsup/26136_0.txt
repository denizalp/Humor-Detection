Be careful about signing up with these folks because the owner claims that we signed a contract that states that  we need to give 6 months notice before cancelling their services.  First off, my husband & I do not recall signing a contract & the owner came & gave us the sale pitch to hire him & we did & no where in his presentation did it say that we needed to give 6 month notice before cancelling because if he had mentioned that we would've never signed up with him.  He double-charged my credit card & now he won't give me back my money back to me because we're terminating his services without a 6 month notice.  We agree with Steve M, Malinda P, & all the ones that have given them a poor rating because what these people write are all things that we have experienced to a certain extent.  Just BE AWARE about how this company works.
