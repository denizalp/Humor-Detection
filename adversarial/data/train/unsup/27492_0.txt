What a beautiful assortment of doughnuts! We tried   the red velvet crumble as well as the chocolate birthday cake, yum! The gentleman at the counter was very friendly, helpful and kind! Service was fast and efficient. We didn't eat inside of the establishment, but it looked spacious, clean and like a good place to eat and enjoy.\n\nWe would have loved to have ordered from the drive through, but unfortunately there was a sign that said, \"no single donuts\" in the window so that was a bit of an inconvenience on a summer day. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Hurt's for people who like uniquely decorated and delicious doughnuts.
