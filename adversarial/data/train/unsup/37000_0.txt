My experience with O'Harmony Realty was one of the best landlord\/tenant experiences I've ever had, they worked with me from the initial move in to me having to move out before the lease was up as my job was relocating me to another state on short notice, Michelle especially was always there for me, kind, courteous...understanding and extremely helpful, if you have to contact anyone in this agency...ask for Michelle and she will work to make sure any experience you have with them is a exceptional one...if I get relocated back to Vegas...you can bet that I will call Michelle first...thank you for everything
