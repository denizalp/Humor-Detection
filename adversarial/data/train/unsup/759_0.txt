Psst! Hey got a secret to tell ya'll about...\n\nAt South Park mall, they have fancy food court with a dozen of choices. If that isn't bag you have the California Pizza, Cheesecake Factory or Maggianos. The kids today growing up in America have it made when it comes to the mall dining experiencea. However, they are missing out on the old school department store diners. \n\nI am going to drop a little secret on you Charlotte and it is called Arthur's! This gem is hidden in the basement of the Belk Department store. Really,  I am not pulling your leg. If you take the down escalator into the ground floor past the small appliances, wedding registry and fine china you will found yourself starring at Arthur's cafe menu. \n\nFirst thing, the serve Cherry Coke and steak fries so they got my taste bud's attention. Arthur's is know for their great cheeseburgers (voted as best in Charlotte) and and check this out CHEESE STEAKS! I knew that would get your attention. For the ligher side, they have pretty tasty salads too!  Plus their ketchup and mustard is in the red and yellow plastic bottles, Old School style! None of those fancy little packets will be found here!\n\nIf you need to recharge with a quick meal at South Park drop in on Arthur's. But lets keep this secret between us, ok! ;)
