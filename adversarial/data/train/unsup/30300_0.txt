It was...OK.\n\nCalled in an order. Asked for bagels (at\/around 1:30pm) to be added to the order and was told that they didn't have ANY. Settled for a pastrami reuben (Really good) and a piece of cheesecake (Really terrible).\n\nThe service was SLOW, even though there was a single customer ahead of me. The staff seemed to be more interested in standing around BSing than they were in helping customers. I did notice that the place was mostly empty when you would have thought there would have been at least a late lunch crowd.\n\nAnyway, the prices were the same as the restaurant in LA, but the facility in Vegas is larger. Parking is abysmal and leaving the restaurant if you park out front is like navigating a maze. They do have al fresco seating...so that's a plus.\n\nAgain..it was OK. \nNot great.\nNot terrible.\nJust OK.
