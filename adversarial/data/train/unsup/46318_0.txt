This is a solid steakhouse... We got tons of good food for around $350 with tip. \n\nI got the Chicago rib eye. It was could perfectly. It was tender and had tons of flavor. My girlfriend got a chopped salad and Cajun shrimp. I tasted both and they were great. \n\nMy cousin got the 12oz filet and his girlfriend got the 8oz. They both enjoyed their meals. \n\nOur friend got the surf and turf with a 8oz filet and lobster tail. He said it was on point. \n\nOur service was excellent. \n\nI recommend trying this spot out!
