I rated this one star because there isn't an option for zero. Beds were so uncomfortable, you sleep on plastic and the sheets were dirty and rough, pillow cases had a red stain and were dirty as well. Later in the evening we were walking AROUND the casino to get to food and we weren't aloud to walk past the lobby and they proceeded to call security on us for sitting in the lobby. We were told to go back to our rooms. I've never had such an unpleasant visit in my life and don't suggest wasting your money here.
