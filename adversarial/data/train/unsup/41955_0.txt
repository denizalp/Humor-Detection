My friends and I had a great time at Lockdown Escape Rooms-Sahara.  Christopher was our guide and did a great job explaining the scenario and giving us clues (Yes, we did use a few).  We did Wrongfully Accused and really enjoyed the experience. The clues were there, but it definitely took some thought to figure things out.  Being handcuffed together made the team concept even more challenging, but also made the experience more fun.  The place was spotless, service great and the puzzle a lot of fun.  We will do it again!
