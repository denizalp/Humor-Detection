SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Just an AVERAGE steakhouse w fancy white decor. Full of FAKE stuck up snobs. The hostess was rude,we were 10 mins early for our reservation,it was empty,she made us wait. She got an attitude when we asked to move seats because we didn't want to be crammed in a long booth next to strangers. Her smile is as fake as her wig! The shrimp was soggy. The short rib was over salted. The steak was bland. The dessert was burnt. The manager is not genuine at all. You can find REAL service from much nicer people at Dennys! We didn't feel welcomed here. Came after work in our uniforms to enjoy ourselves. Thanks for wasting our time & money!
