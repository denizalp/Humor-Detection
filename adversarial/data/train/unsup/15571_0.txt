you know a place is good when the restaurant is in a slow plaza and theres hella cars only in front of the restaurant.  this is Carlitos.  I'm glad i found this place because it is now my favorite mexican restaurant.  very inexpensive and a big bang for your buck. \n\nmake sure to make it a meal for only 3 bucks more.  comes with your choice of pinto, refried or black beans, rice and their bomb ass sopapilla!  make sure to drizzle that with honey.  enchiladas is my favorite so far with the pork verde.  chips, salsa, and guac is a very good appetizer.\n\nthanks for existing! ill be back soon. very soon.
