This might not be the newest, nicest, or most high tech theater but I like it. It's biggest selling point is that it isn't located in a casino. So, there's no massive parking garage (and accompanying traffic) to deal with. Plus, you don't have to trek through a congested and smokey casino. It's so un-Vegas and \"normal\" (like the theaters I grew up around) that it's appealing. Sure, it's beat up and old and smells like a gym. It's also not crowded. More positives than negatives in my book. I'll be back often.
