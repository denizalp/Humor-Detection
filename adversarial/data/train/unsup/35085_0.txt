Downhill service! Used to be a good place but under new mgmt it is awful.  Rude, inconsiderate staff treat you like your bothering them.  Guy asks me what I want.  I say a smog check as my car is parked 3 feet from the smog test machine\/shack.  Few minutes later asks me again what I want as I again have to say a Smog check. Mumbles at me as he types then hear the word \"Done\" as he leaves me standing there.  Refused to take a coupon, mumbled expired, didn't look at my other two coupons.  Used to go there the past 15 yrs with multiple vehicles.  NEVER AGAIN!
