We went to Sunday Buffet. Service was good. Food was ok. Chicken 65 wasnt up there in taste. Definitely felt a shortage in non-veg menu. Main dishes were missing such as Chicken Karrhai, Beef Nehari, and Paya. Chutney's and raita was never refilled after they were out. Typical Desi Restaurant of Arizona.
