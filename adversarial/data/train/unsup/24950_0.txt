Excellent little dive bar.\n\nThis is one of the least expensive places to get your buzz on in Scottsdale. The crowd seemed to be mainly locals - though a few outsiders (like me) have figured it out. The lights are low and the decor is very dated (perfect).\n\nI visited on a Friday night - which featured rum drink specials - they had a selection of tiki style drinks in massive glasses for $3 ea!\n\nI will definitely be back.
