Cats. Coffee. Cute everything. Hell yeah.\nSo this was my first visit to a cat café in general, and I definitely wasn't disappointed.\nThe whole establishment is vegan which frankly makes a lot of sense to me given the fact that we're all animal lovers here (why do the other cat cafés not have more vegan stuff??). We just grabbed (inexpensive) iced coffees but I'll definitely be back to try other stuff.\n\nIn terms of space and atmosphere, it was perfect- there's a cozy inclosed patio space with twinkle lights where the cats seem particularly happy. The inside of the café is adorable with lots of saturated-colour item furniture; great artwork; lots of cat paraphernalia; and soft, ephemeral tunes playing.\n\nThe only down side was maybe that there were only four cats in the whole establishment and they're clearly very used to a lot of affection from patrons. Needless to say, for the most part the kitties were not interested in hanging out with us. I reckon this is probably a regular thing for cat cafés. They were still fun to look at though! Oh, and all of the cats are available for adoption!
