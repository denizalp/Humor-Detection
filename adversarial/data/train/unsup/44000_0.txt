Before I lived in PV, I use to drive from Flagstaff (2.5 hrs away) just to come and visit this restaurant! The pesto and bread is amazing! Then, the friendliest staff, is just a pleasure to be waited from, comes to the table, full of information, to take your order. I've eaten just about everything and if not me, the people I've recommended to come, have, all saying that this place has great food for the price. I love the sweet potato cannelloni with spinach and mushrooms. It's so different but so so tasty. Also, being right next to the water, the outside patio is gorgeous and old Town Scottsdale is right behind them. I hope this helps you make up your mind for a great lunch or dinner experience!
