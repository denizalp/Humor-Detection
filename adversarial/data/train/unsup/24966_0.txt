Used to spend about $1500.00 a month here when it first opened but like all businesses downtown they tried something new, and changed the menu. They quality is steadily declining. Seems that people who are friends of employees get their food faster, the person who got special treatment and I know each other. The shrimp dish they added to the menu tastes like crap. Last time I'll be here. Bye Felicia
