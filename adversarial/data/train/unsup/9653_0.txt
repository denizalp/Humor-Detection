My wife had another business symposium she was attending at her school (WP Carey).\n\nAs is our normal routine, when I am not invited; I act as the chauffeur service and drop her off  on campus, and make myself scarce.\n\nSince I already know how long these symposiums go, and she would be famished by the time it was done, I figured I would stop by one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the area and order enough food for the both of us for the next two days.\n\nHence, I stopped by my friends at ACE. Li stopped to say hi, and asked where my wife was. I told her that she was at school, and I am ordering for the both of us. Some for me to consume here, and the rest would be for takeout.\n\nI ordered the Salted Pork Chop, House Fried Rice, Minced Garlic Choi Sum, Chicken Curry, and House Special Pan Friend Chicken Lo Mein. I sampled a few of them, and had them pack up the rest.\n\nAs always, this place is authentic, unassuming, and simply delicious. They never fail to impress me. And the service? Well, I come to this place because they know me by name, and they are always glad that I came! (cue Cheers theme song)
