This is a on their almond croissant only.\n\nBosk is located inside the Shangri-La Hotel.  I was too tired from the night before to properly get ready to have breakfast downstairs so I asked if I can get a pastry for take out.  They weren't sure since I'm assuming not many people ask to get a container to go, but they were accommodating.  \n\nI took my almond croissant and brought it upstairs to my room with coffee.  I'm not sure if I was really hungry, but that croissant was damn good.
