Yes, yes, they did it again!! Johnny really knows how to put on a restaurant in the city!  Opening night of Sochu House was tonight and, being a humongoid fan of Sens, of course I made a reservation! It was super busy, but that's to be expected on opening night. They had a few issues with the bar being backed up and the POS system in the bar not working but no biggie. That kitchen was crankin out all the dishes on the menu in short order. Like a well oiled machine, they marched my food out to my table and demanded I annihilate it....which I did. We started with the always awesome truffle edamame (need I say more?) and my all time fave, Soup Gyoza. LIttle  pork Gyoza stuffed with pork and injected with this ginger soy broth that I kinda wanna bathe in. We also did the sweet chili wings, bacon wrapped lychee, sugar cane pork and a curry claypot. Everything was on point and delivered to perfection. The bacon wrapped lychee was the surprise hit for me. Now I will say I'd like a few more for the price, but still awesome and I'll get it again....and again...and again.   The wings were great, sweet with a touch of spice and super crispy. The sugar cane pork has also been one of my faves and I'm glad it's on the menu again. The claypot was super good too and for $10, it's a great must-try. All total, our bill was just over $40 and I couldn't be happier (well maybe if Salma Hayek and Jennifer Lopez were fighting over me, that might win..slightly).  Overall, great spot and loving the new location (stumbling distance from my pad). I look forward to many drunk nights at Sochu gobbling down the awesome food that the kitchen has to massacre me with!!!
