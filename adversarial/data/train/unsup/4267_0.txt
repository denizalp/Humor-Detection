Terrible work, terrible service! I asked to have my gel manicure like the picture I had showed them. The guy did my manicure and it looked hideous. I tried to be ok with it but I really couldn't stand it. I went back the next day to ask if they could redo the manicure or give me a refund and take them off. They said no refunds and would charge me $20 for the redo. I had already paid $62 ($25 pedicure, $30 gel, and $7 design) yesterday. They would not even lower the redo price to $15. See the pictures, it explains it all.
