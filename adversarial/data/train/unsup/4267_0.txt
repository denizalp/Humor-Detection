Worst detailers I've ever used. If you just need your car washed, they're probably fine. But, DO NOT pay more for polishing, waxing, etc. These detailers (I use that word \"detailers\" loosely) are not well trained with polishers and do at best a half a** job. At least the one that did my vehicle. Not only was the job bad but one of my headlights was marred by the polisher. Management offered for a free re detail on next visit. A partial or full refund would've been better service.
