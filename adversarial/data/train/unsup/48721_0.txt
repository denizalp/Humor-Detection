We came here tonight with friends for the Friday night fish fry.  It was the most horrible dinner.  We sat there and waited for our meals for over an hour.  Then when we got them, 1 of the fish fry's were still frozen inside and the other 3 were still raw.  The waitress was really nice.  They ended up comping our dinners.
