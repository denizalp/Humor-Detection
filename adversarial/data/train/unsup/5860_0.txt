I loved Buster's so much in Flagstaff, I wanted so badly to love it just as much here, even though the Scottsdale location no longer has the same owners.  But after a few attempts to love it, I just like it.\n\nFirst, the bread basket is always disappointing.  In Flagstaff, it was a big hunk of warm sourdough with enough zucchini muffins for everyone in your party.  Here for three people, it was two sourdough rolls and a few thin slices of zucchini bread.  I am happy to report that the French onion soup is the soup I know and love with a higher price tag of nearly $6.  In fact, many of the dishes are the same as I remember, but everything at this restaurant is substantially higher in price, over-priced in my opinion.  Some of the nearly identical dishes may be $7 or $8 more here.  It's Scottsdale, not another planet.\n\nSo while I might come back for nostalgia, it will most likely only be when my mom insists.  We ordered fish and chips, one sandwich, two bowls of soup, half of a lahvosh, 2 cocktails, a soft drink, and one beer for $91 BEFORE tip!  Even without the cocktails, the price for these items was ridiculous.  No wonder everyone who eats here is old.  You have to cash in your retirement to pay for it!
