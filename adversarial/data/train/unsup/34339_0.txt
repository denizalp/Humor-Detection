Oh my gosh - on a recent trip to Montreal (June 2010) we wandered into Suite 88.  The only thing we tried was the ice cream, but the Chocolate with Sea Salt ice cream has got to be my favorite ice cream EVER!  The Chai was also good, as was the triple chocolate and the plain old chocolate, but the Chocolate with Sea Salt was amazing!!!!
