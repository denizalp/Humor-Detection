My family and I were checking the bridal stores in West Edmonton Mall out, and since this is the biggest one in the mall, we expected some good things. Nope, not so. Despite their huge selection, most of the dresses look more or less the same, so if whatever style is most popular right now isn't you, you might as well just skip the store. Also, when we went in, the lady at the front asked us if we were shopping for a wedding dress. I said yes. She asked when the wedding is. I said in about a year. Apparently she thought this was so much time that she waved her hand at us and said, \"well, you're just looking then, go on\". No help, no suggestions, nothing, she was hardly even very polite at all. We were just left to wade through zillions of nearly identical, often not very attractive dresses, looking for something nice. Which we didn't find. Good thing, cuz I was too unimpressed to want to buy anything there anyway.
