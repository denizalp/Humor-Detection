Fashion Crimes is like a candy store, a place where you can get lost for hours (and there's enough selection to do so easily). There are little surprises and goodies tucked away in every nook and corner of the place. If you're planning a trek through the store, definitely set aside some time so you can do it justice. This isn't a quick browsing store. Start at one corner (I recommend hanging a left and doing a loop around the store) and work your way around so you don't miss anything. The best times to shop here are during the week days before 4 pm when the store starts to get significantly busier. The experience is better and you can take your time more if there isn't high traffic.\n\nThe dresses are very retro-rockabilly inspired and are definitely rather pricy. The store is raided by high school girls for prom and a great place to get a custom wedding dress with a bit of a twist.\n\nThe shining highlight for me are their accessories! I find sooo many delightful, odd-ball, glittery bits here that get raves from strangers on the street. And for the most part, the jewelry is reasonably priced and there are deals to be had. \n\nThey also have incredible and outrageous hats. My favorite are the Audrey Hepburne-style sun hats in the summer. There are scarves, a wonderful selection of stockings (best place to get the contrast cuban-heel back seam stockings in the city), aprons, oven mitts, everything a girl could wish for to put a little glamour into each day.\n\nFashion Crimes also has a great selection of handbags: Karen Wilson, Matt & Nat, etc. \n\nThe staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Tailoring is offered (items are sent to the workshop a few blocks away). \n\nIf you lust for the dresses but they aren't in your budget, keep an eye out for the insane sales. This store sure knows how to slash prices to rock bottom.
