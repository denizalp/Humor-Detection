WE (a few buddies) found out about this place from my friends pop's. We wanted a duck (a whole duck instead of the 2 breast sold in Harris Teeter for 9 bucks).. \n\nHis pops told us to go here.\n\nNO Problem..  Every since then, this is the place I\/we come for whole duck (i've gotten it so much i forgot the price..sorry) but not much.\n\nTHIS place sells Jasmine Rice... (sticky rice)..... really really good. and inexpensive.\nYou can go to the back and pick Lobster, fish (many kinds), Octopii (if thats the right word) etc..and they will CLEAN it. SCALE it, or BE-HEAD IT.. if need for no extra charge. \n\nAll the seasoning and spices you can shake a stick at!!!\n\nGo try it out....\n\nCheers
