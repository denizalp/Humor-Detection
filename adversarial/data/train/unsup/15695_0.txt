We came to the aquatic center for a private party tonight and it was great. You can rent the entire place out which is a plus. There is a huge slide which the kids love, a walk in area for the toddlers, and a diving pool that reaches 13ft. The location is big so doesn't feel too crowded. There are lockers to hold your items as well as a snack bar with tables if you get hungry. The pool is clean and there are quite a few lifeguards which is great for safety. My kids didn't want to leave.
