Finally, went and dine at Jason's Deli last night after the movies. Perfect location across the street from Park Road Shopping Center. Everything is pretty much closed at 9:25 PM except for the movie theater. \n\nHave been ordering and taking out from Jason's for business meeting as well as on the go.\n\nJason's deli is not like your typical deli. It's has a little bit of everything. Reminds me of a cafeteria growing up. They have a salad bar and with a good selection to choose from. They had miniature gingerbread muffin which was so good. Pop one and you are addicted to wanting more. Only, tried one.\n\nThe Lobster Chowder is out of this world. Got it in a cup which was savory and so rich\/creamy. They should call it Lobster Bisque for sure. What kind of liquor did they put in? Sherry? You definitely need to try this out. \n\nMy regular is Hot Pastrami on Rye with Mustard. It was good and comes with a side of chips. We also ordered 1\/2 a sandwich with salad and came with a side of chips too. Great place to bring the family for food is nice size portion to share with others.\n\nDo not forget to get your free ice cream. Make your own. Soft ice cream with flavors or vanilla, chocolate or swirl-combo of both.\n\nNice and quite last night, there were other patrons at the deli at 9:25 PM.
