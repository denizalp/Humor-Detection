It was a cold day in Vegas so we decided it was perfect weather for some Pho.  We tried to go to our normal spot off Decatur and Spring Mtn but to our surprise it is under construction.  I felt like crying as my heart was set on their Pho.\n\nWe did a quick Yelp search and came across this spot.  The food was great, I still like Pho So 1 but I am a little partial to that place.  \n\nWe had our \"reg\" of pho ga and some Vietnamese spring rolls.  Both were on point.\n\nThe service was great.  Fast, friendly and efficient.
