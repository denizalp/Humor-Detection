Placed a call for service and someone was out within 5 hours.  My garage door opened with the remote but would not close using the remote.  The technician checked the sensor on the opener and the wiring.  When checking the sensors next to the track they found a piece of equipment that was stored in the garage was blocking the sensor and causing the problem.  An easy fix and a lesson for me.  They also gave me advice on what to use to maintain the track and door hinges to make it easier on the unit.  Since it was an easy fix I was only charged the diagnostic fee which I really appreciated.
