The reason Essence of Life gets 5 stars is not because it's posh, lush, or has every single item I could ever need (altho I haven't checked that yet).  It's because it's prices are SO FREAKIN GOOD!\n\nI feel like an idiot for spending so much at the Big Carrot, Whole Foods, and Loblaws when I could just come here and get all my house and personal products here.  My girlfriend told me that the Diva cup is $10 cheaper than elsewhere!  My Gioavanni shampoo is $6.99 instead of $9.99.  All the products we use are significantly cheaper here.  How do they do that?\n\nIf Honest Ed's could own an organic shop, this would be the place (altho, without the huge, sprawled out chaos).
