I love this show!! All I can say is, if you LOVE the Beatles,, you will LOVE this show! Not much acrobatics for this show but could they perform!! WoWWWW! They danced like no tomorrow and the costumes were out of this world. I felt like I was in the 60's era. The performers could not have done it better. It is hard to dance certain moves to Beatles Rhythm but the Cirque definitely did it!  I will definitely see it again. Well worth the $115!
