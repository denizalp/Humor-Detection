The store of last resort...\n\nThat pretty much sums up my feelings regarding the Walgreens in the Only Waunakee in the World.  It's similar to that situation where you are famished and there is one beat-up roller dog at the convenience store.  You hate yourself for doing it, but sometimes you just have to hold your nose and dive in.\n\nService is really hit or miss.  Sometimes the staff is really helpful, but since I tend to come here late at night after the local grocery store is closed, I tend to get stuck dealing with the dregs of the employee base.  Need help finding an item, the best they can offer is a blank stare.  You in a hurry to check out, there may or may not be someone tending the checkout line.  (This is especially true for the photo counter).\n\nAnother pet peeve is the balance rewards card they just rolled out.  I really would prefer not to have Walgreens tracking my purchases in order to obtain their sale price.  Just give me the sales price and we can call it even.\n\nWaits at the pharmacy counter generally run five to ten minutes, longer in the evening.\n\nWith the new Target in nearby Sun Prairie, hopefully the visits to this Walgreen's can go the way of the eight tack tape (OK, I'm dating myself with that comment.)
