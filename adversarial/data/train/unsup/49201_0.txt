I just recently had some security solar screens installed by olson iron i have to admit they were not my first choice due to all the negative reviews but after two other companys not following through on just giving me a basic cost for my project i decided to call olson iron. Angel came out to my place, he was 10 minutes early,  he was very knowledgeable with all his products and gave me some great color options. The installers were prompt , very friendly and professional from start to finish. I am really looking foward to having them do my next project; im sure its going to be awesome...
