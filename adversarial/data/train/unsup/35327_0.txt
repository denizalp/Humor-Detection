I was so excited when I found out a Panera was opening closer to our house. I was going to stop in but my son fell asleep in the car so I decided to do the drive thru instead. Do they not have to-go containers here? My sandwich was wrapped in paper only and not even covered all the way. My baguette was just sitting in the paper bag. The lady taking my order and the one who gave me my food were both extremely friendly, but I'm a little disappointed with how the food was \"served\". I've order take out before from other Panera's and it hasn't been like this. If I had waited until I got home, my sandwich might have been dried out. But because I ate in my car, it was a little messy not having anything containing my food. Wonder how they would have served me soup if I had ordered that!
