I saw this place by accident after taking my family to IHOP for breakfast while visiting Las Vegas. On a whim, I went in and took a look around. What I found was a yeasty heaven of goodness inside of a busy bakery. They had just about every bread that can be thought of. I bought and enjoyed the mini pound cakes (moist and delicious), sourdough bread and farmers bread. The customer service was delightful. I will go back and buy another car trunk of bread next time I am in the area. GO and try it!!!
