I came here with my group of friends multiple times, loved the experience here!\n\nSo far I have done \nESCAPE FROM BLEAK PRISON\/NORIKO\/SYNDICATE: THE RELIC HEIST\/THE UNKNOWN.\n\nI would say Noriko itself absolutely deserve a FIVE star, it is a must-try if you're going to escape rooms, the Japanese horror theme is VERY well-done, with multiple rooms and lots of puzzles, my group managed to escape with no hints, but I do recommend going with a large group just so you can buddy up solving the puzzles.\n\nUnknown was very fun as well, it was more for the interesting factor in my opinion; so how fun it is depends more on the group of friends you go with imo.\n\nPrison was neatly done, your group starts off as two small groups, so just make sure you have balanced teammates on both ends, it does require communication and clues from each other to solve it.\n\nSyndicate was the only one my groups did not manage to escape, my personal favourite part about it was the lasers, I am planning to go back again maybe with another group of friends to finish it. It does require a small amount of prior\/external knowledge, which I did not like about one of the rooms, my group managed to figure it out but I can see that there would be others who would struggle a bit just because they might not know about certain things (trying not to spoil here.). But overall process of elimination still could be used to solve that particular puzzle, just will take a bit longer if you don't know about it to begin with, which I suppose is also fine. I recommend doing Syndicate with more people as well.
