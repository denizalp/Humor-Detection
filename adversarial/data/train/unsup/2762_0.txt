The CAL\n\nBeing part of the B Connected rewards family sure has its advantages. They don't include the most glitzy or glamorous hotels on the strip, but they can comfortably accommodate you for the most bang for your buck! They have a good selection of hotels like Sam's Town, Fremont, The Orleans, and yes....\n\nThe CALIFORNIA HOTEL & CASINO\n\nThere's nothing like being on the strip, but if you want more of a vintage sin city experience with a hell of a lot less drama, then you'll find exactly THAT as you gamble and party in Downtown Las Vegas. This area is home to many classic hotels and the famous Fremont Street. \n\nThe CAL is known for having that Island flare. YUP, you'll find a lot of Islanders here and you can tell they make one hell of an influence with the shops and food selection. I'm sure you've already read about Aloha Speciality Restaurant. The line and food wait can get a little long, but sometimes you just have to suck it up. The food is fairly tasty and depending on what you get, you can also find some semi-authentic dishes to chow down on. The seating is unfortunately very limited, so snag a spot as soon as you see any movement during those rush time hours. \n\nOn to the games!! I can only speak for the black jack tables && let me tell yah, the dealers are, for the most part, awesome and fun. They can be very helpful and can joke around with a good crowd. The cocktail servers circulate pretty often, so I had no complaints in the booze department. I got my fill on free daiquiris and vodka. We enjoyed ourselves so much that my family stayed on the same table for 6 hours straight. Talk about champs!!! \n\nI always receive free stays and deals for The CAL but I've never had a chance to take them up on any offer. I guess I've been waiting for the opportune moment. Sure, the hotel aspect doesn't seem to excite me, but if its freeeee...count me in!
