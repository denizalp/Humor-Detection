This place comes up with fake promotions and various schemes to get guests to give them 5 stars. They make promises a free food and free pizza and then when it comes time to collect, good luck.   While this pizza chain is not so bad overall this location truly sucks. \n\nThey simply don't want to honor anything that they offer to get customers in the door.  Typical bate and switch.  They send out free promotions and discounts and then when you get to the store they say forget it.  Another mistake, Internet error, excuses, excuses, excuses.   They are not honest. \n\nAll the reviews here are from all the other Yelp  people who were promised free pizza to lie and give 5 stares.  All these good reviews are fake.  \n\nLet's talk food, not bad, not that great.  However service sold C-.   \n\nLots of food choices in this area.   Last time I waste my lunch on this pizza joint.  Seriously I don't like feeling scammed they got one on me this time. This is a true and honest review I did not get any free pizza for leaving five stars.
