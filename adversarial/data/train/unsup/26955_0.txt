8907 Legacy Park Drive, water runs constantly in hot water heater, cabinets were clearly coming apart from the walls, leaks under cabinets in the bathroom. When I moved in they said kitchen would be revamped that never happened. When I called about the leaks around the water heater and the oven literally catching on fire I was told my unit was not on the list for an upgrade.  I left the unit... but I'm still coughing today...
