This morning we had a wonderful breakfast.  Ordered chicken and waffle and the meat lovers scramble with potatoes.  \nGreat homemade style breakfast.  Chicken wings were the size of raptor wings. The owners was very hospitable and we wish her the most success with the business.  Looks like she is very involved and does a great job.  Loved the strawberry butter and the homemade hot sauce.  \nKeep it up alliante, lots of great family businesses and I plan to support them all.
