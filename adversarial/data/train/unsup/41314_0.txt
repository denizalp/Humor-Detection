This place has several amazing things about it. History of the building is crazy. Seriously. Just ask for a tour of the speak eazy. Great beer menu with the 2 top IPAs in Ohio available. Full bar as well. Then the food. . . . Possibly the best thing about it. Very freash and extremely well prepared. Both inside & outside patio.
