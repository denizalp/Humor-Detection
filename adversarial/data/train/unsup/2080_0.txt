NOT \"Pain Free\" (for me)\n\nDespite being advertised as \"pain free\", I felt pain during most of the laser hair removal treatments on my underarms: it felt like continuously shocking pin pricks. \nThe pain lessened to discomfort after several treatments had thinned out my otherwise thick and coarse hair. \n\nAfter 6 treatments I am not hair free, but I won't be returning unless they can offer a good deal and better quality services. \n\nThey told me that it takes up to 12 sessions to be hair free, and that the hair might grow back if they are triggered by hormones (in which case, I would require additional touch up treatments).   \n\n\n\nCustomer service is inconsistent. \n\nI met two staff members who were generally rude, indifferent, and surly (ie. acting annoyed and curt when requesting to reschedule an appointment (days in advance), being indifferent when I expressed pain during treatments, rushing through treatments, etc), and two staff members who were decently mannered and courteous (ie. explaining things and answering questions, checking the laser machine after I expressed slight pain, spending more time and doing a more thorough job than their co-workers, etc.).\n\nThis business did not reply to any of the e-mails I sent from the \"Contact Us\" area of their website.\n\nAlso, they would not always call back when I would leave a message on their answering machine.
