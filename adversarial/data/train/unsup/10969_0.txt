A&B prospecting is the best and the ONLY place to get your prospecting supplies. They have been around forever and is a family run business for many many years. I like the stories of companies so I ask. No matter where you live in the valley this is the spot to go. \n\nRyan the owner is the nicest guy and has a wealth of knowledge when it comes to prospecting and mining for gold or other precious metals. He not only had the knowledge (I got a ton of education from him by asking questions) but he also corrected me in what and why I want certain items to have a successful prospecting journey. I came in with some preconceived thoughts and he shared with me why I should go a different route for what I wanted to do. \n\nThis store has pretty much anything and everything you need from a beginner level to expert level prospector. They have books, maps, magazines, pumps, dredges, HUGE selection of metal detectors, crazy things I knew nothing about, and a ton more. \n\nI've been in here a few times before and they have recently did some remodeling, the place looks bright and fantastic. I'm not sure who else in the state has better service, the bigger selection, but I'm pretty sure A&B has it all. They even have setups to test the metal detectors to make sure you get the right one. \n\nThe nostalgia of this place and learning more about prospecting was eye opening to say the least. I will be back for sure.
