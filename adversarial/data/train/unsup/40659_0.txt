I sure miss the little old lady at the counter; she remembered me every time I'd roll through.  But the staff here are just as friendly and the blueberry pancakes are still just as amazing.  With very few things in life that are consistent and something I can depend on, I'm so glad that this place hasn't let me down.  I'll say it again: delicious blueberry pancakes (with tasty bacon!), smooth coffee and wonderful customer service.  Thanks OHOP, I appreciate you...
