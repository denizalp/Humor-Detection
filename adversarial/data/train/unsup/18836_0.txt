Let's get this out there now:  I'm a huge fan of NYPD Pizza.  I love the Chandler location, the Avondale location... it's all the same!\n\nAnyways, this place is great.  Their pizzas are always delicious, fresh, and hot from the oven!  The crust is crispy when you first bite into it and chewy in the middle and their sauce has some good flavor.  The toppings are always generously piled on and the cheese-drag is almost sinful.  Love it.  The garlic knots are truly the best.  \n\nThe atmosphere is super cute.  It's just an overall great place to dine with some friends or your significant other.
