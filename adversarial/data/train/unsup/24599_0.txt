The dancers were extremely hot and the majority of them were so nice. The problem we had was when we asked if my gay best friend could get a lap dance for his 21st birthday a lot of the dancers said they don't allow that there. Some finally told us that the owner only allows them in secret rooms and it's $150 for 15min instead of the normal 20\/25$. That is complete discrimination and shameful on the owner. We finally went to the girl section so he could at least get some kind of lap dance and girl on girl or lesbian action was allowed downstairs. The discrimination there is just terrible and although we made friends with the strippers, will never return.
