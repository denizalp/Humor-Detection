Would absolutely recommend Ed and team. He assembled a very large TV stand\/electric fireplace that I had purchased online. He was on time for our appointment, got right to the job, and worked diligently the whole time. Friendly and courteous, and obviously very knowledgeable about furniture and construction. A pleasure to meet this man and do business with him.
