So, I walk into Schindlers because a family member told me to try there for valance fabric.  I have a pillow with me to coordinate colors.  I only got a few feet in before feeling quite awed and overwhelmed.  I just stood there staring at an old - I mean really old - low, outdated, worn-out, horribly ugly couch and a few people buzzing about it.  When a grandma sort noticed my obvious stare, I commented, \"Wow.  I love it when someone can see the beauty and bring back a piece like that.\"  She said, \"That was in my grandmother's basement for years.\"  I still stood there awhile, & thankfully a sales person asked if I needed help.  Oh gosh, yes.  She listened to my project needs, led me to exactly the right fabric options, and gave me generous samples to take home.  That's three things more than the fabric chain stores offer!!  I had to at least check out the upstairs bargains, which I did unattended.  Oh, my... I can't imagine not finding something there for any need. It's jam packed with fabrics.  And the building is intriguing by itself. What a stroll into the past.  By the time I left, the busy bees around that ancient couch had piled up fabrics of rich tones, thick textures, and amazingly close matches to the (now actually gross) original coverings.  I am amazed and impressed.  I hope Schindlers lasts another 80 years.
