Worse district to work for, specially, if you are a Teacher. The districtÂ´s Human Resources Director works only two days a week; Tuesday and Wednesday. If you have a question good luck on getting an answer. There are a lot of problems with Payroll and you have to take your case all the way up the superintendent to get it fix. Yep! all the way up t the superintendent.... are you laughing out loud? Ridiculous right? \nThe principal that has good reviews in the district meetings is the new one from Longview. Teachers in his campus love him. The principal that gets the worse reviews and everybody fear is the one from Solano. The teachers dislike her very much. Solano school has the highest rotation of teachers. Nobody wants to work in that School. \nThere you have it.
