Cinema Hair Studio changed my life. Before I began frequenting this business, women would say to me, \"Your hair is pathetic, get a life loser\" and now they never say that. Nicole cuts my hair. She has an incredible sense of style and always tells me my hair looks good at the end. Now when I attend social gatherings and various sporting events, people notice me. They'll say, \"Hey you seem interesting and your hair smells good\" which it does. This is all thanks to Nicole. She will often cut my hair different ways as I show her photographs of celebrities with really expensive looking hair and in the end I always look like them, even if one is Steve Carrell and the other one is Jet Li. It doesn't matter, because Nicole is a wizard of hair styling. I would never go anywhere else and if you go somewhere besides Cinema Hair Studio after reading this glowing review, I bet your hair sucks. Thank you, Nicole.
