So Dr. McHale had delivered my baby even though she was not my primary OB\/GYN but she was awesome throughout the long process which both of us will never forget switching hospitals and ending up with a c-section at 12 am. It was fate that my new insurance was not accepted at my old doctors place so I decided to call Dr. McHale's office and they said yes we do take Teacher's Health Trust. \n\nMy first visit with Dr. McHale was a great one. Even though it's been 2 years since I've seen her, we talked about how my first child's delivery was unforgettable. She remembered me and since then we have talked about what we want to do with this upcoming baby #2. Honestly, she takes the time to explain and always answers every question that I have so that I feel comfortable with my choices. \n\nPeople complain about the wait and I've had a good 45 minutes max which is amazing considering I used to wait a good 1.5 - 2 hours to see my other doctor. In Vegas, expect to wait for a doctor for about that long (30-45 min in the waiting room). I figured in and out in 1 hour to 1.25 hours is better than what I used to have to do. \n\nHer staff is awesome and of course her nurse, Stephanie rocks. They will be moving in a couple of months but it's down the street. I definitely have to say Dr. McHale is one of my favorite doctors thus far and everyone that I know that goes to her feels the same way.
