I love this place! I love everything. It makes me feel like I was born in the wrong decade. There is always incense burning and classic rock playing and I always sing along to the music when I go in there. They have awesome clothes, accessories, games, incense, blankets, everything. I even love all the intricate pipes, don't judge. Remember, all of the pipes are for tobacco use only, even the ones covered in pot leafs.\nThe service is great, everyone there is so welcoming and friendly. Probably because they are either hippies or completely stoned, maybe both.\nMy only complaint about Hippie Gypsy is the prices! I mean yeah, it's right on Mill Ave, and they want to attract tourists and what not, but seriously?? It's ridiculous. I have only ever bought a few things there but if they were  cheaper then I would have so much of their stuff. All in all Hippie Gypsy is just a cool place to look around, I buy incense there because it's the one thing that's cheap. But maybe one day if I am ever rich, I will stop by and buy something cool.
