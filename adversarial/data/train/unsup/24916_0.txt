This is quintessential Montreal.\n\nBar is a misleading term. It's a huge outdoor terrasse -- \"beergarden\" for Yankees -- ideal for balmy summer afternoons after work with friends and coworkers. It easily seats five hundred, outdoors, inside, and on the front porch -- yet no douchey frat house vibe.\n\nYes, this is the French side of St. Denis, my French is terrible, but so what? The pitchers are cheap and constant, the atmosphere is uplifting, and the ladies are inspiring... What more can a man ask for?\n\nGo for the pale blondes. I always do.
