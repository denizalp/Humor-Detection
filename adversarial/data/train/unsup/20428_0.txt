Seriously, what is not to love about Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza? \n\nMy family and I absolutely love coming here for a quick bite to eat for lunch while running errands or when ya know, we're too lazy to cook dinner at home! Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza is fast, affordable, and delicious!\n\nFor just $8, you can BYO pie with all of the toppings that your heart desires! You can't beat this deal. The combinations one could come up with are simply endless! There is a variety of sauces, cheeses, meats, and veggies to choose from. If you're not up to the Picasso challenge, you can also choose from one of their Signature Pizzas. Blaze even offers a gluten-free crust and high-rise dough! I prefer the original crust. It's crispy around the edges and the bit of charred flavor it gets from the oven is so good!\n\nThis location can get pretty busy since it's right next to Galleria. Shopping makes the people hungry! There's lots of room to sit and inhale your pie and even a patio to enjoy during the cooler Vegas days.\n\nFor those of age, Blaze offers select beer and wine too! Lots of craft favorites. And for those not of age, I highly recommend the Blood Orange Lemonade or the Blueberry Hibiscus agua fresca. Both are refreshing and complement the pizza nicely.\n\nI love this place and it satisfies my pizza craving every single time!
