Before a show at Wynn, I came here for dinner.  I was early but it was OK and I was seated at a window table with the marvelous third floor view of the boulevard and the Wynn\/Encore towers.\n\nI was brought bread, ice water, and iced tea quickly.  My server, Eric, was top notch!  He explained various things on the menu since it was my first visit to the restaurant.  He then left me to mull the choices before coming back to see if I had any questions or was ready to order.\n\nI ordered a cup of potato leek soup, the bone in Kona crusted sirloin and the parmesan truffle fries for a side.  Everything was very, very good.  The potato leek soup was creamy and served with a few very thin, slightly deep fried fingerling potato slices.  The soup was rich and very enjoyable.\n\nI ordered the steak blue and that's just the way it came.  It was very good and I almost picked up the bone to gnaw before I let them take the plate.  The parmesan truffle fries were addictive.  If anyone from the FDA comes to this restaurant, the fries will be listed as a Class xx addictive drug.  I hated to finish only a small amount but I didn't want to overdo it.\n\nFor dessert, I got the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  It was very rich and had a good dark chocolate\/coffee flavor--strong but not overpowering.  \n\nI gave my compliments to Eric for the staff on such a good meal.  It was a great start to the evening.  The view through those windows along with the excellent food and service make the Capital Grille a real winner.
