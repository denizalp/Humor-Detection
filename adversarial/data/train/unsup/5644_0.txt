Unlike other reviewers, I'm not on a first-name basis with the owners\/employees.\n\nWe started with the spiced nuts (great) and the rock shrimp (average).  The shrimp seemed like a well prepared version of a TGIF appetizer.  Not particularly thoughtful or memorable.\n\nNext we had the asparagus (great) and the mozzarella (odd).  The asparagus was a great marriage of its ingredients, whereas the mozzarella left me thinking that the whole was much less than the parts.  The leeks, mozzarella, bread crumbs and fried egg didn't really complement each other.  The ingredients were each good, but the combination was, well, boring.\n\nFor entrees we had the bass and the chicken.  The sauce for the bass was great, but the fish itself wasn't noteworthy.  The chicken was tender, but I had to cut back on the skin as the rub was extremely salty.  The veggies (leeks and fava beans) that came with the chicken were great.\n\nFor dessert we had the chocolate mint creme brulee and butterscotch pudding.  The creme brulee was a mistake, as all subtlety was lost in the dish.   I wish they'd been serving a traditional creme brulee that night.  The butterscotch pudding was the highlight of the night.  The flavor was deep and complex and not overly sweet.  It was the best pudding I have ever had.\n\nThe service was solid.  We arrived for our reservation on time, and were immediately seated.  I liked how different members of the wait staff checked on us throughout the night, not just our assigned waitress.\n\nThe food was good but not great.  I appreciate that they use sustainable ingredients.  However, when you make a menu that small (the items I mentioned above represent nearly half the menu), there is little room for error.  When I factor in the steep price, I don't expect to be dining at FnB again, even for a special occasion.
