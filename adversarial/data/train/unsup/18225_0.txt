I was a member of this spa for 5 years. My husband and I have had a specific rate for this time. However, after a new owner came to run this spa things went downhill quickly. \n\nA week ago, I was surprised to see an increase in my fee on my automatic payment. I was very unhappy about this because no one notified me. Upon calling the owner, she informed me she sent out an email stating the change. I did not receive this email, nor did my husband on a separate account. Interesting, I thought. Why wouldn't we have received the email? The owner's response was, \"You have had the cheaper rate for 5 years.\" SO?????? You DO NOT raise someone's rates without telling them. \n\nI then asked her to forward me this email. The inept owner then told me she couldn't find her email that was supposedly sent out to ALL of her contacts. \n\nWHO WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FIND THIS EMAIL??????? There is no way to find it because it does not exist. After bringing up this very valid question, she asked me if I wanted to cancel my membership. \n\nYES, I want to cancel. I want to have nothing to do with this place. What a sad way to practice business. Way to keep your loyal customers!!!\n***BTW, I would have paid the increase if this had been handled properly. Sad...\nAnd one more thing, I am more than happy to find a new establishment that can do an honest business. This woman is a liar with zero integrity.\n\n**It is very important to point out ONCE AGAIN that this owner could not provide me with a notification email that was supposedly sent. I did not delete any email nor was it in my spam mail. I received emails that were statements each month. Why would I miss THIS???? \n\nBECAUSE SHE NEVER NOTIFIED ME. That was the ENTIRE problem. She lied and displaced blame. What a pathetic business owner.
