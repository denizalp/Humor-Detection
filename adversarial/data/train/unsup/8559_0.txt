I've been to Cosmo's ice skating rink since its conception about 2 years ago, and I dunno how they do it but, it gotten BETTER this year. \n\nWith the added feature of actual \"falling snow\" to an extended food menu, I wanna say that Cosmo rink has outdone itself this year. \n\nI had their tomato soup and grilled cheese which was quite good considering the soup was thick and not too watery, which is much to my liking. Grilled cheese was on thick pieces of bread. \nAlso got to sample their vegetarian chili and cornbread. I wish I got larger pieces of cornbread but, chili more than made up for it with its spicyness. \n\nI would've given it 5 stars had it not been for those darn firepits. I had heard they were charging for firepits so, I wanted to get an estimate. Went thru Twitter to get one and they replied with someone to email. \nOk --- I emailed and they asked for \"amount in party, what day, what time...etc\" as all those factors would go into the pricing. \nThat's just stupid bcuz being of the spontaneous kind, idk all of that.... And my friends and I all have constant every changing schedules. \nI just thought to screw the firepits!\nThey tryna get bottle service type-ish with them firepits. Vegas Life, I tell ya :(
