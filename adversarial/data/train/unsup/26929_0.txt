If I can give this 10 stars, I would.  Took my grandkids and rest of the family there after reading reviews on TripAdvisor.  AMAZING is just one of the things I can say.  Our wrangler, Robert (Bob) made our ride not only enjoyable, but very knowledgeable as well.\n\nThe horses were very well kept as well as the surroundings, an equestrian center run with absolute pride.  Robert made sure we were all happy no matter what age from young to old and was always aware of our wellbeing.  Robert, thank you very much for making our day a memorable one.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend them to all.  The Sauve family.
