My brother and sister in law suggested we go here for an amazing burger...delicious and definitely not an ordinary ole burger. I had the onion rings and sweet potato pie, both were wonderful. The onion rings seemed slightly overcooked but otherwise good. Shakes are great and atmosphere was perfect for a family dinner.
