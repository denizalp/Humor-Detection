My food rating is a 5 STAR \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE IS A 3.\n\nMy husband and I travel to Vegas frequently and love every minute. We have seen 800 degrees several times but always in between meals or when we weren't hungry or had dinner plans. Just this past week when we walked past it was lunch time. We love that you can build your own pizza and salad. Our salad and pizza were DELICIOUS!!! \nWe will 100% go back next time we are there. The girl at the cashier counter had zero personality and she rang me out and I wanted to split payments and she seemed so confused so instead of getting help or communicating ANYTHING with me she just screwed it up and never said sorry. When it finally got fixed the manager said he would give us free gelato which was kind. I just thought she was a bit rude however we will 100% go back for the food and hopefully the customer service will be better !!
