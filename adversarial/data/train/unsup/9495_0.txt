We really enjoyed ourselves and took 2.5 hours to stroll through all the floors.  The greeters at the entrance were super nice and actually excited!  The Mellencamp exhibit was a treat for me, being a huge fan since his early days.  They even had his motorcycle from his high school days.  \n\nThe costumes were amazing.  We got in to the theater just in the nick of time.  It was performance highlights from induction ceremonies and had great sound, i.e. was loud.  The Rolling Stone magazine covers on the upper floors were very cool.\n\nI'm so glad we finally made it here.
