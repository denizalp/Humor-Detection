Their Angus Top Sirloin & Large Succulent Shrimp, that's what's new and advertised as of 05\/09\/18.  Their shrimp is definitely not large and succulent at all.  The sauce it's cooked in is very over whelming and salty.  The sauce was soaked into my rice and chow mein making the entire meal salty.  Is 3 shrimps minimum you get for that $1.25 extra charge?  I was better off getting the walnut shrimp. Oh well. \n\nAs far as the service, excellent. Although I waited for a fresh batch of the Angus Steak n Shrimp because the current pan only had 2 pieces of shrimp.  How do you advertise that and not have the product in the meal itself?\n\nAnyway, good service just horrible product. So with that being said, Happy Eatings!
