From the warm and inviting smiles that I received when I walked in the door to savory smoky BBQ aromas.. Little Miss BBQ is winner!   \n\nThis is my second visit.. I arrived at 1:45pm to no line and walked right up to counter. Beware if you get there close to closing time you will have get what is left which by no means is bad! I got the chopped brisket sandwich with potato salad and ranch style beans. I got the bun on side so I can make my sandwich at home. \n\nDo not forget desert! I decided to try Pumpkin Nutella pie! \n\nDo yourself a favor and get here early to get a good selection of meats, you will not be disappointed.
