Words cant describe how great this place is. As soon as I walked in the hospitality and the welcoming was all there. Alejandro was awesome! Offered me a complimentary drink. Man....cant beat that getting a fresh cut and a cold brewski. Also I really enjoy how the atmosphere and the shop is. Its like a chill spot for the bros haha. Very very elegant and classy as well. \n\nI got my cut from Jose and man....this guy it the man! I had a very long pompadour while back ago then I cut it back to my old fauxhawk which greatly shortened it. Then I decided to go back to my pomp. Coming in fino I had trust in the barbers they can do something with my short hair and I was right there barbers here are spectacular masters at what they do. Jose taught me some tricks that I never used on my hair like a volumizing cream and different products. He was awesome man! You'll be seeing me again boss! Thank you jose, alejandro and fino for men! #teamfino
