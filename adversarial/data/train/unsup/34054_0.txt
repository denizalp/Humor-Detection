I'm biased. Last time my gf and I were here the brunch was awesome. Just eggs bennys with asparagus, but I've been to many places where they don't make them tasty. Here, it was great. It was a sunday brunch and there were not too many people in. Great for the chef to spend some extra time on your food.\nHowever, we went back on a Saturday and it was packed. Gf got the Bennys again-far from what we got the first time. She asked for medium eggs, they were soft and mushy, the sauce wasn't really good either. I ordered the house specialty goulash soup which had barely any potatoes in it, and tAsted like a minestrone soup... It was watery too I had to send it back. \nI will give the place a third chance as it is tied right now. Prices are $$ and service is always good.
