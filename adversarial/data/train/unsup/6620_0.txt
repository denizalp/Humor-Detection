Review for a Sunday night, based on alcohol and entertainment...\n\nDJ is different, but I love it. Played a mix of blues, jazz, hip hop and techno. Designated dance floor. Literally, you won't sit down.\n\nDrinks are decent. I've had stronger and better. They were slammed because of the superbowl, so they ran out of cranberry juice (lol) and it took forever to get our drinks.\n\nThe crowd suuucks. It was such a weird mix of people. Most of the girls were drunk and stumbling everywhere, and the guys couldn't handle rejection... so they'd fight with you in the middle of the dance floor if you turned them away (good God.)\n\nDon't know if I'd check it out again.
