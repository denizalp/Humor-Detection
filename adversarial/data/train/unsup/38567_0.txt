For lunch on a Friday, it is almost empty,  and the service was fine and friendly. \n\nMy classic BLT with added avocado was delicious and so large,  half is going home with me. The $3.49 mimosa was delicious., as were the sweet potato fries. Most of them will come home for dinner, too. \n\nOn nice days, the doors are open,  and the sparrows are opportunistic.  Be ready to chase them unless you want them in your plate.
