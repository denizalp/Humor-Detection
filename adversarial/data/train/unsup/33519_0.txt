I have only had little miss BBq as leftovers.  The food is the best BBQ I have had in az, Texas Tennessee, and North Carolina.  The brisket was the most moist I have ever had it.  The sausage has bold smokey flavors and is also one of the best sausages I have had. The pulled pork was really good and I am not the biggest fan of pulled pork.  Lastly, the bbq sauce is top notch, don't leave without it!
