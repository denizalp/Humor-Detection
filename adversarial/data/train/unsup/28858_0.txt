Very awesome. Had so much fun and felt like a kid again. The guides really make this place enjoyable as they are so friendly and easy to talk to. I recommend this place to all my friends to try. Most games weren't too difficult but still fun. Once you settle down you realize how great the view are from up in the tree. Especially in October.  \n\nThey say to bring a back pack for snacks and such but the parking lot isn't too far so you don't have to lug around your backpack. Make sure you're rested before you go because it does get a little bit tiring.
