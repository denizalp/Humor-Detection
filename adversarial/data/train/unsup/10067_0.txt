no this place isnt \"top of the line\" but id hafta say.. i love staying here.\n\nits in the middle of the strip.. prices arent bad if you're staying with a big group and don't mind rooming together. (you know you get some bitchy ass friends that come along and \"ugh i dont want to sleep on the floor\" or \"theres too many of us for one bathroom\") STFU!! ITS VEGAS! its not like youre going to be in the room 247 GEEZ! \n\nthe only rooms we get here are the NORTH tower grand suites. do it!
