Just when you think things couldn't get better, The Stockyards comes up with a new menu item and gives them out FREE to celebrate their 1-year anniversary today.\n\nWe were each the lucky recipients today of 6 plump rib pieces smoked then doused in a vinegary BBQ sauce. These succulent meat nuggets had luscious appendages of fat that quivered like a \"17th-century courtesan's inner thigh.\"[1] I like these much more than their standard dry-rub ribs. They were so good Jing K.'s dog ate the rib soaked paper napkin right off my lap.\n\nIn addition to the rib tips, I had the smoked trout sandwich. It was very good, but bordering on too salty for me. I think I'll stick to the pork and chicken at The Stockyards.\n\nSo, Happy Birthday, Stockyards. Many happy returns. I'll be back.\n\n[1] http:\/\/blogs.villagevoice.com\/forkintheroad\/archives\/2009\/11\/top_chef_it_sho.php
