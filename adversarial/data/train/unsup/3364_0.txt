I have been a regular Patron at this establishment for more than three years. I have a frequent massage card and usually fill it up in about six months. (10 Massages is full and you get a free massage).\n\nOn 8\/4\/2015 at around 3PM I arrived for an hour and a half massage.  I initially did not know the name of the person who massaged me- but I won't forget the experience. The massage was mediocre at best. After I paid using my debit card the massage therapist had the nerve to insult my $10 tip saying that it wasn't enough for a person as big as me!!\n\nI told her it was all I had in cash (and she did this in front of other clients who were walking in to see if she could pressure me into more cash)... \n\nI have referred many of my friends to this place and brought people with me for more than three years. I'm completely insulted and incensed by this behavior. What I failed to do is take back the $10- but be sure I'll be calling to complain. \n\nI find that; unprofessional, completely rude and there's a good chance I will never return here!!\n\nTo add insult to injury I notice on my frequent massage card that the date was backdated to yesterday!!  I guess this woman did this with the hopes that if I complain she wouldn't get caught!!\n\nIt took her like 45 seconds to date and sign off on the card and she look like she was thinking about not doing it!!\n\nI'm calling to complain to the manager listed on this yelp page but I doubt I'll see any satisfaction!\n\nToday is August 4 and I went in at around 3 PM.\n\nAfter a lenghty, well put together E-mail to: jackpotfootmassage@yahoo.com ATTN: YoYo (the Manager referenced on this Yelp Ad) the email was returned AND the yahoo email address on the Info page is not active!!\n\nI then returned to the establishment and a woman who identified herself as \"Judy\" refused to contact her manager and said their was no one named YoYo.  (\"Judy\" is the rude massage therapist who continued to insult me!)  She said there was NO MANAGER. \n\nShe also said that tipping was 20 to 30% of the total bill for all patrons!!!  She added that her job didn't pay her enough and so that is why she had to insist on 20-30% of the bill in cash gratuity!  When I pointed out that tipping is OPTIONAL and not MANDATORY - she stuck to her story \"That we expect 20-30% as tip\" - smiling in my face and mocking me!!!!\n\nWhen I phoned a few moments later \"Judy\" answered the phone and also refused to be of any assistance.  She hung up on me!\n\nI strongly urge anyone reading this not to go to this place unless you fully intend to be insulted and taken advantage of!!
