Worst nail experience ever! After the guy had already cut off my nails way shorter than I had wanted he decided to go over pricing and quoted 25 over what was on the price sheet they had. And then he proceeded to argue with me about how that is what all the places in Vegas charge. So it's 75$ for a French manicure? I think not. So I asked for a regular manicure with just polish and he changed the price twice again, it ranged from 15-40$ and he couldn't explain the difference and then if you want French color is goes up more. So now I have no nails and paid for who knows what because no one could explain pricing at all. I would never return and my nails look horrible!
