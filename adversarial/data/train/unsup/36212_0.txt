Very novel dining experience here. The theme is sarcasm, banter, offending customers but in a very fun and laughable way, I loved it. Our server was great craic. The tables are picnic benches and you get the table cloth and cutlery thrown at you to set it yourself.\n\nThe choice of food on offer was great, I had ribs and wing combo and there was a mountain of food in the basket for $23.99. The wings are pretty hot!\n\nYou get a paper hat made and placed on your head with a quote written by your server...there were some pretty amusing messages on display.\n\nIf you have no sense of humour and can't laugh at yourself then this is not the place for you. For everyone else, I defo recommended it.
