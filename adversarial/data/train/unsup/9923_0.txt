Darbar might seem like a slightly upscale restaurant at first with its modern interior and dim lighting, but prices were very reasonable and almost inexpensive, especially after converting to USD! My friends and I came here for dinner a few weeks ago during our trip to Montreal. I had the saag paneer and we ordered two samosa appetizers to split among the four of us. There were two per order, so we each got one. The samosas were served on a fancy plate that had the sauce dish attached to it and hovering over the plate. They were delicious. I definitely thought about getting another order of the samosas. The saag paneer was standard. It was served with some pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top, which I had never seen before and thought was an interesting touch. I did wish that they gave a larger portion of rice because I ran out of rice before I was even halfway done with the saag paneer. \n\nTaste | 4\nAtmosphere | 4\nPresentation | 4\nService | 4\nOVERALL | 4
