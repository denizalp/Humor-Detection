Authentic Chinese restaurant on a busy street in Chinatown. It's on the 2nd floor and they have tables with large windows.\nLimited English is spoken here but he menus are in English as well as Chinese and food is a universal language.\nI had the lunch special which was available to 3 pm I think. The roasted duck is really good here which is what I had as well as Mao Poe Tofu. Both came with white rice and a house soup. Very filling and very good. I will definitely be back.
