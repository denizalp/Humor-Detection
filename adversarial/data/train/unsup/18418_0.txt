Coffee was very good not sure if worth the $5 a cup they charged. I did notice that you need to be Hawaiian to be given the same level of friendliness from the owner. They weren't rude to us by any means but weren't overly friendly either as compared to when Hawaiian folks came in. Not sure if perhaps they want to cater to Islanders and not outsiders (almost like I was on the island again).
