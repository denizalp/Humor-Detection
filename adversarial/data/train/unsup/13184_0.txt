I LOVE cupcakes and really wanted to like this place, but I have tried them twice now and have only been disappointed. My last order of cupcakes I took one bite of each and ended up throwing them all way (six cupcakes in the trash made me really sad). They are just too big with too much icing and the cake itself did not taste like much of anything. They did not taste like they are made with fresh ingredients. The pictures of the cakes always look amazing though!
