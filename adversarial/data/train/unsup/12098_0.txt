I do not think it is unreasonable to ask a service provider to be so kind as to close the door of a restaurant on a 95-degree high noonday; keeping it open, with the thermostat at 74-degrees, as I was loudly educated, appears to be an odd fiscal decision. \n\nThen to be humiliated while the grand jester and master of ceremonies asks the people lunching at the bar if I am going through menopause was more than enough. The word in Italian is cafone?! \n\nLucca and Sandra, you make the finest Italian food I have ever had in Phoenix; your food is like being in Italy or New York. Grazie Mille!\n\nI regret to say that you have lost a customer, a new and loyal customer, who has raved about your restaurant and in the short time that I have lived in the Roosevelt District, which is a month, I have been there at least 5 times; I have been proud to bring friends and family.\n\nTomorrow, I was going to bring my father in for lunch.  \n\nLucca and Sandra and Angel, I wish you continued success; you deserve it. The food is divine and your personalities are friendly, and lovely. \n\nI will miss you, but I've been embarrassed and humiliated too many times by your partner to return. You remember the night he refused to give me the check and let me leave? The night he wouldn't let me take my food to go? The evening he told he wanted to make a pizza di cane al forno? \n\nA piedi nel tempo di 95 gradi oggi e viene chiesto se ho avuto la menopausa in della barra intera, era l'ultima paglia. Arrivederci, grazie e auguri per il vostro successo. Abbracci per quasi tutti!
