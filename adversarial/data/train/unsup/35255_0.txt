Couldn't be any happier with Preppy Pet. We left our 3 fur babies for a full 4 days and 3 nights. We were sad to leave them, especially since we just recently moved here and hadn't found a place that we were comfortable with. I scoured yelp and decided on Preppy Pets because of the great reviews, the option of seeing our pets on camera and the great prices! Their prices are half of what everyone else's is. We picked up our pups and they were happy as can be. You could tell they all really loved being there and loved the owner Sue. She was absolutely great and made us and our pups feel completely at ease. We will definitely use them again anytime we need to go out of town! I highly recommend them. Thank you to Sue and Preppy Pet for everything! We all greatly appreciate it! :)
