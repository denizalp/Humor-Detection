This place just keeps getting better.  Our waiter was soooo great this last visit.  Our food was amazing. We tried the bahn mi for the first time from SK, the bbq pork.  It was GREAT!! Different than others I have had, but better in some ways.  Shaking beef is still a go to, steak salad is heaven, pho is so good and now the bahn mi. We are set for good food out here in Surprise thanks to SK!
