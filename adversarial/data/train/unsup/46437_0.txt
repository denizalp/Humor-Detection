I wouldn't even give them 1 star.  People there are Very RUDE and not customer friendly and do not believe in \"Customer Satisfaction\" at All!! I got 4 Palm Trees and 3 Rose Bushes with a 1 year warranty.  I thought, like Home Depot, I would just get refund back on card, because they all died within a Month. NO, they make you shop there by giving you an \"in-store\" credit.  So I get another Palm Tree and I used my \"in-store\" credit THEY made me get, to buy it, and told me by using that it voids out the 1 year warranty on the palm tree I was buying. Lol. What?  Then I buy a broken turtle from their pond in back which I got for a discount and went back week later to buy the other 2 broken ones to set around my pond and a Manager, Jeremy Rudely says I can't buy it, that the 1 I got was a 1-time courtesy.  Again, Lol, What?? LAST BUT NOT LEAST...when you walk in the store they have samples of rocks (which I found out are aged with time), so liking the color of one of them \"Rainbow\", I order 12 TONS for my backyard.  It gets unloaded and it's a \"pink\" in color...NOT what I saw and thought I was ordering.  So I go up there and was told by a Manager, Jim that they will take it back for a $150.00 \"re-stock\" fee.  Again, lol, What??  I told him that was not what was on display...he said it turns that color with \"age and time\"..Sooo isn't that \"MISREPRESENTATION\"??  How much time and age?  Am I supposed to wait what?....3 to 5 years to see my backyard turn the color I want? So needless to say, I'm stuck with 12 tons of the wrong color all in my backyard.  Once I use this \"in-store\" credit, I AM DONE WITH STAR NURSERY AND ESPECIALLY THE LOCATION ON W. ANN ROAD, NORTH LAS VEGAS!!!!
