I own a unit at SKY, and am therefore a \"shareholder in the building\" The board which has a long documented history of corruption is to this day still a main concern of mine as I have equity in the building. The building is known for having water problems. It floods several times a year due to pipes mysteriously bursting. The building is only 8 years old. Every time pipes burst and water damage occurs the front office (Pinnacle Management) sends a letter out instructing owners to open their own insurance claim and contact BELFOR, a restoration company) to do the repairs. It's always BELFOR, they never recommend any other company but BELFOR. BELFOR makes a fortune every year off of restoration jobs from water damage in this building. But why always BELFOR? When I asked that question at a board meeting I was escorted by security from the meeting. It seemed like a legitimate question to me, but I guess I hit a nerve as I got too close to their \"cozy relationship\" with their contractor. I'm left wondering what the arrangement is between the HOA board, Pinnacle Management, and BELFOR. I'm getting a whiff of something that doesn't smell quite right. I'll let you all do the math on what I'm insinuating here. But hey, why fix the pipes when everyone mentioned above is getting rich off the regular ongoing damage restoration from pipes that mysteriously burst way too often.....no reason to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs now is there?????
