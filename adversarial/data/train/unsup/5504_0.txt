My wife and I have always enjoyed our meals at RigaTony's! The food is delicious no matter what you order, they have a full bar, great ambiance and everyone is very friendly. Because this establishment is so fantastic, there is usually a 25 to 30 minute wait before you seat. On this visit my wife and I went to the bar, had a drink and an appetizer, and when we were done with those, our seats were ready. Not a bad way to spend your wait!
