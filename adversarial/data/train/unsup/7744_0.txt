This company is amazing!!  I've had Michael out to my house to service my garage doors several times.  On the most recent visit (I was switching out both of my garage door openers for new ones), he noticed my doorbell wasn't working and helped me fix that too!!!  Amazing customer service!!  My only complaint is that Michael isn't also a plumber, electrician, landscaper, and everything else I might need at the house.  If he was I wouldn't hire anyone else. Don't hesitate to call these guys!!
