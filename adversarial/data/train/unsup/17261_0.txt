Found this shop during my visit to Phoenix, and it was very chill. Everyone that worked there was super nice, informative, and they have wicked good house flavors. Caleb (so sorry if I spelled your name wrong :P) helped me out at the shop while I was there and he was very helpful :) . I will be coming back here to vape more and play board games next time I'm in Phoenix with my friends! Y'all rock!
