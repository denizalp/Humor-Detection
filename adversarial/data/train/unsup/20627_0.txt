Came here with a few friends on a Saturday night - expecting it to be busy as hell, after all, is IS in Yorkdale. But it only took a minute to get a table for 6 -- score!\n\nThis location has gone through a lot of renovations and it shows - the place looks great. \n\nService was awesome - our female server was both friendly and quick and didn't forget or mess up an order. Definitely deserving of a huge tip, which is so much easier to say as someone else paid the bill that night :P\n\nMuch of their menu has changed - it is smaller than it used to be, but still quite a good amount of options. I ordered the chicken and waffles, as I'm as southern as you're going to get for an Italian boy, and I loved it. I felt like Oprah on one of her fat days (which is like everyday nowadays), but it was definitely worth it. I'd probably order this again.  The waffles were sweet and the chicken moist and delicious!\n\nSome of the other meals ordered included deep fried pickles (at the pickle barrel? shocking), burgers which were pretty damn good as well ( I stole a bite), fish and chips and a salad. All healthy portion (and by that I mean, huge and unhealthy) and all looked great. Though some of my friends complained about the fish being a bit soggy, I can't really comment since they were sitting too far away from me to sneak a bite. And I wouldn't touch salad unless it was made with grease so I assume that was also good. \n\nBottom line - great place to eat. I enjoyed it and the prices were pretty decent for the portion size. PS - Get the milkshake. That thing is huge! And no, that's not what she said. I said it.
