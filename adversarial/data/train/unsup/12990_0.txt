service is terrible long waits, we ordered the spam sandwich and when i was eating mine there was no mayonnaise in it. this is such a simple sandwich to make only pandesal spam and mayo, but no, i didn't  get any mayo at all. id make this at home but im too busy. this place is a rip off, there are so many other good Filipino places to try. this place is not worth.
