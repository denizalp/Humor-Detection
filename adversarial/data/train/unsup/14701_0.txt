I gave this place two stars because they open at 6am.  The staff are all female which I don't care about except I like to see some eye candy from time to time myself.  They have daily regulars so even if you get here first you might not get waited on first.  They obviously favor their regulars, which might make you feel like a bit of an outsider.  I'm also a little afraid to dine here as they've been on channel 5's dirty dining before.  Outside of that they have a good drink selection and good outside seating.  Oh, and if your having a bad weekend, again they open bright and early.
