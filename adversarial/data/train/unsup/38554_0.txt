My husband and I got married end of August 2015 at the Estate.\nWe had our ceremony and reception along with cocktail hour all at the same venue . \nWhen we first booked the Estate , it was run by a different person  ( George) by the time of our wedding the owners had changed , but it was ok since the staff and suppliers ( food ) was all the same . \nLalith was the person we were working with and he accomidated all the things we wanted .\nThe food was really good , all our guests loved it.\nWe had selected the chicken and beef combo plate that came with potatoes , carrots and broccoli .\n\nWe were satisfied with the service we got , especially since we had lots of demands.\nWe had one of the upstairs room for the ceremony , and the downstairs for the cocktail hour .\nAs the cocktail hour was going on the ceremony room was being prepared for reception , giving us the whole entire upstairs ( 2 rooms ) for our 160 people reception.\n\nWe dropped off all our stuff the night before to Lalith and the next day morning preparations had started .\n\nThe venue its self is pretty simple and nice , but you can always bring in a florist \/ decorator to decorate it your way .\nLots of parking space as well .\n\nOverall , I would recommend this place to host an event. As in any venue , get everything in writting.
