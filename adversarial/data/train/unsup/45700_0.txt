The food here was good, I got exactly what I ordered.  The Egg Rolls were probably the best I've ever had.  \n\nThis just isn't a place you want to eat at.  It's ok to order to go or have it delivered.  There were boxes everywhere and they literally boxed me in while I was in the restroom.  \n\nHaving said that the food was quite good.\n\nI will definitely go back but it will be a to go order.
