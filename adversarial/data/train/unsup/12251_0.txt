We hadn't gone back in a couple of years. I got a Groupon deal, pay $15 for $30 of food. Why not?  Service was excellent, our waitress was extremely attentive and proactive.  We ordered a raspberry iced tea and a lemonade. $2.95 each, free refills. Cups are 32oz. We had the mozzarella stick with marinara sauce at $8.99. Overpriced for what they are. Tasted fine but l think the Gilbert location does a better job than this one in Chandler.  Next l had the fish taco.  It consisted in small nuggets of fried fish topped with a pick de Gallo, shredded red cabbage. Tacos were lined by two corn tortillas each.  The bean dip tasted very good and it was my favorite part of the meal. I ate part of it, left the excessive amount of corn tortilla and foufou chips. I disliked those little fish nuggets, they reminded me of dry dog food, round and brown.   Ron had the chicken macmac, shredded chicken in penne pasta topped with cheese sauce. He ate it but left half of it and didn't ask for a to go box, it wasn't the kind of food worth eating twice.
