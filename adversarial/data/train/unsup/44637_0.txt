Horrible business! They came in and basically trashed my house from floors, counters, appliances etc were all covered in a chemical that ruined my stainless steel.  They even coated our kitchen knives with chemicals. My wife and i took several hours re cleaning the entire house. While having the tile and grout cleaned they drug the hose from machine through the house rubbing the baseboards and damaging them. While cleaning tile they got chemicals all over the bottom of my stainless steel appliances causing them to rust! Then they left puddles of water everywhere causing the paint to start peeling from baseboards as well.  They also stained the concrete on the walkway to the front door with the chemicals. When i got home several hours later the house smelt HORRIBLE! I could go on with other issues but I think you get the clue. So I contacted the owner and was told they guarantee their work for 24 hours. He came and my wife went over all the issues. He said he takes full responsibility and will have it all fixed. I sent him 15+ pictures of all the issues as well. He said he'd contact me the next day. Never heard from him. Then i get a notification that they fully charged my card that i never authorized to use especially considering all these issues. I try to call and of course no answer and no call back. I call 2 business days later and finally get him on the phone and basically tell him i don't want them in my house again and to refund my money for at least the tile\/grout cleaning. After he has to call the tile guy he finally agreed to refund for that part. Which by the way i had already disputed the charge with my credit card. So in summary i DO NOT recommend this company to anyone.
