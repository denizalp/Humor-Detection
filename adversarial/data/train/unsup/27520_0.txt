I love my dogs pictures I'm so excited for them to be finished! We received a groupon for a Christmas gift! Jennifer is very good with the dogs and the pawrents! We had a good time getting our dogs to pose on such cute lil furniture!! For everyone crying about the prices I'm pretty sure you knew what you were getting into! I did and I'm not a rocket scientist! Just a dog lover!! There was absolutely NO high pressure at all! Thanks Jennifer
