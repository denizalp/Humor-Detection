Wear your Kevlar vest if you go fo shoes here!\nWhen they call out YOUR shoe size...watch out!  You *will* get run over!  They bring out these huge bins and yell out \"Women's, size 7\" and people come running out of nowhere!\nI love Last Chance.  I shop here quite often, actually.  Shoes.  Shoes.  Skirts.  Shoes.  I will spend a couple hours here, hunting for the bargains!\nI would give it more stars if they had more people working here.  I mean, they KNOW the place is gonna be mobbed!
