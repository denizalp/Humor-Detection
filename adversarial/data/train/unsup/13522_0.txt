My doctor tells me I'm not getting enough fiber in my diet, explaining how fiber is nature's broom. How I should eat more vegetables for a healthier lifestyle.\n\nI say he's full of shit, rationalizing how Coor's light, made of pure Rocky Mountain spring water and a host of other boiled veggies, along with Doritos, also made of veggies,  have made me practically a vegan of sorts.\n\nOk, so maybe he is right.\nMaybe I should eat more veggies.\nBut the veggies you get at the grocery store are laden with Agent Orange...a toxic chemical designed to exfoliate rain forests. \nNow what?\n\nSingh Farms.\nA twenty acre organic farm on the corner of Thomas and the 101, where despite its sneaky disguise, is sitting there growing all kinds of healthy stuff guaranteed to sweep your digestive tract faster than a Canadian curling team.\n\nYes, this place is the bomb. Literally.\nNo more Metamucil, Turbo-lax, or Colon-blo.\nKen Singh's veggies will clean you out like a guest contestant on Poker All Stars.\n\nThere's one more reason to come visit here.\nIt's a Saturday morning respite from your week's grind, with its long, winding paths and the many shaded table areas to sit and ponder life...as you kill time, hoping the bimbo-du-jour back at your apartment has packed up her stilettos and bounced.
