I am editing this review to include Trent PA.\nHe was pleasant to deal with over the phone and initially I had a good impression; however over time I have felt a little uneasy with him. He made us feel a little creepy, could work on some things. Overall the office was still nice I just would not recommend seeing the PA.\n\nI highly recommend this office. My daughter had a small ski accident so after an ER visit, we had to follow up here the next week.\n\nDr Hrasky is great, he's calm, listened to my daughter and me, explained everything very well-what the injury was, the treatment plan, and expected recovery.\n\nThe in office x-Ray machine is really nice and shows a lot of neat live images while the Dr uses it.\n\nHis assistant was great too. Really thorough and seems to genuinely like kids.\n\nThe front desk staff was nice enough. They try their best to answer all administrative questions and explain the financial info.\n\nThe prices were great and very reasonable, I have commercial insurance but they collect the full amount up front if you have a high deductible. They were talking to another patient about a payment plan so possibly they do that too.
