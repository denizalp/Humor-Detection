My name is Ann Lewis- I stayed at the South cove apartments Aug 2017-Feb 2018. It was clean quiet and for the price and everything included a great value. The staff was stellar and someone always there to assist you. Thank you to Patty who went above and beyond to accommodate with my move in and out. Also to Rayes, Marcela, and Brandon. I would definitely rent there again. Great job thanks to all of you. Ann
