Worst customer service experience I've had in a really long time. Seriously I am shocked. Allow me to explain.\nI saw the groupon being offered and I read the reviews. Sounded great. I always have a credit, coupon or something with groupon but I also know they take a big cut from the salon.\nSo I called the salon asking if they would prefer to honor the groupon price. She didn't answer the phone but replied only in text. Her voicemail box wasn't set up. Anyway She said yes. Great right? So then I asked how much for a retouch? She replied (via text) $60. Knowing that I had benefits to buying through groupon yet were foregoing them for HER benefit only, I asked if she would do the retouch for $50? Doesn't hurt to ask right? After all that is how much I usually pay for my retouches that I have done every 3 weeks. That wasn't a deal breaker. It's $10. It was just a question. Her response was like \"how does that seem fair?\". I felt compelled to explain myself on text like \" forget the $10. I just have groupon bucks I would have preferred to have used..\" Yadda yadda. Lol. Just a return phone call would have resolved things, at the very least have allowed me to make an appt! \nLong story short it took from Sunday morning to 10pm on Tuesday night for her to rudely tell me to find another stylist. \nI normally only take to Yelp to write raving 5 star reviews. However beings this salon seems to display zero professionalism it had to be documented. I am adding a screenshot of the conversation cuz it has to be seen to be believed.
