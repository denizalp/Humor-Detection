Had high hopes for this place after reading the positive reviews, so was a bit disappointed. \nI bought one slice of the 3:15 cake and 3 types of tart. The mousse in the cake wasn't as airy as expected and tea flavour was not fragrant or distinct. Some reviews mentioned that their desserts are not too sweet like other places, but I cannot agree.
