Who doesn't like cold stone creamery?! They had a very friendly and patient staff. A couple new flavors I either hadn't noticed or just didn't have back home in California. And the mixture was done right. I think next time I'll get the chocolate dipped waffle bowl instead of the regular waffle bowl. My moms bowl was just better than mine. I thought it might be too much chocolate with my ice cream but I was wrong. You can't have too much chocolate. Don't make the same mistake I did.
