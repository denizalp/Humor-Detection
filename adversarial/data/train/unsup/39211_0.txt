Five stars for service and ambiance but less than stellar on the price point and the seasonings.  We shared a 22 oz ribeye and forgot to order the Gorgonzola topping.  Our fault but you would think they would then be sure to add something to the meat.  While it was buttery soft the flavor was lacking.  This is a steak house first and foremost and I expected the steak to be tremendous, it wasn't.  The drinks were good but again at a price I would avoid most times.\n\nThe service was very attentive with multiple waiters checking on us all of the time.\n\nWe had the kitchen sink salad, again ok but nothing to write home about.  The mushroom side was good as we're all of the sides we tried.\n\nOverall, really not worth the price.  Why GVR sees themselves able to charge strip prices is beyond me. Had it not been a celebration for someone I can't see coming back.  I go for the food, the setting is not something I want to pay a lot extra for.  I can get two good Henderson steak dinners, better seasoned for the same money.  If you are more interested in the setting, the service and having a long, leisurely dinner then Hanks might be perfect for you.
