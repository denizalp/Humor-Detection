In terms of hibachi restaurant experiences, Kanji is on the top of my list. The large open space has 4 hibachi grills with open seating around them. Yes, you might sit next to a stranger (gasp!), but isn't that half the fun? The staff was excellent and made our evening a joy. Dropping the sake into our sake bombs, being quick with a refill and even taking some flavored sake shots with us. Speaking of, you should def imbibe in a few of those shots. They are delicious and relatively low in potency. \n\nThe food was excellent as well. The steak was cooked perfectly to order and stayed tender (I always find that food cooked on a hibachi grill it hardens up rather quickly), scallops were large, beef tataki was tatasty and the fried rice and accompanying sauces were great accompaniments to the meat. I've had quite a few hibachi chef's who come in, do their routine and then walk off like nothing happened. That wasn't the case here. Our dude, was crackin' jokes, talking to us, making some new rice art (Sponge Bob!) and an all around good dude. \n \nGrab a group of friends and head on over here! (Just make sure you go low sodium for a few days after). \n\nProtip: free sake bomb with Yelp check-in!
