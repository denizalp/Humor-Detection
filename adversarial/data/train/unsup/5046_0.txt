Whenever I'm in Calgary--and it's not as much as it should be--I wet my whistle at The Cellar.\n\nThey have a good selection of wines from around the world.  I was impressed by the Washington state selection--as a big fan of that viticultural area I'm hugely disappointed in what's available in many parts of the USA.\n\nA number of wine regions have sprouted up in Canada, and like the larger neighbor to the south, some of those places--but certainly not all--have been successful.  And you can try a pretty broad sampling here.\n\nCanada has world class dessert wines, particularly icewines, by such luminaries as Inniskillin from the Niagara area.  And at The Cellar you can find the increasingly successful reds from the Okanagan valley.  The foray into Pinot Noir has been successful, though I do think they are a bit overpriced for comparable quality in other areas.  \n\nThe big stunner to me was that the Syrahs coming out of Canada are quite tasty--a surprise simply because heavier reds haven't been successfully in Upstate NY.  (If you'd like to debate that last point, message me with a successful Finger Lakes red and I'll try it on the next visit there.)\n\nA good shop with a good location and good wine.
