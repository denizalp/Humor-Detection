Nice ambiance. You can tell they take pride in their place. Not used to barbershops with interior decorating. No appointment so a slight wait which is expected. We are from out of town and didn't have time to get child's hair cut before we left. Nice even cut and son said it didn't hurt (he's always scared of the clippers). Only weird thing is it smells like eggs? Maybe they use sulfur or something in the hair products??
