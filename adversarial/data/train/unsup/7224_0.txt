East End to me is still one of the best breweries around. You might even say pioneers in the game of craft beers and IPAs. \nAlong Came A Cider has been one of my faves for awhile now. \nFinally tried the Food Rescue 412 loaf pour and it is so good. The fact that it's made from bread is a wonderful way to rid of unnecessary food waste.\nThe location is standard brewery architecture and decor. More barebones than some of the newer places and definitely compared to their newer location in the Strip. But, I like it. A lot. Simpler is better. Especially when it's all about the beer!
