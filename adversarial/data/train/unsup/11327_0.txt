Bee-sting cake! Bee-sting cake! Bee-sting cake! Do not leave without ordering AT LEAST one of those things. \nThe couple in front of us spoke German and seemed to know what they were ordering so we ended up copying their entire order. \nThe cinnamon swirl was 99 cents, but hard and too sugary- not my favorite.  \nThe almond coffee cake was soft and had a nice almond filling in the center. You might want to skip it if you aren't a nutty, almond lover. 5\/5 for me. \nThe cheesecake tasted very similar to the almond coffee cake. Do not expect it to taste like American cheesecake. 4\/5. \nThey normally accept credit cards, but their machine wasn't working when we went in. Make sure you have cash! Their day old bread is significantly discounted- lots of rolls and loaves!
