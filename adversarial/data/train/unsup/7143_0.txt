(Lyrics George Michael - Faith)\n\nOh but I need some Yelping from that brewery\nTime to pick my appetite off the floor\nOh and when that beer comes down \nWithout frothy foam\n\nWell it takes a strong brew baby\nand I'm ordering your nachos\nBut I'm showing you the door\n\nCause I gotta have McFate\nI gotta have McFate\nCause I gotta have McFate, McFate\nCause I gotta have McFate, McFate, McFate\n\n\nMc-Yeah!  This place is close enough where I can bike myself to which is always a plus in my books.  The place itself provides a open atmosphere and has somewhat of a under-construction look.\n\nMy buds and I sat at the high top tables and order their craft brews.  I ordered the Nelson Pale Ale; I'm not much of a beer drinker these days nor can I say I'm an expert when it comes to hops and sorts.  Needless to say, I love a beer where I can actually taste the difference between each other!  \n\nWe started with appetizers and our server was quite helpful in making a decision.  I wasn't too hungry, but my buddy was so we ordered the Hummus & Harissa Plate and the Nachos.  The hummus was a house made garlic hummus and came with veggies and pita bread.  I thought this start was a delight and you can definitely taste the garlic!  Our nachos was huge and came with homemade chili, jalapenos, cilantro, sour cream and guacamole.  I regret not adding chicken to it; but overall and solid and probably one of my favorite nacho appetizer I've had in a long time.  Matter of fact I would say this is top 3 for sure!  We ended the night with dessert skipping entree since after the super awesome nacho we had nothing left!  We order the chocolate mousse with Oreo and whipped cream.  Again, what a pop to the senses!  Both smooth and creamy with a crunchy texture.  It was definitely appealing to the eye but also our appetite!\n\nIn the end McFate is definitely a must return for this Yelper, but also a great recommendation for beers, drinks, and great atmosphere! - Enjoy!
