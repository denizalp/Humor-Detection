I'm always satisfied with the food. It's always made to order and never disappoints a hungry pallet. The service sometimes can be slow, but it has a tendency to be busy on most all of my visits. I've been here 5 times and plan on returning again in the future. Fun and friendly atmosphere. More geared though towards adults, but kids are welcome!
