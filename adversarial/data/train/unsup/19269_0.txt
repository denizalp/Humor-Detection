This is some of the worst Chinese food I've had in memory.  This is like those places they used to have in the suburbs in the midwest in the 80s.\n\nEvery single item was either deepfried or covered in a sauce loaded with extra sugar, guai lo style.\n\nI got the appetizer sampler which was just several versions of slightly different shaped, bland, tasteless, deep fried eggroll and wonton-ish looking things - dripping with oil.\n\nOrdered the salt and pepper pork chop because of another yelp review and also they list it as Chef's special.  These turned out to be double breaded and deep fried pieces of pork with a ton of bone still on.  Some pieces was just deep fried bone. And the extra, extra, extra breading they coat it with is completely bland and tasteless.  I think they should call it the NO SALT OR PEPPER pork chop.\n\nI also ordered the Kung Pao chicken \"extra spicy please\".  Aside from a couple of stray peppers, the dish had zero heat.  It was also chock full of zucchini.  Loooooootttts of zucchini.  They should've called it Kung Pao Zucchini with a couple little pieces of dry chicken breast.  And this dish was not seasoned at all - nothin'.  No salt, not even a little MSG.\n\nThe only dish that was passable was the young chow fried rice.  Good enough, not oily, but once again completely underseasoned.  \n\nI give'em two stars because they seemed nice and fried rice was sorta ok.  I'm never calling them again.
