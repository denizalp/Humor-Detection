Just saw the Grapes of Death here tonight.  A French zombie flick from the 70s that actually wasn't too terrible.  I've never really been into foreign films of any genre but this flick was quite entertaining.  The theater had  a bunch of movie theater style seats with some plastic chairs in front for when it gets really busy(like when they screen Dr. Who or The Evil Dead).  There were only a few people here tonight but everybody was really friendly.  The owner was really cool.  They have a sale going on for buy one item get 50% off another.  I picked up an X-files comic and a Hannibal Lecter figure for about $20.  Their comics selection isn't the biggest by far but I was here for the movie anyway and it did not disappoint.  For $5 it's hard to beat.
