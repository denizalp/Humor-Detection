Great place to eat! We have one in Orlando but we haven't eaten there. The atmosphere was great and gsw won! We ordered the calamari and it came with like an avocado lime ranch dip. My BF ordered the salmon cooked medium with pork belly and peas! His dish was delicious. I ordered the wild mushroom rav. It was decent but I wish I would have ordered my bfs plate lol. I ate off his plate anyway :) to end our meal we ordered the ice cream sandwich which had caramelized bananas, brownies, NUTELLA and banana ice cream!!!!!  we tore it up! The server was awesome and we had so many refills on our water. We didn't have to wait long for our food. I looooooved this place! :)
