If you have acai, it won't be too long before I find you.  An equal opportunity acai bowl eater, I stopped by Vitality Bowls last weekend since I was in the area.  A hot, new business for the Mountain's Edge neighborhood, this is a great place to get your acai fix. The menu lists 10 different acai bowls, plus dessert and oatmeal bowls. You can also request gluten-free according to the menu.  \n\nI chose the small 20 oz. Vitality Bowl with acai, bananas, strawberries, flax seed, organic granola, goji berries, and honey.  Usually $8.99, Charlie the owner gave me $1 off since this was my first visit; he did this for another customer who came in after me, too!  I liked my acai bowl very much and the small size was more than enough for me.  I think the only things that were missing for me were coconut flakes.  \n\nBe sure to use your Yelp check-in offer of 15% off!  I'll definitely be back.
