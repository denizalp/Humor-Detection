Steak was under cooked, staff was slow, and to top it off, we hear the manager arguing loudly with the elderly couple across from us about how they didn't know what medium was. So what you're telling me is we ordered two steaks cooked the same way and we're complaining about the wrong one? The one we think is good is actually over cooked?....
