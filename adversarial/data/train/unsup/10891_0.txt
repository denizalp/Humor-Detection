Was with some friends celebrating my last night of being 39 and we headed on down to The Rock to catch the  Cabaret Roche show, where burlesque, vaudeville & drag all collide into one! We were a lil early and learned that the well drinks were buy one get one free before 8 and boy oh boy did we take advantage of that, well maybe I did haha\n\nThe show was amazing, had such fun time, I love it when I can look around the room and see all my friends laughing and having a good time and knowing like me, they are really enjoyed the night! And I love love love Pandora!! She is the coolest!  Such a fun show & night! \n\nI don't know why it took me so long to get down to the Rock, but I know I am coming back!
