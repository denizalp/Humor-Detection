My experience at this locations has been EXCELLENT. The staff from check-in (Michelle) to treatment (Ashley) to exit - fivestars .. I had the clear & brilliant treatment this afternoon. Ashley was a total professional. She listened to my concerns, made sure I was comfortable during treatment, and is very knowledgeable and competent certified laser tech with great people skills. I do recommend this location !\nOriginally, I had bought my clear & brilliant package at Phoenix location on camelback. The certified laser techs that performed my few early treatments were great, but I had a couple problems with scheduling (wrong scheduled times when they send you reminder notice). After a couple of mix ups, I decided to come to the Scottsdale location for my remaining treatments. I am very happy to have switched locations.
