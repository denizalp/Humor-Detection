40 seats in the whole restaurant so it's cozy. Open till 3am which is amazing.\n\nPortions are small, and prices are high... Im a healthy eater and I also like to try lots of things, but I ordered soup, the fried seabass, extra noodles, chu-chee lobster, and another dish and still was not full, despite the check being well over $75. The first time I went, I was not asked how spicy, and boy all the dishes came out blazingly hot. The true Thai experience. The next visit, I asked them to tone it down just a notch and it was perfect for me. \n\nPros:\nGreat flavor\n\nCons:\nSmall Portions\nHigh Price\nPay extra for rice or noodles\n\nI'm rating this restaurant purely on taste and not price or value.
