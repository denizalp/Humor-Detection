I stopped in for a side salad and a Shamrock shake.  They were all out of Shamrock shakes and there was a week to go before St. Patrick's Day.  Disappointment!\n\nThe side salad was just what I wanted to take home and I was out and on my way quickly.\n\nThis is a bit out of the way because you have to go north of Sahara to get to it and then back to go west on Sahara.\n\nThis is a backup outlet only if I'm in the area.
