I am really not into cardio, but I've been coming to this studio for the last 6 years and am simply addicted. Every class is a new challenge and my only goal is to keep going. The instructors are motivating and inspiring and it's always a great group of people that attend. This studio is unique and the classes are exciting and fun while actually focusing on a full body work-out and not just legs.\nENJOY!
