We went for dinner last night and it was just ok.  Definitely wasn't the best burger I ever had.  Our waiter was nice, food was served quickly however the food was just ok.  There were 5 of us and we all said the same thing, \"it's ok\".  I was really hoping for an amazing burger for the price we paid, $11.50 for a burger & $2.50 additional for fries.  My stepdaughter had a milkshake which was very good but also was $6.75.  As my husband said \"been there, done that, check this place off our list\"
