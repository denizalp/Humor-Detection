Ehh...I won't be back. Trendy isn't always bad, but Arrogant Butcher exemplifies trendiness while sacrificing the food + experience factor. With a large group, I had the cioppino ($25--which I was sooo excited about) and a martini (about $9). It was fine. No major complaints. However, it just wasn't worth it. \n\nI definitely splurge on food more than I should, but Arrogant Butcher just left me feeling disappointed. Not because of anything specific, but a general sense of ennui. \n\nYour money can be put to better use elsewhere...
