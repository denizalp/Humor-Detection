Wife heard an interview on the radio (Beth and Friends Show) from a Social Tap employee mentioning free meals for dads on Fathers Day. We decided to try a new place out of the many, many choices in Scottsdale and Arcadia. When we arrived, I asked about the \"Social Hour\" menu since it was after 4pm on Sunday. Waitress said that, \" We don't have that meanie that this location\" despite it having Scottsdale listed on the menu. Not an acceptable answer\n\nWe ordered and ate good food. Got the bill and my meal was still listed. Asked her to take it off and she said, \"it was only for brunch.\"  \n\nDo not appreciate dishonest businesses even if the food is good. I will tell everyone about my bad experience.
