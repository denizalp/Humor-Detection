We bought a dinner + show package for Cirque's Beatles Love show on Vegas.com. This place is very expensive so we probably wouldn't have eaten here otherwise. \n\nWe arrived at the very beginning of our seating time which was between 5 and 6 pm since the show was at 7 pm. The place was pretty empty so we got a great table next to the watery garden area. We had a total of three servers that accommodated our table, so we always had everything we needed. \n\nWe were given a Prix Fixe menu valued at $40 a meal which included an appetizer, entree and dessert. They had lots of fancy options for the main course like filet mignon and salmon but nothing for vegetarians. The waitress assured me that the chef could prepare a special dish. Three of us ordered glasses of wine, which were about an additional $10 a pop.   \n\nI started off with the beet salad, which was delicious - I just wish there was a little bit more of it. When it was time for our entrees, I got a plate of perfectly prepared carrots, kale, mushrooms, mashed potatoes and asparagus. Dessert was this huge, rich slice of chocolate torte. I literally cleaned every plate put in front of me.  \n\nSo with our lovely view of the indoor water garden came these little birds that were chirping and fluttering around. One actually perched unbeknownst to us on the lattice ceiling and dropped a bomb on my mom's arm. We all thought it was funny, but when my dad casually mentioned it to the waitress, she said it was a big deal and got the manager. He apologized profusely and comped the additional $60 bill we had from the taxes on our meal and the beverages. We really weren't that upset but it was a very nice gesture. \n\nThe meal was timed perfectly and we had plenty of time to get to the theater and find our seats. So besides a little bird trouble, this place was great!
