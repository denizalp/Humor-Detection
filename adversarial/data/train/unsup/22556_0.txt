Back in September i went in because my car was over heating.  Dave handled me when i walked through the door and was a complete prick.  He would not give me the time of day to discuss the problem I was having and the research i did to find out what the issue could be.  \n\nThey charged mje $150 and stated that i needed new hoses. They told me the job would take an hour to complete and they would call me when my car was ready to go.  3 hours later i called and Dave testily told me that he would let me know when my work was done.  I finally went in 2 hours after that to pick it up.  I didn't even make it home before my car was overheating again so i went back, and after being rudely rushed along and cut off, they replaced the thermostat that i had put in saying that it was installed incorrectly. I was charged another $75 for the work.  I then tried to go home and couldn't even get out of the parking lot before my car was over heating again. Took it back and was told that it was the water pump that needed to be replaced for $350.  i wised up and went to a private mechanic that was referred to me by a friend and got the issue fixed.    \n\nDO NOT go here under any circumstances!!!  The service was horrible and the mechanics (if thats what you want to call them) were shady and will try to bilk you out of as much money as possible.  Its too bad for good honest mechanics that they are tainted by the \"mechanics\" that work at this garbage establishment.  C'mon Champaign, lets avoid them and gleefully watch this shop go under!!
