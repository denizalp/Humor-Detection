You know how there are some places around Charlotte that you don't feel cool enough to go into? The hipsters have invaded and your pants aren't tight enough and your glasses are too small.... Central Coffee is NOT one of those places. It's welcoming, warm and the staff is super friendly!\n\nI came here for coffee before South End Small Business Saturday. I was working with the Third Rock crew and wanted to fuel up before being a trolley tour guide - I know, it's a fun life. ANYWAY, walked in here and immediately felt welcomed. The colors are warm, it smells great, and the staff is friendly. They even have a little stand up front that has frames on it with the word \"share\" in them. The sign on it says, \" Did your Mama teach you to SHARE? Put one of these at your table to let others know you don't bite.\" I LOVE THAT IDEA. Have you ever been somewhere and there weren't open tables, but a BUNCH of open seats at other tables? Let's share! Beautiful idea. \n\nI will definitely be back to this coffee shop time and time again. The coffee is delicious - I had the caramel lattee. Parking isn't ideal, but not too bad either.
