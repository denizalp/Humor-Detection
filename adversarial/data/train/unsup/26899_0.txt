Worst bank with the worst customer service I've ever encountered. I've never heard a representative of a company sigh so many times with a customer walking through the door, and talking to them. If you'd like to go through the same experience, go to this location and speak with Erica. The other rep named Cassandra wasn't worse, but I won't say she was much better. So much attitude, but I hear that might be the standard with other locations as well, which is disappointing. Definitely won't be back if I don't have to.
