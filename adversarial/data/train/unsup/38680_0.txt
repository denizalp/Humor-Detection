I made an appointment online to go to their minute clinic, on Tuesday afternoon(i had a severe UTI and wasnt able to get into my doc) They had an appointment available for 2:00 so i had to leave work at 1:40 (its in walking distance). When i arrivedtheir systems were down so i was unable to sign in on their machine, so i went to the pharmacy and told them i was there for my 2:00 appt. They told me to just let the nurse know once i see her pop her head out the door. 2:20 rolls around and still nothing ( there is probably 4 others waiting too) i go back to the pharmacy just to make sure they havent forgotten about me and about 10 min later the nurse comes out. I walk up to her and tell her im here for the 2:00 and she is as rude as can be and says\"sorry but im going to lunch i wont be able to see you until after 4\" WTF?! I left in tears, had to go to a different one that was 30 miles away (in rush hour traffic). Very unprofessional! Nobody was on the same page or knew what was going on and the NP on duty was very rude and unapologetic! I dont recommend going here!
