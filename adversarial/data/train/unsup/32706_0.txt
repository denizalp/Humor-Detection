This is a nice little brunch place. My friend and I shared the heuvos rancheros and the red velvet pancakes. Have you ever even heard of red velvet pancakes before?! It wasn't AS heavenly as it could have been, but it was still delicious! It's a bit out of my way, but it's worth going to. Decently priced, yummy, and good service. What more could you need??
