I've been going here for 20+ years. I moved far away in the valley years ago but still made the trek but haven't for more than 5 years. This place was DELICIOUS once upon a time. Hence me making the 30 minute trek. However when comparing the fajita goodness to even Jack in the Box's fajita pita this place has taken a nose dive. The tortillas of thin, fresh goodness have become chilly thick pillows of gummy yuck. Maybe the machine setting, heat & salt could fix this? There weren't any peppers on the platter only onions. The shrimp were the size of a nickel. My \"michelada\" was horrible. Tasted like watered down tomato juice. No flavor what so ever. The chips\/salsa always were sub par so no loss there. They are exactly the same. Just a bummer all the way around. The best part was the kind, speedy staff member named Josh. He rocked even at a busy Saturday lunch time. This place is in desperate need of a make over. Just a shell of what used to be there. So sad that a childhood fave has fallen to this.
