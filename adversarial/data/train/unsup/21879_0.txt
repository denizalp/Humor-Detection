Being a girl from Philly I usually have very high standards when it comes to cheese steaks! lol. & I gotta say this place is pretty up there! \n\nI bought a Groupon so we wanted to use it this past weekend. I've actually been here a few times at their old location. We all know this is the place to go after the clubs at 2 am. It's that \"drunk food\" I guess you can say. lol. I ordered the steak hoagie while my boyfriend got the regular cheese steak. If you're going to get a cheese steak here you have to get it with the Cheese Wiz! When you check in you also get a free order of fries. \n\nI liked the service here because usually any business that I've been to you can't combine the Groupons with the Yelp deals. It's either one or the other. So not only did we get to use our Groupon but BOTH my boyfriend and I got to use our Yelp deals for the free fries. I ordered the house made ranch as well which is usually 50 cents but they gave it to me for free. The only negative was that it took a while for them to actually place our order. \n\nThis is probably the only place that I'll ever go to get a Philly Cheese steak here. Everything was really delicious though and I was basically in a food coma after we left! =)
