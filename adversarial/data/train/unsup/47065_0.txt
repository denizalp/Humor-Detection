This place is fantastic. For it being a wood scrap yard there were a lot of people coming and going. I found what I was looking for after walking the property.\nI went there looking for 2 vintage windows to use in my wedding and the first guy I asked showed me the area where the Windows are but not what I was looking for, all the glass was broken out and I was looking for ones with the glass. So I ventured off to look to see if anything caught my eye and ended up being asked by one of the owners what I was looking for and he actually had a good stack at there other warehouse down the street. He directed me over there with letting one of his guys know I was on my way, found EXACTLY what I wanted. The guys were trusting enough to let me put the Windows in my car and drive back to the other location and pay, I was shocked considering you seem to not be able to trust anyone these days. Very great customer service! \n\nWhile waiting to walk the property I walked into the main building and saw some awesome pieces that they have done. Also when you walk the property you see some of the things they are actually working on, very neat to see how a scrap piece of wood could turn into a complete beauty! Will be returning when wood is needed.
