My daughter had her wedding at Bella Rose this past weekend. The setup is pretty nice as you walk into the estate. It's a nice garden setup for an outdoor wedding. \n\nThe bridal room and grooms room is setup really nicely. Big roomie and they basically provide everything you need for a wedding. \n\nThey provide the wedding planner which we had Gabriela, they have specific vendors for food, DJ, florists, photography, and cakes. You can even bring your own liquor. \n\nThe whole wedding ran very smoothly. There was also about 3 others girls from Bella Rosa helping out too. Nice wedding, reception, and banquet. \n\nOnly problem I had was the the banquet. Don't get me wrong. The decorations were great, table setup was great, flowers, and DJ outstanding, but the food they pick was for a plated meal. The salad was okay. There was either chicken or beef. They said chicken was pretty good, but the beef. Not good at all. They served us almost a hamburger patty over gravy. It was dry and not very good. Just remember the wedding couple gets to chose the menu. Service was slow because they didn't have enough servers. \n\nSo other than the dinner service and the food, it was great. I loved the friendliness of the Bella Rosa staff. Very accommodating. I thought it was great. We had around 165 and it seemed that was perfect for this site. Anything over might be stretching it for the ceremony. The banquet facilities can hold much more\n\nAnyways, great wedding venue. My daughter and now Son-In-Law, really did enjoy themselves. Bella Rosa took all the stress out of the wedding. Enjoy. We sure did.
