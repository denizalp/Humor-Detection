We got this as a groupon and went for lunch. My fianc√© loved the carving station! I enjoyed the shrimp. But the service totally sucked the lady acted like it was an issue we wanted water and booze? In all it was ok I would give it a 2.5 star but figured I would be nice and go three for what we paid it was good.
