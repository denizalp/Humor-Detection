The number one reason I go here is for the salad that comes with.  The dressing is very memorable!\n\nI usually get  the plate here with teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef and teriyaki shrimp.  It also comes with rice, the salad (so good!) and two orange wedges.\n\nThe staff is friendly.  The place is clean, even the rest rooms.  There is plenty of seating and their portions are generous.\n\nDon't let my review make up your mind for you.  Just drive by the store front and roll the window down... I bet that'll be enough for you to park and hurry in!
