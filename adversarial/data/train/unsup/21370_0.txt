Lunch Special?\n\nThe waitress did not even know that lunch special existed until I pointed to the posters on the windows. Should I be worry??\n\nBraised Beef Soup Noodle ($6.99) was a good size but tasted bland and forgettable. Maybe I should stick with grilled items? The restaurant is named Grill Legend?\n\nJust a really confusing experience. I got more confused when the waitress asked me if I wanted soy milk or soup. Then came back and said my order did not come with that....\n\nWill I be back? Probably not.
