I'm paraphrasing here, but this is how the typical customer service call went in almost all my experiences.\n\nCox - Hi, how can I help you.\n\nMe - I am having trouble connecting to the internet at the moment. I've just finished resetting my computer, my router, and my modem. I checked all of my network cables, I'm able to communicate with other computers that are behind my router, and I just can't get to the internet. Is there a reported outage in my neighborhood at the moment?\n\nCox - Sorry to hear that. Can you please try unplugging your cable modem, waiting 15 seconds, and plugging it back in?\n\nMe - Uh, yes, like i said, I just did that like a minute ago.\n\nCox - Oh, can you just try again for me anyway?\n\nMe - I'm pretty sure there's a problem with the internet, can you just confirm if there are any reports in my neighborhood at the moment.\n\nCox - Are you sure it's not your wifi? Can you try plugging your computer directly into the modem?\n\nMe - (getting upset at this point) Sure, I'll plug my laptop into the modem. ... still not working. Is there a reported outage in my neighborhood? I'd just like to know if there's an outage that is getting worked on or not.\n\nCox - I'm showing that everything is online and no outage. I think maybe you should try resetting your modem again.\n\nMe - Really, do you have to ask me all these questions before you can answer if there is a reported outage in my neighborhood or not? \n\nCox - Yes, we need to go through the troubleshooting steps first.\n\nMe - FINE - I'll reset the dang modem again, for the third time.\nYep, still broke.\n\nCox - I think there is a problem with your cable lines, have you ever had trouble with mice? I know that sometimes animals can chew through the lines. If you'd like I can send a line repairman out to your house, but there will be a $100+ minimum charge to fix the cable lines in your house.\n\nMe - are you serious?\n\nCox - Yes, I have seen this before.\n\nMe - no, ARE.. YOU.. SERIOUS?\nDo you have a supervisor I can talk with?\n\nCox - My supervisor is busy at the moment, and they will tell you the exact same thing I am. I have the same information they do.\n\nMe - I really don't care, is your supervisor's supervisor available?\n\nCox - I'm sorry, why don't you try resetting your modem again.\n\nMe - GIVE ME YOUR SUPERVISOR NOW, please. I no longer wish to speak with you.\n\nCox Supervisor - Yes, I'm showing there is a reported outage in your neighborhood and the service truck is actually working on it now. If you look down the street at the X and X intersection you should see them doing scheduled work right now.\n\nMe - ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?! YOU'RE DOING SCHEDULED LINE WORK ON THE CONNECTION IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AT 7PM ON A WEDNESDAY EVENING? THIS IS REDICULOUS, AND WHY COULDN'T YOUR OPERATOR JUST TELL ME THIS WHEN I CALLED 45 MINUTES AGO?\n\nCox Supervisor - I am sorry sir, there is no reason to get upset at me the way you are.\n\nMe - PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR SUPERVISOR CAUSE YOUR BEING BELIGERANT WITH ME RIGHT NOW.\n\n\nCox, this is the reason I dislike calling you, no this wasn't a one time, unique experience, I've had very similar conversations over multiple calls. I'm so glad the relationship we had has finally moved on, and I'm not looking back!
