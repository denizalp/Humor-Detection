These ladies are absolute artists! I'm still amazed at how flawless my makeup was for New Year's Eve... and the best part? It lasted all night, despite the fact that I was outside and got rained on a bit.\n\nMy best friend and I booked appointments with The Sparkle Bar about two weeks in advance, and since both of us were getting our makeup done, we asked for the artists to come to the house. Candace showed up promptly, got her mini studio set up, and started working her magic. She was extremely pleasant and friendly -- it felt like one of my good friends was doing my makeup. She was very attentive as well with how I wanted my makeup done, and the finished product... wow! I was extremely impressed with my makeup, and it didn't feel heavy, gross, oily, and didn't have that \"caked-on\" look. I felt like a princess, just sayin'.\n\nCandace started my best friend's makeup as well, but then Leiah came to finish hers. And let me just say, Leiah is definitely a makeup guru. My friend's makeup was perfect -- elegant, yet still subtle. Leiah was so incredibly sweet and talkative; she made the experience that much better! One of our other girl friend's wanted to get her makeup done last-minute as well since she saw how amazing of a job these girls do... and Leiah was able to get her makeup done, too! How's THAT for amazing customer service?! Last minute on New Year's Eve? Leiah, you are absolutely amazing!!!\n\nI will definitely be back to The Sparkle Bar to get my makeup done. These girls know what they're doing. And as far as pricing goes, it's extremely reasonable. I figure every girl deserves to feel like a princess every now and again, right? So if you've got a special occasion to attend, or just want to get pampered and look beautiful and flawless, call The Sparkle Bar (or book online) -- do it! What are you waiting for?!
