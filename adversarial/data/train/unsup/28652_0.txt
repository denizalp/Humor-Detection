I've tried this location three times and each time liked it less.  My third visit will be my last.  I had the two meat plate of pulled pork and beef brisket with sides of bbq beans and potato salad and sweet tea.  I was there 20 minutes after they opened and my pulled pork was cold, the beef brisket was tender and served hot.  The bbq beans were way too watery, while the potato salad was decent.  The sweet tea was below average in quality.  Also, they over charged me on my order and instead of making the correction in the register and giving me the correct difference back, the employee reached into the tip jar and took out a dollar and handed it to me!\n\nWe can use more decent bbq places around the valley, but this location will not be one of them.
