Oh the power of a sign that is two minutes away from your house.\n\nLet me tell you a little story about how I was on my way to go pick up a salad... and then three little words stopped me in my tracks: Bacon Portabella Melt. Well, I'm not sure what happened next. The next thing I knew... I was at the drive-thru ordering one.\n\nWas it everything I had dreamed it would be? No. Was it tasty? Yeah, for a fast food burger. You know what would have made it better? If that Wendy chick would've delivered it to my house like she does in the commercial. Seriously, who wants to get up off the comfy couch?\n\nFor those judging me about cheating on my salad, I did sub a side caesar for my fries. I do have some will power... although \"some\" should be in really small font.\n\nThis location always has pretty good service. Never a long wait. The workers are nice.  It's super convenient on Park Road. However, it is super inconvenient to try to get back to Woodlawn Road.
