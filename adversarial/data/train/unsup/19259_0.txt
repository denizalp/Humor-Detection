I'm glad that I finally got around to trying out Gilcrease Orchard.\nI happily set my alarm clock for 6:30am on Tuesday morning and arrived just about 7am. \n\nIt costs $3 per vehicle to drive in or free to walk in (but you'll be walking a decent amount if you opt this route).  The kind lady at the gate showed me a map of where things were and how to get around.  \n\nI got some cucumbers, zucchini (which was outstanding) and tomatoes -- also outstanding.  I miss Jersey tomatoes and I'm happy to say to say these were pretty damn tasty.  I also managed to pick up my all time favorite, apple cider and I'll say one word - CRACK.  Holy cow that stuff is good.  I can't wait until the fall so I can stock up.\n\nI love the fact they don't use pesticides and that their items are generally organic in nature.  \n\nI'll be back soon for more tomatoes, peaches and zucchini soon :)
