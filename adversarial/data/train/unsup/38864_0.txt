Avoid this location like the plague. Literally every single time I go here which might be once a month, when I forget or didn't pack a lunch for work, they get something or the whole thing wrong. I either order a Southwest Chicken Salad (which i only made that mistake of getting once at this location) or 2 plain McChickens. The salad was a skimpy imitation of what you are supposed to get and my McChickens almost always end up with mayo or lettuce shreds, despite always ordering them without. Today was the last straw. I ordered 2 plain McChickens and yet again, incorrectly prepared. I naturally just removed what I didn't want, but its the principle. I've been here at least half a dozen times and I'm always disappointed.
