We had lunch at this buffet and it was good. It's not a mega buffet like you get on the Strip but it was quite decent.  They offered: pork chops, roast beef, turkey,  fried chicken, chicken wings, baked chicken, pizza, pasta, meatballs, stuffed shells (the best!)chinese food, mexican food, salad bar, soup of the day and of course all kinds of vegetables and carbs.( I don't eat seafood so I'm not sure what they had in that category.)They had lots of desserts and an ice cream machine.  They offered Pepsi products for drinks. And there was a wine menu to purchase by glass or bottle at a reasonable price. The employees were nice and super efficient. The restaurant was clean and very pleasant with very high ceilings. So for the price you cannot go wrong with this buffet unless you insist on caviar and champagne.
