Don't mistake this for the fabulous clothes Macy's, this is the HOME Macy's, which should make you cry even harder over all the control this store now has over your life. \n\nI love Macy's. I'm a black card member and have actually posted that on FB. Cry, girlfriends, cry. I spend more time here than I do on my relationships, my job or my animals (what???). I love it, I don't care.\n\nWent in looking for new bedding. Had a gift card to spend and there were specials. Can't imagine what you'd think I'd do. \n\nWalked in and met Linda. Who is this fabulous person? She persuaded me with her Macy's charm to walk out with $900 worth of merchandise (after gift card and discounts - $400). I did it so happily that I wonder if I've lost my mind. Until I wake up on 600 thread count Hotel Collection sheets with a duvet and pillows that make my room look like a million bucks. Then I bow to mecca AKA Macy's and Linda, of course.\n\nI love other stores, but for some reason this place draws me back again and again. They have quality merchandise at reasonable prices, their salespeople are always friendly and welcoming and their stores make you want to BE Macy's. Shop here, you'll love it!
