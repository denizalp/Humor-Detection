I have to agree with most of the reviews here, this place is great.  I recently bought a pair of progressives from them.  There was an older lady who worked there who was very helpful in assisting me with finding a pair of frames that looked good.  A younger lady measured and ordered my glasses and they were ready for pick up when they said they would be ready. \nThe owner was there when I picked up my glasses and he was very nice and made sure everything fit well.  They even gave me an extra glass cloth wipe and a bottle of glass cleaner.  The thing I really liked was they give you a plastic card and on the back is your exact prescription in case your ever travelling and your glasses break you can go to any optician  and you have your prescription with you!  Very good service and great prices, I highly recommend this place!
