We came in at 1am and I wasn't expecting much.   My bf works odd hours and he and his friends come here on occasion because they like the late night happy hour.   I was skeptical. \n\nAnd of course I was wrong!  I was fully surprised at how good the food was for that time of day and for that price.  Late night happy hours usually mean getting rid of the bad stuff but everything tasted fresh and delicious. \n\nI think I might be obsessed with the duck tacos.   Perfect balance of flavors and textures.   I also really liked the baba ganoush a lot.   It might be one of my favorites I've ever had. \n\nThe service was pretty good for just one bartender working.   One of the runners or cooks came out with him to help carry our food and knocked over a water glass.  Very quick to remedy the situation.   I really appreciated that. \n\nWill definitely be coming back!
