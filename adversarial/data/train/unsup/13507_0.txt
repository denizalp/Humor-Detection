Burger King is my kryptonite. I can avoid all other fast foods but this place is always hard to turn down. I love the food here. FLAME BROILED. Yum. I don't eat much fast food. Not that it is beneath me or anything but because it always gives me a really bad stomach ache when I do. \n\nBut not Burger King. I have always been able to eat here with no problems at all. So that is what keeps me coming back. Honestly, a nice Whopper Jr, or even the full Whopper Sr. ( my own name for it). Their fries are thick and crispy and not overly salty, and the Oreo milkshakes. Seriously guys! It cannot get any better.\n\nThis location is far enough away from me that I do not make a habit of coming here. But sometimes when coming back from a shopping trip at the Mills it is just too easy to come here. The staff is courteous and pleasant and always put up with me being like, way to excited than I should be for fast food. They answer questions that we have about the menu, I mean, tell me more about these hot spicy chicken tenders, and put up with my taking forever to order even though I know what I am going to get each time. \n\nThis place is my downfall, but if I am going down, I am doing it with some crispy fries and a nice Whopper Jr.
