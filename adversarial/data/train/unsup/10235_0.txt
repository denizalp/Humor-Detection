I have been  coming here for  10 years.  Dr Gailey and his staff are amazing.  Gateway family dentistry has really helped me take care of my teeth.   I just recently had a dental emergency and i called first thing in the morning and they got me in and taken  care of  right away.       The place is always super clean,  and the staff is so friendly. They always take the time to explain  everything, and make sure you are comfortable.  I highly  recommend  getway family dentistry.
