This coffee shop has the perfect atmosphere! It's welcoming and and extremely clean. The mom and pop feel to it is just right. I would rather give my money to them than going to spend outrageous amounts of my money to chain coffee places. Their sandwiches are small but suffice the appetite. My favorite thing about this place is the variety of flavors for coffee, especially the white coffee.
