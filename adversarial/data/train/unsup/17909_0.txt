We were craving Qdoba big time tonight and the Q at Park Central is closed so we drove out to find this location. Well, evi-fn-dently this location is in the university which is off limits for punks like us. Even the two mall-cop looking guards had a hard on for making it perfectly clear that we were on private university property. Well sue us for not knowing and breaking the law. We went to Chipotle wishing we had Qdoba. You get a single star just becauae.
