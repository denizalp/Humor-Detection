Good, friendly service is not something I've come to expect from a taco truck, but El Tacontento delivers service with a smile almost as big as the grinning, sombrero-wearing taco painted on the truck. I drive past this newer taco cart on my way to work, and one thing convinced me that I had to try it: the name! This stand in the parking lot of a tire shop across from Fiesta Rancho and the Westwind Drive-In Theater recently replaced another mobile vendor with not-so-memorable tacos and a name I can't remember.\n\nI requested a veggie burrito and was offered pinto beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, salsa, and crema inside a large flour tortilla. The rice was well seasoned and the Mexican-style sour cream made it even more delicious. I'll be back for this burrito for sure. My husband ordered a taco de birria and proclaimed it very tasty for his first time ever sampling birria. He was given a choice of corn tortilla: regular or fresh. Of course, he opted for the freshly pressed and griddled masa. Our total? $5. They offer bottled beverages, but I'd definitely like to see some horchata or other aguas.\n\nThe man and woman who took our order and prepared our food were so friendly and helpful that we will certainly return for mas tacos y burritos. Gracias and cuatro estrellas for El Happy Taco!
