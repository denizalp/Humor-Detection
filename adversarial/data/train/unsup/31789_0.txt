This is probably the most famous Persian restaurant in Toronto, always busy for a small place! I love the decor, it reminds me of home lol. The music and the atmosphere is amazing. The service was also really good. The waitresses speak Persian even though they're white. The food is amazing obviously! I've pretty much tried every dish and they're all fabulous.\nKEEP IN MIND that this place serves traditional Persian food, so no kabobs!!
