My first time here ever. \n\nA lot of cute stuff! It's like an interesting mix of a Bed Bath and Beyond and a Walmart. \n\nI ended up getting sucked into the home decorating station, but the isles are small. \n\nI ended up shattering a bowl because I didn't realize it wasn't attached, but they were so good about it, even if they talked about me behind my back. \n\nI'd definitely go back to shop.
