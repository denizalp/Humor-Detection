Good food, except fried chicken was a little greasy. The problem wasn't the food, but was the waitress AJ. We couldn't believe the attitude she had towards us. After she finally came over and took our order, she didn't return for over half an hour.  An update on the status of our order would have been nice. Was our order even turned in? We tracked her down at another table to ask and she completely snapped on my Dad telling him \"It hasn't been that long!\" and then told us how busy they were, with not a lot of customers there. The food finally came out after waiting over an hour.  She gave my son a small cup of bbq sauce and then I asked her for some. She responded with \"Isn't that enough?\" AJ disappeared again. She finally came back and we asked for the bill and to-go boxes. She brought only the bill so we reminded her about the boxes and she responded, \"I only have two hands!\"   She then practically threw the boxes at us. AJ needs to learn proper customer service or find another type of job.
