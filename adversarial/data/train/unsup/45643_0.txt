This place is wack, the pho is meh. They claim they have superior beef broth in their pho, rest assured it's not. I've had better broth out of a can from Safeway. \n\nThe server messed up my order too, I asked for no tripe and what do I get.... tripe. \n\nOrdered the wings, like super salty and just not good. \n\nService was rushed but the food did come out very fast. All in all I wouldn't come back next time I'm here.
