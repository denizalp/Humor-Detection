Mixed feelings about this place. The room is nice and high tech, but who comes to vegas for the room? Was here for 7 days and did not get any play for my $. The popular club makes this place a douche haven (The crowd was too young for my liking) and the food at just about every restaurant was grossly over priced for the few vegan options they offered.
