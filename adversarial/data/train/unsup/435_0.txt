Po-TAY-toe, po-TAH-toe... however you wanna slice it, throw it in a taco and it instantly goes from an 18th century Irish food staple to a modern day college student's Mexican eatery hit. Seriously, don't knock the potato tacos until you try them. They're unexpectedly good.\n\nBaja Bar & Grill sits in the same plaza as Smash Burger, Firehouse Subs, Aloha Kitchen, et al. With its proximity to the university and its school-spirited decor, it goes without saying that they cater mostly to the fiscally-conscious college demographic. Specials galore -- Happy Hour 4-7p (M-F), Taco Tuesday $1.25 all tacos (except shrimp), and Rebel Thursdays ($2\/$3 booze) to name a few. With a Yelp check-in, you even get a freebie. Your choice of a potato taco or fried oreos, which I have yet to try.\n\nI stopped in recently and the guy at the counter reminded me of a Hawaiian New Yorker. I know that seems like a total contradiction, but he was laid-back yet terse and frazzled. It could have been due to the fact it was taco tuesday and he was manning both the cashier register and doubling as a bus boy. \n\nAs for food, I wouldn't say they have THE best tacos -- El Gordo still has that spot for me -- but for the pricing, location, and efficiency, this place will satisfy your taco cravings.
