Thank you for 25 wonderful years of providing one of the widest selections of videos in the Phoenix area. You will be missed! I browsed again today (The penultimate day before closing their doors for good), looking through their impressive variety of new, popular, older\/classic, and obscure films (The obscure videos are the best!). Browsing by aisle is definitely an experience that many people these days will unfortunately miss out on. Sometimes there is more fun in the act of browsing than watching the movie you pick out. :)\n\nCurrently they have deeply discounted Blu-Ray, DVDs, and games. Prices are as low as $1.99 for case-less DVDs and box sets are $9.99.
