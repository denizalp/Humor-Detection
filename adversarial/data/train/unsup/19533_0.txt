L'amore is a wonderful Italian restaurant on the corner of Lincoln & N 32nd St. I was treated to a mind boggling amount of food for a holiday event hosted by Kiss Me Kate. The service by Sal reminded me of a quintessential New Yorker. Quick with a funny line, excellent timing and dressed in black. (Black pants, but still. In New York we wear black.)\n\nIf you read no further, remember this: Cioppino.\n\nChee-oh-PEE-noh\n\nThe dish is not on the menu for some reason. If you gaze upwards to a chalkboard you might notice it. Come hungry, or come with a date, but everyone should order this.\n\nChee-oh-PEE-noh.\n\nA seafood stew, complete with scallops, calamari, shrimp, clams, mussels and a white fish. (The white fish varies on a nightly basis.) My palate was delighted to order it Fra Diavalo. (I heard Fra Diablo, but that was close enough. Hot. Spicy hot.) This entire medley is served on a bed of linguine.\n\nL'Amore has been owned and operated for 13 years by Kim and Greg. Greg was beyond attentive to our table. If you look around the restaurant their passion for riding horses is evident.\n\nThe lighting is subdued but yet the mood is festive. This is where you bring friends and family. Any guest will be impressed. Live music is played on the bar side which filters over softly to the dining area. Sal, our friend, was able to balance a large party with infinite ease. When the Cinderella hour rang we left begrudgingly.\n\nChee-oh-PEE-noh.
