I was excited to have a craft beer place in Bridgeville!  Then I went here.  It was nothing more that a typical dirty, dark, poor service, subpar food, loud 'jukebox' music, and COORS LIGHT place!!!!  AGH!  I was hoping for more for a craft brewery with delicious food, not this.  So disappointed.\n\nI'll drive the extra miles and go to Spoonwood Brewing!
