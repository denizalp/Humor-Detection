Great lunch spot in Market Square. \n\nFriendly, fast service and fresh food. I love the concept of their \"rice bowl,\" which comes with a lemon rice (lentils optional), your choice of protein, and then various delicious toppings such as olives, feta, onions, green beans, etc. The bowl is topped off with your choice of sauce as well.\n\nGreat decor and a nice addition to downtown. I will be returning soon!
