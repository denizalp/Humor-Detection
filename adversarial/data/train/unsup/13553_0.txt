Ummm... the name of this place is mispelled. It's Feliz! As in Happy Taco! If you're from the South side this is what you'll call Taco Feliz...\n\nHappy Taco has been around for quite sometime and has been the best part of my late night excusions. My favorite dishes here is the Chorizo, egg & potato burrito. Also the rolled tacos are awesome! as are the regular tacos with rice & beans combination. \n\nThey have HUGE sodas and very decent prices. During \"normal\" hours, they will always have an english speaking attendant - they may have a crazy thick accent, but they understand what you're saying. But sometimes in the middle of the night many things can get lost in translation. I love this place and their menudo is KILLER!
