It was pretty darn good.  My husband's favorite is the Tusy roll.  Mine was everything else we had, which is the spider, dynamite, and the ASU roll. Everything is sprinkled with crushed macadamia nuts.  The place is new, so you can see things are not running quite smoothly yet.  But so far it is 4 stars.  I will be back pretty soon, especially since the prices are very reasonable.
