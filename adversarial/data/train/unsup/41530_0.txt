L'Orignal was our third choice after we were unable to dine at two other restaurants due to Quebec's absurd liquor laws (not unlike Utah) that do not allow children to dine if the restaurant can serve people drinks without ordering food. I think that I have just eaten at too many great restaurants and they are all starting to seem the same to me. I think I need to return to much simpler, rustic fare to be re-inspired. We were seated promptly and our waitress was very nice and attentive. We started with New Brunswick oysters and the foie gras appetizer. I loved rye bread that accompanied the apps and creamy, curdy cheese underneath the foie gras was heavenly, as was the apple bacon chutney on the side of the plate. I probably should've just had a salad from there and called it good. For entrees, my husband got the pork chop special, which he enjoyed but the top of it was overcooked and dry. My daughter and I split the surf and turf which had beef instead of elk that night, with lobster salad & cabbage three ways. The steak was excellent. The lobster was barely discernible in too much mayo and the pureed red cabbage had too much vinegar. Hubby and daughter split the s'more dessert with meringue, chocolate fudge and graham cracker. They enjoyed it but it was too sweet for me. I guess I just expect to be more wowed when paying nearly $300 for dinner. I should've just gone to Schwartzes for smoked meat and an equally Canadian experience.
