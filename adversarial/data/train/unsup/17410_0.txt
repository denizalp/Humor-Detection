Omg we got so spoiled at this event! We started the night at Tanzy and they never disappoint. Their drinks are always amazing. All of the food was so good. The meatballs, pasta, all the different cheeses, everything was delicious. After we got spoiled with our food and drinks we headed over to the iPic theater. This is my second time at this theater. The first time was when Yelp hosted their first event here. Their theater is super luxurious! We walk in and we already have a cocktail and cookies waiting for us! As well as a blanket and pillow. Not to mention the movie that we got to see was so good! \n\nThank you so much to Hailey for putting together such a great event and thank you to iPic and Tanzy for having us!
