Excellent food . Needs more people to attend  the customers, and their cash register area is a chaotic zone . Everybody standing there , and the phone is answered in loud voice , very annoying .  The phone should be in the kitchen or answered in a professional manners . Wait time is very annoying, in the mean time they should offer some papadam . It is s good takeout place . But dine in is a  taste of tolerance power\nMost of the Item were finished in the menu . They should make less things but well stock their kitchen even a cup of tea they could not provide or a bottle of water . They have tap water only . \nBut I donot think they will care to change because they are more than busy so you have to put up with this environment  so that you can relish their excellent food . I will give them 5 star for food quality I salute the chef , but management of the front shop is one star , and the poor server even with her excellent service could not keep up the environment tension  free . Anyway I will take out next time
