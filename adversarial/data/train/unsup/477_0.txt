This is the first time I have been to this Subway. I came in for the $2 - 6 inch sandwich special.  This special (cold cuts or meatball marinara) is on for the whole month of December too.  It was very quite inside. I didn't have to wait in line, so I was in and out in about 3 minutes.  The guy that served me was pleasant and I definitely will be back.
