I Love that this is an actual \"Park\" setting (see Dee's pics) instead of just your typical chain link enclosure.\n\nKind of hilly ground with lots of trees,grass and gravel. They have a watering area, bag dispensers and even pooper scoopers.\n\nUnfortunately it seems that no-one uses the bags or scoops because there is an over abundance of Dog Shit all over this place, I mean it was bordering on disgusting , every other step I was carefully averting these squishy landmines. \n\nWhy are people so Lazy and Foul??\n\nSO needless top say I didn't stay long and have come to the conclusion that my Dog just might not enjoy the dog park after all.\nHer mouth becomes a dripping slime machine whenever I take her, and she wanders around dazed avoiding the other dogs at all costs. \n\nAll this subsides as soon as we leave so maybe she is just a spoiled priss, who doesn't like dirty strange dogs and the filth they play in?\n\n2 stars, until they get a fecal regulator on duty
