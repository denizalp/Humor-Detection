I found my perfect dress here. I went in thinking this is going to be another wasted trip in looking for my wedding dress. I had been to multiple places at this point and always left disappointed and slightly sad. I was kind of over dressing shopping at this point BUT Susan from Wedding Warehouse changed my entire perspective again. I found my dress on my FIRST try. I knew as soon as I put it own, this is the ONE. I tried on other dresses for the sake of saying \"I tried on other dresses\" and they were pretty also, but my dress was absolutely beautiful. She even let me try it on 3 or 4 different times( I was memorized with myself). To top it off, the price was well within my budget and I even purchased my crown....well under budget too. If you're looking to find your perfect dress, that fits and fabulous fabric, plenty of selection, please check them out. Ms. Susan is the cherry on top. Great experience all around.
