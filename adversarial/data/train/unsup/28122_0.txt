Bottom line. The quality of the Pastrami and the corned beef were excellent.\nThat's what my wife and I came here for. We are from NYC originally and I am a Deli snob...ha...ha. \nI just ate at Katz Deli 7 weeks ago and this was every bit as good. The Pastrami is the real McCoy. It melts in your mouth. I do not mind paying a premium for great deli meat, as I know how painstaking the process is . The rye bread was excellent also as was the potato knish.\nOur waiter Samuel was an excellent waiter and went out of his way to make sure everyone was happy.  I hope they do well. Its the best pastrami and corned beef in Vegas. Unfortunately there are many people that live here that will not know the difference or would rather pay less and get some prepackaged reheated garbage so they can pay $5.00 less a sandwich. I am keeping my fingers crossed and hope they get enough good press and word of mouth.\n                                                                             David C
