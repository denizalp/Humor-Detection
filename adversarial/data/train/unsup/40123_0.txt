We eat here every time we visit Vegas (4 times and counting)! Great sushi, amazing appetizers, original drinks, and just plain great atmosphere. Unlike any Japanese place, the staff is friendly, knowledgeable always makes great suggestions. And not pricey, around $100 for two for a full meal with a few drinks.
