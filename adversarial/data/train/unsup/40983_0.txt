I just want to say how impressed I was with this moving company.  First of all, Ann the scheduler, YOU ROCK! I had reserved my moving date about one month in advance and called to reschedule my moving date about one week prior due to my house closing that was delayed....well let me tell you Ann worked it out for me at the last minute and moved appts around to make it happen for me.  I was so stressed and she saved me! Also, the crew worked so hard for three hours moving my stuff from a condo bldg into a 3 story house! I will absolutely recommend Christopher Moving and use them in the future for all of my moving needs! Thanks a million to everyone! Melinda Ryan
