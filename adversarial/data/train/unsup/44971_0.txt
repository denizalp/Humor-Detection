Although this little jewel sits in the heart of Phoenix, a multi spot for all civilians i have given it a clear 2 stars specifically for price. Parking in the ghetto frightened to walk back to the car, mediocre overpriced rides, and overall presence didn't help. Plus sides were petting zoo which directly helps 4H, stadium bathrooms (running water and no staring at pool piles), the ambiance, lemonade squeezed in front of my face, western photo booth, nice help desk girl with gives it the extra star. We won't be back for a very long time because over $100 dollars later we only have a (pretty great western) photo. It should last us the neck few years until prices sky rocket again and remind us that we'd rather spend our hard earned money in a million other ways.
