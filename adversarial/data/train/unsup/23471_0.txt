Just had a NIGHTMARE grub hub experience with another company. I waited 2 1\/2 hours for disgusting food. Finally my food arrived and it's soggy and monstrous at nicest. I cancel it then look back on grub hub and find Nicks. Not only was it delivered on time (early actually) BUT it was also delivered by the nicest guy and it was delicious. Bookmarked for future delivery! Thank you so much for saving my night!
