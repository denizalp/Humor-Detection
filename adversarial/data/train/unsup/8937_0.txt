I had my assistant call the Cracked Egg to ask for an owner I could send the below letter to. \"Curtis\" got on the phone, wouldn't give his last name, and yelled at my assistant! So with no other outlet than Yelp, here's the letter:\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nI live very near the new Cracked Egg restaurant at Charleston and Hualapai. My inquisitive 3-year-old daughter watched with great anticipation as the new \"muffin store\" was being built, and the morning of 4\/27\/14 I took her there (she was very excited). I would normally bring my wife and 1-year-old son, but my wife was home sick with a cold.\n\nWhat followed was the worst customer service experience of my life. Given the recent opening of the restaurant, wait staff and hostesses were understandably unpracticed and the operation wasn't running as smoothly as I expect it will over time. However, when I complained to the manager about needlessly waiting for 15 minutes after it was our turn to be seated, a man approached me, and with no introduction or conversation, promptly escorted me out the front door (my 3-year-old daughter riding on my hip), and rudely and loudly told me to \"get in my car, leave, and never come back.\" I encouraged him to listen to me, his customer, and he rudely told me \"look around, are you the only one here with an infant?\" \n\nI'm not a loud, large, or scary-looking man; in fact, I'm a 47-year-old, well-respected member of the business community. I serve on two high profile community boards, and own and operate a small, local business. Suffice it to say, I've never been banned from any establishment, and found the whole experience horrifying, especially in light of having my young daughter with me.\n\nThe saddest part of this experience is my 3-year-old daughter now speaks (unsolicited) about the \"bad man at the Cracked Egg who wouldn't let us have pancakes and bacon.\" She shouldn't have to worry about facing hostility at any of our neighborhood establishments. It's shameful.\n\nSincerely,\nJeff G.
