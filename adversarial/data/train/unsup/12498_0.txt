I went to Toronto for a business trip I ended up selecting the Radisson by the harbourfront for 2 nights even influencing my co-worker to pick the hotel. It was almost $200 a night.\n\nThe hotel was not what I imagined especially the photos were deceptive enough I had a shock when I arrived. It was old and low-quality there was a mom-pop store on the same level as the front desk. I checked in late at night was given a twin bed room which was not what I selected I went to front desk to see if they could switch it. The lady put me on the 3rd floor facing the main street - that proved to be a disaster because the entire night there were trams flying past the hotel all night. The poorly soundproofed building and the paperthin walls I could hear all traffic including people going in and out of doors. It was an absolute joke. I did not sleep at all I called the front desk and the rudest guy told me there was nothing that could be done. So I called the agent that I booked the hotel through then the hotel was willing to switch me to yet another low floor high traffic room. To make it worse, my co-worker who booked the exact same hotel with exact same price for only 1 night was checked into the 8th floor upgraded to the lake view. He was dumbfounded by the irony that I recommended him to stay there and I was receiving the worst customer service so we went to the front desk this time they said we should have known about the tram blahblah but put me on the fifth floor one side away from the street. \n\nAlso I parked my car at the garage which did not indicate how much the rate was but the public parking rate was $12 a day it turned out it was $50 for two nights! \n\nThis was probably the worst hotel I ever stayed in Toronto. Poor customer service, low-quality facility and poor location - what more do I need to say?
