YESSS this place is awesome. I can't wait to go back. The prices here are super reasonable for what you get. Shrimp and crabmeat cocktail was good.. and so were the stuffed bacon wrapped chorizo dates.\n\nMy ribeye steak was even better.\nI tried my boyfriend's scalloped potatoes they were creamy and delicious. Had I not been so naughty with food this past christmas season, I would have easily devoured the whole side of potatoes.. but too bad my conscious got the better of me this time.\nThe complementary piece of fillet when we sat down was great, and so were the complementary bacon cornbread+bread basket. \n\nCholla's also gave us a small scoop of the sorbet as a palate cleanser which was a nice touch. For the price this place is legit. Honestly, the food, the service can't be beat.
