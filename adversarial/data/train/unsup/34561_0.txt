We became Tower RV Storage customers almost the day they opened. We are extremely happy with our decision to move our RV to this location. Gabby and Lisa are excellent representatives and are courteous and helpful each time we stop in the office to visit. The storage facility is clean, modern, well equipped, safe and secure. The amenities are great - water, two wash bays, air, a vacuum system, RV Sewer dump, propane, free ice and more. Well done Gabby, Lisa and Tower Storage, Chandler.
