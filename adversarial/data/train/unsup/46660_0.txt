I stopped into Sauced tonight after wanting to visit for quite some time.  When I arrived, I was the only one in the restaurant.  I had looked at the menu online, but was hoping for a bit of a refresher of what toppings they had for a build your own pizza, but unless I missed it-- I didn't see posted clearly.   I was kind of hoping for a super simple decision guide like similar woodfired pizza joints have.  i.e. choose your size, then your sauce, then your cheese, then your toppings.  Luckily, I knew generally what I wanted and went from there.  I ordered a small pizza with pesto, mozzarella, bacon, sausage, and prosciutto.  \n\nThe pizza was made very quickly, which made it a great place to stop on a whim on my way home when I was craving pizza.  Not an order ahead and wait scenario (although you can order by calling or on the website.)\n\nI took it home with me and noticed that the box was completely drenched and leaking out of the side and onto my car seat cushion.  When I opened it up, I saw how oily the pizza was and how their was oil pooled in that corner.\n\nThe pizza itself was great.  The crust is the perfect thickness.  Their pesto sauce is one of my favorites I've had on a pizza.  The entire package was delicious.  As far as taste goes, it is my favorite wood-fired pizza I've had.  \n\nMy only negatives for the experience was the difficulty navigating the menu as a first-timer-- not knowing my topping, sauce, and cheese choices.  The oily, messy pizza wasn't ideal, but dripping through the box was a bigger disappointment.  \n\nI'll definitely be back for their pizza when I'm in the area, but will probably order ahead online so I can see all of my options clearly.  I'll also eat there or grab extra paper towels, etc. to prevent oily leakage in my car.
