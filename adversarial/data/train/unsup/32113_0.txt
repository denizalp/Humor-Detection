One of the new hip and trendy locations along the St. Clair Corridor!\n\nPlace has amazing decor, atmosphere, and service... but was overall disappointed with the food.\n\nAdmittedly I haven't ordered much from there.  Got the 2 side orders for ~$11.00, and chose the broccoli and cauliflower.  My order got lost somehow which added about 10 minutes to my wait, which doesn't seem like much, but when you're on a 45 minute break, is a quarter of my lunch! \n\nFor the broccoli, they gave me 4 florets. 4. They were large, granted, but when it comes to broccoli, the larger the size, the harder the stock.  Also because it was undercooked, the stock was all but inedible. The flavours weren't pronounced other than the char they had on the leaf side.\n\nCauliflower was much better, but didn't appeal to my tastes, so I won't comment on it. Portions were a little better though.\n\nMy coworker ordered the soup ($10.95) and didn't look like she got much. Probably about 1 ladle's worth.  \n\nI will admit I'm not much of a fancy eater.  The whole 'organic\/gluten free' movement kinda falls flat for me.  Hope this place all the best, as they seem to have good intentions! but I doubt I'll be back.
