Dave's Cosmic Pizza. Very friendly vibe, energetic staff. Got me a pie and wings in 20 minutes on a busy NFL Sunday night. Love the concept, freshwater dough and preservative free toppings(I'm looking at you, Papa John). Definitely needed in that commercial district with only Danny Boy's north of the tracks and Dewey's to the east. We won't mention that dump, Pellicano's. Eagerly awaiting my next visit.
