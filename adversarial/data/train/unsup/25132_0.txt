MA-Am-M Bolduc feels kind of like home?! \n\nFlipping through the menu I just not sure what to order, choices too many choices. With a small establishment with 1 cook and a small kitchen, it does makes me wonder how could that be possible.\n\nBreakfast\/Brunch with eggs, bacon, crepes and french toast ($11.99) is disappointing... a lot of food, a lot of carbs... everything is luke warm. It definitely taste like and look like something I made at home. Should I be excited?\n\nMy Yelp friend's poutine and burger looks depressing... but at least it is specials for $7.95. BTW, I think he kind of like the maple syrup... when he started dipping my whole wheat toast in that... I guess he must still be hungry after he ate his food.\n\nAt least the waiter is nice, the coffee is good and the hand made scrapbook menu is cute!
