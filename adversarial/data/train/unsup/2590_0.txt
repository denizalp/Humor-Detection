It's worth the wait. It's worth the cost. It's worth the crowds. It's worth losing your eyesight due to the crap lighting and microscopic chalkboard writing they call a \"menu.\" The food at Joe Beef is nothing short of edible sex. Great sex. Hot, steamy, mind-blowing sex with your ex.  The ex you hate as a person, but could fuck every day for the rest of your life.  That sex.  I had the horse steak and almost ejaculated at the table (it was wrapped in bacon).
