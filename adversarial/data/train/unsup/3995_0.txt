My girlfriend bought me a $25 gift card just for kicks and so after months of having it we decided to use it for to go.\n\nThe parking lot sucks as its shared with an auto shop place so they have a bunch of cars there. We enter in and it's quiet, but then again idk how busy it does get on a Thursday afternoon. We waited about 5 mins before a server acknowledged us. But she said she was the only working right now, so I bypassed it.\n\nWe ordered our food and it took 20 mins for it to come out. \n\nWe leave and get home to enjoy our meal and to my dismay I took a bite into my buffalo chicken sandwich and was consumed by this weird taste. Idk if you've ever smelled bad raw chicken, but it tasted like it. I had to stop eating it cause I wasn't going to take my chances. The only good things they offered was their curly fries, cheese sticks and fried pickles. Pretty disappointed.\n\n2 stars went to the nice waitress and decent appetizers.
