I must say I felt extra fancy walking into this hotel. From its dangling glorious chandelier decor...to the gigantic floor to ceiling screens with lavish ever changing backgrounds...it had a very well layed out modern design.\n\nWe stayed in the West Tower on floor 43. The room was exquisite. I was even excited to use their mouthwash and lotion provided just because the labeling was so unique. It had an old English vintage look to it. The bathroom had some pretty neat black and white wallpaper that when you really observe it...u can see females all over. It came with a ginormous spa tub and a 10-person capacity stand up shower with a bench inside. The view from room 4309 was glorious. I got to see Bellagio all the way to almost Fremont St. The carpeting had a few stains here and there and when you get off the elevator there's a sign that shows \"ice\" on that floor but that was nowhere to be found.\n\nI was able to use their fitness center and loved it. They had a Smith machine, free weights, bar bells, workout machines, cable machine, rooms for classes, treadmills, etc....just tons to work with.\n\nI will definitely be back! Service was exceptional!
