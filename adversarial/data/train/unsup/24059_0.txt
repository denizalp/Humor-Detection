Prrrrrrrr....\n\nI know that I can't have my cake and eat it too...so I got stuck with going to the club portion of the Cathouse & not the dining portion.\n\nCathouse was the last mission for the night and even though I was ready to start a catfight after several hours of torture in the heels. I did start to feel this seduction that Cathouse had over me as I stepped in.\n\nThink of the 1930's era...Mae West...art deco...Amelia Earhart... but you're in a brothel. Classy X-rated I would say. Interesting & original unlike any restaurants' ambiance...I just wish to go through the dining experience\n\nI've got to hand it to this place when it turns into a club... for it's bumpin' music (hip-hop, r&b, some 80s rock) and strong vibe...a vibe strong enough to get me into the platform raising the roof in the middle of the dance floor\n\nHowever, towards the end of the night the place transformed into Club NV(SF)...in other words, G-h-e-t-t-o...so I climbed back down from the platform after that awakening\n\nOverall, this is a great place to get your groove on but the excitement & awe that you feel wears off over time. I suggest that this should be the first spot to get a drink and head on over to the bigger venues like Tryst or XS to party rick james style\n\nGive it to me baby...
