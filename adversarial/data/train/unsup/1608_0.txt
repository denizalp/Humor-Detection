The owner Elfi Is the best!  She's been running this place for the last 4 years and she runs a tight ship!  My dress shirts and slacks come out perfect every time.  I have a pair of distressed J. Elliott denim that got a scent cause of a dog \"accident\" I was nervous how it might turn out.  I prefer not to dry clean my jeans but Elfi assured me everything would be aiight and the dry cleaning done was superb.  It WAS smelling like tapioca but no more!  One of the things I hate with many cleaners is they staple or safety pin tags on your shirts or other items.  They didnt here which was great to know as well.  \n\nThe crew have would I say the magic touch go figure!  If your looking for a great dry cleaner in South Scottsdale\/Tempe do not hesitate to give them a shot!  You won't be disappointed.  Ask for Elfi is she's there.  She will take care of you!
