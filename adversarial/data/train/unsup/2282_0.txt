\"Six-deuce every time, I never had the Heinz.  Fifty-seven can't ketchup to mines.\" â€• Jay-Z, Maybach Music 2 (Lost Verse)\n\nL.A. loved and Vegas presented, Dirt Dog has spread its wings from The City of Angels and crash-landed in Sin City.  So hot!\n\nWe had just arrived in Vegas, buzzed and hungry, well past noon.  Southwest Airlines had a retiring pilot who ended up buying drinks for all the passengers on board in celebration of his retirement.  I guess when the pilot is buying, the flight attendants gets liberal with the booze because I needed food in me like 30-minutes ago.  After flipping through some bookmarks, Dirt Dog was chosen.  You know it hit the spot because we got dirty... so sooo dirty!\n\nWe got the Elote Dog on Texas toast [$7.25 + $0.50 for the lobster roll], a Dirty Chili Dog on Portuguese bun [$7.25], and one order of the Filthy Fries [$5.50].  That Texas toast was so buttery and crispy, it was hard trying not to moan with every bite.  If you love Mexican street corn, elote is for you.  The Dirty Chili Dog was a sodium bomb.  The Portuguese bun is slightly sweet so it helped off-set the saltiness a little bit.  Of the two dogs, I'd choose the Elote Dog over and over again.  As for the fries, they were amazing.  The Filthy Fries were topped with guacamole, chipotle aioli, cheddar, and cotija cheese.  I can imagine sitting back on a velvet couch with Chrissy Teigen in nothing but matching silk robes, eating these fries, while John Legend writes ballads on his piano about how awesome it is that I stole his wife.  He can keep Luna though.  She's cute but I ain't nobody's step-mom, okay?\n\nSo a place with 90's hip hop? Uh, yes please!  The staff is charismatic and friendly, the atmosphere is fun, and the food is great.  \n\nTL;DR  I believe Knockin' Boots said it best in, \"The Original Hip-Hop:\"\n\n\"Ooh boy I love you so. Never ever ever gonna let you go, once I get my hands on you!\"
