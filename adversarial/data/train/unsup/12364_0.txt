Two words: Ladies' Night. I feel like a bandit for the meal steals we ran off with on this evening of damsels. If you sport double Xs, you get 50% off food on Wednesdays. The three course prixe fix was $27! This is definitely an amazing value. \n\nThe food was a little hit or miss for me. For my three courses, I went with a cauliflower soup, wilted winter green salad and the Jidori chicken. The soup was good. The wilted salad was delicious! Definitely the winner of the evening for me. However, the chicken was teetering dangerously on the edge of being overcooked, and when it originally arrived at the table it was perched on a moat of red sauce that was not tasty (and it wasn't visually appealing). We actually had them replate the chicken without the sauce, as there was no way to avoid it. I had visions of a juicy, tender succulent chicken, but this did not happen on my visit.\n\nMy husband swooned over their angel hair with crawfish small plate, but he had to send back a burnt scallop dish. The server remedied the situation promptly and did not charge us for the dish, so kudos for service!\n\nStill, the overall impression was that there was just a little something off in the kitchen that night, or perhaps the real winners on the menu are the seafood items or something else I didn't order. I would definitely return to give them a second taste, as I really love an off the Strip place focusing on providing fine, American dining! Plus, how can I possibly resist those Wednesday night deals!
