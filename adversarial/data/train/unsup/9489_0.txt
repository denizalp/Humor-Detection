Another ribtacular fest in the books. I don't even mind all the overpriced, tough as shoe leather pig consumption going on, as long as they keep having such great, cheap shows. It was five bones(pun? maybe) to get in. The parking was a bit of a hassle as the Cleveland police find it necessary to station a dozen cops up by the Q but only one all the way at the end of the detour. Otherwise known as a scenic tour of the Flats. Small gripe. There was plenty to see and do(carnival type attractions and a dunk contest). The rib joints all had their nasty, sticky old trophies on display( like anyone is not using them to spit gristle into). The sun was shining and the river was, well, at the time corpseless.\n\nOnce the show started, my fam and i got about fifty feet from stage(right behind the sound guy)with only our general admission. Some suckers paid twenty to get ten feet ahead of us. The sound was crystal clear and powerful for such a dinky looking setup. The acts were all very energetic, funny and self effacing. And they all sounded great for their age( Roger Daltrey, eat your heart out). Mickey Dolenz even performed Purple Haze which prompted swaths of old men to break out their air axes. And Mark Lindsay performed his classic Indian Reservation(Cherokee people, Cherokee pride...). That song always drives me into drunken fits. Speaking of, pints of Bud were 5 tickets. Translated to American currency, that is roughly nineteen dollars. No, more like six( same as a Cavs game). Not too bad. There was a smoking area off to the side and nobody complained.\n\nThe evening ended with the Turtles getting a bit raunchy and goofy. My mom loved it. She didn't really like her ribs. Oh well.
