After reading many posts about great places for cupcakes in Phx, I set out on a quest to find a local bakery to brag about near me.  I spied this bakery on the way home and decided to check out the goods one afternoon.  It was completely empty except for a 6 year old boy bored out of his mind waiting for his late 50s granny to quit reading the weekly Basha ads.  \n\nDespite the underwhelming crowd, 2  1\/2 of the 4 display cases were packed to the gills with everything from: black & whites, fruit pies, canolis, fruit tarts, GIANT petit fours (aren't petit fours supposed to be bite sized?), chocolate éclairs on steroids, muffins, danishes, loaf cakes, biscotti, and too many types of cookies to list.  All items seemed priced in the 75 cent-$2 range, which isn't bad.  Behind the counter were bread baskets with freshly baked breads--french, sour dough, rye, etc.  \n\nThe woman behind the counter reminded me of Seinfeld's soup nazi.  If the soup nazi had a cousin, it would be this lady.  She was stern and impatient even though the shop was empty.  When I probed her about the items, she was curt and offered no real recommendation on popular items.  It seemed like all the things I selected were made with the same \"cookie bottom\" and different topping\/filling flavor--apple, blueberry, raspberry, cinnamon. I could've missed it but I didn't see ANY cupcakes...\n\nI settled on a raspberry linzer cookie and a sugar free apple pie.  The cookie was thick and cakey--slightly crisp around the edges and spongy in the thickest parts.  The apple pie was empanada sized and was made with real apples that gave it some tartness--no goopy canned crap here.  Both were 'g-double-o-d' good.\n\nThey also had whole cakes in a refrigerated case next to the carbonated beverages.  While this place had plenty of seating, it didn't give an inviting impression.  The seats and tables were like something from an 80s office break room void of comfort and style.  However, I will admit that I thought the baked goods were definitely worth putting up with the militant counter person.  \n\nOh yeah they're open on the 4th, so stop by if you don't know what to bring to the soirée\/pool party\/BBQ you're going to.
