I came here on a Groupon during Thursday Night Football and they had a radio station giving out bunch of freebies including movie tickets, tickets to NASCAR and sporting events, etc.  There weren't many people here so all of my friends ended up winning prizes.\n\nThe food specials were ridiculously cheap and they had $1 PBR - can't complain there.   However the fish and chips were very dissapointing and I would expect more with their background and how much they promote their fish n chips.     \n\nService was great but my friends kept commenting on how obese the servers are.  All I could think about was Fergie's song, \"Big Gurls don't cry\"   Hey I had a good time and there's nothing wrong with a little heavyweight loven!
