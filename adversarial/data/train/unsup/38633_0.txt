Brilliant buzzing busy!!! Just on approaching the cafe...it is buzzing with people either waiting to get served for take-out or waiting to be seated for table service. I opted to take-out because it was very busy & the sun was pounding down on me. Expected high prices but good quick service nonetheless - would visit again!!!
