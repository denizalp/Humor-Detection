I am almost ashamed to admit that I have come here. Lets be clear, this is a 5 min walk from my office and I come to get my BANGS TRIMMED. Its only five bucks and *hopefully* done better than I can do on my own using my office scissors.\n\n*Hopefully.* I have had an entire cut here, back in university days, but I never went back. They charge more for \"long hair\" even if you want only a trim. It seems to me that crafting a good short-cut would take more energy. Also, the stylist would not stop trying to convince me to colour  or add extensions, when clearly I don't look like the type. \n\nRegardless, I have had the emergency bang trim a couple times when I have somewhere to go and I cannot see enough to get there. The first time was great, I had an older lady who somehow heard what I wanted over the insanely loud banging hardhouse and gave me a nice, free flowing, properly blended bang. I should have taken her card. \n\nThe next two times were horrible. The last girl cut them so short and blunt, with the uncut long piece overhang, all while proceeding to tell me that my haircut didn't suit me and my round\/chubby face needs some poof for balance. She also said I have a really \"unique look\" which I suppose is open for interpretation. \n\nHonestly, this place must be for people fresh out of haircutting school, or something. Everyone I have ever got can barely hold scissors, and they use the comb for leverage. I expect some finesse from a stylist that claims to be professional. \n\nNever again. ill side-sweep until I can get to my usual hairdresser.
