We came in for a Saturday brunch. Due to it bing summer in AZ, there was no wait for the patio! Not surprisingly, we were the only group sitting outside the entire time, which was nice. It felt like a private brunch! I thought it was weird that they do not have a non-alcoholic drinks menu. When I inquired, the server had to list off all the drink options (numerous unique sodas and coffees). It was hard to listen to all of them. I would have preferred to read the options on a menu. I ordered the cucumber and mint soda and my friend went with the grapefruit soda. Both were awesome; super refreshing and not too sweet. We had just finished a workout class so I wanted to eat something healthy. I order the quinoa burrito, which is suppose to have eggs, black beans, corn, chiles, avocado, pepper jack in it. It probably had four beans and five corn kernels in the whole thing. I couldn't taste any pepper jack or chiles. It was mostly super dense, over cooked eggs and a lot quinoa. I love quinoa and even this was too much for me. I barely ate half of it; it was so bland even covered in salsa. We also ordered the parker house rolls to share, which were tasty but not worth the price (four small roles for $9). Overall, this brunch didn't stand up to the ones I have had at the Henry in the past. Whenever I try to eat a healthier option at a Fox Restaurant, I'm always disappointed with the flavor of the food. Next time, I would definitely stick to my favorite, less healthy options, like the chicken fried chicken or the le pig sandwich!
