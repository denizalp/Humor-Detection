Glad to see this spot (formally Central Bistro) open up again..a little more low key then most places on Camelback..it has a great vibe with a good happy hour. I will still never understand a new place that doesn't ask \"Have you been here before?\" but that is just me railing against the machine. \n\nIt will become a regular spot on my rotation.
