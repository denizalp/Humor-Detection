One of the more flavorful places to get your Kalbi. Each time I've been, it's been a little slow (dine in once, take out twice). We order the Kalbi and Tteokbokhi for my mom and I to share. The portions are great and the cost is even better. \n\nI've found that the cut of meat here is also a higher quality - it's not the super think beef that overcooks and dries out. The cut is thicker and remains tender and juicy. \n\nI will definitely keep this place on the list of go-to's when I'm back in Vegas for visits. \n\nThe decor was clean and well done. They have a large tv playing K-pop in the background - maybe 2 tv's, if I'm remembering correctly.
