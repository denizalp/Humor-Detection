1pm on a Thursday. No lineup. 4 people working at the counters. Air conditioned bliss during a heatwave.\n\nThe lady at the counter was super friendly and I was in and out in about 5 minutes.  All I needed to do was renew my license plate sticker. No fuss, no muss, 4 seconds of friendly banter and I was gone.\n\nIt's also really close to a California Sandwich shop. Just sayin'.
