Saturday night.  More inappropriate attire.  Surfer on Acid shots.  More tequila shots. More Red Bull & Vodka.  Cocktails.  Beers.  More cocktails.  \n\nRound II of the Bachelorette Party.  \n\nBody English was a lil' tamer than Tryst but, I still got love for this club.  Very different scene, very different atmosphere - slightly older crowd, not as diverse but with a whole lotta white boys (which my girls and I do not mind at all).  ;-)  It's on the \"smaller\" side for a Vegas club (one large dance floor) and it's not on the strip but, I think these are both pros for Body English - it's a nice change of pace\/scenery from the sometimes \"over the top borderline Cancun cheesy factor\" Vegas mega-clubs.  Once you walk in, it feels like you're stepping into a sexy, exclusive establishment with what appears to be a lot of tall, good-looking people (then again, it could just be the lighting and the fact that the crowd consists of so many tall people).  There are \"bridge and tunnel\" types but, there are also a lot of \"yuppies\" and \"hipsters\" at Body English, which is welcome change (although we did meet a shamelessly nasty guy from GE, ugh).\n\nThe music on Saturday nights is a mix of hip-hop, house and a whole lotta 80s rock!  Normally, I would shake an angry fist and throw my drink at the DJ if I heard a set of 80s rock but, 80s rock is actually fun when singing along with a dozen buzzed girl friends.  The 80s rock probably explains the majority \"white boy\" crowd (again, no complaints here!).\n\nIt doesn't  hurt that the DJ (DJ Clinton Sparks - who is HOT,  btw) freakin' ROCKS the party that rocks the body every Saturday night.  And, in true Vegas fashion, celebrities make an appearance at Body English every Saturday whenever DJ Clinton Sparks spins.  While we were there, Carmen Electra showed up, the Asian guy who inspired the movie \"21\" was in a VIP booth at the front of the dance floor (I wouldn't consider him a celebrity but, the DJ called him out), Duran Duran made a special appearance and one of the members got on the turntables and spun house music and 80s for awhile.  \n\nOverall, Body English is a dang good time.  If you're \"so over\" partying with 21-25 year olds and want something a little classier than the Vegas strip mega-club experience, make your way to Body English.  \n\nPS) Special shout out to Jason @ Body English.  I emailed Body English about a week before we arrived in Vegas and Jason immediately responded.  All we had to do was ask for him once we arrived and we cut through the line and velvet rope, no cover, and were on our way in.  Nice. Thanks, Jason!
