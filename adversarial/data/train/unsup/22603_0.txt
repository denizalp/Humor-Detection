What I like about it...\n\n- Convenient: right next to the gym so we can get breakfast before we workout.\n- The bar area: which seems to expedite the process even more.\n- Organic: still hard to find for some reason, but not at Canyon Ranch.\n\nThis is not your typical Vegas over the top restaurant.  You will get smaller, but high quality portions and is a great start to a day after a long night.
