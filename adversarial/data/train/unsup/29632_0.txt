Yes I realize that both were helping customers... however  it seemed that one customer didn't really need help as he was behind the counter looking for his own part...... you could have at least acknowledged that we were there , waiting, and waiting.  Then when the phone rings, you walk right past us as we waited at the counter for help and answer it.  There are a lot of auto parts stores in the area. We took our business elsewhere
