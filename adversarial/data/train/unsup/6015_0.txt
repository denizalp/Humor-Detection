I have been here several times, yet I do not have anything specific to say about the airport itself. It is a large cities, large style, international airport. It is very big, and very spacious. That is redundant, isn't it.... maybe I am just typing now until I get the little notification saying I have typed enough, how's it go? \"Way To Represent. That's how Elites do it!\"..? Something like that lol.. back to the review though, as there is no way I will hit that mark for this one\n\nVery large airport. It is also a modern airport, and I haven't seen to many areas that look old or run down. I honestly prefer this airport, to others in its category like LAX or DFW... ok well, now that I think  about it... maybe I like DFW better... maybe I am just more comfortable with DFW? Anyways.... this airport doesn't FEEL like its a huge international airport, but it is. It is relatively safe (I have to add relatively because knowing how my luck is as soon as I say it is safe, there will be an attack there and someone will sue me saying \"that Soldier assured this was a safe place and we went and I was shot 98764 times in the same leg\"... wtf... anyways. \n\nWhether you are connecting domestically, or you're transferring to international... both in between our borders and outside them, this place is a good starting point, or stopping point for whatever it is you are doing, and wherever it is you are going. From here, you can damn near get anywhere. So it is kinda like that star bridge in the THOR movies.... except its not .. its Phoenix.
