Namaste bitches!\n\nMy romance with Yoga has been on again off again, but after my visit to Iam Yoga today I think I'm ready to go steady.\n\nJennifer was minding the front desk and was very nice to me, introducing me to the owner as well as my instructor for the day, Alyssa.  Jen gave me a quick tour of the place and was easy to talk to.  She seemed genuinely interested in me and excited about working there.  \n\nEveryone was incredibly friendly and outgoing, which I think contributed to my positive experience.\n\nWhile I'm not new to Yoga, this was my first hot yoga experience so I was naturally a little apprehensive.  \n\nAs an instructor Alyssa seemed very knowledgeable and I never felt awkward or out of place during her session.  As a beginner, the F1 CC class was seriously challenging, but I made it through till the end.\n\nI'm going back tomorrow to sign up for their $20 all-you-can sweat for a week.\n\nHighly recommended for beginners.\n\nEDIT:  Went twice today, I think I found my groove with this place.  If you are new, make sure you go to a class with a 1 in hit, such as F1 (Flow) or H1 (Hatha).  Also make sure to bring a towel (I bring two towels, one for the mat and another for all the crazy sweat!), at least 1\/2 litre of water and a yoga mat (duh).  My first time I forgot a towel and they dinged me $2 bucks.\n\nTIP: Sit next to the north windows. Usually they open them about 10-15 minutes before the end of class. I find that it helps me keep going.  If I'm too far away I find myself wishing I could feel the breeze and stop focusing on what I'm doing, which is essentially trying not to pass out.
