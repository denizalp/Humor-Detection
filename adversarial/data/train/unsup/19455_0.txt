This review is for my visit to the Starbucks in this store.  The manager was recently moved here from my normal store and I wanted to have a drink and say hello.  I agree with the other comments about the poor parking and being run down.  \n\nHowever, for my needs, the Starbucks outlet is in the front of the store.  After a brief visit with my friend, I left with my coffee and a smile.
