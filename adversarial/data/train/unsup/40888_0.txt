Food was pretty good (I had a chicken wrap) but service was crazy slow.  Our party of 3 (after the main lunch rush) didn't even get acknowledged by a server for almost 15 minutes...just as we were about to give up and leave.  Even then, it wasn't a server, it was one of the runners who informed us who our server was and that he would take our drink orders.  We had him take our food orders as well.  A harried young lady I can only assume was our server - she never introduced herself or apologized for making us wait - brought us our food pretty quickly after we ordered it.  It was good and the portions were more than I could eat.  I'll give it another shot at some point.
