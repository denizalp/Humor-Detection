He's always next to Vanguard\/Insert Coins\/Beauty Bar.  Great place for the guy to set up shop.  The same guy always works the cart.  And listen, I like a good dog down my throat like every other red blooded American male, but this place is different.  It's amazing.  Cheffini's Colombian self has saved my girlfriend's and my own stomach from total hangover city multiple times.  Their dogs are bomb, quick, convenient, and $3.  Yeah, I said it.  $3.  That's it, you cheap b@stards.  Seriously.  $3 for a jumbo dog with bacon, chips, ketschup, jalapenos, cheese, and mustard?  And I won't have a massive hangover tomorrow?  Sure.  Sign me up for two.  Hell, if I wasn't stuck at home right now, I'd go try and find this cat.
