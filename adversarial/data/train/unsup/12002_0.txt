I have not lived here, so I have to start with that, which I guess means this isn't the best review, but whatevs.\n\nI went to check out the apartment because they were in my price range. The smallest 2-bedroom (\"The Sanctuary\") was actually not the greatest floor plan even though I was looking forward to its unique layout. The patio was small and the dining room was actually just big enough for a small table and 4 chairs, but the rooms were fairly big.\n\nThe lady showing us around was nice enough, but a little short at times. Everything was iffy until it came down to two things; I loved the French doors but as soon as I found a huge American cockroach I was pretty much out.\n\nAlso, the \"Soleil\" were above garages, had a much better layout, and had no evidence of roaches. It is possible those units have them, too, however not necessarily because they are in a separate building. Regardless, I didn't take my chance and I don't think you should either.
