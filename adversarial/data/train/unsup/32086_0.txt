Great pizza, but very, very expensive.   We were overcharged one time as well.  After spending $28 on a pizza we asked for a to-go box and they wanted to charge us for it.    They claimed it was their effort to have less waste and be green.  I get that, but charging for a small box is tacky after charging a premium.   The pizza itself is awesome.
