My favorite pizza of all time! So extremely flavorful and delicious. I could literally just eat the crust. The Calamari is on point. Pasta is delicious. Haven't ever had anything I didn't enjoy here. The cheesecake is the best you'll ever have. Cannoli's come traditional or chocolate covered!! Love the staff and atmosphere of the restaurant. Hands down best pizza in Arizona, and arguably the best in the US!
