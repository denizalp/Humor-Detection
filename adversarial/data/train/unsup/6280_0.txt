Everyone in Vegas always goes to Pho-Kim Long after a long night of drinking and partying. I've been there multiple times but after finding this place, I found my new Pho place to go to!\n\nThis hole in the wall seems much more authentic than Pho-Kim Long in my opinion. \nDon't get me wrong, the outside of this place does seem a bit sketch and it is located off the strip but the dishes I've tried so far has exceeded my expectations. I tried this place twice and I enjoyed much more than Pho-king. Probably come here from now on~\n\nThey have their own lot so parking is not an issue!\n\nHowever, there is one particular lady who does have a bit of attitude. Oh well.. I just ignore it.
