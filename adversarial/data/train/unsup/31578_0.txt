Been here twice. Had the \"one meat\" with 1\/2 lb of brisket, 2 sides, corn bread and butter. Brisket is very tender and excellent flavor, best I've ever had. Lots of food comes with this order. They have refill yourself soft drinks, plenty of huge picnic tables and some tables with paper towels on each.  Mac and cheese and potato salad are very good choices. Order at the counter and they bring it out to you.
