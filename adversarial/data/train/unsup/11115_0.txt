Worst straight razor shave EVER!\n\nI came in for a straight razor shave the morning of my brother's wedding. I have had a few of these before, but this was the first time that my neck was shaved down with an electric razor first and then a straight razor shave followed. \n\nThere was pretty immediate evidence of minor razor burn and minor cuts on myself and another groomsman, noticed by my wife when we arrived to the wedding venue. The next day, the razor burn was the worst that I have ever had in my life. Five days later, my neck is still completely broken out, it's painful, itchy beyond belief, red and swollen. I am now using a medicated ointment to try and alleviate the problem. Their haircuts might be a good bargain but look elsewhere for a shave.
