Not bad for inside an airport! I typically expect my airport dining experiences to involve mediocre food and shotty service, but this was not the case at The Pub.\n\nMy husband and I were able to snag a large round table by an outlet so we had plenty of room to hop on our laptops, charge up, and enjoy some lunch before our flight home. Our waitress was very friendly (and funny!) and our food and drinks came out fast. I'm sure this is standard for them considering everyone is trying to catch a flight.\n\nWe both ordered double bloody Marys. I mean, why not? It was Friday after all! These bevies were pretty no-frills and included I believe just a lemon and lime. The mix itself was not my favorite, but I chugged it down nonetheless. No Tito's will go to waste!\n\nTo eat I had the ham and Swiss sandwich on a pretzel roll and this was delicious! It came with fries and everything really hit the spot. Comfort food at its finest. \n\nPrices are what you'd expect in an airport, so no surprises there. Definitely worth a visit if you have time to kill at the airport.
