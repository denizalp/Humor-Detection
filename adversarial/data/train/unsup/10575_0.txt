I wish I could give zero starts. We were on the walking tour for about 10 minutes with our two 90 year old grandparents to celebrate my grandpas 90th Birthday. What a cool experience, right? He was so excited to see the signs he actually used to see light up on buildings....\n\nWe understand they don't have shade but we realized that it was way too hot once we got out there and stood right in the sun.  So we asked if we could come back later on at night (when it was cooler) or the next morning and they straight up said no. I guess walking out the door for 10 minutes counts as the tour, huh? Wouldn't even accommodate for a discount to come back or let us reschedule. It's not like we were out there for an hour and did this. I am thankful for the free ice packs they gave my grandparents. \n\nThanks for any amazing 10 minute tour! ha.
