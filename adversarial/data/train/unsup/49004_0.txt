Us Bank is awesome!\n\nI used to use Wells Fargo and was unhappy with all their stupid fees and with how they used to hold back the availability of funds. \n\nSince I've made the switch to US Bank I've been much happier.  No B.S. fees and the tellers are way friendlier and way more helpful.  \n\nI highly recommend US Bank, especially the one on E Sunset Rd or the one by Windmill & Eastern.
