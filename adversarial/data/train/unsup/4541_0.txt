What can I say? It's a mall. Like it or not, if you live in the downtown core you will probably find yourself needing to come here at least once. \n\nEaton is deceptively small - it's a long, single hall flanked by stores, so you don't quite realize that it's three stories tall with a foodcourt that takes up an entire additional basement floor. I think it takes a couple of trips to really appreciate\/realize\/absorb the size of the mall.\n\nWhat Eaton has in quantity of stores it lacks in size - most of the individual stores are on the smaller side, especially since many of them have a second location on Yonge or Queen West, so Eaton is more about the convenience of having everything in one location. \n\nEaton is definitely very well lit, bright, and airy, with a really nice, massive open skylight and a fountain, which helps mitigate the fact that it is usually extremely crowded and overrun with younger kids and angsty teens. I've pretty much never seen the mall not extremely crowded to some degree.\n\nThe food court is pretty top notch in terms of quantity - sushi, asian foods, burgers, McDonalds galore, with a massive amount of seating. However, bussiness people tend to swarm here during lunch break, so despite the seating it's still almost impossible to find a table at 12:30.\n\nExtremely convenient - right on the PATH, and very easily accessible by public transit.
