Worse buffet experience ever. They lure you in by their online menu promising a wide variety. When you actually pay the $35 to eat, there's 1 edible option, the salad. I was looking forward to the Dungeness crab legs, no flavor and the claws may as well have been empty.  The \"beef\" was so dry, Stevie Wonder could've confused it for beef jerky.  The Spanish rice was OKAY, and that was because we were starving.  I definitely will not be returning.  I guess the money spent went towards a very friendly hostess, and waiter.\nThanks, but no thanks.
