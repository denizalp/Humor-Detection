Let's start with the name.  Carne = meat and Vino = wine.  Yes please.   \n\nNeeded to find a special restaurant for a birthday we were celebrating in Las Vegas.  As a fan of Mario Batali's restuarants in LA, I didn't hesitate to book a reservation at Carnevino, especially since we were already staying in the hotel.  In Las Vegas, its always easier to book experiences within the bounds of your resort.  Easy to do at Venetian\/Palazzo.  \n\nOur dinner was absolutely amazing, and I'm referring to the whole experience, not just the food.  The restaurant is elegant and the service was on point.  We had a team of servers doting on us all night.  The food though, was heavenly.  Their steaks are truly extraordinary; dry-aged on site, then rubbed with sea salt, black pepper and fresh rosemary to achieve tenderness and signature flavor.  The menu also offers all kinds of beautiful homemade pastas, salads, and side dishes all inspired from Italian street food.  But trust me, this is no street food joint.  The menu is rich and sophisticated, with prices to match.  \n\nThe meal is served family style.  I was one of a party of four.  We ordered two salads, two steaks (as recommended by our waiter), two sides- mashed potatoes and spinach.   This was entirely too much food.  The steaks were HUGE. \n\nThe \"charred dry-aged rib-eye for two\" easily feeds four!  The \"dry aged bone-in NY strip for two\" could have easily served four as well.  We would have been fine with just one steak between the four of us.  \n\n**Beware! They do a hell of an up-sell here.  The waiter had suggested we order two appetizers and two pastas, in addition to what we ordered!  Here we are, four LA girls, and this guy's pushing food for eight hungry men returning from sea.  Really?  (insert irritated face here).** \n\nHaving recently eaten at Bestia in LA (another fabulous Italian carnivore den) and mistakenly followed the waiters suggestion, I knew that was too much food!  What's the deal with these types of restaurants and the food up-sell?  Its annoying.  Even cutting his suggestion considerably was too much food!  I considered knocking off a star for this, but overall, this place is definitely first class, so 5 stars it is!  \n\nOh, I should mention that the cocktails and wine were fantastic too!  We had a fabulous time at Carnevino.  This was definitley a dinner I will always remember fondly.\n\nBookmark this one friends, for the next time you visit Sin City. \nxo
