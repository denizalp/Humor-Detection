My wife and I stumbled onto this little gem while driving around. It was an impulsive ooh look, let's go in. What a wonderful place. Small, friendly, unusual, creative. These are some of the words I use to describe this place. The food is amazing and different from any other place we've been. If you want a New Orleans, French inspired food, this is the place. There is a come, sit, have something to eat, drink some wine and relax philosophy here. No rush to get you out. In fact they make it a point to tell you this. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you have to come and check this place out.
