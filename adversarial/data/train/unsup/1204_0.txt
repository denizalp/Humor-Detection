They've made a few changes all for the benefit of their riders.  We talk and they listen.  I absolutely love this studio and am glad that I can keep coming back. The events for riders and how involved they are with the community is an added bonus. You can always look forward to someone greeting you at the door or in the studio if you need assistance with your bike. Great music, great fun, great ride.
