I love the looks of the restaurant inside and out. Herb garden is an added cool bonus. This place has lots of employees working at once, it seems like they have a system down. You walk in and order your food and sit down and wait for them to deliver it to you. \n\nOn to the food, the first time I went I got the Quinoa Crunch Bowl. I ate it at the restaurant and was very impressed with the salad. It had perfect flavors that all went together so well and I would have given this place 5 stars. I loved the dressing, everything about this salad was just what I love. \n\nI went back once and ordered the same thing and got it to go and it was missing arugula from the salad and they replaced it with some other lettuce. Wish they would have told me because it sucked with romaine. Not the same! In addition, I added on salmon. Ohhh so sad salmon, it was cut up into a canned tuna like size, crisped and cooked so much that it tasted like salmon jerky bits on top of the salad. It was so bad that I had to go back and show them my salad and how pathetic it looked. When you hear grilled salmon, you think a piece (one piece not broken up bits) or a nice grilled salmon. If it was salmon chunks that were overcooked and sitting out all day, I wish I would have known. \n\nI decided to give it one more chance. I really loved that bowl and wanted it to be good as the first time, got it to go and it was in a different packaging which the top would not stay closed and one fast sudden stop at a red light and my salad fell and it was all over the floor of my car!! So much for good packaging for to go orders :( sad me!\n\nFinally the last straw was eating there with my hubby. He got a burger which was very small and the side portion of fruit was hmmm toddler size? Very small. Of course I got my favorite salad and it had a fly on it. Enough said.
