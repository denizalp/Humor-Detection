A bit of a haul from Charlotte, but well worth the trip. The restaurant is small, so the table spacing is tight.\n\nThe starters we selected Arancini, sunchoke chips,  and deviled eggs. The Arancini was phenomenal. Super savory and perfectly seasoned. The sunchoke chips with the aioli were a the best version of chips I've had. The aioli had a remarkable depth of flavor. Deviled eggs were delicious but paled in comparison to the other apps.\n\nFor the entree I got duck breast with winter vegetables. The duck was cooked perfectly with a nice crispy skin. The veggies had a nice acidity to balance the duck. The black rice provided a nice base.\n\nDesert was dessert was a deconstructed smore, Which was glorius.\n\nService was top notch. Servers were very knowledgeable and the pace of the meal was perfect. Allowing for conversation but not too spread out. Plus our waiter handled a difficult table with grace.\n\nBeer and wine selection. The keg ran out on my SO's choice and they comped a glass of similar beer.
