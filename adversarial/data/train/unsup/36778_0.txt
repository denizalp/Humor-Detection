Location is what gives it 4 stars. \nWhat gives it 0? Out of every beer almost on beer list. Ironic part is we were the table that ordered them. Took the waitress each trip to realize what they were out of. (Wouldn't you just keep a list? )\nAlso change your kegs and be prepared this is usually when beers change flavors and opening week of college football. \nSorry this bar would never cut it in the big football cities. \nSeems they have tons of mixed shots which is cute if your back in the frat or need quick buzz.
