So 4 years later I go back and this time for a bachelor party. For some reason the guys thought it was a good idea to invite me.....I digress. I warned the group that this place is in a sketchy part of Vegas and that the raunch factor was pretty high. I also told them I only saw the guys dancing and not the women. Well.....the raunch factor with the women was even higher. We walked in.....loud music and fully nude women everywhere grinding all over any man with a pulse. What I thought was interesting was that the guys that I was with, including my husband, hated it almost immediately. They were so turned off by the nastiness of the women. We didn't stay very long...
