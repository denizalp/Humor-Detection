Wow so bad - Don't do business with them they will try to rip you off !!! We have been getting our home serviced by Water tech for years and they were great. Now I call these guys and they want to double the cost of service and add $80 just to show up ?? isn't showing up a  part of the service ? cant really service it if your not there LOL what a joke
