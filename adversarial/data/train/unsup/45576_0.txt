Being a local, I have heard amazing thins about the Sunday brunch. I finally had the chance to try it. Absolutely amazing! It is endless small plates brunch, so you can try a variety of items. The chilaquiles are amazing and the shrimp and grits!! You have to of course get the endless mimosas, it's not brunch without them. I sat on the patio since the weather was perfect. Service was very quick given how busy it gets for brunch. Two thumbs up! Will certainly be coming here again!
