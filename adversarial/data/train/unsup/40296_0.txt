This is one of my favorite theme bars in the city! It has a tropical feel with totems, straw huts, and cute table and chairs. It transforms the space into a hot jungle island. \nThere's food served in the bar, but mostly snacks. The chicken wing and poke are both pretty good. Even though they are not quite enough as a meal.\nTheir drinks menu is quite interesting as well. Most of them are Tiki bar signature served in interesting containers. The bar is most famous for its gigantic bowls. When they are ordered, there will be dramatic smoke and gong. The bowls are suggested for 3-4 people, and can be quite strong, but definitely doable for two if you choose to. Lol
