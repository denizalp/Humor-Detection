I was renting with EZ rental car, which is a part of Advantage. We got there after a cancelled flight. We got downstairs into the office and the gentleman tells us the computer is down and there is nothing he can do for us. He recommends we go to other rental car offices to see what they can do for us (which someone else had already tried and they were triple the price). 30 minutes later when their computer was finally back up and working we got a car that was dirty on the inside. I sent an email to their corporate office and no one ever got back to me. Do not use them!!
