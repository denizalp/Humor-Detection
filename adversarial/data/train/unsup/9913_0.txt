I scream.  You scream.  We all scream... for ice-cream!  Or, so the saying goes... not so much at B & R on Camelback though... there are 2 big disappointing factors about this B &R.\n\n 1 - unfriendly employees... I've been in on several occasions and not once have I seen an employee smile or be anything other than monotone.\n\n 2 - no soft serve.\n\nSo, it's fine to get a scoop or two, but honestly, I'd much rather drive the extra 20 minutes and go to Ice Tango!
