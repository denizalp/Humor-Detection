First time! Wass a little pricey for the portion. Would've been nice to throw in a peace of bread maybe for the price. On to the good stuff, the owners son waited on me and was very nice. I ordered my dishes 5 on the spicy scale and he suggested to go higher next time. Well the 5 was just right for me and I'm no spicy wimp. (Were you trying to kill me guy suggesting higher?) Nah...LOL.He suggested if ya like coat to be sure to come in on Friday's. I said I liked coat but actually never had it. (I was thinking \"lamb.\") I ordered two dishes, curry chicken and butter chicken. Came with rice. Both tasty. Would definitely go back for the taste and the nice owner.
