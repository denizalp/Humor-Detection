Came in for lunch on a weekday. There is a shared parking lot with plenty of parking. When I entered I was greeted and there was a wait. I went to the bar instead for immediate service. They were not prepared and were severely understaffed. The bar tender was stressing and dropped some alcohol. When people left the serving areas weren't cleaned. It was quite a unique situation. The persons in the kitchen were able to make some great tasting food in a timely manner. I had soup unlimited with a chicken pitta sandwich and a desert cup of strawberry whites chocolate. It took a while for the food to come out but it was hot and good. That was the best part about the experience. I was asking several times for other needed items like water, silverware, etc. I don't know about returning during lunch hours.....
