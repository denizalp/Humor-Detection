I heard ravessss about this place. And yet I'm still trying to figure out what the hype was all about. Located in the Miracle mall, I had walked by this place a dozen times and finally was excited to try this place out!\n\nI ordered the New England Signature Lobster Roll which costed a whooping $24 bucks.... I was actually surprised it came with fries so I guess that made it a bit more worth it. If it was just the roll alone..yeah that's pretty expensive. (I can go to slapfish and get a roll for 16 and it tastes better then this). I wasn't too impressed with the taste and I wouldn't say its worth what I paid for. I still can't find the hype in the roll. Maybe I should have ordered the lobster mac? Either way I can't justify paying that much again for anything on the menu here.\n\nYelp Review 2017 Challenge 68\/100
