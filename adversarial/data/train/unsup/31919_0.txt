I like the Bistro for what it is. It is a much better workplace cafe than others that I have experienced.  Bfast burritos are a solid choice. They have Thursday Chef's Table specials that are usually very good. Prices are fair and Gaston, Cindy, and Yadira give great customer service. \n\nThey should offer bfast pizzas every day, though!
