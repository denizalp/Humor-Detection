BAD food and the WORST customer service everrrrrrr!!!  \n\nMy family and I have been to this buffet probably a dozen times in the past few years, but we hadn't been here in a while, so we thought we'd give it a visit.  We went on 4\/3\/12 around 5:30 PM.  \n\nHOSTESS WELCOMES US LIKE ZOO ANIMALS:  There was a family of 8 ahead of us, and then there was our party of 6.  When it came time to seat us at our table, the hostess decides to take both groups with her for seating.  She proceeds to have all 14 of us follow her clear to the other side of the buffet closest to the salad bar, to seat the company of 8, then she proceeds to \"double-back\" all the way towards the front near the chinese food area, to seat our remaining party of 6.  If I would have known that we were going to be treated like wondering, waddling ducks, then we would have dressed for the zoo-like occasion.\n\nLEAPING LIZARDS, BENDABLE CRAB LEGS:  My parents and I started our meals with the crab legs.  They didn't have any crab openers available at the station, and when we asked our server for them, he treated us as if we were annoying him with our request, and told us to get them at the crab station.  So I go over and ask one of the guys behind the counter for the crab openers since there were none displayed.  In response, he mockingly copies \"my voice\" and \"small hand gesture\" of opening a crab leg, to his co-worker, asking where we could find a crab opener.  He then proceeds to walk behind a closed swinging door, to retrieve them.  By the time I got back to the table, our crab legs were cold.  Even with metal crab openers, we still had a hard time opening the crab legs.  Instead of being \"crackable,\" they were like rubber bands and \"bendable\".\n\nFOOD HAS CHANGED TO BAD:  Nothing was tasty and delicious, as it had been in our past dining experiences here.  My husband asked for a \"thick cut\" of prime rib, he got more like a THIN SLICE OF DELI MEAT!\n\nIGNORED OUR DRINK REQUESTS:  We asked our server for \"3 cups\" of coffee and a refill on a coke.  The server never brought us the coffee or refill.  But strangely enough, the server had the \"time\" to chit-chat with nearby Spanish speaking patrons for long periods of time, and even had the remarkable \"memory\" to grab some decks of playing cards from the casino, to \"shove\" them into the purse of one of the said customers.  It was great to see that he was bilingual, but somehow, someway, he felt that giving away the casino playing cards trumped our request for drinks.  Then, he DISAPPEARED FOR THE REST OF OUR STAY.  We ended up getting another server assigned to our table, who did bring us our drinks \"AFTER WE HAD TO ASK FOR THEM AGAIN\"... even then, it took another 2 attempts for him to get our drink orders right.\n\nHIDING COTTON CANDY:  One of the appealing nature of their dessert bar is the ability to get cotton candy.  My 8 yr. old son and I decided to go get some.  At the time we were here, they didn't have the cotton candy visibly out, but instead HIDE them behind the counters, and in turn, requiring the customers to ask for them!  We knew they had the cotton candy because the customers sitting at the table beside us had scored some.  With my son standing next to me, I asked the lady scooping ice cream if I could have \"2 BAGS OF COTTON CANDY PLEASE.\"  She turns around, and what do you know, she only hands me 1 BAG OF COTTON CANDY.  Then she quickly turns away from me, to tend to something else.  So I patiently wait for her to return.  While I'm still standing there waiting, another couple come up beside me.  Upon turning back around, the ice cream lady simply ignores my presence and directs her attention at the newly arrived couple.  I interject with a POLITE \"excuse me,\" to which she responds to me with a \"WHAT NOW?\"   I continue to tell her that I needed 2 bags of cotton candy, and that she only gave me one.  She replies, \"You only asked for 1!\"   I responded back, \"I asked for 2, one for my son and one for me, MY SON WAS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO ME WHEN I ASKED YOU!\"  As if I would have confused the notion of NEEDING 2 BAGS instead of 1, KNOWING my son AND I both wanted them.  Regardless of whether or not I asked for ONE or TWO, it was her duty to give me the 2nd bag WITHOUT her snarky attitude and responses, and most certainly, WITHOUT a fight!!!\n\nMy parents and I have lived in Las Vegas since 1978.  In the past 34 years that we have visited the numerous Las Vegas restaurants and buffets, we have NEVER experienced such POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  NEVER COMING BACK HERE EVER AGAIN!!!
