I like Jo-Ann's the best of the craft stores. They always have a great selection, the stores are clean and well organized, and they accept lots of coupons. You can use a competitor coupon and a phone app coupon at the same time as well! They have really great sales as well. The staff seem more helpful and friendly then some of the competitors.
