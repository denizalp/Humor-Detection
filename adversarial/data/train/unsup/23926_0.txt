Fantastic place!  My friends and I booked this place for a Bachelorette Party.  We thought i'd be a fun, unique way to celebrate with the bride to be - also, it'd help her take some lessons home to her soon to be husband, rawr!\n\nWhen we first drove into the stripmall we thought uh-oh because the area looked kind of hidden and ghetto.  It's located right next to the laundromat and the windows of the studio were completely blackened out.  We, being 8 little Asian girls, were kind of hesitant.  However, this is a lesson learned on how NOT to judge a book by its cover!\n\nWe walked in promptly at 9pm, which was our set appointment time.  We filled out some liability papers, gave our individual $50 for the lesson, and got started.  The lesson lasted an hour.  There were 8 poles in the studio, perfect for the 8 of us!\n\nOur instructor was this petite, cute blonde who was soo helpful and made us feel completely at ease.  She taught us these really cool pole swings and moves.  It really works your upper body!  No wonder she was so toned, dang!  She also gave us a lap dancing lesson, hahaha now that was an interesting experience I will never forget...
