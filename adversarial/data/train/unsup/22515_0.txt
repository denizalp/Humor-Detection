I have a dirty secret. \n\nAfter I drop the kids off at school, I go through this drive thru to get my day going. I'm not proud of it but you know, sometimes it's something that has to happen. \n\nHowever, if you have to do it, this is the one you want. No matter how long the line is, it moves fast and the voice in the speaker box is anyways friendly and upbeat. \n \nThe very best part of this location is the star of the drive thru, Bob. Bob is awesome. He is always glad to see me, treats me like a regular and makes me laugh. Everytime I drive away, I'm chuckling to myself about something Bob said. He makes my day, every day. \n\nThe coffee is... Starbucks. I don't love it and I openly hate myself on the inside for drinking it but Bob makes my self loathing worth it.
