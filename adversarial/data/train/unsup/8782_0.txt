WRite review.\nNeat and clean and classy store with a wide variety of adult themed items to draw in the prudest of prudes as well as the dom-est of doms and every one in between. \n\nThis location is large and has a large selection of items of all sorts.  I thought the dungeon room was a neat way to take out the frustrations.  ha!  no pun intended, but kinda.\n\nI discovered this store while looking for a costume for a party I was attending.  I found a costume online that I could not order on one website, but discovered a similar one at Fascination's online website.  so I went down there in person to check it out.  I wanted a French Maid costume.  They had everything I needed in their large selection of various costumes right in the store.  Stockings, the dress, the hat, apron.  I was able to get all that I needed right from this store.  \n\nAs far as the adult themed items in the store.  Everything seemed so expensive and over priced.  My goodness.   I can't imagine spending that kind of money on some of those things.  \n\nAll in all, I wrote this review because this store is not a sleazy or cheesy type of store.  It's a very decent place to shop if you are into the items that are in this store.  You can also find costumes at this location that you'd find at some of the Party stores or online.
