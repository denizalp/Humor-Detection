The Experience:\nI was looking for a pet friendly hotel for a mini vacation with my puppy brother. I decided to go on the off days and check in on a Sunday afternoon and check out on a Tuesday (to avoid the drunken crowds on the weekends). There is a dog park and a memorial park found after you cross the valet lines. They provide free valet parking service which is kinda nice and definitely makes you feel special. Walking into Vdara you can clearly notice that there is no casino or smoke from people's cigarettes. I honestly loved that! I loved not walking in and smelling a whole lot of crap. There is also one bar and a starbucks. The location of Vdara itself isn't too shabby. You are able to go to Cosmo with just a few steps, it's in the City Center so it's definitely very close to every thing. I did see the cleaning cart in our hallway all 3 days that we were there. Not sure if maybe it was forgotten or what but it was just so weird and random to see it there. Also, on one of the nights we were there, I ordered room service for myself while I was taking a hot bath and the person that delivered literally just walked into my room, while dog was loose (being that I was in the room with him). It was a weird experience. So glad that my husband was there to go take care of it and ensure that Porky didn't get out. I would have preferred for room service to knock first and if no answer, come back after a few minutes or something, don't just walk in, especially when you have a dog staying in the room. As far as cost goes for what you get, not too bad. Totally worth it.\n\n\nThe Room:\nHuge! Modern and very spacious suite. I loved the huge window we had in our room (our view wasn't the greatest.. we saw the highway but no biggie). It was a bit of a pain to get out of bed to close the blinds (yea, I'm lazy.. don't judge me.. it is called vacation!). The room had enough space for Porky to even run around. It had a comfy couch by the window. There is a kitchen area with a stove and a sink that is found in the entrance of the suite. You can call the front desk for kitchen ware for what I understand. There is also a small fridge and two free water bottles are provided for you every day. There is a big bathroom with a soak tub and a standing shower. One sink with a decent amount of space for all my crap. WiFi was ok. Tv is alright too. The tv is in a weird location of the room being that if I lay down in bed, it is not in front center of me. \n\nDog friendliness:\nI honestly loved that it was dog friendly. Dogs up to 70 pounds or two dogs with the combined weight of 70 pounds are welcome to stay at Vdara. There is an additional fee of $50 per night plus an additional $75 one time only cleaning fee that is not refundable. When you check in, the make you sign a waiver and let you know the rules. They provide your dog a small goody bag with a blanket, a dog treat and a dog menu. Being that it's a dog friendly casino, there will be times that dogs will bark during your stay. I was ok with it but I know my pup had a few moments of \"wtf? what was that?\" Nothing drastic though. I had the chance to order room service for Porkchop since provide a dog menu. Sure why not, right? He gobbled that up in no time too. Must have been good. There is a dog park with dog poop bags, a bench and a water fountain. Unfortunately you gotta cross the valet line to get to it. That would be one reason to deduct a star. No dog bowls available unless you call the front desk. \n\nDog room service menu:\nFetch of the day- Seared filet with sweet potatoes. green beans and yellow squash (S: $10 M: $12)\n\nChicken a la coop- Hormone free baked chicken with whole grain brown rice\n(S: $7 M: $14)\n\nRollover- Chicken and beef sauteed with fresh vegetables and orzo pasta\n(S: $8 M: $15)\n\nCasino and Parking Lot: NO casino. Valet parking only and it's super tricky to find.\n\n\nCustomer service: 8\/10\nPet Stay Deluxe Suite: 9\/10\nDecorations around the hotel: very modern and artsy! 10\/10\nCasino: NO casino (or smoking or parking structure in this hotel)\nOver all: 9\/10\n\n\nWouldn't mind coming back and staying here again, since I can bring my fur baby with me and be in a clean and comfortable room. I would recommend looking around for damage in the room prior getting comfy just to ensure that there is no prior dog damage that you would be held accountable for.
