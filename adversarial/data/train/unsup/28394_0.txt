I love this place!! Hubby and I decided to go someplace different for breakfast. The restaurant has the ambiance like Cracker Barrel when you walk in, old fashioned restaurant. The people are nice servers actually talk to you and check on you to refill drinks. The mini Muffins are to die for and the food as well. We had the pancakes, apple bacon and sausage links with potatoes. Very delicious. We will be returning again!!
