When I saw this place, I thought....really?!?!  midtown needs another gelato spot like I need a hole in my head.  Then I stepped in and then I tried their gelato.  As far as I am concerned, all other gelato joints on Mt Pleasant and Bayview can close down and hang their heads in shame.\n\nThis store, ladies and gentlemen, is what gelato is meant to be.  You really feel like you are stepping off the street in Toronto and into viva Italia!\nDuring my visit I heard the owner talking over skype in Italian, Italian music was playing, some Italian import goods were available and all the flavours were written in Italian.\n\nThe owner is great.  Ask him for his favourites, like I did, and you will not be disappointed.  \n\nEach gelato I tried had fabulously smooth texture, rich flavour and no hit of fake flavouring or after taste.\n\nHighly, highly, highly recommend.
