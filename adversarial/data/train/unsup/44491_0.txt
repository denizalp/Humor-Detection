Wild Thaiger is hands down the best Thai food in the whole valley. I've been coming here since 2004 and it has been consistently amazing since the beginning. They have my favorite spring rolls (usually I get veggie), and that's out of any Asian restaurant I've been to, Thai, Chinese, Cambodian, whatever. Their curries are on point, not soupy like most places. I usually get the beef waterfall salad but everything I've gotten here has been great. It is so, so good!
