This is the perfect dessert for a day in the desert! It's light and airy and oh so delicious. I keep going back to the taro flavor because it's so good, but I wouldn't doubt that the other flavors are just as delicious! They have a super cute outdoor area that would be great for cooler weather. They even have a hammock! They had the doors open for this location, while I agree that it adds a cool effect to the location it is just too hot in AZ right now. They also had a water pitcher with ice cold water that is a great touch. Again it's so hot and it is nice to have it readily available! The staff is also very friendly! It seems like it's a great place for a neighborhood hangout! \nI would definitely recommend this place for a fun and delicious dessert!
