Haven't eaten here yet.  Stopped by to check out the menu and the wine menu for future dining.  In return I got a \"you don't belong here, why are you wasting my time\" attitude from the hostess as she snatched the menu with a dirty look  and scoff when I handed it back to her.  I am in a t-shirt and jeans drinking juice, so you judge me?  You are located in a mall, guess what?  There are going to be people in t-shirts drinking juice.  I am sorry I didn't put on a suit after hiking at red rock to go to the mall and walk around checking things out.  Obviously the one star is  solely for the hostess who needs to learn not to judge people.\n\n5 stars for your wine pricing.  I will definitely be back to have a bottle of Relentless and try your food.  Honestly, your wine pricing would bring me in regardless of your hostesses, but not being judged at the door would be a big plus in the future.
