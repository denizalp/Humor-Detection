HOLEY DONUTS ! ! ! \n\nWOW !   The Chocolate Fried-Cake-Style with a light clear sugar glaze are OUT OF THIS WORLD !  This holey wonder---whose Earthly home-base is Cleveland, Ohio in a re-purposed drive-in from the 1950's---must have come here from another planet, and is now replicating itself every morning just to keep us content and unsuspicious.\n\nI don't live nearby, but when in the neighborhood for business, or other, I'll stop in for half a dozen to take home.   About twenty years ago, an employee brought some to work and I couldn't believe how delicious they were.  Twenty years later they're exactly the same---slightly crisp exterior, tender moist interior, and deliciously mild chocolate flavor.  \n\nI'm very particular about donuts, cakes and pastries, so very rarely purchase.   Even restaurants and bakeries extolled for their sweet offerings leave me unimpressed.  My grandmother always held the number one spot, with Hough's Bakery number two.  They're both gone now, so I seldom eat desserts of any type, but I'll make an exception for an occasional Royal Donut indulgence. \n\nI highly recommend it.  (It's so good I've never bothered trying any of the other donuts that they offer.)   They sometimes sell out early, so call in advance.
