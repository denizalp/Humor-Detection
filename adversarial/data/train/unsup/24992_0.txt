If you're looking for a great plate of food in Madison for under $10, you just aren't going to do any better than Mediterranean Cafe. I believe it's run by a father\/son from Algeria, so it's more Middle-Eastern-focused, but none of the food is really that foreign\/adventurous, just solid, typical Arabic-style mediterranean food. It's unassuming from the outside (and pretty cramped on the inside), but the food is always superb.\n\nI typically get the lamb shawarma plate, which comes with lamb, hummus, mixed greens salad and pita bread. The hummus is awesome, and the creaminess is really great in contrast with the vinegar-based salad dressing, which is great as well. The lamb and pita bread are pretty standard, but definitely solid. In my opinion, though, the real star of MedCaf is the deliciously-minty Algerian tea. I'm by no means a tea connoisseur, but trust me: You'll wish you could make it at home. \n\nAs I said, it can get cramped inside, but if you can get a seat, there's very little wait time. It's a great ethnic interior, with flags adorning the walls. The staff always thanks you when you leave, which, though it doesn't seem like a big deal, is really a nice touch. I do wish it was open more often, but it kind of adds to the exclusivity of the place. A really great eating experience overall, and like I said, for under $10, with an entree and the amazing tea.\n\nOne last thing: This is a cash-only place, so don't be a n00b and come in without any dough.
