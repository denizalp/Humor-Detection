This is probably one of those \"you can have fun anywhere if you are with friends\" places. I don't have any ill will towards the place but I can't bring myself to praise it either. Just not that memorable. I've been there once for brunch and once on a Saturday night.\n\nBrunch was fine. It was late in the afternoon so it was quiet so service was quick and the waitress had a nice attitude (no, I'm not being sarcastic, she was quite nice). A decent standby if you are in the neighborhood looking for brunch and want to know what is out there.\n\nThe Saturday night was ok. It was fairly crowded and the bar was pretty typical weekend Ossington st. Not bad. A lot of people standing around. Not a ton of people smiling but not dripping with attitude like some places further east.\n\nThe music oscillated wildly between pretty great and decidedly meh. I had the \"I feel like I can DJ better than this at home\" conversation with someone in the bathroom. For every \"Award Tour\", \"Wanna Be Starting Something\" or \"Got Your Money\" there was an ill advised descent into Ace of Base or Marley \"Three Little Birds.\" \n\nThe good: the space is pretty big (especially in back) so it would probably be good for large groups. The coat check people were also really helpful in clearing up a mix-up with our jackets.\n\nIn sum: I would not be averse to going back, but it as you can probably tell, I don't have any deep burning desire to do so. No ill will but no gushing praise. I'm guessing that two stars is the appropriate grade for that.
