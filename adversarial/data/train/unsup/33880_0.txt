I have watched the O show from Cirque de Soleil twice, and always wanted to watch a new show. I bought the tickets from vegas.com four hours before the show, and the seats given were great. Love the show. Love all the details in the show. The stage, costume, skills, music, everything were fantastic. I'll recommend this show to everyone.
