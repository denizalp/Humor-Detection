The store it self is gorgeous!!!!! I went in because I wanted to get a purse, I work retail too, so I know how important is customer service when it comes to make customers feel welcome and comfortable. No one approached us and they were at least 3 associates without clients. I asked for help and the lady seemed not in her best moment, she showed me the bag, she didn't offer us water or anything, didn't smile at all.. so I decided to leave, I went to the forum shops store instead.
