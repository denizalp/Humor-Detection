Tucky's was just an average barbecue place. The food was memorable. I got the two meat plate with brisket and pulled pork. They were both lukewarm and didn't have much flavor. The cornbread tops were dry, but I did like the mac & cheese. The service wasn't overly friendly and the place was a bit dirty. Enough to not make me to return.
