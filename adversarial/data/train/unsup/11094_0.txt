Those who know, know Antonino's. \nIt's sort of one of those Italian rights of passages. When you talk about Italian fast food, Antonino's is a gauge on whether or not you know and are willing to drive for good food. Embarrassed that i had never heard of this place, i made my way down one fine afternoon. \n\nSimple, delicious, cheap, friendly service, you really can't go wrong here - be it a pasta, a fresh Neapolitan pizza or a delicious sandwich. They make it all at a competitive price.\n\nWarning though - group napping is a popular occurrence after an Antonino's meal.
