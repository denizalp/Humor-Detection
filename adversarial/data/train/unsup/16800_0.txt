This is a review from my 9 year old niece who lives in the area.\n\nWhen my aunt and uncle said we are going to the pool we all said YEAH!!!  When we got there we said OUCH because the floors are so hot and burning. We all enjoyed the pool, diving board, waterslide, and the lazy river of course!  Although the floors burned our feet, we all had fun and did not want to leave!
