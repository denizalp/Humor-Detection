My first time was TUM's March 11th event and even tough it was freezing cold, close to -15, I enjoyed every single minute of it. The crowd was good, vibe was amazing, good music, AMAZING food, wine+beer +tequila just made it perfect. The whole market was very well organized. There were line ups for some vendors but all great things worth the wait. Location worked perfect for me as I drive and it was close to my house, but I'm not sure how people without a car can get there since its not TTCable. \n\nI guess the cold should have been the biggest issue for everyone rating it, but I dont think they expected it at all especially for a warm winter like this years. \n\nOverall I loved it, I'd like to go to such a market every week in summer. Perhaps they could improve the events by having live bands playing too.
