Booked a room here on a super expensive Vegas weekend w\/ a really good rate! I think it was about $100 a night on a Friday and Saturday. No resort fee! \n\nI haven't stayed in a room off the strip in a long time, and while there are moments where I wish it was more convenient to go back to my hotel room, over it worked out. The rooms here are more like timeshares. Suites with amenities. We booked a standard suite. Checkout was at 11am, even though it says 10am.\n\nThe good:\n-A cute and modern kitchenette! We even had a dishwasher and a stove! Fully stocked with dishware, utensils, coffee and popcorn! \n-A washer and dryer. But we didn't use it.\n-A tv in the living room and in the bed room\n-A good size bathroom. And the water pressure was great\n-King size bed was comfy! \n-Staff was very attentive and if we requested something, they would call us afterwards to make sure we got it. \n-The gym was a good size. It wasn't crowded either in the morning. \n-Indoor pool. We didn't use it but I liked that it was there. Closes at 11pm at night.\n\nThe not so great:\n-Walls are thin. We could hear our neighbors. Especially since a standard suite is connected to a deluxe. \n-Not enough pillows and towels. Had to request more.\n-No daily maid service. And extra $20 a day if you request it. \n-Air conditioning unit was LOUD! Kept waking me up at night every time it turned on. \n-Sofa bed sank in the middle\n-The layout of the suite could have been better. The hallway with the bathroom separated the living room and the bedroom. Both rooms felt very enclosed and partitioned off from one another.\n-More closet space. Especially with four girls! \n\nReally liked that there was a liquor store, ABC store and a few restaurants attached to the building. Really convenient! The drive to the strip is less then 5 minutes. The have free shuttles very hour too but it stops pretty early. Not for the party animals.\n\nOverall, good option if you want to save a bit of money and don't mind being off the strip!
