I came here with my boyfriend for the very first time last night. We loved it!!                   A great venue, small and intimate. Nice soft seats, done in red velor.                                 It is a small Theater,so it makes it so easy to see the performance very clearly.  Everyone that works here is very friendly. The attendants were very helpful..The bathrooms are very clean and automated.                                                                                        There is even a snack bar with consumer friendly prices. You make take your bottled water in the Theater with you as well.  We saw the show Daddy Long Legs, i loved it so!   It was a great story and so well done.  What a brilliant performance!! Wonderful singing. Lots of parking and restaurants around so you can eat before you go. We will be back and looking forward to it!
