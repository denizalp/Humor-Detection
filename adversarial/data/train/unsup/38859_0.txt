Just had the winter tuneup done on my unit that Dukes of Air installed in March. The technician, Kalem was one of the same guys that helped with the tricky install (due to where it was located in our house). He was great during the install, troubleshooting a problem that arose due to our crazy house, so I was happy to see he was the tech today for service. The office gave me a two hour timeframe of when to expect him, but he did call before he arrived to give me an even more accurate time which I appreciated! He is friendly, professional, clean, and thorough. What more could I ask for? There was a mix-up with the office concerning service that is covered with install, so hopefully they will honor the second free tuneup when the weather warms. I will update the review if needed, but right now, Kalem gets five stars for his service!
