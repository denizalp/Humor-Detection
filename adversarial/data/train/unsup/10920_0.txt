GENERAL NOTES\nI love living in the entertainment district for the close proximity to a wide variety of tasty and cheap food. However I'm so close to so many great food places that the thought of walking further for longer than 6 minutes to get food is one that doesn't often occur to me. \n\nEnter Burger Brats, a burger shop I can see from my window, filling the gourmet(ish) burger-sized hole that has been missing from my regular diet for the past...I dunno, while.\n\nFogs and I went down to check it out before their grand opening and were greeted by some very nice, very enthusiastic people. Unfortunately, the burgers are too expensive and the fries aren't great. I'm sure I'll go from time to time but the value isn't there for me. Maybe their malts are good...maybe they'll get better...or cheaper...\n\nMENU RECOMMENDATIONS\nI had the mushroom melt burger which was good but severely lacking in toppings beyond those found in the name of the burger. Geoff had some other burger which was also good but not great. \n\nI've tried the fries and the sweet potato fries. Both were disappointing. Especially the sweet potato fries. They cut them like regular fries and they're not crispy or flavourful enough for my taste. \n\nSo...try a burger?\n\nSERVICE NOTES\nVery friendly staff. Open late on weekends. \n\nLOCATION NOTES\nNorth side of Adelaide, just West of Duncan in a basement unit. I don't want to say where as it's still the best kept secret in the entertainment district but there's free parking very close to this establishment. \n\nHUMOUROUS STORY\nDespite the name, they do NOT serve brats here.
