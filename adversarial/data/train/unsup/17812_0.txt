This place is in the middle of nowhere. Well actually I only say that because this side of town is pretty foreign to me. \n\nIt's a pretty cool spot if you live in the area. My friend had a birthday party here and she got to rent out the whole outside patio. It was a cool night so it wasn't too hot. Everyone that was there for her got a stamp so you can get half off appetizers, well drinks, and beer on tap. The beers on tap was pretty good. \n\nThey have karaoke and the DJ was awesome. He seemed like an aspiring rapper. \n\nThe prices for the the food and drinks were pretty reasonable not too pricey. This place is pretty cool we had a good time. I probably won't be coming here too often considering is pretty far from me but if I was in the area I wouldn't count this place out.
