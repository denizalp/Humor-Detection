Not the greatest service here. The meat and seafood departments rock but the others, not so much.  Most of the time they act like they are doing you a favor by helping you. Once the cheese dept yelled at me for being on the wrong side of the counter, I was avoiding a lady who was coughing up a lung. So, to prevent getting sick I walked around to the other side, clearly where I could still be seen and waited on.  I have so many of those stories where people just don't care. The one on the strip is superb.  They have their A game going, too many tourists not to. They have a better selection of prepared foods as well and the people that work there are happy and willing to help.  There is a wonderful lady at check out counter in Henderson.  I'm going to get her name.  She's happier than a pig in mud every time I go to her. She makes my trip to Whole Foods worth it. Always smiling and happy to have a job.?
