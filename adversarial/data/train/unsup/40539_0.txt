Magic was pretty good. There is underlying adult humor that the kids won't get so I barely held my breath. I was anxious what was going to happen next but it was my fault that I chose to bring my kids to Las Vegas. You can get free tickets at the back of the hotel through the rewards center without signing up for anything. We had to buy four drinks that cost around $40.
