Came here to look for a netbook.  After being approached by Dwight the sales person, he showed us a netbook he retrieved from the stockroom.  This particular netbook was not on display.  He explained us the specs and informed us the price was 320.  He said a free pc tune up software came with the netbook.  I didn't need it, but he said it was free so i said okay.   When we went to the cash, looking at the register they were rung up as two diff items, 280 for the netbook, 40 for the software.  I asked if the real price for the netbook was 280.  He said no, it was just for inventory purposes.  I was suspicious of this, so i looked it up later online and realized that the netbook was in fact 280 and I was lied to straight to my face, multiple times.  Needless to say I was pissed for being lied to, so I went to get it refunded, talked to the manager who offered no apology, and no apology from the sales person.  \n\nThese guys make commission on these extras, so make sure to look ONLINE for the price first, before purchasing, because these guys will lie to you.  The prices are good, but after being lied to like that I'll never shop here again.
