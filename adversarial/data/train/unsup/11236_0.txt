If you find a drycleaner you like, don't ever leave them - not even if they are across the city. \n\nGoing to a formal event, I wanted to wear one of my new bridesmaid dresses again (yeah, that's right). It needed to be cleaned, and Tower Cleaners is near my office. I figured since business folk trust them with their suits etcetera that I would be fine. Right? Wrong.\n\nThe back panel on my dress has a snap so you can't look through the lace and get a nice show. They broke the snap OFF of the dress so that it won't secure. So that you CAN look through the lace and get a nice show. Well, I'm not sure if the show is that nice. ANYWAY,  Thanks. Then the boning in the top portion of the dress is now jutting THROUGH the fabric and jabbing me so much that I need to wear a bandaid in that one spot - or bleed and die.
