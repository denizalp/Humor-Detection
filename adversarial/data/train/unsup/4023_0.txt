The wife and I met a friend of hers who lives in Vegas (and her three young children) for brunch on a Saturday at Yardbird Southern Table & Bar.  We didn't make reservations in advance, which was very poor planning on our part as the restaurant was packed with brunch-seekers.  We put our names on the waitlist for a table, but were fortunate to be able to be seated in the lounge.  The Yardbird staff throughout our visit was exemplary, especially our server (unfortunately, I didn't get her name) who initially took care of us after we were seated in the lounge, won me over big time with incredible hospitality and service by securing us another coffee table and chair to accommodate our group of six while taking and delivering our drink order.  As luck would have it, a large table came available in the dining room and we were able to be reseated at a much more functional location for our party.  \n\nWe shared a couple of orders of the Deviled Eggs ($10) for the table.  They were delicious with the salmon roe giving them a nice visual, textural, and flavor pop.  The wife and I shared an order of their signature Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles ($36).   Each of the three pieces of chicken we received was perfectly fried, but more importantly, internally moist and juicy.  The waffle was nicely savory as it was infused with sharp cheddar cheese.  The bourbon-infused maple syrup was a perfect topping for the savory waffles.  While it was a pricey dish, it was easily the best version of chicken and waffles that I've ever had.  Yardbird isn't a great place to bring children, but my wife's friend's children seemed to really enjoy their mac 'n cheese.  \n\nI'd equate Yardbird Southern Table & Bar to Southern \"fine-dining\".  It was truly an enjoyable meal and a solid place for brunch.  I'd gladly return for brunch or give it a try for dinner.  4.25 stars, but the service made it a 5-star experience!
