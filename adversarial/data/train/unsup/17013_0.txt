A new year... new coffee places to try out. Piedmont has been on my radar with it's vivid latte art with seems to be red drinks (beet? red velvet?) and their green tea.  With the insane long wait at nearby Lola's Kitchen, Piedmont was a nice soothing atmosphere to kick start a nice Sunday.\n\nThe moment you step in, the wafting smells of a baked cinnamon buns just infuse your nose.  The place is run by a seemingly nice family with the head at the cashier taking orders and the younger one being the barista.  The aesthetic reminds me of the many new loft minimalist chill vibes that a lot of the newer places are showing.  I like it... exposed cement walls are artistically warmed up with many pretty flower pictures.  The large slabs of wood on the tables keeps this from feeling sterile and snobby 3rd wave coffee trend.  There's enough tables for people to sit and talk or work.  I wouldn't say you can do a full team meeting here but it has more seats than your average place.  It's nice and clean... I like it.\n\nDirty Chai Latte - Light on flavour but that's because they're using the real deal tea leaves to create the chai instead of a syrup or premix.  I would say for them to up the amount of chai leaves to give it a real flavour and not just a diluted chai.  3\/5\n\nFlat White - A nice drink with a more robust coffee taste that balanced nicely with the almond milk.  It's not as strong as I like it compared to other places in Toronto but for those are just dipping their toe into drinks beyond a double double.  This would be a nice introduction 4\/5\n\nOverall, great little bright place that delivers on solid drinks.  Definitely would return if I have to wait around in the area again.  Next time I'll try their matcha latte.
