Don't waste your time at this place. Me and my girlfriend came here last weekend and a bartender (Mike was his name) was continually hitting on my girlfriend, right in front of me. She was extremely uncomfortable. We watched him do the same to every girl in the bar... it was repulsive. They were over serving everyone in there and the drinks we got were WAY TOO STRONG. This place is poorly managed for letting their bartenders over pour and steal money out of the OWNERS POCKET... pathetic. The food was mediocre and over priced... over $10 for a burger that tasted like a fast food joint.\n\nMost importantly, a COP WAS SITTING IN THE PARKING LOT when we left - just waiting to give people DUIs - coupled with the over pouring and repulsive actions of the bartender, we'll never be here again. I will ensure nobody I know ever spends a penny at this place as well - do the same... there are plenty of legitimate bars and restaurants in this area that deserve your business... this isn't one of them.
