I could have easily given this place 4 stars for the soup alone.  I'm not a fan of most of their sandwiches, due to using cold lunch meat slices.  This trip blew it for me, starting with soured and spoiled iced tea. I mean, it even stunk it was so sour.  I mentioned it to Nate, who was bussing tables and he just ignored it.  Then mentioned it to the girl behind the counter, which Nate overheard, and he rolled his eyes at me.  At the end of my meal, I tried the tea again, thinking maybe it had been remade.  Nope! Still sour.  I mentioned it to Nate again, and he got very argumentative, and defensive.  Started throwing his hands in the air and telling me that the tea is just fine.  I then asked him to get a manager, at which he started to argue about that too.  I then asked for less attitude, and he threw his hands in the air again.  Finally, a manager comes out.  She was appropriate, nice and apologized, and offered a complimentary soup to go.  They finally decided to make some fresh tea.  Hopefully Nate will learn to grow up and handle customers as a professional, or maybe he needs to find do another line of work.  At this point, it really is questionable if I'll be back.  I was quite offended.
