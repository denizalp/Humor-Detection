My first time ever doing an escape room was here at Lockdown. My friends and I, a group of 6, did the Mob Boss one. Overall I had a memorable experience and it made me really excited for the next escape room! Overall, I would say Lockdown is a 3.5\/5.\n\nBasically you need to work together to solve puzzles or find clues to get to the end. It's a great bonding experience tbh because you are forced to work together! You do get clues & you're never truly locked in, though, FYI.\n\nI would recommend doing an escape room to everyone--you gotta try it at least once! \n\nI would've given this a full 5\/5 except for the fact that the locks were very difficult to open. I honestly thought we could've finished the room in time if it weren't for the locks! We had a few times where we had the right code but it didn't open - then we'd ask for a clue that basically gave us what we already knew (aka a waste of our clue!). Unfortunately we were all a little salty because of the technical difficulties and did not feel it was that fair.\n\nWould I recommend this place? Yes with a warning about the locks. There are a ton of other escape rooms I'd like to try out as well. Overall the escape room experience is one of a kind, so I'd definitely recommend a try!
