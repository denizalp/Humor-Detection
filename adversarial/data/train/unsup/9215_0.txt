I have no hesitation giving this restaurant 5 stars. The food was delicious and the service was great as well. I came here for lunch and had the coco mare - the seafood salad that has avocado, hearts of palm, corn, grape tomatoes, shrimp, and crab with lemon and olive oil. WOW one of the best salads I have ever had. I also ordered an amazing capuccino after lunch - one of the best I have ever had! Definitely want to try it out for dinner
