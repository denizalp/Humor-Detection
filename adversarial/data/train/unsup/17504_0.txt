Off the strip Bistro & Bar located at the Linq promenade next door to Flamingo. Great location serving great food. We got there on a Wednesday night around 8:30 pm, it was crowded but we got seated right away without reservation. \n\nI enjoyed the enviroment and decor of this place and everything we ordered was delicious here.....This place has a Giant Meatball that's out of this world. I also had the Kale salad which was very fresh and tasty. My friend ordered the steak and she was very happy with her steak. \n\nOnly dispointing thing about this place was our server....Our server came up to us and didn't greet us or give us his name. Just wanted to take order. He answered my questions about the menu, but was completely uninterested. Refilled beverages and food came out quickly, but never once asked if we enjoyed our meal. Also once we arrived and ordered our first drink I showed him the Yelp check in deal which is free cocktail with order of a cocktail. So I asked him is this mean one our drink is free since we both ordrered one? He then said No, buy one and then second one is free.  We finished eating and we are still waiting for him to ask us for the 2nd drink, he comes over with the check wow really? So where is our second drink? he said, oh I didn't realize you wanted you FREE cocktail. Really? Isn't that your job to ask how I am doing and If I need anything else? Yes we did got our free cocktails after all but I wasn't impress by our servers attitude at all. \n\nI would have given this place much better rating if our server was actualy doing his job.
