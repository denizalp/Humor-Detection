I'm going to have to give this place a 5* rating. Not because it's particularly pretty or because it was the best meal of my life, but because from the second we walked in, all staff members were so caring and sweet - it's just so rare to get AMAZING customer service in Montreal! \n\nWhen they found out it was our first time visiting, our waitress was extra helpful and sweet. That's what'll make the difference the next time I'm craving chicken and not sure where to eat... Chalet will be on the top of my list for sure!!\n\nThey serve comforting, Quebecois-style rotisserie chicken with delicious fries that have a hint on vanilla in them, served with their BBQ sauce, a piece of white bread and coleslaw (not creamy, the vinegary type). I personally don't see the need for the bread but the chicken, sauce, fries and coleslaw all had great flavours. \n\nSuch a cozy vibe inside the restaurant as it's been around since the 1940s. The guys at work order from this place every couple of weeks so maybe I'll join them next time :P
