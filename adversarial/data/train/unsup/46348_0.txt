Ariana at the bar was outstanding. It's seems so much harder now to get excellent service and she provided just that. Ariana was very attentive, aware and extremely helpful! The wine served tasted like it had turned she immediately offered to open a new bottle and it was perfect! She knows how to properly handle food (don't touch it) knows the menu, and made great recommendations. Called the manager over just to say how great she really is, and of course he agreed. Andrew was very responsive and aware of what is going on within the restaurant. Highly recommend this location and Ariana (and Andrew) for recognizing great staff when you have it!!!!! Thanks for a great dinner
