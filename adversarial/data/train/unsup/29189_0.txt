Took my 11 year old son and his friends.  It was his first time and we traveled from Surprise AZ.  He had a great time, loved the four hours he spent there, learned a few new tricks... but sadly, in the end, as we were leaving, his backpack was stolen.  Granted, it's not the facilities fault but the staff didn't seem to care either.  They were very involved in conversation while I stood waiting for assistance, then no one even offered assistance.  Just kind of, oh well, not our problem, it's 4:00pm and we want to close up.  I had to suggest taking my name and number in the event it turned up or someone brought it in.  Just disappointing for our first experience.  My sons been bugging me for nearly a year to go here and spent the entire ride home (an hour) upset because his brand new shoes were in there, his video camera, the hat his sister bought him, and it's his school backpack.  Just stuff but nonetheless disappointing.  Still hoping it will turn up.  Lesson learned, don't turn your back on your belongings for even a minute.  That's all it took - he JUST put it down near me, I stepped to the side to take a picture of him, and it was gone that quick.  . Parents, teach your kids better than this.
