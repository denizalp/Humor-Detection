Great work from the kitchen, but EPIC FAIL by front of house... If only that great food hadn't died on the pass! (6-8 minutes waiting!!) Beer arrived \"cool\" and FLAT. (how long had IT been sitting there?!) Goddamit!\n\n[It looks like yelpers Zachary V. and Dan P. got it right before me. Poor service since at least a few months ago!]\n\nThe FRENCH ONION BURGER was well-conceived and the ingredients were great!\n--perfectly-cooked medium-rare burger\n--gruyere on top. great choice, perfect flavor, but already hardening and cold\n--grilled onions were juicy and not too salty\n--even the bun was buttery and delicious\n--tater-tots perfectly cooked\n### Too bad it all arrived lukewarm and DEAD.\n\nYou know (or perhaps you don't) what \"dead\" food tastes like. If you don't know what that means, think \"taking home a to-go bucket of fried chicken with a side bucket of french fries\". When you arrive home, it's just faded! The fried chicken may still be kind of crispy and slightly warm and the fries may be tasty, but they've lost their life. They're DEAD! You go (or you should be going) to a restaurant to taste well-prepared food, from fresh, high-quality ingredients, presented just moments after cooking.\n\nHere's the timeline:\n# arrived, patio table filthy from previous diners. Where's the support staff? (nowhere)\n# host didn't even notice how dirty our table was and take action to clean it\n# nor did our server when she arrived to ask us if we wanted waters. I had to ask her for a towel to clean it up. Oh, was this supposed to be a sawdust-bar?\n# +12 first service (to take drink orders) 12 minutes.\n# +19 minutes orders taken\n## +22 minutes beer arrives. For a place called \"cold beer\" and cheeseburgers, I want to be *drinking* a draught beer no more than 6 minutes after I sit down.\n### the beer is FLAT and \"cool\". At +22 minutes, I was going to drink it anyway. goddamit! I am so mad at you right now!\n+35 minutes, the table next to us, having arrived after us, receives part of their order (2 plates) before us\n+43 minutes, the table next to us receives their other 2 mains.\n## +45 minutes, our food arrives, DEAD\n+50 minutes, i sent it back saying I don't have time now to wait another 20 minutes for more food.\n+55 minutes my colleagues sitting at a nearby table get their food, having arrived a few minutes after we did\n# +75 minutes, i have to flag down another server to get our check\n\nOther suggestions:\n* Redesign your menus. Beer and Alcohol menu reads like an index card i'm using as a cheat-sheet for a lecture.\n* As you present the regular menu, explain it to me. Tell me that the apps and features are on the front, and the Burgers (!) are on the back. Talk to me about it, and get me excited for what i'm about to eat. Don't just drop me and run.\n* it's *&@#$'n October in Phoenix. The weather is fantastic. You gotta know that folks are going to want to find a place to sit and have a great lunch (beer and a burger) on a great patio. How can you not properly staff for a mildly busy lunch service?!\n* where are the busers, runners and support staff? (read: nowhere!) Offload some of this work from the servers to let them do their jobs properly.\n\n\nNote: there may be a problem with my phone, but when I went to check in here and my GPS put me ON TOP OF the restaurant, it fell to 24th on the list of \"nearby restaurants\". :\/
