Super tasty. I am not a big shwarma fan but this place changed my mind . They are a bit smaller but have plenty of meat and pickles to make it very filling\n\nIt's cash only but there is a atm further down at the same plaza. Prices were good..4 shwarmas for 18. \n\nIt was busy while I was there with limited seating and dirty tables. I would recommend take out
