I was able to bring my Mom to see this show since she's a huge fan of Jay , anyway this turned out to be so fun ! This show has something for everyone , the description gives you an idea so I won't go into major details on the take .. I actually really loved the element of surprise that went a long with it .\n\nThis show is big on Participation from the audience and of course cool humor from the cast . The topic is of course XXX rated but seeing the way it's scripted with improve scenes makes it so fun !\n\n\nIf you're looking to drink you have to go out and get your drinks but the show lasts just long enough you don't notice the lack of a bar because once the show gets going you're sucked in and I didn't notice any moments that dragged .\n\n\nThis show is so fun ! And I hope it is able to get a chance to stick around Vegas!
