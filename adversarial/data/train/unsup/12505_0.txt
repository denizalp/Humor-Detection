My landlord bought me a fridge here yesterday.  I called them to set up the delivery.  They guy on the phone was chilly and abrupt.  These folks will not work with your schedule,  you have to work with their's.  I was told the choices were either Thursday or Saturday, thats it.  I said how about Thursday afternoon, around 4?  No, he said, he can't tell me when they will be there.  The delivery guy will call me and give a 2 hour window.  I couldn't even request any point in the whole afternoon, he said no because they could be in my area at 8am and thats when I would get it.   Rude, humorless, cold, and extremely dismissive.  This is why everyone goes to the 'big box' stores now, like Best Buy or HH Gregg.  Better prices, better selection, and greater flexibility.
