A couple of people at work raved about how Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles made it's way to Vegas and I had to give it a try.\n\nI came on Friday around 3 and luckily that's when their Happy Hour starts!  (HH 3-6PM). Appetizers are $5 (except for the catfish beignets) and draft beer is $1 off.  We started off with some catfish beignets and fried gizzards.  And I opted for their namesake Lo-Lo's, which comes with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles.  \n\nCatfish beignets: Large pieces of flakey catfish, with a nice crisp breading.  It comes with a dipping sauce that tastes like thousand islands dressing, but the best way to eat it is to douse it in hot sauce!  \n\nFried gizzards: Definitely an acquired taste if you aren't used to it.  It's a little chewy.  I didn't care too much for it because I was all over the catfish.  \n\nLo-Lo's: The 3 pieces of chicken were huge!  1 large chicken breast was enough to fill me up.   The breading was a little too salty for my taste, so I ripped off the skin and went straight to the meat.  The meat was tender, juicy, and seasoned perfectly (after getting past all the breading).  The waffles were a bit soggy (before adding any syrup).  I wish they toasted it a little longer to crisp it up.  All in all, soggy waffles wouldn't deter me from enjoying my meal.  Flavor was great!  I loved how the chicken paired well with the hint of cinnamon in the syrup and butteriness from the waffles.  \n\nAll in all, the food was just okay for me.  Service was a little slow despite the restaurant being empty.  My favorite part of the meal was enjoying old school R&B playing in the background.
