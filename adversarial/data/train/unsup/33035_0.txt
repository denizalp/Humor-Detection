Our first time at this restaurant and really did not have any expectations.  If you were to order one thing in this restaurant, order the grilled calamari.  It blew me away and set the stage for the rest of the food.  We wound up having 5 or 6 more dishes and staying for over 2 hours.  I would definitely return to this restaurant again.
