I love this local place at ASU.  Dawn has been cutting my family's hair here for years and we look forward to every visit.  We never wait and it's always like visiting an old friend every time and catching up.  Usually I don't even say what I want done - she just remembers and gives me a cut fresh cut every time!  I don't know what more than I can say other than I wish the parking situation was a bit more ample.  Sure you can pay to park, but free spaces are a premium on busy days.
