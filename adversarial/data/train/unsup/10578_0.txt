This is my 1st year working for National Career Fairs. The company is under new management.. Which understandably has growing pains...We promote more career fair events than any other career fair company in the entire United States. They are the number one searched website by career seekers! I have seen good and bad events...very seldom has NCF events not kept their national average in attendance for both employers and job seekers..Our Sales Director has been very honest and fair to everyone he's hired...I love working for this company and can't wait for our 2016 events to start! We are gonna rock the business with a new product no one in the career fair business can compete with! Stay tuned!
