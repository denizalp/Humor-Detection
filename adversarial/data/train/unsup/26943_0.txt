EXCELLENT beer selection, both in the cooler and out.\nReasonable prices.\nSuper friendly and knowledgeable staff.\nNice layout that makes it a little homey-er than a Lee's or Total Wine.\nNot too far from home.\n\nBest of all: a bar inside that's pouring like 8 very unique beers (and some wines - didn't check them out). You can sit as long as you want, and it's ok to have kids with you!\n\nI haven't been for the free beer\/wine tasting nights, but I've heard it gets pretty packed. On a Friday evening, we were the only people in there.
