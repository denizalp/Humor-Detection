Learned about this new location of Amelie's opening & came to check it out.  I've had a hit & miss experience at their other locations & this was no different....although there were many more hits\n\nMushroom & onion quiche with Gruyere- crust was flakey but the quiche was dense & super flavorful. This is a repeat!\n\nTwice baked Almond croissant - super moist & subtly almondy - repeat!\n\nPecan tart - this is a southern staple & these guys did it right. Tender crust & lots of buttery pecan throughout - repeat!\n\nMacarons - even though most were raw on the inside, I was a fan in concept. Longer in the oven definitely required. Got 1 of each & here's the rundown\n\nJalape√±o- weird flavor that tasted more gelatinous & half raw on inside\n\nBasil-lime - raw but surprisingly nice compliment of flavor\n\nPistachio- subtle nut flavor\n\nRaspberry little bit raw, real raspberry jam (seeds). Intense raspberry flavor\n\nSalted caramel - this tasted like chocolate. No caramel taste. Wonder if it was mislabeled \n\nCinnamon ganache - CINNAMON. Just like biting into a cinnamon stick\n\nBourbon vanilla peach streusel - raw. Peach jam & maybe a slight cinnamon flavor to represent \"streusel\"\n\nMixed berry - dry with whole strawberry inside\n\nLemon - raw. No lemon taste\n\nMilk chocolate passion fruit - bit raw but nice compliment of chocolate to passion fruit\n\nHoney - my fav. Lovely honey aftertaste. Light creamy perfect crisp\n\nOrange - very orange w a vanilla cream. Like a dreamsicle\n\nSo when traveling back to the Uptown area, you'd best believe there will be another ginormous box of Amelie's goodies!
