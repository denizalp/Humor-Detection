I went there to attend a private function.  It was an evening event so l didn't get to check the golf course.  However, the golf club building is notably in need of rehab!  Carpet is stained, dirty, outdated. Elevator is dirty, slow yet noisy.  The establishment smells bad, furniture is old.  Finally drinks are very expensive and served in tacky disposable cups.  I ordered a rum & coke which was poured in a plastic cup for $12!  Enough said, l ll never step foot in there ever.
