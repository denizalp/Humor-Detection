The restaurant is very easy to find and is a lot bigger than it looks. I made a reservation for lunch time and was seating right when I checked in. The waiter proceeded to give us recommendations and then let us have some time to decide what to order.\n\nI knew they were popular for burgers and shakes so thats exactly what I ordered. The strawberry shake was fantastic!! They gave a huge amount and even a left over cup with some extra. I was able to share the shake and it was plenty for the two of us. As for the burger I got one with chicken and it was outstanding!! The toppings and sauces were all a wonderful compliment. \n\nOverall a great place to grab a bite to eat at the Cosmo. If you check in on Yelp they give you 50% off select draft beers which is a great perk! Also you get free popcorn with pizza seasoning instead of the typical bread most restaurants serve.
