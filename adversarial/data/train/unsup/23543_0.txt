I've had to re-do this review since Yelp HQ decided to combine the warehouse listing with the gas listing. Stop doing that!! \n\nShort and simple: \n\n1. You have to be a Costco member to buy gas here, duh!! \n2. It's cheaper than other gas stations. Like 20-40ish cents cheaper. \n3. There is and always will be a long line. Stop complaining about it. \n\nThe end.
