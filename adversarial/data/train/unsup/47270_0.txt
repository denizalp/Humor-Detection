So sad to see a great electronics store turn into an overpriced Woolworth. Apparently, they can't make it alone by just selling electronics. They now sell every garbage Nick Nack patty wack known to man.  There's one thing that hasn't changed. The staff is still a bunch of pricks. They still have no clue what customer service means. Maybe if they got rid of the white shirts and loosened up a bit maybe they would sell more merchandise. I'm just so disappointed in Fry's electronics.
