A recent shopping trip that resulted in some barginlicous finds is why I give this particular Dillard's a five-star rating. When they have sales, they have some friggin' sales! I'm talking about 70% off already reduced items!  Can you get any better than that? I just bought a very nice work dress that was originally $159 for $39 and a skirt suit originally priced at a little under $300 for $70.  Amazing!\n\nUsually their big sales are during the in-between seasons -- right before they get their new shipment for Fall or Summer. Lucky for us Phoenicians, we can usually pull off summer items into late fall and even early winter. \n\nThe sales clerks are also always very friendly and not overly pushy. They typically are older and more seasoned sales professionals, which is actually refreshing to me.  They don't stand around chatting with their co-workers and ignoring customers -- they understand what customer service is and help in what ever way they can.\n\nOh, and this Dillard's has a great shoe department.  Tons to choose from and a crap-load of salesmen to help you find your favorite pair. \n\nAlways keep Dillard's on your shopping radar -- you won't be disappointed, and your wallet will thank you.
