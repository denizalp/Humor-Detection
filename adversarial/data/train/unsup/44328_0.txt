This review is more on management than food or anything regarding the chain. Although I can imagine this establishment is not the only one doing this.\n\nSometime during the summer I wanted to get my mother a candied Apple because I know how much she loves them and she doesn't travel to the strip or other stores where they are very common very often so I figured I'd surprise her.\n\nI got home and cut it up for us to share and it was completely rotten. Okay no big deal, I'll just call and return them tomorrow. \n\nI called, spoke to a manager who had a sincere apology and even asked if I'd like a comped meal for 2 and I said sure since the place was so far away from my house anyways. \n\nSo I show up later that day dressed up and with my girlfriend only to ask for the manager and be completely ignored regarding the dinner.\n\nI say \"I'm the one that spoke with you earlier about the apple\" to which he replies \"I know, I remember\" then I ask about the comped meals and he completely ignores me and leads me inside and tells me to get 2 more apples along with my refund.\n\n2 comped meals is a lot for this kinda thing, but don't offer it and take it away. I invited my girlfriend and drove all the way out there for no reason.
