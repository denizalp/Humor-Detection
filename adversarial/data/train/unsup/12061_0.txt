I love events like this around town.  Instead of having to make multiple trips to different areas, you get it all in one stop.  This is especially great around the holidays.  Don't take that as me knocking the local businesses, I'm applauding them for coming together for the convenience of the community.  \n\nI came here in attempts to finish off my Christmas shopping and all that I ended up doing was buying things for myself.  I always start out with good intentions and then end up getting sidetracked.  It's not hard to do when you see all of the goods up for grabs here.  Small shout out to Steel City Cotton, not sure what it is with you guys, but every single time I see you at any event, I end up buying a tee from you guys.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed browsing the best part of this was the interactive part.  I know it was more aimed towards kids, but aren't we all kids at heart?  I made an ornament, took close up pictures of microscopic items with my phone, and the best thing was making an old, unwanted vinyl record a piece of art.  I am currently looking for a clocking mechanism to make it a talking piece in my home.  \n\nIt was such a great time here, I look forward to it next year.
