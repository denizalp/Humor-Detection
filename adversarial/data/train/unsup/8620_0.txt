Came to see about selling an almost new Marlin .22 and a Nikon rimfire prostaff scope (also basically new and in great condition). Walked in and was stared at vacantly by four employees who seemed to want to look busy after I saw them, when I realized that they weren't going to greet me or initiate conversation at all. So I approached the counter and was asked \"what do you want?\" By a kid who looked fifteen years old. After explaining that I wanted to sell the rifle and scope, he didn't say anything, just started to mess with a computer and after he was done, (I'm guessing here, again no words spoken to me) walks over to an older heavy set guy who's been loudly talking the entire time.  They mutter to each other for around 5 minutes and the kid comes back and says 75, maybe one hundred. \nNow don't get me wrong I know this isn't a super high value rifle, but the scope is worth 100 by itself and the rifle at least that. Needless to say I laughed and walked away, rifle still in hand. Steer clear if you know resale values and guns in general. This place reeks of a few gun savvy guys preying on those with little experience, and clueless employees who just Google what you bring in. STEER CLEAR OF THIS PLACE.
