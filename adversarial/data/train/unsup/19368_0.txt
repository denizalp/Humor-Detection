Known about the jabbowockeez for a few years now ever since Americas best dance crew... But finally got the chance to see them in person. Although they're not my favorite Americas best dance crew (Quest crew is), jabbowockeez has earned a close first\/ second place after seeing them live. \n\nTickets ran for $60 per after all the tax and fees and even though we were in the third section from the front... It was still really close because the theater isn't that big. There's also a gift store and bar inside where you can get some souvenir and Dranks if needed. The line to get in was smooth and easy, as well as getting out. The one thing I was disappointed in was no pictures of them whatsoever. ( no camera\/ cellphone rule) I guess it's understandable they want people to buy tickets and actually attend and see for themselves. The show was filled with great dance moves, story telling, character, jokes, audience interaction and pretty much a whole package to a show. Usually dancers just dance and get off and do another dance routine... But instead they were able to tell a story and really get the audience hooked. \n\nNow I understand the reason why they're one of the more successful dance crew to be known. Earning a place at the MGM grand is no easy thing but Jabbowockeez definitely earned the right to be there. 5 star performance and would love to go back for a different show.
