To Sherri Ds \"compliment\" she sent me asking me did i even try the pizza. Um ... Did u read the review? Clearly I didn't and thats because your phone guy upselled me on a medium one topping. For miss sherri d to be an entrepreneur i guess she thinks its justified that her menu states one price but the price i was given over the phone was almost 10$ more then what the menu states. The customer is always right ma'am. Maybe you havent been on your entrepreneur venture long enough to know that yet but i wouldnt give a dam if the pig or cow you get your meat from was made out of gold... If your menu says one price and i call and hear something totally different im gna be put off by that. And your phone guy just thought i was going to go along with it and pay it? Instead of complaining to me about leaving a bad review you should be more focused on what u did to get it in the first place. Im a dancer in vegas and make a very comfortable living so it wasnt about the money it was the dishonesty in it. If i had looked at the menu and seen that price and it was consistent with what he said on the phone i would have ordered. So convincing me ur pizza is worth the 30$ is not addressing the conflict at hand. Ur ignoring my issue to try n cover it up by saying everythings organic. BYE LADY
