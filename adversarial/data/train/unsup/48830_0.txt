So, I cheated at Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar. I got the Mac-N-Cheese Bacon Burger (and fries) to go vs. having the dining experience. So this review is just of their food, though their service was good - no complaints. (Actually, two bartenders fought over serving me...luckily, the male-half of them won out. :-) )\n\nThe burger was $20 and I would only spend that on a burger and fries in Vegas. Otherwise, this was worth about $13. Don't get me wrong; it was good, just too damn big. Eventually, I had to use the plastic fork and knife. And the Mac & Cheese stayed with the burger, which I liked. \n\nThe fries were a mixture of two brands; very nice. Unfortunately, the ketchup they gave me to go I had to be extremely conservative on since it was such a small portion.\n\nAnd speaking of small portions, I'm gonna need to order their smallest burger next time. This was a chore to eat. Again, still good, just hard to eat. I do have a big mouth...just not for actual food.\n\nGuy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen & Bar (\/5 Stars.)
