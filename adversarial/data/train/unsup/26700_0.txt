Why are you reading this? You have skimmed by other reviews of this place and still haven't gone? Ok if you have to hear it again here we go:\n\nThis place is great! The service is always excellent, the food has never disappointed and the complimentary chips and salsa are easily worth the trip alone. The atmosphere is fun and lively, there are TV screens showing sports mostly but you can still hold a conversation.\n\nThe only downside to this place is that sometimes there can be a wait. They will quote you 20 to 30 min, which is reasonable for a great place like this, but you will usually only wait 10 to 15.\n\n My advice for this place is to come hungry because will definitely leave full!
