I had heard so many good things about this bakery, and I was so excited to find out how it was close to my house! Located in the Walmart shopping center near N. Decatur and the 215, this cute little shop has delicious goodies ranging from salty to sweet. My S.O. and I arrived Sunday afternoon and had an assortment of specialties on their menu. There were over 15 different types of cookies. The cookies were crispy on the outside and ooey gooey on the inside. Absolutely delicious with many fun flavors! My favorite so far has to be the blue velvet. We also got the Canadian sunrise breakfast sandwich, which was very tasty. We loved that it came on a homemade biscuit - except it did seem to fall a part easily, so I wouldn't recommend this for eating and driving (if you do that sort do thing !) We also had to have their poutine (a traditional Canadian dish - fries, topped with gravy and cheese curds, and optional bacon.) After trying poutine once before in Vancouver, Canada, I was pleased to find it again so close to home! Aside from their delicious food, the customer service was exceptional. The staff was so friendly and helpful, and we will definitely be back to support this local business!
