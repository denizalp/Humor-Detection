My husband and I had a wonderful experience here. We signed up for their Terrarium Workshop, which involved each of us putting together a customized hanging air plant and a small terrarium. The two staff who were guiding us through it were both very helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable about the plants, stones, design ideas, and so on. They even let us create one large terrarium between the two of us, instead of a small one each, in order to accommodate the larger cacti that we specifically wanted to include. Our friends loved the resulting plants that we took home, and we definitely recommend ecostems to them.
