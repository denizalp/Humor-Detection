On their six year anniversary, it's only appropriate I write them a love letter on Yelp.\n\nAlcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages galore: organic kombucha, gluten-free wild ales, gluten-reduced beer, sours, and traditional ales & lagers. The kombuchas are amazing. I would drink a Lavender-ade and a Wake Up Call every single day if I could. Someone please buy me a kombucha fridge fully stocked, thanks. \n\nTrivia on Wednesday nights. On Wednesdays and Sundays Kombucha Growler fills are just $10. Fridays, Beer Growler Fills are $10. You'll find The Hunter's Wife food truck parked outside to feed you. \n\nI love that they use their warehouse space to host so many cool events. They do a really great job working with the community and coming up with great ideas. They also have weekly fitness options: yoga on Saturday's at 10am and Run Club on Sundays at 11am. Tuesdays they have a Disc Golf Putting League. \n\nOne word of warning: parking can get nuts here during disc golf night and when there are special events. Keep this in mind, you may want to skip driving and take an Uber. \n\nHuge congratulations to Townes on what he's built with Lenny Boy. The Charlotte Business Journal just selected him for a 40 under 40 award (2018). So well deserved.
