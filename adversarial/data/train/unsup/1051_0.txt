Disclaimer:  This may sound like an advertisement or that I am a hired reviewer for CDC, but the truth is, they were so terrific that I just have to sing their praises.  You can check my multiple reviews to see that I am an honest reviewer...\n\nHad the best experience ever with CDC Pools!  We just bought a vacation home in Scottsdale and needed to redo the surface of the pool.  Cassie was super helpful in assisting us in selecting the perfect pebble tech coating and tile within many options that could have been overwhelming.  With her expertise and guidance we were able to fine tune our selections and prioritize our needs very quickly.\n\nThat was just the beginning.  They assigned a point person to oversee the whole job and I was informed every step of the way.  I was able to connect with Sergio for any questions or concerns and he was more than responsive.  I never waited at all for him to get back to me and he was extremely helpful.  He came by to check on things periodically throughout the process and made sure that everything was to our satisfaction.  In my opinion, he went above and beyond in customer service attending to our every need and was always polite and respectful.\n\nThis has been a seamless, positive experience and my pool looks amazing!  (photos to come...)  Now I just need some warm weather so I can swim in it:) \n\nI highly recommend CDC Pools for your pool renovations.  They were fabulous!
