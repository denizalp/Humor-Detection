As good and friendly Dr. Suarez is - the frontdesk is awful, unfriendly and just forget if you need anything - you will die trying to get if from this staff. Trying for years  to overlook it as the doctor is great - but it is getting unacceptable and actually pretty costly to pay for their mistakes!
