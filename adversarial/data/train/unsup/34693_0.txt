Ran by some of the most amazing people I've ever met in the customer service industry. They are so courteous and genuinely care about your experience here. Super clean, and I cannot believe they actually featured Initial D (an excellent Japanese anime about cars) on a Saturday afternoon. What a gem of a theater and a total contrast to the horrible experience I had at an AMC last week. 5 stars!!!
