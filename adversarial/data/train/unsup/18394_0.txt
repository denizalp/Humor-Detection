Quik Trip is the Cadillac of convenience stores. \n\nImmaculately clean, brightly lit, and always a fast and friendly experience.\n\nI go out of my way to go to QT whenever possible, whether it's to gas up my ride or grab something to drink. \n\nThey have the cleanest restrooms you'll find in a convenience store. For that reason alone, I'll frequently change into my training clothes there on the way to practice knowing the floors won't be filthy (unlike the restrooms at the track, yuck).\n\nThe iced tea selection is ridiculous! Available in sweet and unsweet, I'm hooked to their unsweetened Pineapple Papaya and Mango flavors. And for .79 cents, you can't go wrong. \n\nPretty much any convenience store junk munchies can be found (chips, roller grill, etc.), but QT steps it up a notch and has a full-fledged bakery for donuts, pastries, ice cream mixers, smoothies and coffee. \n\nAlso, I have to say the assistant manager Joe C. kicks ass! The friendliest employee I've encountered at a QT, and that's saying a lot since they're all polite (in my experience at least). \n\nI stopped by last night for some tea after training. Hadn't been in for quite a while as we had to train in Chandler for a while until MCC reopened. \n\nThis Dude remembered my name and what I was up to last I dropped in. Killer memory and great customer service! \n\nQT will never do you wrong!
