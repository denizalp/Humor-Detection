Stopped by here for a post work-out feast. The place was well-lit and clean. Even though it was nearly 9pm on a Sunday, there was still a good amount of people eating there. It was a self-serve place, but the cashier was nice enough to bring our food right to our table. The wait wasn't that long. \n\nFor ~$19, you get 25 wings in 5 flavors of your choice. We tried: cajun teriyaki, hot garlic, afterburner (super spicy buffalo), citrus chipotle and mustang ranch. They were sooooooo good with the right amount of sauce and crispiness. The sauce was just right...enough to cover the whole wing, not all soggy and dripping. Out of the 5 flavors I tried, my favorite was CAJUN TERIYAKI, and my least favorite was mustang ranch. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I definitely recommend this place if you are a wings lover, because it will definitely \"wings\" you over!
