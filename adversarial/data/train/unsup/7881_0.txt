This place is in the friggin boonies, it's literally across a corn field and there's really nothing much around it other than a few gas stations\n\nI was really exciting coming to this mall thinking it was going to be huge but I was quite disappointed....not as many shops as I thought, finished it in less than 3hrs...they have some good brand name stores but mostly for the women like kate spade and shit....prices are incomparable to the states as always....it's clean with lots of parking, food court kind of lacking in selection...not to be rude or anything but a lot of the shoppers here are very pushy and don't have any manners at all...-____-\n\nQuite a few shops we had to wait in line for, example Tory burch, we had to wait 30mins to get it but they had this huge sale going on, it was a war zone inside, ppl holding onto 5 bags and shit the everywhere...there was only 1 changeroom and this lady stayed in there for 30mins....ppl were pissed off and complaining, she came out like a boss completely ignoring everyone giving her the looks\n\nNot coming back this place again, I say the Niagara one is much better
