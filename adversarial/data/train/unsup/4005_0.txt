Nice digs!  \nNice waitstaff!\nGreat bacon!\nReally good Bakn Bakn Bakn breakfast with some thinly sliced tasty potato home fries and toast.\nThe menu is creative and has many items that do not have bacon.  Looking forward to returning and trying some other items.\n\nFound out they are open all day including dinner with the same menu.  A full bar with wine, beer and specialty drinks is available.  I did think the prices were a little high.
