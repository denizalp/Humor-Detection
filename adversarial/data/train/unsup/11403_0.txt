Do not go here!\n\nAwful, petty, careless staff!  I have three dogs and five cats and they are my children! First strike for Alma School Animal Hospital, they gave me the wrong prescription medication which could have caused long term liver damage (or worse) and I did not receive any kind of apology.  I was so upset I called back to express this and was promised the vet would call and apologize himself - but he never did. The second strike was when the vet allowed me time to consider to vaccinate my older dog or not.  When I decided to do it, the vet fee was not waived as promised.  The front desk staff said I was lying and refused to even consult with the vet. Finally, they refused to provide me with my dog's prescriptions to refill! They knew I was leaving their practice and held the medication hostage; very unprofessional.\n\nObviously I found another vet who cares about animals, is careful when administering medication, keeps their promises, and respects their pet parents!
