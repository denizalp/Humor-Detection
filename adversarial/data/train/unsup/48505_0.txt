This place is awesome!!!! The service was amazing and the food was even better!  The staff was very attentive and nice.  There is a lot of cool stuff on the walls to look at while you wait for your food, and many tv 's to watch. The gift shop is a tad pricey but the items are nice. I was pleasantly surprised with a 20% off check in offer. I will be back here when I make a return visit to vegas.
