Found my go to place for tacos hidden away in the back of Pancho's at Kensington. It's definitely authentic, filling and more economical than Seven Lives. They just added chicken to their menu & it's good, better than the pastor I think. There's seating at the back (inside & outside patio) and facilities on the premise. I can't tell you how delicious their tacos were. You'll just have to try it out for yourself. The tacos were overflowing and your hands will get messy but there's a hand washing station available and plenty of nappies.
