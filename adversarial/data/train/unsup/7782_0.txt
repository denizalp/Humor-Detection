Busy McDonald's location that sits right off the freeway from 16th street. This is a smaller location inside that is renovated. Not a kids zone as they don't have a play area however still offer the same regular menu items. The drive through has double ordering windows which help move fast. The only issue with this location is majority of the time there is some kind of hiccup and the service is not up to par. Many times I have received cold food, order is wrong or they forgot something. I have dealt with this for years. The service window seems to hold employees that are trainees. I'm not sure but they tend to be not the courteous workers.
