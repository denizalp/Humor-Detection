Filipinos go to great lengths to find the next best Filipino restaurant out there, especially when the restaurant carries the name of one of the oldest chains in the Philippines, but unfortunately this Max's Restaurants fails to impress or sets out to disappoint. I ate there on 2 occasions ever since they opened, the first time was lunch, we thought that there would be a long line, but we were seated immediately, I thought great, we can make it back to work in time, wrong! We only ordered like 3 items and it took them 1 hour to bring it to hour table. We had the famous fried chicken, the skin was indeed crispy but the meat was so dry, you would probably need to double up on your soda order since they don't do refills, so Filipino mentality, tsk tsk tsk. The second time I went there it was a friends party, they had pre-ordered the food ahead of time as to avoid the hunger evoking wait, we had crispy pata, which wasn't that great, the usual chicken, pancit, kare kare, adobo that didn't look appetizing at all, over all the food was edible, at least they had a room that can accommodate large parties and give you some privacy. The service was below par, the server just left her cleaning cart in the room while we were still eating and did not really attend to our needs well, especially when you are charging\/expecting a gratuity charge for large parties. The napkins were cut in half, so typically Filipino again. I am proud to be Filipino but Filipino mentality really irks me because hey are we not in America? Overall, will I come back? Only if i am not paying for it. Have the Filipinos finally found their white whale? Sorry you will have to continue searching for the best Filipino restaurant out because Max's is definitely sub standard.
