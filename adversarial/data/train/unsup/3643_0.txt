I've been on a bit of a ramen kick since temperatures have dropped in the Valley. \n\nWas in the Tempe Marketplace area and got a craving so decided to check out Kabuki for their Tonkotsu ramen specifically. \n\nIt was good! Maybe not the most authentic, but it hit the spot. I got two nice thick pieces of chashu which were tasty and filling - good thing because the ramen doesn't come with any other toppings, unfortunately. If they added an egg to this dish, it would definitely make it feel more complete as a ramen. The broth looked nice and milky with a decent flavor, and I thought the noodles were cooked well - good amount of spring and chew.\n\nI've had sushi rolls here as well and maybe thats where Kabuki really shines but their ramen is not bad at all!
