Yet another restaurant I wish I had visited earlier but didn't because of the 3.5 star rating, which was lower than many of the other Mexican options in the area. For the purposes of this review, not coming here sooner was probably a good thing because I have the opportunity to try all of those higher rated places and this place in comparison comes out on top with a solid 5 stars. \n\nWhile this was only my first time here, I came here with a party of 10 and not one of us was not satisfied with our meals, so I would reconsider some of the poor ratings on here before writing this place off. \n\nNot only was the food inexpensive, but the portions were HUGE. In addition, the service was extremely quick. I drink a ton of water at dinners and I did not find myself empty once between their four refills. They even start you off with free nachos and salsa, which they refill before you are even finished if you would like more. Finally, on more of an aside but still related, I also liked that they give you boxes to package leftovers yourself rather than bring it to the back to do it for you, since I've read that that process can be unsanitary at times. Again, just a super nitpicky detail that I personally appreciated.
