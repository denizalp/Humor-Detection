Horrible place! Do not stay here unless you want to be over charged! The room was horrible barely any pluggins worked had to move the TV to an inconvenient in order to watch. Room did not come with a phone or any mention of one. Customer service did not address any problems. Was over charged by $100 for phone and remote even so the room did not have a phone to begin with and we had left the remote on the bed. When called manager was very rude and hung up and did refund our money even so we did not take anything. If stay here take precautions before you get accused of the same. This hotel actually deserves ZERO STARS
