About 15 years ago, this place was the local Portugese grocery store, with the odd shelf of Jello thrown in. Nowadays, it really caters to it's changing clientele. Gorgeous produce (not cheap though), an entire refrigerated section devoted to mushrooms alone (must read up on what's what in the world of fungi..), excellent game selection, inexpensive sliced meats (cheaper than Metro, Loblaws or any other grocery store - including No Frills) and inexpensive meat section. You can find things like goat's milk  here, Organic cereals etc. A good place if you only want one stop shopping (and can afford it).
