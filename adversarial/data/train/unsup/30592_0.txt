One of the best Sushi places in Gilbert. They have great rolls and semi-decent prices. I believe they got rid of their happy hour on Fridays, so that's a bummer. But they never let you down with their great sushi and always friendly service. \n\nYou can never go wrong with the Cali Roll, The Caterpillar, and my favorite...the Tootsie Roll.
