Walking around, we came across this chocolate\/candy shop.\n\nIt's super colorful in here and a fun place to visit. If you're looking for a sweet treat to bring back for loved ones, this is a nice option to have. Prices are a bit high, but you are in Vegas. Employees were friendly and helpful. The packaging of everything in here is really cute.
