Great tasting food served in a clean environment. \n\nMy friend ordered a Mushroom Poutine. It took at least 5 minutes after ordering for it to be finished. In the meantime, I was greeted by vandalised tic-tac-toe on one of their tables. At least the table was wiped clean! They called out our number on the speakerphone so we would go pick it up. Friend shared her Mushroom Poutine (which comes with a fountain drink) with me, and it tasted a-mah-zing. The mushroom cuts were bigger than I expected, but still good. The cheese curds were top notch, and the fries were well done. Fountain drinks are bottomless. \n\nWashrooms are tucked away at the back of the restaurant.
