Myxx - why do you look more like a roller rink than a restaurant?\n\nWe stopped in to the bar to grab a drink and check the space out.  Imagine this scene - a giant beautiful bar.  Three tables by the door. And a vast, open wood floor.  With no tables.  To the very right, behind some fancy white curtains - there are more tables for what appears to be a private party.  It was the craziest set-up I have seen for a \"restaurant\" in quite some time.\n\nThe bar staff were very friendly.  Our drinks were pretty expensive ($10 each) and very mediocre. There was only one other couple eating dinner at one of the weird tables by the door.  Eventually people started rolling in for the private party, but it didn't liven up the place at all since they were totally separated.\n\nI guess Myxx has realized that they are not really cutting it in the normal restaurant business and are now devoting most of their space and energy to private functions.  Which honestly may be best, but at least make the \"store front\" part of your business look appealing!
