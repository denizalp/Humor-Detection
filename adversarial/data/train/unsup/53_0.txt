The chalkboard drink specials read like a culinary romance novel to me. Cracker Jack Latte. Cheesecake Latte. Snowflake Latte. Tirimasu Mocha. I mean, comon now, I basically want shot of every single item. Woe is me. \n\nI settled on the Cracker Jack Latte and sidled up to a (chilly!) table next to the window to get some work done. The lovely latte wasn't overly sweet (as the barista promised me it wouldn't be) and the ratio of froth to steamed milk was definitely on point. My main ish with this latte was the de-freakin'-licious caramel peanut butter syrup was all at the bottom of my mug - it just wasn't mixed in. Thus, I was *forced* to scoop out said sugar surprise after I guzzled my latte. First world problems. \n\nNext time I'm in Rocky River, I'll certainly stop by Erie Island Coffee for another perusal of the specials menu!
