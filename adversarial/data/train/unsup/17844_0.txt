This is my third visit and my last. The drive through is always slow. today after 5 mins waiting I honked horn and talked to the speaker. nothing. At 8 mins tried again. Then left. As I drove by I could see 5 to 8 people inside playing around not doing their jobs. so off to Wendy's across the street. They were super fast, courteous, and we're happy to be doing their jobs. So very unlike the horrid sonic that we will never return to.
