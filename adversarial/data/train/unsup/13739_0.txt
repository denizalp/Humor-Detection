I was pretty drained after work, so I was just going to default to an old favorite. But then I drove by this place and remembered that there was something that I had to try on Mondays...\n\nI found out after walking inside that Little Crown & Anchor Pub offers the same all you can eat fish and chips for $13.95 on Mondays (5pm thru midnight) as its big brother does. Having never tried this AYCE special before, I decided to take advantage of the opportunity.\n\nThe first plate that they brought out was huge. I'm actually not sure that I would've been able to handle it fully had I been in optimal eating shape. There was a huge pile of chips, a perhaps-too-generous helping of peas, the battered fish (of course), a lemon slice, and a dipping portion of tartar sauce.\n\nI think the crispy batter was the best part of the meal, but the fish itself was slightly dry and fairly bland. Everything was on the bland side really, and no combination of condiments (salt, pepper, malt vinegar, tartar, even ketchup) truly helped the situation. The chips strongly resembled Red Robin's boring steak fries. They'll be happy to bring only fish as a continuation of your AYCE experience, but I ended up with taste buds dulled both by repetition and by some sense of feeling full. And flavor aside, I doubt that the fish filets are premium cuts given their nonchalant attitude toward providing seconds and toward wasted food.\n\nI wouldn't really bother returning to Little Crown & Anchor Pub just for the fish & chips. The service was friendly though, and the music was quite fun fun, both when it had pop and alt\/indie rock hits and when they recalibrated the playlist for an older audience.
