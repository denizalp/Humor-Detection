I'm not one to comment on public transit systems however, in this case I must share my thoughts. Mega Bus is the Worst paid form of public transportation anyone could ever take. To be clear, I've never been a passenger on Mega Bus - and never will be, but I've been the designated driver, specifically the one picking up our out of town guests. Over the course of the past 3 or so years, I've seen my guests cry (i.e. Bus driver wouldn't let them on because of the size of their luggage), lose money (i.e. Connecting bus ran over 45 minutes late, the connecting bus left and passenger was left paying for another ticket plus the fees - customer service not helpful, subpar communication skills), and for a few of my Brave guests, I've witnessed them asserting themselves with drivers who were at best acting\/reacting like bullies on a middle school playground. I have a hard time wrapping my mind around why one would pay for a service who would turn around and degrade, disrespect, and treat them as subpar citizens. I understand for many it maybe all that they are able to afford, however, if collectively we standby and say nothing this will get worst. I'm bringing to wonder if this bus line is owned by one of the presidential candidates - wink, wink...jk. Bottom line, I personally wouldn't spend my dollar on Mega Bus.
