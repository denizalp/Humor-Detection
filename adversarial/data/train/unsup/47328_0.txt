Had my surveillance system installed by DMC this year. I am extremely satisfied with the professional service I received. DMC is knowledgeable of today's market in technology and equipment needed for all your specific needs. All of my cameras are high quality and I can view them remotely on my phone 24\/7. All wires are hidden and the DVR has a cool lock box for it. I would strongly recommend this company for the equipment and installation of surveillance systems.
