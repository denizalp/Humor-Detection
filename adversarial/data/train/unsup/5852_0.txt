Can I say Oy!  We had a group of seven.  All tables are for 4.  We put two tables together.  A table of 3 came in right before us and someone was waiting for take out.  When we ordered we   were told a couple of items would take a little bit but that was OK.  So we waited and waited.   We waited and waited. 70 minutes after our order, two dinners came out.  10 minutes later 3 dinners came out.  Finally, after 90 minutes the sushi and last 2 dinners came out.  The Miso soup was served first and was not warm enough.  A couple of people called in for take out and came to pick it up and waited for long periods, one was given a bowl of Miso soup while she waited.   The food was good but the wait was over the top.  \nThe place is loud, the ventilation fan has a very high hum and made it hard to hear someone talking if you were at one end of the table and they were at the other end of the table.\nProbably should just do take out and be ready to wait.
