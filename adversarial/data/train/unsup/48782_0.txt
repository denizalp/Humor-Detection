This was my first time here. The food is good but not sure it was worth the wait after Ashely the manager was rude. So took away from the experience of coming here. The waitress we had was knowledgeable about the menu and very nice and even apologized for her mistake but didn't realize she couldn't make substitutions on the menu for simple cottage cheese. \nIt's too bad a place like this has a manager with poor customer service and people skills.
