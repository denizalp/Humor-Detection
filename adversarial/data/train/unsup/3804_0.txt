I had high hopes for Capo's Italian Cuisine.  Two stars is all I can come up with for this place.  Somethings are on me.  Like not really mapping out how far this place was from mid-strip.  We paid $27.50 + a $5.00 tip for a taxi from the Monte Carlo.  So figure you're into roughly a $65.00 round trip cab fare just to get here and back to your hotel.  That was on me.\n\nIt was 100 degrees outside in the early evening.  The secret door was kinda of fun.  We gave the password to my GF's daughter to get us in.  First impression, it's hot in here.  77 degrees inside.  The host seats us at the first booth we come to in the bar area facing the bar, a TV showing the The Shawshank Redemption, and the open kitchen.  Heat from the kitchen is coming right at us.  Not good.\n\nI got up and asked the host now sitting at the bar if we can be seated in the main dinning room which is pretty much empty.  One booth out of five is occupied.  There's a big table set in the middle for maybe a party of ten?  I don't know.\n\nThe host says-\nWell, you know here's the thing........we have a big party coming in and....we gotta lot of reservations.....and let me see what I can do....and I'm not to sure.....and let me check on something.....and so on and so on. \n\nMy inner monolog is saying to me-\nThis guy wants me to break out some cash for a better table in this empty hot and stuffy restaurant.  Are you fucking kidding me guy?  I just shelled out over $30.00 bucks just to get here!  Really?  I'll stand my ground.\n\nThe host continues-\nYeah, you know we got this big party coming in and we are really busy and, and, and.........Okay, okay, okay, I'll get a booth setup for you.  \n\nFor the record, only one other couple came in while we were there and the big table got broken down and put away half way through our dinner cause no one ever showed up.  Now, I have no real proof he was shaking me down, but I think he was.  Not cool.  \n\nWe got the temp down to 72 degrees and things were looking up.  Martini time.  I had two and they were good.  Our waitress was very nice to us.  Oh yeah, as others have mentioned it's pitch black in here.  99 Cent store mini flashlights that weren't working very well are attached to the menus.  It was a struggle reading the menu.\n\nFood-\n\nFried Calamari-\nNot bad.  No tentacles.  Boo.\n\nMe-\nSalad- Over dressed and limp.  \nVeal Parmesan-  Surprisingly good.  I always give credit when due.\nPasta- Under cooked.\n\nQueen of Reseda's Daughter-\nSoup- Bland.\nRacketeers Ravioli- She liked it.\n\nQueen of Reseda-\nSoup- Bland.\nVeal Marsala- Chewy, she did not like.\nPasta- Under cooked.\n\nEntertainment-\nThe live Frank Sinatra type singer was cool at first.  The Queen of Reseda's daughter was the only single looking female in the place as far as I could see.  \nHe serenaded her once, she liked it.  \"Return to me.  Please come back bella mia\"\nHe serenaded her twice, okay fine.  Move on Broheim. \nHe serenaded her a third time and it started to get really old, really fast.  \nWe laughed about it later, but it was borderline uncomfortable for a while there.\n\nAfter dinner we asked if they would call us a cab.  They have there own driver which they offered to take us back to our hotel.  It was a flat $25.00 plus I gave him a $5.00 tip.  We took them up on their offer, the driver was very nice and got us home safe. \n\nIMO these guys have figured out how to stack the deck with the Yelp reviews.  Soon after I posted this review, four new five star reviews mushroom up pushing this one down.  Take notice how most of these reviews are pretty short and sweet by people with not a lot of friends.  \n\nSome guy wrote how it was packed on a Monday night?  BS.  We were there on a Sunday night and it was dead.  I wish I would have checked out the 166 other reviews that are not currently recommended before coming here.  166!  Check them out for some very interesting reading.  \n\nI regret coming here.  I felt like I wasted a dinner in Vegas.  You'd be better off at Casa di Amore.  We had a great time earlier this year.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/casa-di-amore-las-vegas
