Since I work in the mall there are only a few places we usually go for lunch and this is a place my coworkers frequent, I do not.\n\nThe food is ok, mediocre burgers and fries but my major problem with this location is the service. They continuously mess up orders and substitutions.\n\n My other problem is that they seem to ignore their customers. You call ahead they don't pick up, you are standing right in front of the hostess' stand and the person just ignores you. Wouldn't you think they would want to try and help you out right away? I guess not. \n\nSince this is the first official review for this location I will share a review meant for this location posted on a different JR:\n       \"Here's a suggestion, if your restaurant is dead and there's        someone waiting to place a to go order, how about u tell the staff to tend to them instead of performing their unenthused dance routine for nobody.  Poor prioritizing!!\".\n\nCare about your customers and you will have them keep coming back for more, don't ignore
