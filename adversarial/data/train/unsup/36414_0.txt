Finally, after 18 years in this food desert-an Asian restaurant that is like being back in San Francisco! Pad tai with shrimp that almost made me cry-chow fun that was REAL chow fun! Not someplace that thinks big noodles is enough-my only wish is BBQ pork like they have in the windows in SF. I know you have limitations serving in a place like Arizona but now I have a dream and hope! Thank you Tottie's-I will be back! BTW-this was a Grubhub delivery order so I did not actually go in the place-doesn't matter-they could be serving out of a trunk and I would still place my order!
