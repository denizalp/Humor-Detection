I really like the planet fitness franchise. This gym just opened in April 2018. It still has that new car smell! The staff is friendly and so are the other gym peeps. It is brightly lit and has its own parking area away from the other stores. But... it is tiny. I have been to 5 locations and this one is the smallest I have been to. I would say little is ok but they are missing the stair climber. NO STAIR CLIMBER!! How is my friend Timmy supposed to get his swerve on?!? If this stair climber issue is rectified I will consider a 5 Star review.
