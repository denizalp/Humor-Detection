Look I am willing to pay for a quality brunch but this is ridiculous. The fish was not caviar it was canned tuna. The peas meh, the bread very meh. and they charge like it is a king's feast.\nBUT you do get a small swan figure in there and a few knickknacks on the wall.\nIf you like food experimentation and high prices then check it out. If you want value or comforting taste then try somewhere else. Either way, definitely skip their so-called hummus. It tasted fishy. I mean it tasted of fish.
