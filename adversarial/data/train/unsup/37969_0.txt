My best friend and I went here for winterlicious 2017 and I must say we were blown away by the ambience and service alone.. yes, its a fancy restaurant but the service was on par with the ambience. our server took excellent care of us and the food we ordered all came in on time one after the other so there was no long wait time.. we started off with complimentary feta bread that came with fig which we enjoyed...we really liked the scallops appetizer.. my friend got the lettuce salad (not too impressed with that) .. we both got the Icelandic cod for our mains.. the fish was a bit salty and the beans were kind of hard (this is the only part of the meal where I thought it could've been done better).. the desert.. omg the desert alone was amazing! I ordered the sampler which came with an apple rosette tart, sour cream ice cream on a cookie, praline mouse and snap cookie, and oreo cheesecake - ALL AMAZING! my friend ordered the maple cr√®me brulee - also AMAZING! overall, I highly recommend this place!
