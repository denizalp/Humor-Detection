This hotel is beautiful, and the staff are really friendly and attentive. The only issue I had with this place was with the nightly security guards. We stayed for one night with our kids and as we were getting back to our room around 11 after running down to grab food for them we noticed an older gentleman sitting right outside of our door, he was a security guard. I didn't think anything of it at first, he was older and most likely tired from walking the halls of such a large place, but an hour later when I looked out of our door he was still there. I'm sure the kids were making some noise but not at a disruptive level. In the end he never knocked on our door to complain, he just sat there STARING at our door and scared the daylights out of my children. Sitting outside of people's doors for an hour and a half to try and intimidate them isn't the way to get people to quiet down, it's the way to get a terrible review. Needless to say.. We won't be staying again.
