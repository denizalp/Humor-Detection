For the first timers- walk past the taco stand outside and into the market, pay for the food, make your way back outside, hand over your receipt, pick your meat, then prepare yourself to devour into your taco(s)!\n\nYou get a massive taco for $2.50! I was like \"shoot, I refuse to ever pay less than $5 bucks at a taco spot\" so I got 3 tacos. I think I would have done just fine with just one. \n\nThe tortillas that they use here are bigger than the usual palm-sized ones you find in other taco spots. And boy do they make sure to fill the sucker up! I had a hard time choosing which meat I wanted. Unfortunately for me, I didn't get our meat cooked upon request so I chose based on which looked the freshest. I got the carne asada, al pastor, and the fajita mix. Carne asada tasted a bit bland for me. Thankfully I got a little too happy at the toppings bar (as I always do) so the sauce covered it up. The al pastor was delicious! When you have grease running down your fingers, you know that's a tasty al pastor! The fajita mix was better than I thought it would taste. The onion & peppers definitely brought out a special charm in that taco. \n\nI'm a slow eater; so with the size of the taco and massive toppings\/sauce on it, it gets soggy fast. Have a fork handy in case your tortilla rips like mine. Also there is no place to eat your taco there. You gotta either find yourself a spot on the curb or prepare to use your car trunk. Las Palmas is smart. They get free promotion\/advertisement with people standing around eating their tacos throughout the street. I had 3 random people come up to me and ask what I was eating.
