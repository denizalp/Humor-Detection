Went to Evoke for the first time today and I had a great experience with Julie!\n\nMy appointment started right on time, which is nice since the last place I went to regularly ran 15-20 minutes behind schedule. \n\nSince I arrived 10 min early, I had enough time to have a coffee, which was a bonus. \n\nJulie did a great job with my hair. She cleaned up an old cut that was partially grown out and helped me clarify what I was trying explain that I wanted. \n\nThey also gave me a personalized welcome bag with samples when I paid. A nice touch!
