I am born and raised in Las Vegas and this is hands down by far the best nail salon. A gel manicure can easy last a month or longer. My daughter and I can go in and not even have to decide on a color and leave with perfect glam nails that will last us over a month of playing, cleaning, cooking,extreme sports and grooming and showing dogs‼‼‼‼
