The Shameful Tiki Room was a fun, Instagram-worthy place to go for a novelty experience, but not somewhere I'd become a regular. The volcano set to go off every now and then, and the gong and yelling that coincided with certain drink orders was entertaining, but I could see how it might get annoying after a while! \n\nI really enjoyed the cocktails, especially the mystery bowl which was served in a big seashell, with two limes set on fire inside, and two giant straws. At $23 for a recommended two people, it was a deal compared to the prices of their other drinks.
