With many bubble tea shops in this plaza, Feng Cha is definitely a hidden gem. \n\nThe decor and atmosphere is definitely catered to taking IG worthy pictures - there's a flower wall, as well as a huge teddy bear. The store is pretty spacious with a couple tables to sit down and enjoy your drinks.\n\nAs for the drinks, we ordered the 'House Special Fruit Mix Tea' and 'Oreo Cheese Milk Tea,' which were around $6.99+ each. We customized the ice and sugar levels, and both were not too sweet, which was perfect. \n\nThe 'oreo cheese milk tea' had a nice balance between sweet and salty, and we could definitely taste both the oreo and cheese foam. The fruit tea was our favourite, as it was extremely refreshing. The drink is super big, and is definitely worth the price as it includes real fruit slices and does not taste artificial at all. The fruit is a great addition into the tea, and enhances the flavour of the tea.\n\nThey have other creative and unique drinks, so we will definitely go back to try more! Great bubble tea shop to check out in this plaza!\n\nIG: Follow @hungry_wongs for more!
