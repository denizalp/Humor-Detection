They catered my wedding on 4\/30\/2016. If I had to do it all again, I would definitely have them cater it again. I had 65 guests and every single one complimented me on the pizza (and salad)\n\nWe got the Petite Package with the Tennessee Pig and Gorgonzola Filet. Caramelized Walnut, Cranberry, with Gorgonzola and Champagne Dressing Salad and Italian Salad. \n\nI wish I would have ordered more of the CWCGCD Salad, even the squares liked it ;) and I wish I would have been able to take flatbread to go.\n\nThe venue owner fudged and didn't reserve a spot out front for the truck but Kim and the crew took it in stride, they parked on the side of the building and made it work. They even dealt with the rain! \n\nThanks for being apart of our memories!
