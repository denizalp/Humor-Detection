Update, will change this review to hopefully every restaurants expectations and standards as well as my own as soon as I return to this dining establishment. Due to the prompt, professional mangement operatio, by reaching out, and apologizing, I will return and re-assess after my near future experience that hopefully brings upon happy expected and anticipated endeavours.\n:)\n\n\n\nWhat could have been a solid four to five star review tonight, 11\/11\/17 was immediately destroyed the moment the hostess was leading us to our table. On our way being seated another employee...shorter Mexican lady with her hair pulled tighy in a bun had to look at us and say very loudly, very rudely and very uncalled for \"don't you know we close at nine?\" . If it was nine or even8:45 I could understand. It was 8:10pm and it was just the two of us. I had never been to Steak and Stone and was super excited...when she said that I was so offended and disgusted that I looked at her and said \"really?\" And she then paused en route with her giant empty cart, stared me down for a very uncomfortable amount of time, said \"yeah, we are closing\" then preceded to talk rudely about me and to me. Completely uncalled for and seriously, I NEVER write reviews based on service but this was so out of line with her glares and trash talk that continued I feel this must be addressed. I mentioned the disrespectful matter to the hostess but apparently no management was in sight or on duty. Poor, horrible and completely unacceptable. As this could have so simply been a great experience...the horrible, sour bitter \"welcome\" ruined the entire meal, moment, and experience as she continued her harassment throughout our unfortunate horrible dining experience. Complete waste of $70.00.\n\nP.s...my molcajete bowl was five shrimps and a ton of onion...such a bummer.
