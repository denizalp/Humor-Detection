We came here last year for winter break and since then we were dying to come back! Every crawfish place \"didn't compare to the one in Vegas\". Their fish is so fresh and the flavor\/seasoning was flawless. The coconuts were so fresh and juicy. The fried alligator tasted like a soft and less chewy version of calamari. Aside from the great food we had an amazing waiter named billy. He offered great suggestions like the baked oyster and he was so funny. He had great dance moves and taste in music lol. He was funny and made sure we had a great time. He also was great at his job and made this amazing experience perfect.
