Re: Grooming Salon. Specifically, Katie, the cat handler.\n\nIt is near to impossible to find cat groomers in this town. Some vets offer the service but after today's visit to Petsmart I won't go anywhere else. So the deal is I have a demon cat. Well, she's lovely and adorable with me, but for some reason fears all pet workers. No clue why, nothing bad has ever happened to her. \n\nKatie works Tuesday through Friday and starts at 7am, which I can appreciate because no one else should have to witness the dramatics my cat puts on. I arrived after calling ahead to see if Katie could shave Josie's haunches, so as to avoid bits clinging to her backside (gross.)  Katie got an E-collar on Josie and told me she was going to have to scruff her while she worked, which was just fine with me because the cat was screaming like a murder victim and otherwise being embarrassing. In less than ten minutes the job was done (for only $6!) and Josie was back in her carrier like nothing happened. \n\nLook, I had a veterinarian tell me that if I brought Josie in for any grooming they would SEDATE her, and she also recommended I get her declawed, which I believe is inhumane. Maybe Katie considers what she does completely normal and reasonable, but she's the first professional who has worked with Josie...professionally. \n\nI know my cat is a total freak but I can't shave her ass myself, so thank god Katie is at Petsmart. Seriously.
