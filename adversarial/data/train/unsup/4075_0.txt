My first experience was weird...it was 4 in the morning, my daughter needed some milk...this place was the closest to home. When I walked in i said good morning to the cashier, she didn't say anything back, when i looked at her, I literally had the feeling she was waiting for me to ask her to empty out the register and she was ready to defend herself. OK. Sometimes I get that, I get it. I went to get the few things i needed and went to cash out. Still nothing. One of her regulars came in and her tone completely changed, the most chipper \"Top of the morning!\" greeting ever...when it came to me the cold should re-applied. The tattoo'd woman with glasses didn't even tell me to have a nice day. Everything else is great! The best brushLESS car wash ever.
