Another trendy Scottsdale Quarter hang out spot. Connected to IPIC and Tanzy - this place has a really nice bar and cool decor. \nI went here for a Tequila Flight - and was amazed by how much the staff knew about these lovely little beverages. \nLike most places in trendy Scottsdale - everyone looks alike - almost walking clones. Clearly they give out free BMW's and Boobs.
