This place is awesome! This legendary place has been around since 1970! A real old school family business! Just look at the pictures on the walls of all the celebrities that have been there over the decades. I can't believe I never knew about this place the whole time I lived in Vegas. But I'm glad I finally tried it, it's so great. I love the old school set menu of entree, garlic bread, soup or salad, pasta, and wine. And not just a glass of wine, a carafe! Great Italian food and right off the heart of the Las Vegas strip. You got to try this legendary place.
