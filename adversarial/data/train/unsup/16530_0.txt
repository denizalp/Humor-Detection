The taro milk tea never lets me down. You can taste the real taro bits that they use. And the boba itself is a great consistency, never over or under-cooked and just the right level of sweet. \n\nLike most boba places, you can adjust your ice and sugar levels. And if you decide you don't like your drink, they'll offer to make you a new one. \n\nBrew Tea has always stayed consistent with their service and their drinks that's why they are getting my 5 stars. You will not be disappointed :)
