I can't say I've experienced better but I can't give it an A-OK. \nMy dad had a partial knee replacement and wasn't ready to go home from the hosiptal so my mom and I chose this place. The rehab part of it was fine. The staff were freindly but often left him on the side of the bed and no way to call the nurse. The food was terrible. They would say there was soup before dinner every night but only brought it once.  It seemed a bit disorganized- new people didn't know what to do and had to ask a million questions.The billing was the worst part. :Luckily my mom kept track of everything that they were supposed to pay and every time she got an incorrect bill she would have to call. This happened twice so the third time she went up there in person to speak to them and hopefully got it all resolved.
