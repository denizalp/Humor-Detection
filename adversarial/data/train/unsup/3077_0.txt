CRUST THE GOOD LORD.\n\nI have to write more so it actually counts as a review, this friggin' pizza is soooo on point! I could honestly just eat an entire pizza's worth of the crust alone, but then they go on and put that sweet Italian magic all over it, hooooo boy.\n\nJust go here. Staff is friendly, service is fast, pizza is bangin.
