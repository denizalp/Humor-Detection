I thought this place is more like whole sale priced fish store.\n\nBut I was wrong..or maybe they changed their concept..\n\nEverything was expensive considering portion and quality.\n\nYou can get same or better quality product  cheaper at Gallaria supermarket or H mart as well.\n\nI think gallaria market's seafood part has more good variety and quality of fish for cheaper price.\n\nEverything was way too pricey than I expected and pre made sushi was really poor decorated.\n\nThey also have menu for made to order as well but 8pcs sushi and 6 pcs roll was 25+tax which is not worth the cost and wait.\n\nThere is no where to eat also it doesnt come with miso soup or salad ..\n\nJust going to high-end sushi restaurant seems to be better option for me.\n\nAnyways It was different what I heard about this place a few yeas ago.\n\nI think they changed their store concept for pricey way.
