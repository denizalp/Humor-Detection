I was able to get a very good price. However, on the day of picking up the car I notice the seats, especially the driver's seat, show obvious signs of tear & wear. My feeling is that it was a showroom car, especially on that day I don't see the showroom car, which was the same colour and trim of my car, is no longer in the shower room. I was suspicious and raised to the sales manager, and later the General Manager came out too. They all look puzzled but of course didn't admit anything to it. The seat wear is obvious that it has been sat on many times. If it's a true brand new car it won't show that. My previous older Acura cars showed it, but that's not something I would expect from a brand new car. Another sign was that the car did not really have new car smell that you usually get. I demand for a true brand new car but the General Manager just offered me a refund. I refused and later I was offered only the seat protection to be applied. They insisted it's a new car. I had a trade-in and the paperwork was done already and I took the car anyway just because of the price. Otherwise, this dealership has really disappointed me. It's my 2nd time buying there but this bait & switch is totally unacceptable.
