I want to say this is the best club ever,  but omg, this club is so overrated!!!\n\nI was really excited to finally experience the XS hype, only to find out that the club does not live up to its hype.  Waiting in line already made me not like this place.  Our friends were a few parties ahead of us and yea it sucks that people cut to meet up with their friends, but whatever it happens and you do it, I do it and yep, that's what we were doing.  And then, a bouncer stopped us saying \"you have to wait like everyone else.\"  okay, fine, we have to wait.  AND THEN, this bitch ass bouncer lets people cut for the party in front of us.....??????  thanks...for that?  later on that night i found out that one of my friends was not let in because the bouncer didn't believe her id was her.  it wasn't a fake id and the reason why they wouldnt let her in was because she said the wrong weight as written on the id.  ARE YOU SERIOUS?? its freaking vegas, she's with a bunch of girls and who really says their correct weight on their id??  and what bouncer really looks at the id anyways.  ugh i hated the bouncers there, thought they were so tough cuz they were working for the it spot in vegas.\n\nthe music sucked!!!!!!  for being one of the most popular clubs in vegas, i thought they would have played more hip hop, less house\/trance.  it was like weird remixes if they did play hip hop, so no thanks!\n\nokay ill give credit to how big this place is.  it was nice that it had a spacious outdoors and how they had gambling tables within the club.  i liked how it had a lot of seating area as well.  everyone kept on saying, it was the nicest pace, but honestly i think its only the nicest because its one of the newest clubs....give it like another year....
