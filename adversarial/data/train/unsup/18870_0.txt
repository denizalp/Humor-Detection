I decided to come here because I'm on Queen West often and I noticed a new restaurant. I walk in and see that it's very upscale for the area, doesn't really fit. A friend and I sat anyway. We were seated near the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen. The service was okay, although I hated the uniform...a skin tight short black dress (but that's besides the point). I ordered the quail and my friend ordered the burger. The food was also okay, my quail was a little soggy and too chewy for my liking but my friend really enjoyed the burger. My problem wasn't the service, the dress or the food, my problem was that I could hear the chef, presumably, yelling in the kitchen during my meal. It made us feel really uncomfortable to say the least.  At one point I heard screaming coming from the kitchen...I don't know if anyone else could hear at the front of the restaurant but we could definitely hear it in the back. It is definitely a hostile working environment for the kitchen workers if that's what they deal with everyday. I could even see a couple servers making weird looks at each other. The manager should really do something about this.
