I am placed up here for work and it was awesome that they admitted this place was nothing fancy. I understand the need to save money but this place is out of my standards as hotels are concerned. Next time I will pick another extended stay.\n\nAt the very least, this is as simplistic of a hotel that you can get. It is an extended stay so the only difference is the fact that there is a small kitchen in your room and rates are for long stays. \n\nI walked in the room and was so disappointed. Basically if you are low on $ or do not want to spend a whole lot to stay some where for longer periods of time or do not mind places that are poorly furnished and dull, this is your spot. It is very simple. There are no bells and whistles so to speak.  \n\nCustomer Service:\n-Everyone seemed happy to answer questions and help. Which is great! They did have REALLY good services... but service isn't everything with hotels!\n\nMain Decor\/Items:\n- Pretty simple, little to no decorations. \n- Carpets appear to be in good shape.\n- They allow pets. Nice if you needed to travel with one.\n- Nothing fancy here at all. Very minimal to say the least. They have a laundry room with a few washers and driers. In here they also have a few vending machines.\n\n\nInside The Room:\n-The beds are or seem older and not that soft.  \n-Old small TV. Like 15inches, like something you'd put in a child's room. However they do have showtime and about 20 some odd channels.\n-One small recliner.\n-Two chairs and a make shift dining table\/desk. \n-Iron Board\/Iron - the board's cover in my room was stretched out and would not stay on the board. Making simple ironing a longer task and painful.\n-No Closet! Just a closet organizer installed into a corner with no doors or anything. Oh and 4 hangers... *rolls eyes*\n-Large dresser which could hold a lot of cloths. But I opted not to use it.....\n-Overall it is old and cheesy looking in the rooms. Very much plain and straight forward, again nothing remotely fancy at all. very minimal. \n\n\nKitchen:\n-Simple kitchen with small stove (two electric burners), Microwave, Sink, and a refrigerator.\n-They stock you with two plates, two cups, two bowls, a set of silverware, and a can opener. \n-They provide a pot and pan, strainer, and a few other simple items.\n-There is also a cutting board (small), one dish rag, one towel.\n-Coffee Machine but I found that mine had mold in it. (I always check those little brewers for this!)\n\nBathroom:\nSimple and plain. Nothing to write about... except the issues I had with hot water. Getting a nice steamy hot shower was pretty hard to do. Seemed like I would have to turn and hold faucet all the way up to hot to even get the good hot water. Otherwise I'd have some what of a luke warm shower which just sucked.\n\nInfrastructure: *GEEK MODE*\nWireless Internet is $4.99 a month. Cheap but once you are on it you notice why it is that cheap. It's pretty damn slow because the main IP is in South Carolina. How slow is slow? Well you can barely watch a 1min youtube video without it buffering 4-5 times. Its sad\n\nThey only offer Wireless, there is no wired connection. \n\nHouse Keeping Service:\nThey offer a service at a  charge and charge based on a daily or weekly visit from the maid. Not sure how much it is but its good to know. You still can technically go and get new towels and linens. \n\nThis is just not a place to my standards and its way below what I would call acceptable for any extended stay. It is sad too, the staff seems very friendly and helpful but I would recommend passing and trying another hotel.\n\nThis one is simply cheap, looks cheap, feels cheap, and is cheap. If you need to save $ this maybe for you. If you want to have a comfy stay, walk far away as this is NOT the place to stay!
