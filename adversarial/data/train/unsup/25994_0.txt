I'm not sure who the people are who got terrible service but it seems to have been years ago. I went in recently to buy my husband a sports coat and got amazing service. I am totally clueless when it comes to menswear and was helped by John Marino. He explained the sizing and different types of jackets and took his time. When I went to pay, he offered me the special sale on sport coats that wasn't going to start until the next day. That was something he did not have to do, and he saved me a lot of money! My husband was extremely happy with not only his coats but the savings. We were very happy and I would highly recommend this store and their services to anyone. We will be back!
