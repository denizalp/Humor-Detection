We were meeting up \"pinoy\" friends for dinner at 6pm last night. Me and wifey got there at 6... Our friends are following \"filipino\" time so they got there around 640pm lol. It was nice that they gave us a big table with the party not being complete. \n\nFood is awesome!!! We all loved the yari ika squid. Sauce is soooo good! The chicken wings and the squid ink fried rice were a hit too! \n\nService is great too!!! Shout out to Jeff! We got free sake shots because some of the items that we wanted to order were not available that time. \n\n5 stars!!!
