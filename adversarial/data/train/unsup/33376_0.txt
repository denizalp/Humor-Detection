I've eaten here a few times because there seems to be a lack of healthy food choices in the 'hood.\nMy first meal was one of the \"healthy choice\" salads. The chicken on it was really bland, and really, the whole thing was a little bland. And I can't believe I paid $10 for a lunch salad.\n\nThe second time I went, I had a rice bowl, which was pretty good. Sorry, I can't remember the names of either items.\nAgain, it was a little pricey.\n\nI'm sure I'll go back though, since there are some days I just can't get my self organized enough to make my lunch!
