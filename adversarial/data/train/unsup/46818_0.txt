Expensive Yes! But worth it. The food was delicious, and plentiful. The service was just right, the waiter seemed to know exactly when to come over and when to stay away. The parking is difficult to find, but |I can understand their choice of location since this is a chain that for the most part caters to wealthy travellers. Dinner for the two of us with tip ran $280. We'll save this place for special occasions.
