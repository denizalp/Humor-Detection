I brought my car here yesterday and when I got inside nobody was there but someone saw me and told me he'll be right with me just a moment, but it didn't take that long, he came out and he was very friendly and asked me how can he help me, so I told him what the problem was, that my car was making noise (like a can) when I drive it so he took down all my informations and started checking on my car right away, Mark (who's the store manager) was very helpful and informative and informed me everything that was going on, him and the rest of the crew were very courteous and friendly. And after not so long of waiting they found out that there was a nail on one of my tires and fixed it right away and the noise that my car was making was from a rock inside. I don't know how that got in there, lol. And took care of it for me too. I know it wasn't a major car problem but the experience was absolutely wonderful, I'll definitely bring my car there for now if I need it fixed for any reason. Thank you guys, you were a big help.
