The pineapple pancakes were fluffy and the bacon was crisp. Early (early early - like when they first open) morning wait time was only 15 mins and had food ordered and out to us in 20 mins. We have tried other times and have been told an 1hr and 45min wait time. Yikes! I've had the fried green tomatoes (to-go) and they were absolutely phenomenal. I was super impressed with them. I highly suggest trying the togo window if you are looking for fast service. Otherwise, plan on having a wait.
