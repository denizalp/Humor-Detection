Abruzzo Pizza has been around for as long as I remember\n\na popular choice in the area. I see the delivery car around town all the time. \n\nmy review is based on the panzorotto\/panzorotti\/calzone, if you don't what it is. it's a probably the best food invention of the 19th century\n\nit's essentially a stuffed pizza pocket folded in half stuffed with mozzarella cheese and ingredients you'd top a pizza. it's and fried or baked. ( fried tastes a lot better btw) \n\nit's a meal you'd eat with a fork and knife. the Abruzzo tomato sauce is exceptional and is made from crushed field tomatoes. I'd recommend having it on the side for dipping.  one of the best panzos i've had.
