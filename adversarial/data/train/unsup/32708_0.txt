To juice or not to juice, that is the question. \n\nLet me start this review with the fact that I've been trying to get to this location for over two weeks. Why the obsession out ask? I had the opportunity to visit one in Colorado in February 2018. I was an instant fan. The fresh fruit, great customer service and such a clean environment. \n\nWe eat with our eyes first. Now, having said that, I was expecting the same or better experience in my town of Phoenix. The bar was raised in Colorado...and then lowered at this location. \n\nUpon entering the location, I was still excited by the anticipation of replicating my Colorado experience, but good grief Charlie Brown, this place was such a disappointment. The best thing I experienced was the awesome customer service given when I called to verify their location because my gos was clearly distracted by something because it had me going in circles. I wish I could recall her name. I called around 2:54 pm. Anywho, back to the review.\n\nThe decor gave a Huntington Beach  vibe. The oversized stretch canvas wall art was positive with being preachy (is that a word?)lol\n\nThe location was bright with minimalist decor. There were only 3 young ladies inside enjoying their healthy Nekter delights. So, I didn't think it would take as long as it did. I'm still waiting for my wig to be blown back, by great customer service, or clean tables and prep area...NOPE not here. \n\nPros:\nFresh ingredients \nAgave nectar \nReusable paper bags with handle to take your items home.\nGreat colored spoons and straws\nSelf serve cooler\nA rewards program (that no employee here nor Colorado advised me of. I only knew of it reading other reviews.\n\nCons:\nUninviting, but not mean employees.\nDirty eating areas inside and out.\nMinimally stocked self serve cooler.\nDirty prep area ( a friend came with because of my recommendation based on my Colorado experience).\nOrder taker\/cashier wasn't very helpful with suggestions as Stevie Wonder could see my friend was clearly undecided.\nThe Strawberries weren't sweet and crunches like an apple  \n\nMy friend didn't like her bowl and went back to advise of such and the guy asked \"do you want me to just scrape off the toppings?\" Seriously? And the bowl cost more. So, I was actually due a refund for the difference. \n\nMarketing needs improvement ( I had a yelp coupon, for checking in, for a FREE ginger shot. The cashier wasn't familiar with it but honored it as they did on Colorado. I have a feeling this coupon was the idea of someone in corporate.)\n\nThe self serve cooler wasn't fully stocked.\n\nOverall, I would come back to give this location another opportunity to knock my socks off. I wasn't completely in love  with this location, but based on the location and the demographics, this location will need to step up their game.
