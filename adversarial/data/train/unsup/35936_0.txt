Have read reviews. Including some of the negative\n ones. I\/we have been going there regularly ,ever since it opened.  We have never had any issues with ,bugs. Hairs etc.  In fact the owner seems to be  concerned about quality and actively solicits the customers input.\nWe have eaten at many other Vietnam style resturants, S.K is in the top tier.
