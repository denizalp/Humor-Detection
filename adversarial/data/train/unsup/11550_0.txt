This used to be the Imperial Palace, the biggest rat trap on the strip. Not much has changed other than the paint on the walls. The shoddy floorplan, 1960s elevators, ridiculous parking structure, ghetto clientele, and crap rooms are still here but thanks to the new name you're paying three times as much as last year.\n\nIf you're looking to stay on the strip stay anywhere but here. Yes even Circus Circus! This place was bought by the folks at Caesar's Palace and they've done nothing to help it. Total waste of money!!
