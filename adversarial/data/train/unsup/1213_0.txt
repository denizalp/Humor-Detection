This is the type of field that got me hooked on paintball to begin with. \n\nThe layout format is more geared towards woodsball \/ scenario, rather than speedball \/ x-ball. \n\nFor beginners, and those that desire more strategic play, this layout is the best way to go paintballing.\n\nIn this method, you don't have players laying down cover fire at the rate of 20+ paintballs per second, that are flying at you at over 200 feet per second from all directions. Getting splattered by these puppies will definitely send you home with welts on your back, front, and neck. \n\nUggghhh...I used to hate coming to work with a huge welt on my neck! (You get the picture).\n\nThe people are were very nice, and friendly. Both the staff and the players were very accommodating. The only downside that I saw was that everyone knew each other, and I felt like the odd man out. But, once I got to know some people (I am not shy), it was great to get some playing time in, even with a bunch of strangers.\n\nThe place is a little bit hard to find, and it is a paved road up until you pull into the parking. At that point, it turned into crushed gravel. Not a big deal, but just a little dusty for those that are more familiar with the parking lots of the indoor paintball facilities.\n\nIt is outdoors, and is probably not the most comfortable setting during the summer. It was 80+ degrees in the middle of the afternoon when I was playing, and it wasn't bad at all. The field is huge, and there are lots of places to hide.\n\nThe place is well managed, and is very inviting for the beginner and advanced player alike.\n\nI absolutely loved this place! And if you want to try things out, they also have a free 1 game rental of paintball equipment (marker \/ hopper \/ safety gear). \n\nI would recommend wearing jeans or work pants, and long sleeve shirts. And you will do just fine. Don't be intimidated by the people wearing desert camo or paintball pants and jerseys. Some of us are just dedicated to the sport, and have spent a lot of money on the gear and apparel.\n\nHowever, once your adrenalin gets going, you'll barely notice getting pelted. \n\nOne thing that you will notice is that you're having a whale of a good time!
