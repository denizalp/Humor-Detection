Came across this cute little coffee shop early Saturday morning.  I was so impressed when I walked in.  Very warm and inviting inside with a hip, urban design.  I only bought a banana and americano (which was fab!) but I can't wait to go back and try their food items.  They serve also serve Nutella infused Hot Chocolate. Wow! Definitely going to try that next time.
