I love Dr. Tounian! He and his staff are so sweet and knowledgable. \n\nI went in earlier this week for a teeth cleaning. Xrays were also taken because I wanted to discuss the possibility of veneers (I have Invisalign but I'm super lazy with it...I know, bad.) The hygienists were very careful with me and the xrays and cleaning went so easily.\n\nAs a first time patient I had an exceptional experience and I am so glad to have finally found a reliable, clean and professional dental office here in Vegas.
