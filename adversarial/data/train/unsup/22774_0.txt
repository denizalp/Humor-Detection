I don't normally shop at this Salvation Army location, but I was in the area and it was a Wednesday which means amost everything is half off, so I figured I'd stop in. Upon entering the store I was greeted by 2 employees screaming and cursing at each other. From what I was able to gather, they were having a disagrement about the Real Housewives of Atlanta, which then turned into an attack on each other's character. One girl was on community service and the other made sure that everyone in the store was aware of this fact because she screamed about it multiple times. Lots of cursing, threatening and general batshit craziness went on for roughly 5 minutes before a manager got involved. Manager kept yelling at them to \"take it to the back.\" Eventually they did, but it didn't make a difference because \"the back,\" was in the same room, but was sectioned off by some shelves of mugs and rolling rack. The fighting continued for the entire duration of my shopping trip, which was about 35 minutes- 20 of which was spent in line waiting for one girl to get a key to void a transaction on the register. The clothing prices were pretty crazy. $13.99 for a vintage dress? $9.99 for a Walmart dress? (I know it's from Walmart because my friend had the same dress and I was with her when she purchased it on clearance for $7.99.) $19.99 for a newish Lane Bryant sweater? That is insanity! The plates, vases, mugs, etc. were priced reasonably, but the kitchen electrics were also pretty overpriced. All in all, I can say this is probably the worst Salvation Army that I've visited in quite some time.
