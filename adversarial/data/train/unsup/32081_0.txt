My fiance took me here for my birthday last month.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the servers are all dressed in black shirts with red ties and the ambiance of the restaurant is darker and has a flavor of the 1930s Bonnie and Clyde gangsters.  I'd recommend going here for that alone.\n\nThe food was very delicious.  I rarely order steaks, but ordered one here topped with crumbled blue cheese and a side of wedding soup.  The steak was cooked perfectly and seemed to melt in my mouth.  Soup was decent as well.  My fiance ordered a salad and thoroughly enjoyed her meal as well.  She ended up purchasing me a bourbon and honey based cocktail.  It really hit the spot being a hard liquor drink but having a sweet side to it.\n\nOverall really enjoyed my experience here.  It's a little pricier than what I typically try to spend on a meal but the food and the atmosphere make it worth it.  Definitely a place to consider when wanting to go out somewhere nice for lunch or dinner.
