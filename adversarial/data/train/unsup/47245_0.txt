I scheduled online on a Wednesday for duct service cleaning for Friday. I received an email stating it was confirmed and the email stated they would try to work with my scheduling needs. I did not receive any sort of confirmation call to confirm or advise of the time window. I called on a Thursday and the rep told me they called me but I did not receive a message. The rep advised my window would be between 2:30-5:30 and I would be called 30 mins prior to the technician arriving. Around 5 on Friday I called to see if they were on their way. The rep answered and said he would call the technician.After 30 mins he called me back and said he had just gotten in touch with him and they were still on the job. He said I could either reschedule with 10 percent off or wait for them to come. I decided to reschedule for the following day, and he said he could fit me in as priority. I assumed priority meant first. The next day rolls around, no call. I call about 3 and the rep stated my window was between 2:30-5:30. Lovely... 5:30 rolls around and again no call so I call them and once again she couldn't get a hold of the tech and says \"I assume it because he's busy.\" I told her to just cancel the service and she says \"yah I apologize.\" Thanks for your apology but I still have two wasted days of waiting around for a tech and dirty ducts. I typically go with Sears for carpet cleaning, that was for next week, but no thanks.
