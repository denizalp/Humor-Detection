Chapters is a national bookstore chain that has some similarities with Barnes and Noble.  It also has hints of the the old Canadian bookstore chain Indigo which Chapters bought out a few years ago.\n\nThis particular Chapters is near the Sunridge Mall and is close to the Calgary Airport.  When I'm in town, I usually end up stopping just after I get to town or just before I'm about to leave.  It's a great place to kill some time and even buy those last minute gifts before you head home.\n\nThe store itself is large, open, and comfortable to browse around.  It has an excellent selection of books, gifts, and a sizable magazine rack.  There's also a Starbucks on one end.
