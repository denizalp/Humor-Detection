One of the fun parts about life is trying things you've never tried before.\n\nMy boyfriend introduced me to Vietnamese food....and i do believe it is my new favorite.  I have been to Doan's 3x now, and i have to say i LOVE this place.\n\nLet me start with the staff and restaurant.  Despite your first impressions of the neighborhood and parking lot, Doan's is a nice, clean, pleasant restaurant to walk into.  They are super friendly, and willing to give you suggestions of what you might like.  \n\nHowever, might i suggest to you one of the 3 dishes I've tried there: \nVermicelli Bun To, with the pork, added meat balls and a spring roll.....so stinkin' good.  (I've added a couple pictures of that.)\n\nThe Sandwich with the pork (which was amazing!), i crave those things now...and I live in Raleigh!  sad day.  :\/ \n\nOr the broken rice, which came with Pork, steak, and shrimp.  \n\nEverything was excellent.  The thing i like most, is that you can TASTE that it is grilled.  You don't get that at many place.\n\nAs far as drinks go, we tried the fresh limeade which was super good.  The Vietnamese Iced Coffee....it's made with sweeten condensed milk...seriously, how can anything be bad that has that in it?!  This iced coffee will make you stop going to the chain coffee house and go to doan's...it is that good.  And if you like it with a little bit of a chocolate twist, try the Lee's Coffee.\n\nBut my favorite....SUPER DE DUPER FAVORITE...in fact i would say it is so good, that if you put it on top of your head, your tongue would beat your brains out trying to get to it, is the Avocado Smoothie.  HOLY COW!....i NEVER knew Avocado could taste like this.   I noticed every table was ordering some sort of smoothie, so i asked our super nice waiter what it was and he told me it was a smoothie.  He said his favorite was the Avocado, so i said, BRING IT ON.  And I am soooo glad he did!\n\nApparently most countries use avocado as a \"sweet\" treat, and this smoothie brings out a whole new side to avacado i never knew existed.   So if you're daring, and want something amazing go for the Avocado smoothie!!!  you will NOT regret it!  (They also have a green bean smoothie....i want to try that one next, but currently i'm so addicted to the avocado, i haven't ordered it yet.  lol.)\n\nIf you're looking for good eats, good prices, nice staff, and something different than the local chain, take a trip to Doan's, you will NOT be sad that you did.
