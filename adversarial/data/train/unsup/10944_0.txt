I always come here when visiting Vegas. This time the pool was FILTHY, as if no one skimmed or shocked it (upon opening). We were the first people in the pool too so it was obvious someone didn't do their job the night before or the morning of. Bugs, grease, hair, gross. I asked to speak to a manager twice and both times they shrugged it off, no manager ever came to talk to me. If I want a sit in a dirty pool I can go to the regular pool for free.  So I did, and the normal hotel pool was very clean. For a place like moorea, image is everything and they didn't meet the bar this time. Sign of poor management; no quality control and ensuring the venue is perfect before letting customers in. Aside from the dirty pool, the waitresses are all very nice and attentive.
