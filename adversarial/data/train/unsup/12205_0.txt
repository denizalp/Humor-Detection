I am being VERY gracious with 2 stars. Oy, MEH, have I had better!  This was not a good, fun, or gratifying experience in any way.  I rarely find that I wish I had not gone somewhere, because I usually can find something pretty redeeming at most places such that I could give it at least 3 stars or more.  That is because I usually research places pretty heavily here on Yelp before venturing out! But, sorry Yelp crew, this time I felt heavily let down.\n\nLet's start with the food:  It was BLAH.  I am not a picky person.  Again, most of my reviews are high stars (and I review everything!).  But this place is on my Naughty List.\n\n1. Dutch Oven \"Pancake\"\n\n My Dutch Oven \"pancake\" sucked.  It just did.  And that's not a nice word, I know, and being a lady, I almost never use that word in public, but this sub-par confection deserves such strong language.  It was gooey, eggy, flavorless, bland, and undercooked.  It should have risen a little like a pancake, but it did not.  It was not fluffy.  It was the OPPOSITE of whatever fluffy is.  I was hungry, so I ate it, but I did not enjoy it, and I resented having to use calories on something so tasteless.  There was no golden brown coloring on the bottom of the pancake when I lifted it up.  It was not served hot, but warm.  The creme fraiche was nice, but not presented well.  The only thing good I can say about this dish is that the BERRIES placed on top were excellent.  Literally, that's all I can say.  They did a great job shopping for the berries.\n\nScore: 1 star\n\n2. Frittata\n\nMy egg frittata was \"forgetaboutta.\"  In other words, forgettable.  Also under seasoned, it had me reaching for the salt on the table.  (And I'm not one to usually do that).  I had my brunch companion taste to see if it was just me, and it WAS NOT.  He also thought that the frittata needed salt, and had no flavor.  As for consistency, it was fine.  But there was nothing pleasingly rich or memorable.  Yes, I know it was part of the \"Healthy Start\" menu, or some such thing.  So, it was fairly low in calories, but it still has to be GOOD.  It wasn't.  It was OK.  The avocado tomatillo sauce was the only good thing on this plate.  It was a little spicy, but it saved the dish from being a 1-star.\n\nScore: 2 stars\n\n3. Miscellaneous and Chocolate Croissant\n\nMy dining companion had the special, which was overcooked, to the point of being burned.  I tasted it, and it was awful.  He was a trooper for eating as much of it as he did.  (But again, we were HUNGRY). It had bananas, which were also awful.  His other dishes were pretty bad.  He is writing his own review, so I won't go into it.\n\nLast, and least, was my chocolate croissant. I'm a connoisseur of \"pain au chocolate,\" or \"chocolate croissants,\" as we say it here. I lived in an apartment in Paris (18th arrondissement) one summer and made it my ritual to have one EVERY DAY, and they were amazing.  I also have eaten my fair share of these delectable pastries here in the United States.  My all-time favorites are pretty hard to beat, like \"The French Spot\" in Cedar City, Utah, where a French damsel cranks them out like her life depends on it.  And my other favorite is, believe it or not, right here in Las Vegas, \"The Baguette Cafe,\" where a French lady also excellently bakes them fresh daily.\n\nThis one wasn't.  My chocolate croissant was burned, dry, and tasted terrible.  I was hungry (do you see a theme here?), so I ate it, but I felt bad about it.  \n\n(SCORE: -1)  \n\nI don't know why they gave me two croissants when I ordered one, but I think it was just to \"get rid of it,\" TBH. I saw that there were 2 chocolate croissants sitting out on the counter when I arrived, and guess what? THOSE ARE THE TWO THAT THEY GAVE ME, and NOT one of the ones that were under the clear dome cover of the pastry plate.  I was a little offended, but I was HUNGRY, and decided to give the chef the benefit of the doubt.  She did not deserve it.  My dining companion hated it, too.  These chocolate croissants should have subjected the chef to a criminal misdemeanor, with at least 1 day in custody, in a European jail.\n\nAnd that takes me to Chef Sonia.  Almost all of the reviews rave about her, and how kind and gracious and welcoming she is to her customers.  I. saw. none. of. that.  What I saw was a mirthless woman who did not greet us, despite talking to her \"regulars,\" and when I happened to be in her path when she was trying to get back into the kitchen, she bumped into me, and scowled at me.  Not even an \"excuse me.\" Or, \"oops!\" It was incredible.  I kept trying to make eye contact as one of the reasons I came was that so many people said the chef does \"touch table\" service and she is nice to talk to.  Again, I saw her doing that with others, but she NEVER did that with us. She seemed unhappy. Unlike everyone else, we also got no silverware and had to ask for it. I don't know why...but it was uncomfortable, rude, and weird.
