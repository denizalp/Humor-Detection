Put some fries and hot sauce on that chicken shawarma wrap, it's called Sultan style.  I'm just kidding.  I just made that up... don't say that to the cashier, they will be confused.  But you should still ask them to put fries and hot sauce on your wrap, it's a nice touch.  Thank you My T for the tip brosky!\n\nThis place has really bad reviews.  Granted service is not like you're going to get at Robouchon, but cmon, it's not that bad.  I really like the fatoush, it's more authentic than most places in Summerlin.  The chicken shawarma was great.  So juicy, not dry at all, I'm surprised at what everyone else is saying.\n\nI will come back!  Someone mentioned waiting 15 minutes for their food?  Is that really that bad?  Cmonnnnnnnnn
