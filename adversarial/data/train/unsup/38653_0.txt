it's a buffet.\n\nexpect the food to be mediocre.\nexpect a line for the lobster dish.\nexpect them to run out of lobster for 20 minutes.\nexpect the foom to be poorly heated i their warming trays or under their warming light.\nexpect the only action to be by the hot seafood: lobster, crab leggs...\nexpect peoplen to try and cut u in line.\nexpect to have an empty soda glass our entire for you entire meal: servers go around picking up your lobster and crab carcasses and refilling soda and water.\nexpect your meal not to come with alcohol (full bar between food areas).\nexpect a giant wait before you're even seated.\n\nthis place is all about waiting.\n\ni quit coming here. f this place.\nwent to buzzios and for the same price  the quality is exxtreme. sure, it's not as much food, but i bet a lot of these good reviews are by obese people. \n\nwhat do you prefer: \nQUALITY or QUANTITY?\n\nthe best part is the full dessert bar. sad, huh?
