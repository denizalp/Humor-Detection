This place was just ok in my book. It was good, but didn't blow me away. I decided to stop in for lunch yesterday after seeing all the positive reviews. The inside is small and very clean. The 2 girls working the front were very friendly and ready to take my order! I had already browsed the menu prior so I knew I wanted the Cali plate which consists of 2 chicken strips, fries and a hawaiian roll. The meal comes with one sauce, so I chose wasabi ranch and then also added the sriracha aioli and the mochiko sauce. I love sauce, fyi. I added a small drink because I wanted to try the lychee lemonade and paid about $8.75 for everything, not bad! \n\nThe lychee lemonade is deeeelicious, not too sweet, not too sour, but just right. I am so glad I tried that. So the food came out within 10 minutes and the chicken fingers were huge! I was happily impressed. What disappointed me was the fries, they were seasoned and there is no mention of that anywhere on the menu. I HATE seasoned fries. Every time I get them they are just tooo salty for me and this was exactly what happened here.The chicken was hot and juicy, not greasy or dry. The dipping sauces were a let down but my favorite was the sriracha aioli. I noticed something on the menu that said something along the lines of they were no longer going to be serving chicken fingers after 12\/1. But they did say they were going to be adding different items to the menu. If you like the chicken fingers, or want to try them, I suggest going there asap. I am interested to see what new items they will be adding, so I will certainly be back.
