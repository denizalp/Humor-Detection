This is such a great restaurant...we come here so often that most of the staff knows us by name and always seem happy to see us.  I love that there is a restaurant near my home that serves fresh and innovative dishes that I can also bring my kids to.  The service is always on point...every server is so knowledgable about the food and the wines they serve.  Chefs Kim and Joe are masters and every meal has not only been delicious but a work of art visually.  Do yourself a favor and try this Summerlin gem.
