I've been here a few times now and the staff is very welcoming and lovely. The only issue I have is that I've had gel pedicures the last couple of times I've been and two of the nails (the polish, not the toe nail), came off within 2-4 days....gel should last much longer than that. They didn't seem to be as thorough and it's an expensive service for only a couple days of wear.
