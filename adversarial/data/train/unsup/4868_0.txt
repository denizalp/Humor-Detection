This place was a madhouse, I see how you could get some good deals but honestly it's not worth it in my opinion. I went there and found some very pretty things but they weren't discounted enough for me to bother standing in line. Plus there just wasn't enough plus size options that I could find, found lots of smalls and mediums in the plus size section though which was pretty disheartening.
