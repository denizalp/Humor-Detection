They received one star ONLY because I couldn't write a review with zero stars.......\n\nThe absolute worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant.  \n\nFirst, we had made reservations for 12 people, weeks in advanced.  Confirmed our reservations the morning of. When we arrived they only had a table set for 10.  Their solution was to give us an additional table in the corner so that 2 lucky people could be separated from the rest of our group. Well we weren't having that....and finally they brought 2 additional chairs to our table. 2 chairs that were bar stools, so 2 people had to sit much higher than the table making it impossible for them to eat comfortably. \n\nReservations were at 7:30. It was 8:30 before we received bread (which we had to ask for) still no one has taken our order. And we were having to get up from our table to order drinks at the bar....since our waiter was to preoccupied with other tables. Once we did place our order it was another 45 min before we received our food. \n\nA couple in our group ordered lobster ravioli, about 30 mins after we placed our order they were told they ran out of it.  At this point everyone in our group was upset, and we asked to speak with the owner......this is where it gets good.\n\nWe voiced our issues to the owner who replied with \"I do this for fun, I don't feel like arguing so we will just take our food back\"\n\nWe were dumbfounded by his response.  Some people continued to eat, I gladly gave my food back.  \n \nIn an attempt to fix the issue the owner did bring out lobster ravioli (that he must of pulled out of his ass, since they supposedly had just sold the last of it about 20 min ago and proceeded to say \"here is ur ravioli, so don't complain because I myself made it for you\" What a cocky SOB.  If I wasn't there celebrating a friends birthday I would have walked out right then and there. \n\nWhen the bills came, they ended up charging me for my pasta, and literally hand wrote a 20% gratuity on each of the the checks. How ballsy is that?!  No tips were given, and portions of the bills went unpaid.\n\nI have never had such an unprofessional experience in my life. I will NEVER go back..... And strongly advises that no one give business to those assholes either!
