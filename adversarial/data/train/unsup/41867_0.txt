I'm pretty picky when it comes to sushi but this place rocks my world. Super picky about Tako specifically and here it tastes awesome. Not fishy at all a the texture is just right. Don't forget to use your IndiCard here! And happy hour is 30% off everything including sake which they have a great selection of.
