With a tearful eye this past summer, we dropped off my daughter to day care.  It was traumatizing and one of the most difficult things I've had to do.   With a tearful eye this week, we informed Little People Child Care that we would be leaving.\n\n(no fault of LPCC.   My mom is retiring and will be taking on the responsibility)\n\nGloria of Little People Child Care is an angel and a miracle worker.    She's one of those people who are genuinely warm and friendly.   Are you worried that your child will not eat or nap?   Gloria can work miracles and managed to get our baby to sleep and eat regularly along with the other kids.\n\nI love Little People Child Care because it's a family run business run in a house.   You know she is a great parent with talking to her well-mannered boys.  And even though she has so many kids under her care, I can only wish my house was as clean as hers.
