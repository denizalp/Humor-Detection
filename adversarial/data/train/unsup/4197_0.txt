I'm going to be that person that writes a bad comment in a sea of good. Don't get me wrong, I love Bosa Donuts although I do prefer the location on McDowell. But on one particular incident a couple of months ago, at 2 AM I ended up ordering a Thai iced tea with boba while my friends also ordered the same. But rather in my drink I ended up with a dead fly floating in my mouth. By the time I realized this I ended up getting so sick that I wasn't able to drive back and complain. \n\nI love Bosa and I am a loyal customer. But I will never return to this branch again.
