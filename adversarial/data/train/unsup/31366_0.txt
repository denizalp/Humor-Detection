My husband and I moved to Toronto last summer with our dog and Spring Realty helped us find our current home in Leslieville. Ara was GREAT to work with, he really knows the neighborhoods and we really appreciated how he paid attention to our needs. Whenever we would go see a potential home, he always knew where the closest dog parks were, which I LOVED! We also worked with Sherry, who was also fantastic and patient! We still keep in touch with both Ara and Sherry because they're just awesome people! I highly recommend Spring Realty!
