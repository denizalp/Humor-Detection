ChopShop, where have you been all my life? It's hard to believe that your food is so healthy, quick and delicious, but my empty lunch bowl and giant smile are proof that this is an amazing fast casual concept!\n\nI ordered a Thai chicken bowl with veggies and forbidden rice and happily washed it all down with a green kale juice. If I had a ChopShop in my hometown I'd be here all the time! It's difficult for most spots to make healthy something you crave, but this restaurant does it effortlessly!
