They lured me with $3 happy hour specials. Don't like the special? Settle down, they spin a wheel that determines the next option every half hour. We went through margaritas (too much mixer), Tecate (it's Vegas, it's crowded, I'll take it), and Dos Equis. We passed on the Cuervo shots.\n\nOur waiter\/model was pleasant and made certain to keep all meaty items off my foods. Chips are NOT fried in lard and the taco salad can be served up vegetarian style (though, sadly, you pay the same price as the omnivores). \n\nWe started with chips & three kinds of salsa, the roasted ones had more flavor than the fresh one (Note: chips are not complimentary here).  None were particularly stellar but I wasn't looking for innovative culinary arts at a cantina. The taco salad was a big heap of fresh mixed greens in a fried shell (it balances out, right). A bit heavy on the dressing but an adequate choice for a a late, leisurely lunch. My companion had the chicken salad and thought it was tasty and an appropriate portion for her smaller appetite. Presentation was eye-pleasing on all our items with the exception of the margarita. The glass had a big ol' chip in the base, retire this puppy already. \n\nLunch for two + a couple rounds of HH drinkies was about fifty bones. Is it worth a trip out of your way? I'm going with no, but it a nice option if you happen to stop in during happy hour. The Deuce shuttle stops right out front. Vegetarians - this place is meat central they put it everything, but the staff was willing to work with me on veggie-tizing my dish. Vegans - super slim pickings. \n\nDiablo's is operated by the Light Group and Zabeel Investments which are based in North America and Dubai. Hooray for mega-investment\/management companies soaking up tourists dollars with overpriced foods!!
