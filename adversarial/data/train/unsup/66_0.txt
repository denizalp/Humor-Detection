Today was a half day at work for me, since I was getting over a cold and tried to come back one day too early. But coming here to pickup a few things was just the tonic. \n\nYou see, a few months ago this Peroggi place had a small tragedy. Again I was on my way home and decided to make a quick stop. Seems all of their new A\/C units upfront had gone on the fritz. The only food items they could salvage were now safely in their refrigeration units in the back. \n\nUnderstanding their emergency, I offered to buy a few items and make it up to them. Well, one of the owners was glad I stopped by and I drove off with $50 worth of goodies. \n\nSo having finished off our supply of Pierogies and Kielbasa, I came back today to restock our home freezer. As others have noted, this is only a small deli with four tables. They have food items that they'll prepare for you in the back, but God help it if more than eight customers decide to come here for lunch. LOL\n\nWell that would not be a problem for me, I was here to shop and go.  As entered I could see three woman in the back making some Pierogies by hand. That's how fresh things are here. They make the typical potato and cheddar ones, along with onions, bacon and et cetra.  We have never had a bad one.  \n\nEverything is excellent.  Enjoy!
