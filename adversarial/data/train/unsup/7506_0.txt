Great Experience - After calling and getting a few quotes over the phone, we ended up selecting Illumination.  They scheduled an in-home measurement (even arrived a few minutes early for our appt), the item arrived when they said it would arrive and then they called to schedule the install, and they did a great job on the install.  Everything was seamless and both Anthony who gave me the quote over the phone and came for the measurements, and their install team, were courteous and on time.  Happy with the job!
