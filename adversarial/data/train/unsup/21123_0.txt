Whatever you do, get the Adobo Fried Rice here.  It was the first time I tried adobo style fried rice and it was good!  Actually, most of the food here was good.  My only exception would probably be the Chicken Adobo which wasn't bad or anything, but it just wasn't as good as other chicken adobo's I've had before.  The portions here are generous and the environment...well, a lot better than most Filipino restaurants outside of a resort in the Philippines.  It's clean here, and a nice sit down and dine restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the following:\nChicken Adobo, $7.95, -OK\nMiki-Bihon, $7.95, -Good\nAla Carte Lechon Kawali, $8.95, -Excellent\nOx Kare Kare, $10.95, -Good\nAdobo Fried Rice, $6.95, -Ridiculously Good\n\nSalo-Salo Grill is a little pricier when you compare it with the Filipino buffets in Vegas, but the food and look of the restaurant make up for it.  Plus, they have a little hut outside, in the parking area, where you can smoke.  How Filipino is that?\n\nCustomer service was OK despite the other reviews I read about it being not to good.  I didn't like the fact that the waitress stood next to our table though when she dropped off the check.  She stayed there till we put out the payment, a 'hunny'.  It was annoying!  Someone from my table said it's just the way some of us from certain islands are...I don't know which island she was referring about but it still irritated me nonetheless.
