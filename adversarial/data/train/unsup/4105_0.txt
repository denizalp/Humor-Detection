This is a great place to eat when you have a hefty appetite! We always get the all-you-can-eat sushi. It's about $20 but it is SOOOOO worth it! The catch is you will be charged with anything left behind (including rice). So be careful! We've left in fullness pain a couple times, mostly due to the fact that my sister likes to order 10 or more orders of sashimi! They get you with the large amount of rice they put under the raw fish, so I, personally, like to go for their specialty rolls. I recommend the volcano rolls, but don't eat them right away because they are scolding hot but super delicious! I also like the Kentucky roll a lot, it is a roll that is filled with Japanese style fried chicken and wow its amazing. Almost anything they have on the menu is worth a try!! Again, it's all you can eat so be sure to look through ALL of their specialty rolls and try as many as you can finish! Also, make sure you ask for some unagi sauce on the side, that stuff is good on everything!! The staff is really nice and super attentive and when there is a birthday, the gong comes out!
