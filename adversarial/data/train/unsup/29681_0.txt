If you want to die pick this hospital. My mom arrived by ambulance with ankle swelling, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath. Upon arrival, I told the doctor that she had her gallbladder removed 12 years prior due to a benign tumor. Doctors do not want to listen to patients or explain anything. Money is the only priority at this hospital. The hospital discharged her 3 days later even though she was still unable to walk. The discharge instructions said that she had congestive heart failure and needed to go home and get more rest, exercise, and a better diet and arranged for a home health nurse to visit 3 times a week. 1 month later she died of cancer at another hospital. Doctors here do not care unless you are rich. If she had the right tests ordered the cancer would have been diagnosed in time and her life could have possibly been extended. The entire clinical staff was negligent in delivering care. Beware, they will discharge you with an incorrect diagnosis while you are still experiencing symptoms and may not check you thoroughly if your insurance is disliked. TRUST ME, YOU ARE GAMBLING WITH YOUR LIFE IF YOU CHOOSE MOUNTAIN VIEW.
