This place is so hidden but amazing !!!! I ordered a combo platter type of thing, came with steak, soup, rice & an enchilada . My boyfriend got a burrito. We both ate everything on our plate and we're super impressed. \n\nService was 10\/10 \nFood 10\/10 \n\nOnly complaint was portion size for the price but honestly I'd still come back!
