Book it. \n\nFull disclosure it was a four day long paid-for business trip and if I were traveling on my own dime, I probably would not have stayed here. But, go with the flow I say!\n\nThe great: Super friendly front desk folks, I love that the Blue Hound is on site (ordered in-room breakfast one morning and it was outrageously good), don't forget to request to borrow a humidifier, the in-room snacks are delightful but expensive as hell (I'm looking at you NUTSACK).\n\nThe conference I was attending had the most freaking delicious food during breaks, all thanks to the hotel. Delicious smoothies and green drinks, lavender-honey yogurt, fresh salads, pasta, you name it. The view is great - definitely step out to the pool and have a cocktail - and really, I have nothing bad to say.\n\nGo to there.
