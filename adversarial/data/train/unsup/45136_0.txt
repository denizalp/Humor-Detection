I'm so sad they moved to a new location because their old location looked so beautiful! When we let the girls behind the counters that it was our first time there, they were verrrry helpful! She explain everything to us, and even let us sample some flavors. We're kinda indecisive- so thank you for letting us sampling half of the flavors lol! I had the peach and the coconut. (They paired so well together!) Only thing was, it didn't really taste like gelato to me but more as in shaved ice? Overall the \"gelato\" was good, I thought it was awesome how they don't put any chemicals in it & it was made naturally. But I don't think I would go out of my way for their ice cream.(I live 30 mins away) Bonus for the very edgy, photogenic atmosphere though (:
