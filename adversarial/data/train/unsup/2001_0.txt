I went here to see Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias last night. Woo-hoo what a great show!  Sound, lights, crowd all fabulous.  Venue is not too big but like a mini colosseum. We had great seats on the first tier. \n\nDrinks were up to $20 for a premium double cocktail which is OUTRAGEOUS. So if you're going to drink trust me it's worth always getting premium because our next round I went el cheapo and I swear \"well\" drinks here are one step above moonshine. (and I have the headache to prove it). \n\nCredit cards are accepted. Snack bar available too with nachos, popcorn and pretzels.  Service at the \"bar\" line was great but lines a bit long during intermission and the same for the ladies restroom. \n\nThe cluster was after the show, OMG like herding cattle, a slow moving wave of people to exit into the main hotel. I'm not sure if this is the only exit but where's the Fire Marshall to find out?\n\nHaving never been to a concert here before I was not sure where to park or where to go, so apparently after tipping well to park in valet which was full, I learned parking is near the aquarium by the convention center.  When you know better, you do better.
