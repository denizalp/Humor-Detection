A very disappointing experience ... We just had breakfast at sugar factory and one of us ordered the eggs Benedict and found a long piece of plastic on the ham . We called our waiter who took the plate and didn't even apologize and asked if We'd like another dish without saying please accept our apology your dish is on the house .. This gets worse when the waiter talks to the manager who doesn't have the decency to come by to the table and apologize . We asked for check and left the restaurant but before leaving we talked to the manager who 1st didn't apologize , 2nd : he denied that the Waiter talked to him about our table and said \" this wasn't the case even though we saw him talking to our waiter and that the Benedict was taken off the bill 3rd he doesn't deserve to be a manager in such an industry as he has no sense of hospitality , problem ownership and guest recovery.\nThe attitude we got from him has definitely made us not wanting to step in that restaurant again ..
