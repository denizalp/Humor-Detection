What a terrific spot! My salad blew me away. \n\nIf you aren't familiar with Fox Restaurant Concepts, they operate a variety of restaurants that emphasize locally sourced, fresh ingredients. This location was new to me but I knew of the brand & their reliably good menus (wild flower). \n\nI had the chicken salad- the manchego cheese, paired with the marcona almonds, the medjool dates, the crunchy jicama- wow, what a pairing! The dehydrated cranberries offered a tart compliment & texture to the sweet dates & both paired well with the manchego. It's topped with a champagne vinaigrette, which is ideal. I ordered it without any farro but it was still filling and absolutely delicious. Not overly sweet, but sweet enough that you feel like you're getting both lunch & dessert. \nThey had a fantastic selection of juices & tea options! I hear the Hangover beverage with coconut, honey & pineapple is one of their best. \nI opted for the iced green tea which I really enjoyed. \nI found the ambiance to be cool, hip, with a nice outside seating area. The ceilings were high & you can see into the open kitchen. I was enamored watching the chef dig out multiple spaghetti squash. I think I found a new technique. \n\nWith the wood floors, high ceilings and lots of glass, it's pretty noisy. I wish they'd install some noise absorbing material but that aside, I've found a new go to PHX lunch spot.
