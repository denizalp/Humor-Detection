The good: portions are large. Seriously if you don't eat much, consider sharing a plate with someone. \n\nIf your ordering pancakes a 1-short stack will do- it's 10 inches!  if your a monster then consider the 2 or 3 short stack. I love the variety of flavors, I had the lemon-blueberry stack, very delicious combo especially the deep lemon flavor which I expected not to taste. \n\nI also had the Veggie skillet, eggs and veggies over the homemade potatoes are delicious, the veggies were tasty and I think it's better if you don't have them scrambled as it comes w\/three eggs (any style) I had mine over easy, w\/ your choice of toast OR biscuit and gravy(no meat- YESSS!!)- it would not be advisable to order the biscuit and gravy w\/the skillet, it's way too much. I thought it would be a small biscuit - but I was wrong. \n\nThe bad: seating sucks, it's cramped, I had a table next to an annoying mother, and suffered her opinions on the Mets and why sharing your food with your siblings is important- she wasn't even loud about it, but that's how close we were. The chairs are so uncomfortable my ass was killin me while I ate and after. The coffee wasn't very good. And not that this matters much- but my server had \"resting bitch face\" it's hard to enjoy your meal when your server looks like she about to cut you.
