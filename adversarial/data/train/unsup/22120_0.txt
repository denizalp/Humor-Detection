Looking for a barber where the barbers are competent and give you a good cut and shave?  Then you got that here.  \n  Looking for a place where the barbers chat and kid with each other and chat with you? Go somewhere else.  Everytime I've been here everyone was quiet.  Only sound was the TV up on the wall.  You want a place with a little \"atmosphere\", go to a place like V's.
