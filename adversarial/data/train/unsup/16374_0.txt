Date Night for 2 this past Saturday with my boyfriend included: 2 cold Sake bombs, the Japanese beer battered cod as an appetizer and the \"Samuri Warrior\" (I believe that's what it's called) for the main dish ... ran us $60 bucks!  \n\nI'd never made so much for a cold sake bomb, or for Sushi that taste like I made it myself!  Nothing exceptional about it all.  This is only my 3rd time trying sushi since moving to Phoenix.  Here, Blue Water Grill and Whole Foods!  Whole Foods beats everybody else out of the water.\n\nIn addition to the mediocre sushi, the service absolutely sucks!  We probably only seen our server a total of 4 times.  Once when she took out drink orders, once when she brought the drinks back and took our order, and the third time she came when she noticed we were done and already had the bill in hand.\n\nI careless to give this place a second try!
