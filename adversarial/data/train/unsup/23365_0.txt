I have been here 3 times and I came home the first and second time feeling very satisfied. I'm 16 and I've always went to crappy cheap places to get my haircut so I was really looking forward to going to salon crave because its $40 dollars and hey, it should be worth it right. Well the third time I went I finally realized how HORRIBLE they cut my hair. It was nothing like what I had asked for, the cut was choppy, uneven and I even had to cut some pieces out that she missed when I examined it at home. I finally realized the other times I went, it was also choppy and unflattering and she didn't really seem to know how to do those chic bobs or she just didn't take me seriously since I'm young. But I also guess it's my fault too, for not communicating my disatisfication to her. Overall, NOT a place for youth and definitely won't be back.
