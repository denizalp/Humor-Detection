I went on a dessert date with a friend after hanging around the area and we were not disappointed! Although the price is a bit high for a sundae, I have to say that the servings for everything else on their menu were quite large, and I honestly don't mind paying the price for a yummy treat once in a while!\n\nI had their Good Morning sundae and it was so refreshing and a great way to mix both my love of ice cream and iced coffee!\n\nI can't wait to return and try something else.\n\nMy only \"complaint\" is that it was a little crowded due to the size of their location, and hard to find a seat, and when we did get a seat, the woman had left a broken cone and her napkins all over the table in a sticky mess. She didn't even attempt to clean before she left! But that isn't Fugo's fault, that's just customers being a butt.\n\nIf it isn't super hot outside, their items are easy to eat and walk with it!\n\nIf you come with a big group of friends, have a plan to sit elsewhere or go someplace else after you receive your order. There's about 2-3 tables and a window area to sit at, but it's only good for couples or singles. I can't imagine having more than 3 people in a party in such a small area!
