So this was the best Mexican food I've had since moving to Vegas. Why did friends not bring me here sooner? Why make me suffer through those other awful places I will not name?\n\nI'm taking one star off for slow, slow service and the \"meh\" margarita. Maybe it was my fault for not upgrading to the Cadillac margarita, but I thought the house would do the trick. It was blended well, don't get me wrong, I appreciate the vitamix type blend job... But alcohol and flavor were lacking.\n\nNow... Food was on point. I thoroughly enjoyed my mole enchiladas. That sauce was as authentic as I've ever had (I'm not Mexican or an expert, but it was darn tasty.) The beans come on a little tostada cup and the rice tasted fresh. Can't remember what my boyfriend had, but he ate the whole thing. Something with green sauce...\n\nChips were crunchy and not too fragile or greasy. I could eat chips and salsa all day. Our salsa was spicy and I guess I wasn't expecting it because other places had been so bland; it was yummy though!\n\nWill definitely return in the future.
