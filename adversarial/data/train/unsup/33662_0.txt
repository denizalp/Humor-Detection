This place brings me back to the boba in Cali especially since there's not very many options for boba out here in AZ...pretty good and always good customer service. However, one of your girls there needs to lighten up and stop taking this job way too seriously...smile a bit maybe. I think she might be a manager but I'm not positive. All the other folks here are incredibly nice
