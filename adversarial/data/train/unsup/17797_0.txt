I am seriously in love with Swenson's. \n\nIt is absolutely amazing for fast(ish) food. \n\nThe burgers melt in your mouth. The buns are just perfect and you won't find anything like them anywhere else. \n\nThe milkshakes are heavenly. I love that you can mix different flavors. Chocolate and banana! Chocolate and mint! Chocolate and peanut butter! \n\n*SWOON*
