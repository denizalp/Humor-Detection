I i'm coming to the gym for few months now and I really like this people and the staff are friendly but today I had a horrible experience.  I've been asking them a question about my billing and each time for the last week they said it was OK and that it was OK I come 3 to 4 times a week I knew there was an issue so I kept asking.  Hey I was told that my payment was not processed for this month and then I have to pay a late fee when I asked them several times over and over about my payment and also the staff was horrible was really rude and I honestly do not recommend anything because the same person but I think it's the manager I think she was rude and very unprofessional... I don't recommend this location.  I'm not sure about other but there is a LA Fitness and is $4 more a month no contract and with the pool!!! Is worth it the only reason that I liked this location is on my way and is a small place I don't like crowded places but I will survive.  I had other people that had bad experience but because I had not had one my self I really did think much of it! But now I see 100% no people skills!  If there negative stars I will do it!
