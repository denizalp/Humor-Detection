Ilios Noche is a Greek \/ Mediterranean restaurant located in Charlotte, NC and is part of the Xenia Hospitality Group (where it is all about \"hospitality\" or \"generosity\").  The focus for Ilios Noche is on a fast & casual restaurant, bar, and bakery dining experience.  \n\nI tried the following:\n\n1) \"Greek Style\" Pork Ribs (with coriander, lemon, olive-cabbage slaw, cucumber yogurt) - my manager (from work) ordered this and I got to try some.  Lucky me!  This is definitely a MUST GET item!  The meat was fall off the bones with the perfect amount of seasoning!\n\n2) Braised Short Ribs - I ordered this for dinner as this was marketed as the \"Sunday Daily Special\".  Loved the flavors, but I thought the meat was a tad dry in the center of the meat.  Good size portion.\n\nENJOY!!
