I am not from Henderson, I was visiting Las Vegas and staying with friends in Henderson.  On a Saturday night I decided that it had been far too long since I last had some Chinese food and searched Yelp for somewhere to satiate my palate.  Pickings were slim in Henderson, but I came across Grand China, specifically the location on Horizon Ridge Parkway, the reviews looked good, and I decided this would be where I could get my Chinese fix.  After being seated, I noticed the menu's were very large and heavy (like heavy, heavy!)  I love crab rangoons and was pleasantly surprised to find them on the menu.  I ordered the dinner special with general tso's chicken, hot and sour soup, and fried rice.  Imagine my surprise when the first bite of the general's chicken landed on my tongue and my taste buds immediately delivered the news to my brain: THIS IS EXCELLENT!  I couldn't believe it, this was some of the best general tso's chicken I have had in years.  The spiciness was perfectly balanced with a hint of sweetness.  The chicken was breaded and cooked perfectly.  Eating this food I knew that I would be back for more.\n\nThe next day I came back and had the entree portion of general tso's chicken (a larger portion than the dinner special) along with steamed rice and the fried wontons instead of the crab rangoon.  Again, the general's chicken was amazing, the fried wontons were much better than the rangoons (you get more pieces and it's cheaper!).\n\nMy only regret is that I live 400 miles away in California and I wont be able to visit on a regular basis.  But, mark my words, when I come back to Las Vegas, this will be one of the first places I go.
