KYOT how did you quietly invade all of the offices and restaurants of my life?  I've had all of the George Benson, Chuck Mangione, Spyro Gyra, and Kenny G. one man can take for a lifetime.  You've done it, you've smoothed me to near death with what you falsely call \"jazz\" (I have another word for it using three of those four letters).  I know others have been led astray by your wallpapery aural seduction, but you can't fool me, you just can't.
