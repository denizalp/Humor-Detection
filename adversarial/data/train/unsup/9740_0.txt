My 1st time staying here.  Our room was comped thanks to my friend who enjoys gambling.  haha.  Anywho, our room was conveniently located close to the elevators and ice machine.  \n\nThe room had 2 queen beds and a large bathroom which included a bath tub, separate shower, 2 sinks, and the toilet behind a closed door.  The room is clean and decently sized.  The beds and pillows were comfortable as well.  Noise level from the hallways is very minimal.  \n\nI would stay here again... the next time my friend gets a comped room.  LOL
