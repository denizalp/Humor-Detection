Stumbled across this bar with some friends past midnight. It's comparable to El Furniture Warehouse, but in here we could have a conversation. We were immediately seated, although most of their seats and tables were occupied. They also have a back patio.\n\nGreat ambience and music. They play music from Cher to Bruno Mars. The songs are the type of songs you start singing along to after having some of their drinks. \n\nDrinks are reasonably priced and somewhat extensive. They have a $4.95 food menu. I would have rated this place higher, except our food took close to an hour to come. We had ordered some tacos, carbonara, and mini donuts. I would recommend the mini donuts if you're craving some Tiny Tom's! Service was very good, and the staff were very friendly. \n\nOverall, it is a very similar concept to El Furniture Warehouse. Although I like the ambience here, I would much prefer the menu and drink options at El Furniture.
