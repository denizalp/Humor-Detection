*3.5 stars*  \nIt was my first time here tonight...a few things, it's pretty nice for a sports bar - the food was actually pretty ok.  I ordered the portobello sandwich - which was pretty tasty.  We started with the quesadilla sliders which are tastier than they sound.  My friends order burgers (a few variations - all got the thumbs up).  Another friend ordered the stir fry, which by all accounts was good for a sports bar, but she ordered tofu, and it had a weird consistency, kind of like a crouton, but not...And for dessert the peanut butter pie.  Super sweet - but good.  Probably something to share, unless you decide to pass on the main, the way my friend did.\n\nAlso - it's better to make reservations, it was pretty busy for a Thursday night with no game on.  And they there isn't a way to make online reservations, so I had to call in.\n\nPS *I'm not sure why the menu doesn't have pics of food in it, b\/c I really think that would be super helpful
