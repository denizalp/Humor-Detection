My 200th review! My 100th was the bulldozed hospital where i was born, so i thought it fitting to pay tribute to another long lost giant. Home to years of futile Indians play, monstrous WMMS world series of rock concerts, Billy Graham revivals and Brownie playoff glory. I never saw a Browns game there, but did see a bunch of Indians games just before they got competitive in the early 90's. The place maybe had 7,000 fans tops back then. It was awesome. People smoked cigars and cursed like longshoremen on those mosquito infested summer nights. The Jake(er, Progressive field) is a complete sanitized 180 from what i know as real baseball. My father in law \"acquired\" 2 chairs from there during the last Browns home game melee that saw people grabbing anything they could carry and bumrushing the doors. He describes it as the closest to \"near riot\" conditions he's ever been in. He also describes the world series of rock shows as sunbaked, acid-drenched orgies. Won't get that at the new Browns stadium. Unless Bernie Kosar and Michael Stanley form a supergroup and play fifteen sold out shows in a row. Loved the giant Chief Wahoo that is now mothballed at the Western Reserve historical society.
