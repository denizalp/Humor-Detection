TIP:  Ask the server to leave the remaining food\/drink on the table if they attempt to remove it right after they've finished serving the table!\n\nTIP 2:  Do make reservations, especially on the weekend.  We went for a Sunday dinner and the place was at capacity.  They have an easy online booking system which will text you to remind you!\n\nPretty damn close to 5*s!  The *only* reason I cannot give them a full 5* is because our server took away the gravy of the murgh lababdar (very similar to butter chicken) and the pot of chai.  Otherwise, everything from the service to the actual food was great, not overhyped!\n\nService was very nice and classy.  The server started out the evening explaining the menu, that it's from different regions of India so it's different cuisines, blah, blah, blah.  Atmosphere is also a mix of traditional with contemporary, so you may feel a bit odd if you should up in your late Sunday evening grocery store best.\n\nNot sure if it was because we were in a larger party\/celebrating a special occasion, but our server started the meal serving the first main, one-by-one (wedding style).  So after each person was served the murgh lababdar, he took away the rest of the delicious gravy!  It would've been nice to dip our naan in the rest of the sauce, but it was too late.  :(   My BIL felt a bit uncomfortable, so he told the server that we can help serve ourselves for the rest of the meal.\n\nHOWEVER, at the end of the meal, the same thing happened with my sister's chai. The server came with a small-medium sized pot of chai, poured it into a smallish mug, then took away the rest of the pot.  Meanwhile, a group of older Indian gentlemen who were seated nearby had full-on pots on their table.  So we thought that was a bit odd.  Again, not sure if this is their practice, but we would've preferred if they left the remaining food\/drink on the table until we deemed them to be finished. \n\nHighlights were the kebob platter (don't think it's on the menu, but it featured different types of meats in different marinades) and the murgh lababdar, again it was very similar to butter chicken.  I don't think you can really go wrong though 'cause everything was pretty delicious!  All the dishes tasted distinctly different, unlike other Indian restaurants were many of them taste very similar.\n\nMy bf cannot eat spicy foods and he was fine, so basically anyone should be able to eat here.\n\nI'd definitely go back as this was probably the nicest Indian restaurant that I've been too.  The old school service really does add to not only the atmosphere, but the food as well!  However, it's not a cheapie place, so keep that in mind.  They automatically add a 15% grat to parties of 7+!
