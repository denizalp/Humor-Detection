I went here for the first time after hearing rave reviews about it.I was never offered any \"free samples\" that everyone keeps taliking about:(.The kid at the counter knew it was our first time there too.He was very nice and helpful though.\nI thought the food was pretty good,but did not really like the menu so much.It seems like the only chinese chicken they have is either,ginger,deep fried,or jerk.All of which I'm not a fan of.Oh yeah they do have terryaki chicken,which i ordered.It was pretty good.Also the white rice i got was perfectly cooked.I sampled some of my B.F.'S Jerk chicken and black beans and they were delicious!I usually hate jerk chicken,but Chino Bandido's is awesome.\nI thought the food was good,nothing special.I really did not like the ordering process.(fill out a form and hand it in???)weird.Also the decor is dingy,drab,depressing,and dirty.Reminds me of a high school cafeteria.(only not as clean).\nThe cookie they gave us with our meals was really good too.I think it was a snickerdoodle.\nOverall the food was good,but i don't see why everyone acts like it's the best food ever.It's not THAT great.\nT he atmosphere is what really turned me off.I'd eat here again,but really gotta be in the mood for it.I know it's fast food,but it got a little annoying when every customer who came in after us decided to sit RIGHT next to us even though there were plenty of empty tables.And they all had loud, whiney kids with them too.(obviously not chino bandido's fault)but still annoying.
