Had an appointment for 6:30 for 2 pedicures, called to re-schedule for 6, they said no problem. We came at 6 and there were at least 5 other people waiting. They asked us to choose a color, we did and sat down. They said the wait shouldn't be long. They were so cramped that they started doing people's nails on the chairs in the waiting area. \n\nAfter 25 mins we told the receptionist we were going somewhere else, the wait was too long. She said OK and we left. It seems like appointments don't matter and they don't stagger them at all. They made no effort to rectify the situation. Went to a salon down the street and they took us right away.
