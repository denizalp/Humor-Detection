Dr Quan is a wonderful man.   I have suffered from chronic pain for over 20 years and have seen primary care doctors, physical therapists, chiropractors, and massage therapists and I always thought they were masking a broader problem that needed to be addressed.   Dr Quan seems to have a better understanding of how the human body works more then any other Dr I have seen.    I am very hopeful I will see legitimate gains with him as my Dr.   His bedside manner is very warm and professional.  I highly recommend anyone to see him.
