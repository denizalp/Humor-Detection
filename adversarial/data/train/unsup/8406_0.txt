tiki gods arise\nthe ghost of the kon tiki \nlives on the two five\n\nThere was a day when Cleveland boasted one of the nations finest tiki bars, known as The Kon Tiki. As the evolution of nightlife continued, the faux-exotic Polynesian motif slowly was remanded to second rate American-Chinese restaurants. The whole tiki bar genre gradually disappeared.  The drinks, originally complicated, exotic, fruity concoctions fell victim to shortcuts and chemical compounds masquerading as citrus or falernum.  The nadir of our cocktail past had many victims, and the tiki bar, with all of its exotic splendor, became a relic.\n\nThankfully, the tiki gods are stiring again, and a minor renaissance of the tiki is gaining ground.  Lucky for us, our ground zero for tiki has opened up just on the edge of Ohio City.  The d√©cor boasts pieces from the original Kon Tiki and also offers some old photographs and history. Not overdone in an fakey TGI Fridays kind of way, but a sincere hat tip to the past.  \n\nSerious cocktail work going on here as well. I was given a taste of the homemade Falernum syrup and it was spot on. The Mai Tai was solid. The Navy Grog cocktail was a boozy, haze inducing hammer.  \nI intend to work my way through the menu quickly.\n\nProps to you, Porco.\n\nCarry on...
