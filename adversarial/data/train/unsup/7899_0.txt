I wish I had read the reviews before I took my daughter's dog here for exercise. He is a medium size lab\/terrier mix who likes to run and catch his ball. He ignores other dogs and goes to a dog park every day at her home. I took the dog and our 3 year old grandson. We went to the 'active' side so the dog could run. There were two young women there with a husky pup and another dog. We went off to one side, far from the others. \nWe were there about 5 minutes.  My grandson was standing on the side, playing with his truck when the two dogs ran over and jumped him.  He screamed, I scooped him up and yelled to the women to please call their dogs. They stood looking at the scene and did nothing! Even after I got the baby up in my arms, the dogs continued to jump on me. Those two women never attempted to call their animals! I couldn't believe it! We left, I will NEVER go back there and I encourage others not to go either. The city should lock the gates before they are faced with a lawsuit! I cannot believe people stand for this behavior.
