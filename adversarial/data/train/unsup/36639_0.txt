Absolutely delightful spot. Chef Nopawan is very passionate about her food, be it a thai classic or something she's experimenting with. Despite having a broken arm she made sure to spend time greeting us at the table, asking us about the food and what brought us in. \n\nThe food itself was all around great, and the owner even offered to accommodate each diner's tastes- like your som tam a less sweet and more on the tart side? No problem! The only minor quibble is the price of each item, as if you show up on an empty stomach, expect to leave with a lighter wallet. Most items are $10 and probably better suited to $8. Most $8 items better suited to $6.
