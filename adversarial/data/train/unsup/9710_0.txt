I don't understand how this place has 4 stars, fake reviews! So of course you expect to get miso and edamame complimentary but not here, everything is ordered separately. It was not busy at all and some how managed to bring our food out all at different times. We had a newbie server, she managed to spill a soda off her tray all over my arm. Broken glass and drink was left on the floor until we left, after I asked them to clean it up multiple times. Bad service. Food was just ok, they don't even offer all you can eat! They tried to give me a $20 gift card for next time, I put it toward my tab, never coming back!
