The name should by Lucky's. Leave out the pizza part. Using imitation cheese and canned tomato sauce doesn't qualify it as pizza. The bread, no not dough, sucks out any remaining flavor out of the dish. It's soggy and miserable. The place is sketch and the only reason to visit the place is to have a terrible pizza to compare it by. Bleh.
