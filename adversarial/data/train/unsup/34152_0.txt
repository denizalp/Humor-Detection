Go two to four times a month with co-workers.  Always a good experience at this family-owned restaurant.  Can be a little busy, but we tend to come in at 11 am to beat the crowd.  Always have the best service and very friendly.  We have several dietary constraints in the group and always willing to work around or find something on the menu for the vegan, gluten-free and other restrictions.
