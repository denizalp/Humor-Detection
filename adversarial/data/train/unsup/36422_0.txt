Let me first start off by saying that I was extremely disappointed by the lobster poutine! If I'm paying 17 for a poutine, I would like a little more lobster on top! There was barely any..\n\nI had also ordered oysters, but they only had two different types. The oysters were well shucked and good overall.\n\nMy friend had ordered the lobster roll and just ended up eating just the lobster since the bread was way too buttery. \n\nWhat did end up getting a good review was the jerk crab and shrimp. The two of my friends who had ordered that dish really enjoyed it and made me wish I had ordered that instead.\n\nOne last thing.. THE CAESARS LOOKED PHENOMENAL! I would return just to try that.
