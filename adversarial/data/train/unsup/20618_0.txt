I'm crushing on Snapdragon hard - my lil' oasis of cool in the sweltering desert.  Found this place on Yelp and went totally nervous about having my curly locks chopped for the first time since moving here from NYC.  Apparently, my worries were completely unnecessary as these stylist know their shit and wield a pair of scissors like a paintbrush.  At my last visit, Ana took super good care of me, listening to all of my requests (namely, a low-maintenence, super short cut that would play up the fact that my hair wants to do nothing else but curl), and gave me a style that I am constantly complimented on.  Adore.\n\nThe whole place smells like roses, and I leave feeling like I've been hanging out in a friend's awesome apartment rather than a salon.  Oh, and I covet the decor - COVET it.  I think the (salted caramel) icing on the cupcake is the fact that the stylists and front desk folks walk the line between professional, chill and sweet.  They get the job done, but keep you blissfully relaxed the entire time.\n\nLove love love.
