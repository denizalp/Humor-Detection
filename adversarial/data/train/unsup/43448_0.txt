Average food. Excellent service.\nI would return to the restaurant if it didn't smell like bathroom. The door to the bathroom downstairs was open the whole time we were there. If I closed it, someone would open it. No one who worked there closed the door. The smell ruined my experience. \nI don't understand how people are able to enjoy their meal, with the smell of bathroom wafting through the restaurant.
