I had the pleasure of getting skincare treatment from Angel when she was working at another spa. I was so sad when she left! After a random search on Yelp I found her name, AND she was on Groupon! I purchased the set of 3 deep cleansing facials. \n\nAngel practices out of Le Studio de Beaut√© in downtown Mesa and parking is easy to find in the lot behind the building. The studio itself is huge and has multiple chairs and different areas for your beauty needs. The facials are in a secluded little area in the back which makes for a quiet, peaceful setting. \n\nIt's always a delight talking with Angel and she is truly a master aesthetician with a wealth of knowledge about skincare and skincare products. She offers very reasonable prices and easy online booking. My skin was looking blah recently but it looked and felt like a million bucks after walking out of her studio.\n\nI've already booked my next few appointments and am looking forward to my next appointment with her!
