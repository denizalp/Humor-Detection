In the spring, they let the public witness the magic of butterfly hatching. The greenhouse is apparently home to thousands of butterflies and what a wonderful experience to actually witness the delicate insect gradually emerge out of the cocoon in a slow, fragile, but systematic process. As these magnificent creatures emerge, the wings actually appear wet and might take a few flaps to dry. This one critter eventually dried out its wings and set out to explore and landed on the ground next to us. The cute little girl next to me, then quickly stomped on it with the deliberate viciousness of a killer, and crushed it further by pivoting her little pink-shoed foot from side-to-side, to the horror of the small crowd that gathered.\n\nOn a lighter note, this is a great venue for birthdays and weddings.
