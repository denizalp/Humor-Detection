I am decidedly not a Pittsburgh native, or \"Yinzer\" as the locals would say, but my family's roots are firmly planted in Pittsburgh soil.  My trip to Primanti Brothers kicked off my first visit to Pittsburgh to see a Steelers game.  Having seen the shop on multiple TV shows and hearing all about it from my \"Yinzer\" friends, I had to try it.  It is as advertised, big, delicious, and not in the slightest bit healthy, which is just fine.  I loved the simplicity of my salami sandwich with cole slaw and french fries, it was just what I wanted and nothing I needed, and I loved it. \n\nFine dining it is not, but if you want that, you picked the wrong crowd.  Every single return trip to the Steel City (and I plan many) will include a visit to Primanti Brothers.  The atmosphere was lively (even though it was packed the night before a Steelers game), the service was friendly and prompt, and the food was delicious.  Keep this up, Primantis, you got something good going, although something tells me you already know that.
