Try to avoid this place like the plague! The big issue is understaffing and poor customer service. When you call this pharmacy, it's not uncommon to be on hold for 15 or 20 minutes, and then they just hang up the phone. The management is apparently too greedy to hire adequate staff to answer the phone. There is often a long line, both in the store and at the drive-thru.  I've dropped off prescriptions then come back repeatedly to be told they \"forgot\" to order the medication.
