I come back here so often.. I'm actually embarrassed by my amount of check in's and how many chatimes I am the duchess of.. my friends and I are here all the time because of the easy underground parking lot and the overall aesthetic of the place. I also come by myself at least once a week because I have a crazy chatime addiction.\n\nI just wanted to update this review and thank goodness all chatime workers wear name tags now (honestly I kind of think it's because of me and my huge blowup with chatime richmond hill) but every time I come here and Olivia is working the cash, she always has such a bad attitude. She seems like she wants to go home (and trust me, I know we all do, especially working in the customer service sector), but don't act like it. No matter what time of the day it is, I've never seen her smile. She's never uttered a 'thank you' and her tone is just unpleasing. Yesterday night, my friends and I were ordering and tapped a different vicinity card twice and she looked up and said in a rude monotone \"can you stop. ok.\" ... LOL, at one point, I give her props for the amount of confidence she has to be able to say that out loud to a customer, (hell, how many times have I thought that in my head when working the front desk) but on the other hand, it's pretty downright rude. I get that it's 11pm and you probably just served all of markham delicious bubbletea after their viewing of captain america, but DAMN OLIVIA. YOU NEED TO TAKE IT DOWN A THOUSAND NOTCHES. \n\nOh, and the lines are longer than the Nile river. \nBut let's be honest, I'll probably be back.
