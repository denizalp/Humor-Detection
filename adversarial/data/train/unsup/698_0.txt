I dont even know why anyone likes this place. All their meats taste exactly the same, like nasty rubber salami.\n\nAnd there was a fly in my soup.\n\nEven their commercials fucking suck. Did they really think Spongemonkeys singing the most annoying song in the world would make people want to buy sandwiches...?\n\nI'm all set with Quiznos. Thanks, but no thanks.
