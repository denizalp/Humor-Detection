I came to Adventure Pet Resort when my reservation for another dog boarding was cancelled. Jason was very accommodating and gave me full assurance that my two chihuahuas were going to be cared for properly. I am thankful to Jason and his crew for letting my dogs stay there even though I came pretty late (around 8pm) and without a reservation. \n\nI called everyday (for 3 days) to check on my dogs and was given quick updates every time about them. \n\nThe resort is clean and well maintained. On the evening that I came, they were replacing the flooring in the play area. \n\nOverall, I had a good experience letting my two pups board at the Adventure Pet Resort and will most definitely let them stay there the next time I'm in town
