I finally got to try one of the other Sweet Tomatoes locations in Las Vegas. Like all locations, this one is clean and has simple yet thoughtful decor. I enjoyed using the new frosted glasses for my beverage as well.\n\nI came with a coupon advertising chicken wraps but I guess they aren't offered at this location (it was a Souplantation coupon, the name for this restaurant chain in Southern California). Unlike Souplantation, I hear they only offer clam chowder on Fridays at Sweet Tomatoes too. The more Souplantation\/Sweet Tomatoes I go to, the more I realize that nothing can compare to the gold standard location in my hometown of Tustin.\n\nNonetheless, the food at this Sweet Tomatoes location is fresh and tasty. The value is also great and meals here are very affordable.\n\nI recommend this location and this restaurant! Parking is ample and it's also a great place for your vegetarian friends since there isn't a lot of meat served here.
