Regal Auctions is a pretty sweet place.  Whether you're looking for a top of the line car, or just something you can use for parts, they seriously have everything!\n\nI've been to Regal a handful of times now, looking to buy a car for myself, for my boyfriend, or trying to have one sold.  The people at Regal are really helpful, especially with dummies like me who don't really know how it all works.  It works exactly like an auction.  \"I've got $4000 there, do I hear $4500 anywhere?  Anywhere?  Going once... going twice... sold to the gentleman in blue for $4000!\"  It's so neat!\n\nI wouldn't mind going there just for the entertainment of it all.  Even before the cars come through for auction, you can walk around their giant yard and take a look at what's coming next, or what you've already missed.  Some of the cars come with a base price that the seller refuses to go under, but a lot of cars can sell for $100, if someone's willing to pay it.  \n\nI have experience selling a van through Regal auctions.  They took care of everything, and cut a cheque afterwards.  Obviously, Regal takes a fee, but it's not unreasonable since they're doing all the work for you.\n\nIf you need to sell a car quickly, or you just don't have time to do it yourself, Regal Auctions makes a great middleman.  They take away all the stress and drama that comes with selling (or buying) a vehicle.
