Quick and cheap but not without the third degree. \n\nI'm usually a middle of the road wash person, but the two times I have been here there is always some 18 year old one direction looking guy jamming his done inside my car trying to get to to get a monthly pass. Even worse, my girlfriend stopped here between patients to get a car wash and one of these clowns decided that talking her up and giving her his number while she was in a big rush. Can't discredit him for trying to get at a good looking lady and going way above his stage, but time and place my friend. A frantic rushed woman who just wants a car wash won't call you back. \n\nOh, both of the vaccum so used had their plastic parts fall off. I really should learn to just wash my car at home
