I was pleasantly surprised by El Campesino! I came for a late lunch and really enjoyed it. If you like Mexican food, you'll like El Campesino. Its a strip small secret in Twinsburg that has delicious food.\n\nFor starters, the menu is gigantic. Soooo many options! The prices are also super reasonable. We decided to try the chicken mole enchiladas as a starter, and wow, it could have been my whole lunch. The mole sauce had a great, sweet flavor and the enchiladas were super hearty with shredded chicken. I also had a house made sangria. It was what I expected, but I wish it would have come with a lime or a piece of fruit.\n\nFor lunch, I had the carnitas, and they were tender and juicy. It came with fresh guacamole salad, onions, rice, beans, and tortilla. All the ingredients were very fresh and colorful. The plate was literally put on the table piping hot! The service was so quick that we were genuinely surprised. We had food overload on the table, but everything was too good, so we didn't feel THAT bad. My Mom had the carne asada. I stole a bite, and the steak was nicely prepared, the seasoning was spot-on and the onions were cooked just right. Overall, the food was exactly what I was craving, even though I felt like I needed a nap afterward! El Campesino made excellent leftovers. I'll definitely be back soon.
