This is the worst Mexican food I ever tasted and the music was horrible.  What a dive.\nWent again to meet a few girlfriends.  They had already decided on this place so I really didn't have much of a choice.  We all thought the music was too loud as it competes with conversation.  We had to yell over the music.  The place is kinda GETTO if you know what I mean.  We went over to Starbucks and had coffee after so we could have a peaceful conversation.  The food was gross.
