I wanted to check out this brand new ultra lounge. I went there on Monday and Tuesday Night. I went there at 10 O'clock on Monday which they just opened. Very chill on Mondays I guess but good music!!\nI went back there the next day which was Tuesday.\nIt was really busy..lot of people, loved the rappers, live music and very good vibe!! Drinks are affordable prices and one another thing about this place is you can get Sushi\/munch with your drinks if you are hungry!\nI like this place alot..very fun but casual so if you want to party but don't wanna go to strip then you should go there to have fun for good price!
