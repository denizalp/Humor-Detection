We have stayed at the Venetian many times, but the last time has changed my mind about this hotel. Although lovely and a great location, our room was not clean when we checked in. By not clean, I mean cut toenails on the desk-yuck. And event the next day-not cleaned again.\nI answered their survey with details on the circumstances and yet, no one contacted me about the stay. Interesting\nBut for the cost, we will most likely try another close hotel from now on. Disappointing to say the least that they did not even contact me for follow up.
