There is a lot of hype for this place in the pizza they bring to the table. I love cheese as much as the next non-vegan, but this was kind of ridiculous. I took this pizza home as takeout, and when I looked at it at home there was a centimeter thick layer of cheese along the top of the pizza. The crust and sauce and toppings were all otherwise quite delicious, so I can't get past the cheese. There must have been a pound of cheese alone on this pizza. The wings on the other hand, were quite good for takeout.
