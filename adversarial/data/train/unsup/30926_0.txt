If daily taco consumption did not lead to obesity, you would find me here every single day of the week. Honesty, I have never had an unsatisfying meal here after a few years of coming here. \n\nLocation - This is located conveniently on Eastern, South of the 215. It's in the most poppin' food plaza in Henderson (in my opinion) next to Sushi Hiro, Smash Burger, and Cafe Zupas. There's plenty of parking AND seating. The restaurant is two stories and even on National Taco Day, there were open seats. \n\nFood - THERE ARE SO MANY TYPES OF FOODS HERE. If your heart desires quesadilla, they have it. Mexican corn? Got it. So many choices of meat and toppings and they even have alcoholic beverages! I usually opt for the Chicken Quesadilla w\/ guacamole and sour cream or three chicken tacos. If I'm feeling extra \"yolo\", I order the chicken fries (which are like nachos but with french fries instead of tortilla chips). All of the meat are chopped as you order it and the items are made freshly right in front of you. There's also a complimentary bar with salsa and toppings. \n\nService - As hectic as it gets, everyone tries their best to accommodate to everyone while remaining friendly. It's kind of a weird system where you get into different lines to order certain food items, but it's efficient (when other customers aren't scattered and cutting). \n\nI would highly, highly recommend coming here to fulfill your Mexican food needs. I always leave with a happy tummy!
