So I went back to La Bocca. Didn't enjoy my last experience - the service or the food - but with all the other positive Yelp reviews out there, I decided to give them another chance. And I'm glad I did. Because this time was better. Not awesome, but definitely better. Up from two stars to three.\n\nLast time I ordered the seafood pizza, which was Gross, which I didn't even see on the menu anymore. Hmmm... wonder what happened there.\n\nThis time I ordered the Oven Roasted Shrimp and Pesto Sandwich, which was quite tasty. Kind of tasted like bruschetta actually, but with pesto and shrimp. Which was fine with me - I love bruschetta. Bread was lightly toasted, shrimp were plump and juicy. Choice of sides included cole slaw, couscous and chips. I got the chips, and they weren't bad, just your basic restaurant potato chips. My friend ordered the Turkey & Brie Sandwich with the couscous. She enjoyed the sandwich, but not the couscous so much. It was served cold, which I don't think she was expecting.\n\nService was definitely better this trip - friendlier and much more efficient. We were in and out in about an hour. Weird thing was we were the only ones there. I mean, I know it's Monday, but still - only one table between 11 & 12? That can't be good.
