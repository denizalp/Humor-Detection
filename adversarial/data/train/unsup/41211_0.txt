Made a special trip to Nordstrom with my daughter and her 3 small children to get a pair of Clarks' women's shoes that we had seen on the Nordstrom's website. Were very disappointed to find out that they do not carry any Clarks' shoes in their store and that you can only get them online (I wish their website had stated that!). \nIt has been years since I have been in this store. Apart from the Scottsdale ultra high prices, I always found the layout of this store to be confusing and a little disorienting. Since this store is located at Scottsdale Fashion Square, parking can be a real nightmare. Additionally, Nordstrom is across the street from the main mall. We crossed Camelback at ground level since that is where we parked, but they also have a bridge that connects to mall at the upper level. \nIt will probably be a number of years more before I attempt another visit to this store and I will probably call ahead to see if a web advertised item is actually in the store or just available online.
