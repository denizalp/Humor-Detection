I took a business associate of mine to lunch here earlier this week. We came in around noon and the place was nearly deserted, 2 maybe 3 tables occupied...WOW! Our server was attentive and friendly but the food wasn't like I remember it being. Everything was good but NOTHING was GREAT. I will say this though...if your hungry, you won't find bigger portions anywhere. My friend ordered the chicken fried chicken and it would have dwarfed TWO regular sized dinner plates, it damn near hid the platters they use as plates. Come hungry but maybe wait for dinner...the steaks on the Menu looked good but also like way too much food for lunch.
