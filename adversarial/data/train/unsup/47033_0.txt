A friend of mine got me hooked on this restaraunt. It has amazing margaritas (3 bucks on thursdays!). I loove the Mango one, my new fave.The food is also very good. I absolutely love the chicken chimichangas and the mexican rice is very good. However, their deserts leave something to be desired, I got the brownie pie desert and it wasn't as amazing as it sounded. I still go there for the food and the awesome drinks! A Queen Street Must!
