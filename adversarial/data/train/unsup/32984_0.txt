I'm a fan of Rock Lobster, my first time at this location (Ossington).  We had made reservations for Summerlicious, but was not found on the list, we were able to get a table but was time limited.\n\nFood:  The food was fresh (as per usual) but I found the portions were smaller for Summerlicious.  We had the Lobster Taco, Lobster Roll and Whale Tail (which was a disappointment). Aside from the summerlicious menu, we also ordered a Lobster Poutine, Lobster Mac n' Cheese and a Lobster Ceasar drink....all were to die for and super yummy.\n\nAtmosphere: This location is very small and quaint, does not have an outer part or patio..like the other location. \n\nOverall: I would probably go again, but not during the Summerlicious rush.
