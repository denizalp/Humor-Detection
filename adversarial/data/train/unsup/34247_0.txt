Here's the deal with this place... Dr. Paris is amazing. He is very knowledgeable and explains everything he is doing. He takes his time and is very throughout. He doesn't just ask A or B A or B over and over again. \nThe reason it only gets 3 stars is the front of office staff. They have no clue what they are doing and they don't seem to want to know what they are doing. Along with their lack of knowledge is a typical pushy sales attitude. \nGet your eyes checked here and then buy your glasses somewhere else.
