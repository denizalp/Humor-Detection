Disclaimer: This review is for the experience of TRYING to eat here, NOT for the food! But trying to go to a restaurant--particularly when you are on a vacation or a Staycation--may be almost as important as eating, itself.\n\nWent by Buddy's early in the day (in late morning), to look into dining later that night. I immediately LOVED the decor, and homey, yet elegant look. The awning, wood floors and red checkered table cloths go well together, and it feels like you are in South Street Seaport in New York.\n\nBut, the hostess was useless, and had little to tell me that morning.  She was not friendly. She seemed more interested in dancing by herself to the tune that was playing. (They play good music there). So, I just decided to return later that night with my dinner companion. \n\nWell, that was a mess. Now, for the first time that evening (at around 6:15pm), I learn that we needed reservations, and that the wait was 45 minutes to an hour, which we were not willing to do on our schedule.  And again, the hostess was super useless. She did not apologize for the wait, or invite us to sit at the bar (which was empty), nor did she explain why there was such a lengthy wait when we could clearly see that there were at least 4 or 5 apparently empty tables in the foreground. Instead, she made it seem like we were complete fools for not having reservations.  Not a good tactic with your prospective customers.  \n\nAnd I have a pet peeve of restaurant hostesses dressed like they are headed to a trashy nightclub.  Does not fit the family vibe that Buddy's seems to be going for (especially with the quaintly named dishes after family relatives, such as Aunties and Grandma).\n\nThe bakery across from the restaurant seems much better run and friendly! \n\nI might return, but it will take a while and maybe some convincing.
