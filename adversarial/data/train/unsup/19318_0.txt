4 words sum this up...\"AWESOME REVERSE HAPPY HOUR!\"\n\nThis quaint cafe is a perfect spot for some amazing late night food and drinks. The joint itself has a eclectic feel to it. A house converted into a restaurant, this isnt your modern, upscale eatery...but more like a visit to your favorite aunt's home for a scrumptious meal. \n\nWe came here late Saturday night and decided to try the reverse happy hour which is served only at the bar located on the second and third floors. The first floor is for the more regular fine dining experience. The way the reverse happy hour works is that they have selected drinks and small plates costing $3- $6. The menu I am told changes on a regular basis. \n\nWe started off with the moscow mule and the cabernet both top notch. For our main meal we did the hummus platter, goat cheese, veg taco, burger and the fried calamari. We wrapped up dinner with the bread pudding. Our meal was perfect! All the food tasted great. My favorite was the goat cheese and the veg burger. The goat cheese with the sweet tomato sauce in my opinion was the perfect sweet and salty balance. The bread pudding...not on the happy hour menu... was pretty good though i have had better. \n\nOur bartender\/server was an absolute pleasure! He was entertaining, knowledgable about the food and made some great recommendations. We ordered a drink (not from the happy hour menu) and it was not added to our final bill. When we brought it to his notice he chose to not go back and add it and gave it to us on the house.....to me customer service does not get better than this! \n\nThe cafe has some great outdoor and indoor seating options and if you are in the bar area you can move freely between both. \n\nOverall: A great experience....A must try for anyone in the Cleveland area!
