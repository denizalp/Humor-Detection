Wow my 4th city taking a city brew tour and they STILL have not disappointed.  same great experience as in every other city, but they really captured the spirit of Pittsburgh (our guide even let us listen to the pens game on the radio!!).  the breweries and beer was amazing, and we met several of the owners! VIP WOO HOO!!!! There was SO MUCH FOOD and it was all super tasty, I'm still full!!! Our guide, Alexa was super knowledgable and really funny.  We had a great time.  Cannot wait until they come to another city, we will be sure to visit as soon as they do!
