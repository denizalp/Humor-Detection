This was our second time ordering from Barros.. First time was wings and pasta which was cooked to perfection.. This time around we decided on pizza..which we are very picky about.. However this pizza was superb! The sauce was amazing an abundance of toppings and super cheesy..we often order thin crust but went with the traditional crust and it did not disappoint.. It was baked perfectly and very flavorful. We will definitely be ordering our pizzas from Barros for now on!!
