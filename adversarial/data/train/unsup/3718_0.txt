Im with Evelyn on this one...whats with all the Haterade towards this Noodle Bar? Sure you pay an arm and a leg for ramen....sure parking is a hassle to find....sure you feel like you need a Platinum credit card to eat here.... but DAMN its Good Ramen!!\n\nI came here with my brother from out of town and we had Kinton Ramen 1 the night before and Momfuko Noodle bar for lunch so we had some ample comparisons.\n\nWe ordered the Momofuku Ramen and the chicken Ramen. We also ordered the BBQ pork and Pork Belly Buns.... and Yes our bill came out to $84 for 3 ppl but HEY... its Momofuku and the broth is nice and fresh. Service is great, quick, and efficient and the atmosphere is really cool.  Personally I like this Ramen better than Kinton and Im not even a Ramen fanboy.... my go to noodle is Pho but this Ramen is worth it.\n\nStop the haterade on Momo and feed your Tomagachi some Ramen!
