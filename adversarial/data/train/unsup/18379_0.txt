Why is everyone so rude in their service department? When I pulled up to service I sat there for 20 minutes with all the service people staring at me. After being ignored I walked in the building telling them like hey I need a 30000 mile service on my genesis. One of the guys yelled at me asking what was I doing and why didn't I wait for a guy in a blue shirt. I said I sat there for 20 minutes and you guys stared at me. After being passed around 3 times to 3 different people the manager Andrew wasn't friendly at all and made me feel like a burden for being there and said its 400$ and takes 3 hours and then that's it. No one was friendly and everyone was rude to me. \n\nThey also didn't give me a rebate on my battery because their batteries obviously die out. \n\nThere was so service manager I could talk to cause he wasn't there. Seriously screw this place.
