Dr. Keller is an expert at what he does.  He can come across as if he is a bit uncaring, but at the end of the day he truly wants what is best for his patients.  Where his bedside manner is lacking, he surely makes up with his excellent staff.  Especially Nurse Fischer who always delivers great care with a smile.  \n   In my case, I went for a double knee replacement but split the operations into two evens.  In both cases I was treated well, encouraged to move soon after the procedure and experienced no infection or ill effects.  I did more than was required of me in physical therapy and I have healed very quickly and \"exceptionally well\" because of it.  Thanks Dr. Keller!
