THE OFF-THE-STRIP STRIP\nThe $12 T-bone dinner or the $10 Senior's menu are legendary kitsch. After much research to find the best experience I ended up at Ellis Island which delivered an appropriately seedy experience.\n\nA CIGARETTE INFUSED VALUE\nThe good is that I had a big side salad, acceptable 12oz chicken fried steak and cream gravy, huge scoop of garlic green beans and a pint of their craft draft beer: $13.53. I just wish I knew how it tasted because the place is packed with aggressive chain smokers that laced my food in nicotine.
