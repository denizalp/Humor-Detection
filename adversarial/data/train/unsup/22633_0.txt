(McCormick Ranch location) \n\nI signed up for the 2-week trial and then bought a package. I give 5 stars to Lynn, an instructor who told me a) it's often difficult for the first 3 months, and b) once you break through the resistance, you will start craving hot yoga. I found it amusing to think that I could actually *crave* exercise, but lo and behold, both of her prophesies came true. \n\nPros: This is not a Bikram studio, so if you like hot yoga but are bored with the same old same old, this studio can mix it up a little. Most of the instructors I had were amiable and the other students were quite welcoming. The women's room has 2 good-sized showers and provides a lovely shampoo, conditioner, blow dryer, etc.\n\nCons: The studio itself is very echo-y and it can make it hard to hear the commands. And sometimes instructors will put on loud music during the class, rendering it impossible to hear the instructor. However, as long as at least one person around you knows what they're doing, the teacher could be speaking in Swahili and you'd have no problems following along.\n\nThe -1 star comes from an unfortunate occasion I had to be privy to...I think the instructor thought everyone else was gone after a particular class, and he proceeded to rip someone at the front desk a new butthole. He screamed at this person (colleague? employee? class attendee?) for ten full minutes at the top of his lungs, blaming and shaming the poor soul like there was no tomorrow. Whether it was deserved or not, I really wish I hadn't heard that.
