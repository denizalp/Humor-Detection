I'll take a pass\n\nMcDonalds has been in the business of serving food for a very long time and their service is usually fast, friendly, accurate, and the food hot and fresh. However, on my last  visit that wasn't the case, actually the last several visits, have been less than favorable. On this particular visit the food was not fresh or hot.\n\nThe burger patties at McDonalds aren't thick, however, the onion, pickle, mustard, and bun usually makeup for it. However, this time I just wanted a hot fresh plain hamburger. What I received was a dried, burnt, piece of meat that looked like it was extremely old and NO amount of condiments would have made this food taste good. \n\nIf this is the first time I experienced poor service and food I would write it off. However, this is by far the first time, needless say, I will never come back to this McDonalds again.
