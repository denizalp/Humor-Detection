I would give this place a NEGATIVE 10 if possible!!!! \n\nThe GF and I went in a couple of weeks ago to look at their portfolios and check out a new shop. When we walk in the door we see one artist working and 3 others standing around. Not one person said a word to us. We sat down on their couch and started looking at their portfolios. One of the artists walked within 5 feet of us several different times and ignored us every time. Everyone else made their way past us at some point and they ignored us as well. From the portfolios there seems to be some good work but nothing that compares to some of the better shops in town.\n\nWe were there for a total of about 15 mins and NOT ONE PERSON SAID A SINGLE WORD TO US. They all seemed stuck up and as if they could care less about us ( potential customers ). Maybe we were the Living Dead and they couldn't see us. Who knows. They were pricks. \n\nAvoid this place at all costs.
