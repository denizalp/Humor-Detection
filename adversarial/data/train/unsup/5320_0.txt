They make a fantastic chicken biryani. Very flavourful, and significant quantity. Then there is the price... $5 for a meal that size and that good is quite the steal. \n\nThe place is very bare bones though, and I would not recommend eating in; they microwave the food in styrofoam containers. Recommend doing take away, and enjoying their great biryani at home.
