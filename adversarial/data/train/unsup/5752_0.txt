On one beautiful evening this summer, I joined my brother's family and the parents on a walk to Paramount new location. We were seated almost immediately and the staff was kind to accommodate the large party and provide the space for two strollers. \n \nWhat followed was a sequence of everything a restaurant should NOT do, food was served at random intervals, we had to deal with many not several, yes tons of waiters and waitresses. It was is annoying that we have to repeat our orders to the new waiter or waitress, everyone of those waiters and waitresses then will walk and have a brief Conversation with a guy wearing  a top white T-shirt who seems in charge.\n\nWe had to constantly ask for missing food items and we finally received the missing orders we were socked by the poor quality of food and taste. The grilled chicken felt it was reheated several times in a microwave and had unpleasant smell, the burger was grilled on a volcano see photo. I wasted time and money going to that place I'm done wasting time describing my experience. The team who is running that restaurant should not hold any job.\n\nParamount you deserve a zero star. For talking your local community for granted. Too bad there is a lack of competition.
