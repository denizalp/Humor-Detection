Hands down a top notch place for quality honest work. If you want to know what is really going on with your car and don't want to be ripped off then bring it to Leroys! We brought our '68 mustang here and not only were they a pleasure to do business with, they were fast and accurate with their estimates which is not easy to do on an older car.
