Um how am I the FtR on this superpopular store? Maybe it's that they moved 4 blocks along Queen Street last summer and folks are still posting on the original location? \n\nThe store is gorgeous! And the staff was super helpful. I've never been able to wear Fluevogs because I thought they didn't go down to my size. Well in there actual shops they go down to size 5 which their partners don't usually stock. So I am a proud owner of my first pair! I bought a re-issue of a classic and have a pair of truth pilgrims...LOVE.\n\nThe staff was great and now I can't wait to visit my home store.
