I made an order for delivery on a Sunday evening and I was not impressed. I requested no lettuce on one of my subs and it was obvious they put lettuce on it and then tried to pick it off.  The bread was soggy as well.  The cookies I received were paper thin and the peanut butter cookie had a very weird taste to it.  I'm not sure I'll try this place again.
