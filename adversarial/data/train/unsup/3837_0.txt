Impressed on so many levels with this stashed-away gem in Phoenix. I had heard of Richardson's, and for my friend's going away\/belated birthday dinner, he requested that we go to Richardson's \"other restaurant.\"\n\nLike any good yelper I checked its profile out and the peoples' who's opinions and tastes I've come to trust had me sold on it. A subsequent AOL City Guide review page was less than inspiring - complaints about them closing the upstairs dining area and diners who were less-than-impressed with the menu - they (the AOLers) came off sounding like snobs in their reviews, anyway, so I didn't let it bum me out, but I wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nBased on the price range and what I'd heard, I was prepared for a 40s-60s married couple crowd and elegant\/traditional dcor that would appeal to that demographic; this assumption was further believed when we pulled up and saw those exact couples leaving the parking lot.\n\nHowever, we drove up (complimentary valet is required) and went thru a wooden door into a stone stair chamber (seriously, it felt like a secret passageway in a castle) to another wooden door that opens into the bar area (I was assured on the phone when I made reservations about three days ahead of time for the Sat night that we would get a table, or you can wait for a table or belly up at the bar to eat).\n\nAnyway, the crowd was very up-and-coming (for reals, not like Scottsdale mall Kona Grill happy hour, \"I'm in real estate\" up-and-comers) late 20s to late 30s crowd, the flat screen TV behind the bar was playing ESPN and the Cure (!) was playing...I was in love. It was still white table cloth and wood accents nice, but the subtle, muted tv and just high enough music volume were enough to make it seem more like a bar than a stuffy restaurant. \n\nI was told it was Dutch-inspired (so executed by the Dutch impressionist works all over the walls) but the food is basic \"new American\" grill faire. New twists on old favorites...along with favorites basic mashed potatoes (except these come out souflee style), bacon-wrapped scallops, prime rib ($32) and Chilean sea bass ($28? $34?) (all of which we ordered, and ate, and it was all excellent).\n\nWe also got a bottle of wine for $25 - not bad. That was one of the least expensive ones, it goes up to the $200s from there. Oh, we also had crme brulee (divine, freshly made with real vanilla bean and served cold, not hot) and coffee to top it all off. Whew! We were pretty drunk, very full and very, very happy with our experience. (the music selection also continued to impress, surprise me - The Killers, Morrissey\n\nOh! I can't forget the server...he was professional (not snobby), knowledgeable and helpful - he will give you his honest opinion on which dishes he likes and doesn't.\n \nOh! And, for a higher-dollar establishment, I was very happy to see they didn't try to charge for every little thing - for $32 I got a salt and pepper encrusted prime rib, the giant side of mashed potatoes, asparagus and a salad (you even get to choose from four specialty salads); a steal, really.\n\nOk, I'm done gushing. If you want a romantic dining spot, this works. If you want a nicer place to grab drinks with people who will appreciate the menu, the ambiance can't be beat.
