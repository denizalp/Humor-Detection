I have five kids...... five. Let that sink in. \nDentist trips for us have always been a hell ride for us. \nAnd this trip has been the most painless one yet. No waiting, no nothing. And they scheduled us perfectly. Receptionists right up to the doctor himself is AMAZING. We are so happy to have found this gem here.
