Is this a mall or is this an airport? Why not both? With more shopping airside than I've seen in a long while, PIT is a pretty good destination if you have a layover. A lot less layovers lately since US Airways decided to de-hub this place, but still, it's pretty cool.\n\nI love airports where you can walk to the rental car garage. That's a big plus for me.\n\nThe only thing that's not five stars is that it's a solid twenty miles from the airport to downtown and the traffic is hit-or-miss.
