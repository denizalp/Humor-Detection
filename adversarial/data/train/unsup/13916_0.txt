The prime rib would've brought me to my knees if I hadn't been sitting down.  I almost passed out from the blissful experience that was happening in my mouth.  Best piece of meat I've ever had in my LIFE and I am a friggin carnivore.  I had 2 servings of this shit and would've had more if I hadn't already devoured 7 plates of everything else.  Seriously, I'll be dreaming about the prime rib every day until the next time I make my way out here.\n\nThe creme brulee is amazing also.  I should've stuffed a hundred of these in my purse before I left but my mind was too preoccupied with trying not to let my stomach explode out of my butt.
