I need them to open a location in San Diego so I can eat their paninis all. the. time.  Also, the Mixed Green Salad, while \"basic\" was one of the best salads I have ever had. The combination of flavors with the fruits and crispy leeks was perfection. And my Chicken & Mozzarella panini was as fresh as it gets and just straight up yummy. The crispy ciabatta, the soft cheese - all so good! It's definitely a scene; we were there in a leisurely Sunday afternoon and it was packed and loud, but I get it - delish!!
