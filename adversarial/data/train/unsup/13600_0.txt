Have you ever grown intellectually without really being able to explain why? Like, you're sitting in your car listening to a CD you've heard 100 times before but this time you really listen and all of a sudden you find your shirt is tear spackled and your left and right ventricles and probably also your right atrium feel like they're twice the size from just 10 minutes before and the additional centimeter diameter expansion is not enough to make up for the disparity in the intensity of the beating. \n\nOr you read a book in high school honors English and wrote what your teacher described as the \"perfect five paragraph essay\" on its themes and then read it again years later, only to discover that you were ONLY a really good regurgitator of others' opinions but that now you finally can internalize the meanings because of your experiences over the last 13 years. \n\nWelcome to Sidebar, the Greatest Lounge in Phoenix. \n\nThe movies, bartenders, color schemes, imbibers, music, and lighting make this place a real contender. There is a bit of PHX douchebagginess that is very, very different than Scottsdale douchbachery but overall the place is rad. And my socks, one fateful evening, almost perfectly matched the ottoman.
