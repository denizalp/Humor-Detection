This is a great little crepe stand inside of the Paris. I've probably had about half of the crepes they have on the menu and they're all good. \n\nMy favorites are the Breakfast Crepe, the Monte Cristo, and the Bananas Foster. The Breakfast is perfect for something savory, the Monte Cristo is a sweet\/savory combo, and the Bananas Foster is great for dessert. \n\nWhile this is relatively fast since you order at the counter, it's definitely not fast food speed. You may have to wait a while to get your food, especially if the line is long. The line tends to get long around 9-10 so get there early if you don't want to wait. \n\nThis is one of my go to stops for breakfast when I'm in Vegas!
