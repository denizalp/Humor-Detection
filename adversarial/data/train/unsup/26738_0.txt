This place is wonderful. \nThe staff is so friendly and I am never disappointed in the quality of food. \nMy favorite is the #11 with everything! \nWe come here maybe twice a week (or try to) since the prices are fantastic for their portions. \nIf you're looking for good pho, come here. I'm so happy that we found this place!
