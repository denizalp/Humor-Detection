Seen a whole wave of posts recently about their mont blanc... a fan of chestnut desserts myself I decided to see what it was all about.\n\nAtmosphere was very welcoming and calm,  although a bit on the small side. Owners were also very friendly. I've been to this place twice for take out and both times their display was nearly empty... which makes me curious what their full menu looks like. \n\nSuggestion: if you are coming here for their mont blanc, call ahead to confirm if they have it or not. A lot of the times they are sold out. And for a good reason - they are awesomeness. You'll find layers and layers of craftsmenship and goodness to this dessert, which explains their price. The chestnut flavour is also very rich yet not overly heavy. Must try for all the chestnut lovers out there. Period.\n\nSide note, however. As with any cafe and patisseries, Duo offers the ever popular macaron. Personally, i found them to be a bit firm for the filling part; almost made me wonder if they were over refrigerated, but the flavours were pretty spot on to their name.\n\nAll in all, mont blanc is a must try!
