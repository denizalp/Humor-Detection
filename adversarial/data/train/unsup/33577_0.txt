I guess it's just me...\n\nWhy is it soooooo hard to find a car dealer that is honest and trustworthy???\n\nUnlike restaurants, which I will normally give 3 strikes (unless they are bad the first time in, then forget it); car dealers only get 1 strike, and 1 chance to make things right.\n\nI am very big on preventative maintenance.  A car is a big purchase, and I want to make sure that is lasts until I'm ready to get rid of it; and that it's always ready and able to go when I get in it.  It's not only a safety issue for me, but a peace of mind issue knowing my family's vehicles are maintained and ready to go.\n\nWith that said, we have a 2010 Toyota Highlander Hybrid that we purchased new in May of 2011.  We didn't care for the service at the purchasing dealer, so we decided to try Right Toyota, it's around the corner from my wife's office; so it's very convenient.\n\nWe have been happy with their service for the past almost 5 years we have been going there; up until last week that is.\n\nWe have spent several thousand dollars at this dealership on service and maintenance.  Oil changes every 5K miles, tire rotations (up until the last set purchased at Costco), timing belt, complete fluid change at 100K miles, spark plugs, etc...\n\nInstead of repeating this past weeks problem, I will just paste the e-mail I sent to John Jones the Service Director below.  The e-mail was sent on Friday, July 15th.\n\n\n\nGood afternoon Mr. Jones, \n \nLast night, my wife called to tell me that she had trouble starting her 2010 \nToyota Highlander Hybrid.   When she first hit the start button, the brake pedal \nsank a little bit and the brake warning light came.  She shut the car completely \noff and restarted it as normal; and it ran fine all the way home.  I told her \nthat we would keep a close watch on it, and get it to the service department if \nit happened again. \n \nThis morning, I went out to start her car for her; and experienced the same \nissue she had last night. I decided to check the battery, as I recalled this \nhappening the last time the battery needed to be replaced.  The first picture \nbelow is what I found when I removed the vent caps.  All six cells were bone \ndry. Luckily, I had distilled water available in topped off all the cells.  The \ncar then started with no issues at all. \n \nMy reason for contacting you is that we have all our service (except for the \nfirst oil change) on this vehicle done at Right Toyota. As a matter of fact \npictures 2 and 3 are from the invoice dated June 9, 2016. The invoice states \nthat the tech not only topped off the fluids but that he checked the battery \ncondition and the battery state of health the last two of which are marked green \nwhich indicates checked and OK at this time. Looking at the first photo you can \nsee the amount of dirt and grit around the cells of the battery. It looks like \nthe battery has not been checked since it was put in in August 2014. \n \nWe have spent a lot of money at your dealership. Oil changes, tires, complete \nfluid changes, timing belt, and spark plugs. I expect better service than this, \nif something is marked as being checked and fluids have been checked and filled; \nthen the battery should not be bone dry and look as if it has never been \ntouched.  XXX XXXXXXX is our service advisor, and we have both been very happy \nwith with him and the service we have received. \n \nI don't know if this is a tech not doing their job correctly, or if this is a \nstandard practice of Right Toyota's service department; but I wanted you to be \naware of this.  Lucky for my wife, she works just around the corner from your \ndealership. I would not be happy if she was unable to start the car and was left \nstranded in a less desirable part of town, especially in this heat. \n \nI look forward to hearing back from you. \n \n \nThank you for your time, \n \nRon HXXX\nXXX-XXX-XXXX\nXXXXXXXX@XXX.XXX \n\n\n\nNote, I edited out my last name, phone number, e-mail, and my service advisor's name.\n\nWhen my wife came home from work early Friday afternoon, she told me she had received a call from a gentleman named Frank at Right Toyota and he wanted to speak with us.  For some reason, he called my wife's cell phone, and not mine, the one listed on the e-mail.  I called Frank back and left a voicemail.  I have not heard back from Frank, John Jones, my service advisor, or anyone else at Right Toyota.\n\nI feel that Right Toyota owes us a new battery; since they neglected to check the one currently in the vehicle over the last 23 months, even though the service invoice from them always shows that the battery was checked and that all fluids were checked.  \n\nI take people and businesses at their word.  If you tell me that something has been done, I expect it to be done.  If you tell me that something has been done, and it hasn't; I expect you to make it \"Right\".\n\nSo, if there is a Toyota dealer or independent service shop that is honest, trustworthy, and reliable, give me a shout, and I'll give you a chance.
