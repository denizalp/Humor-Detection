Went on Sunday for the pool party.\n\nPrice - $50 for guys, even if staying @ hotel. We got a cabana however. It was really nice with a big couch, safe, tv, and fan. There was a $4,000 minimum tab for the cabana, and only 10 people are allowed to have a bracelet allowing them in. You can bring friends or girls up to the cabana with you if you walk them up through security.\n\n**FYI -- the cabana girls will try to UPSELL you. we ordered a bottle of tequila and they brought out the best (read: MOST EXPENSIVE) bottle and our thoughtless friend ok'd it without thinking.....it was $1,450!!!! As Napoleon Dynamite would say......idiot....god!!\n\nThe scene at the pool was good, plenty of attractive women for the eyes to enjoy, not a trashy scene like some pool parties are. \n\nOn a bad note there were a whole bunch of Joey Boombatzs and Paulie Guidos who looked like they were in the locker room with McGwire and Sosa in '98 shootin up the roids. At that point I felt like I never left New Jersey. I wish I had pictures, but if you've been to DJais in Belmar you know what I mean.\n\nSummin it up - If you have $$$$ to spend, get a cabana, get grey goose and champagne, get a tan, and enjoy the Sunday.
