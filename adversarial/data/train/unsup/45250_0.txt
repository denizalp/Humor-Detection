Just don't go there. They may give you some else than you want to have.\n\nI was one that used to go there at least once a month.  (The only reason I go there is because there is no sushi place near my place.) I had a terrible experience there last time, and I never go since then. What happens is that tempura sauce (basically, soybean sauce) they gave tastes like Sake, so I told the waitress the sauce tastes strange. What she told me is that it is fine, but she took it and gave a new one, which tastes fine. I asked what happens, and she said nothing and the previous one was not different from the new one. They claimed that they make the sauce every day so that they cannot be different. Thus I asked her to bring the old one and she said it is already poured out. I felt something fishy about it, because they taste totally different not only to me but also to my friend, and I am pretty sure what the tempura sauce tastes like. She suddenly came to us and suggested some discount because of it although they think there is nothing wrong with food. \n\nYou might guess what possible can happen in their kitchen.....\n\nBy the way, their service is quite poor. The waitress is very lazy. I think it is because Osaka' house owner is her father(, which I heard from her, and I have no idea why she told us that) You also can find their tables are not clean enough to get served.
