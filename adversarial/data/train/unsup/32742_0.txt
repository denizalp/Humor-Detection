Not worth the money.  The clams, oysters etc didn't look fresh and were imbedded with crushed ice.  It was a hassle to dig the ice out of the clams.  I had a couple of clams that didnt taste quite right, probably why my stomach hated me later.  The lobster they advertise is a joke.  How is even legal to harvest such SMALL lobsters.  They chop it into pieces and cook it with some shrimp.  Most of it was overcooked.  The other hot food was just ok.  On par with a 14.99 buffet or somthing, not a $40 buffet.  The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the Gelato for dessert was pretty good.  They had an interesting assortment of flavors.  Get the \"elvis\".  It's good.  For a good seafood buffet stick with the Wynn Buffet.  Pre-split King Crab legs and better overall food\/desserts.
