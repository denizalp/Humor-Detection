I'd driven by here several times but kept on driving because the lines were outrageously long. We finally drove by around noon on a weekday and the line only had a few people in it so we decided to check it out. As soon as we got in line a huge crowd of people came in and, just like that, the line was out the door. \n\nAt the moment I ordered, there were only 2 staff members in front - the cashier and 1 person making the drinks. With as many people in line as there were, they should've had more staff working the front to make the drinks. From order time to receiving our order took about 20-25 minutes for 2 drinks. \n\nSpeaking of our drinks, we ordered 2 split cups - 1st one had Thai tea with boba and lychee crush and the 2nd had strawberry horchata and peach blossom. I love that they muddle the fresh fruit for the fruit drinks. The chunks of fruit in each sip were really refreshing. Both the lychee crush and peach blossom were light and not terribly sweet. They'd be great on a hot summer day. The strawberry horchata had the nice cinnamon flavor and paired really well with the strawberry. The Thai tea was pretty standard Thai tea and the boba was cooked just right. \n\nThey've just opened so I'm sure they're trying to figure out staffing. Once the hype slows down and the lines aren't as bad, I'm sure I'll be here more often.
