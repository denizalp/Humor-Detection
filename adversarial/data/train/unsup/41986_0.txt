It's just okay. The first time I visited, Cafe Zupas had  just opened and the food and service were pretty good. It wasn't excellent, but pretty good. I went back after awhile and the sandwiches were soggy, the soup was watery, and the service was slow. The employees obviously didn't want to be there.\n\nThe lemonade is delicious, so if you go, get a big cup of it. It's probably the best thing there.
