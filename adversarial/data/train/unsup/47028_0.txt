Food is pretty good... prices are extremely reasonable! The staff isn't the friendliest but everything else about the restaurant overlooks the bad attitude given from staff. It's still five stars! I go there to order 20 bucks of food (often good portions) and then pay another 10 bucks for a Beijing roadted duck, which is often cooked pretty well. I've been to this restaurant more than 10 times and still counting! The most attractive things about this restaurant is that the soup they serve you before your meal is free and really good, and that they also offer free dessert. Anyway, I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for southern chinese food!
