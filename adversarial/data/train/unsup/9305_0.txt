Stayed here 2 years ago and the room was HORRIBLE! The room was what you might expect from a Red Roof Inn or worse, AND IT SMELLED! \n\nFast forward to this year. Decided since it's under new ownership and so convenient to the convention center that give it another try.  Their website boasts about their new \"signature room\".  Well, I will say the room was nicer than the one 2 years ago, but that's not hard to do considering it was the worst room I'd ever stayed in! At least they got rid of the smell. \n\nThey have a keurig coffee maker which is nice but I didn't notice until the 3rd day that the nice sealed little coffee cup kit had a sticker on it that said they CHARGE your room $3.50 for each cup!!! What hotel charges you for in room coffee??? \n\nAs for the facilities- EVERY employee I encountered from bartender to cocktail waitress to dealer felt like they came from the bottom of the hiring pool. My friend and I joked that the staff here must have been the ones that no one else would hire! One cocktail waitress had to be almost 80 yrs old! Koodos to her for still working at her age but it was painful to watch! My friend and I couldn't wait to go to the hotels at the strip to actually have some fun. \n\nNever again. Next convention I'm taking taxis to the convention center and staying at a real hotel.
