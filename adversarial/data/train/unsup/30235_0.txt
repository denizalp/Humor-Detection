Littlefish is our go-to brunch spot close to home, and is where we bring all of our out of town visitors. \nThe food here is fantastic. And fresh. Always. \nMy go-to is Jenn's choice, but I've also had the daily scramble and the pancakes (get them with bacon!). You will not be disappointed with their fresh squeezed juices. Every option seems to be based off of a simple dish, but done with a bit of a twist. The lemony-hollondaise has a zing to it that I haven't found elsewhere.\nWe did try the homemade sausage on our last visit, but unfortunately it was served cold.\nThe atmosphere is great - not too big, and not too loud. Make sure you bring a jacket if you use the bathroom downstairs in the winter - it's freezing down there!\nOverall, Littlefish is awesome - and we'll definitely be back soon!
