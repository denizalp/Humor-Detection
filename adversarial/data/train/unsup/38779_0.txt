When it comes to food I give this buffet a 4 star.\n\nThey have a wide variety of food, the crab (unlike these other yelp reviews) was delicious not frozen normal hahahah.\n\nThe food was all high quality, good prime rib, everything was good, maybe great.\n\nNOW! the reason they gave me a 5 star, cause it was my b-day and the staff (yes buffet staff) and the people inside in the buffet all were singing happy B-day hahahahaha.\n\nHow many buffets do you really get that warm, cozy b-day feeling? \n\n\nHere at Cravings.
