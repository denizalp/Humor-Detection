Neg stars. Don't go 2 sch here! Wanted 1\/2\" roots-only lighter color & left w\/ 3ft yellow hair! I Q AIPs following industry Best Practices & Aveda standards. I would've never trusted a student, but I sure trusted the wrong EDUCATOR. Their Aveda Certified Educator, Color Specialist, 2014 Inspire Greatness Aveda Institute Champion combo cosmetology TEAM LEAD (TL) did not follow verbal or written instructions that I provided her & student (S). Plus, she formulated unorthodox chemicals for someone w\/ my coloring. Even AVEDA CORP said she should've known better.\n\nAdjust contrast\/brightness of your monitor N order 2 C the true colors of my pix. As per AIP, the .pdf\/evidence of my instructions keeps being deleted from YELP.\n\nI said 2x to ea & wrote once \"Apply color to new growth only.\" They put color 4.5\" past my 1\/2\" of new growth. I said I wanted 2 go 1- 2 shades lighter than my standard Aveda formula I have used for 6 years: 30 vol 60g of Deep 10N @ 45 mins. The written instructions also said, \"Do not use foils, pull through, or use a gloss.\" This formula & method provided me with an earthy honey blond. B\/c I wore my hair in the same braid @ all my outdoorsy jobs, my hair looked like multi-toned whipped honey peppered w\/ sparkly platinum streaks.\n\nTL formulated: 40 vol 60g of Deep 12N @ 45 min w\/ shower cap.\n\nMy crown turned POLAR BEAR WHITE (PBW). In response, TL, who teaches blonding classes, said, \"I didn't expect this to be so light. Sometimes this happens. Blondes are hard.\" Then TL said she'd fix it.\n\nTL formulated: 40g 0N + 40g 10N + 1g  Lite Yellow Orange + 40mL of CTA.\n\nUnfortunately, TL & S coated all my hair--not just the white part. TL tried 2 dilute the mistake-not fix it. This wasn't prudent. FINAL RESULT: my crown was monochromatic yet streaky ELECTRIC BUTTER YELLOW & the rest of my normally glossy multi-d sun-kissed honey blond hair was DULL, DRY shades of homogeneous STRAW YELLOW w\/ PUMPKIN ORANGE tones. My entire head was a color mullet in shades of Crayola Crayons. And this was the \"fixed\" version?\n\nWhen I got really upset, an older blond mgr told me to come back in 2-3 days after my hair calmed down for a FREE color correction. At 1st, I accepted. I had been there for 5 hours & was exhausted, hungry, & so very much wanted it to be fixable. But, after all my research, I realized how egregious the mistakes were & wasn't going to subject myself to a 2nd multi-mistake incident.  There was no way my hair or I could handle a 3rd trauma. She's THE BEST of THE BEST--and this is what happened??? I stopped my cc payment the following week, &  AIP did not contest it.\n\nI learned, much later, from Aveda Educators around the country, Color Specialists in the valley, & Aveda Corp, 40 vol is used on people with black\/choco, coarse, & thick hair who want 2 go platinum or Crayola-colored. (I have naturally dark-blond, fine hair; fair, yellow-toned skin; and dark green eyes. How could she not notice this?) She used one of the lightest possible Lift-Color-Methods: 40vol\/Deep 12N\/Shower cap.\n\n1-2 shades lighter is literally changing only Deep 10N to Deep 11N or 12N--not changing the volume, especially together with color, and most especially w\/n the Deep line. Deep already has extra vol\/lift contained in it. Adding a shower cap on top of all the extra changes is baffling. A Color Specialist noted that 1-2 shades lighter could be achieved by just adding foils 2 the original formula I've used for yrs or rinsing out @ 30 mins instead of 45 mins. Also, CTA= gloss, & professionals never tone 3ft-long blond hair.\n\nThe TL should have never bumped me up to 40 vol, especially w\/shower cap. This is significant b\/c I asked her, as we looked at my written formula & instructions, if she could only change 1 number, which would it be, & she responded that she wouldn't; she'd change BOTH!!!! I also discovered that TL was NOT S's official Educator. (I'm not sure if TL took over my hair b\/c she wanted to experiment w\/ it, but it's hard NOT to consider this her true motive.)\n\nThe formula TL used on my already-blond hair caused 5 levels of lift (not 1-2 shades), which explains the PBW. She stripped my crown of all color by highlighting my whole head, & even bleached my scalp. It flaked & itched. If she didn't expect my hair to turn white, then, tell me, WHAT COLOR DID SHE EXPECT IT TO TURN?\n\nTheir TL does not truly understand blonding or Deep. This will take me 6 years to grow out permanently altered & damaged hair and about $1K to patch up. This color service set me back K's 4 time, gas, both corrective & blue\/purpl products; & they're not paying me back. Now, I have hi maintenance hair & may have 2 cut short it in the future d\/t drynessI can't speak for other Educators at this institute, but I can speak for the TL, & seriously question AIPs adherence to industry Best Practices, Aveda superior standards, & basic ethics. AIP is sneaky, dishonest, & not BBB accredited\n\nSee hidden reviews! \n\n09\/2017: Cut 8\" due to fried ends
