This place is a skip, hop and a jump down the street from my house, so to say that I had high hopes for this place would be a massive understatement. I walked in and was digging the ambiance: the bar was full of people, the decor was simple and the windows were all fogged up on a cold night: good start. The beer selection would have pleased some off-island, cars-up-on-blocks kind of people, but I made do and ordered myself a pint of something ghetto. The food, here is why I am only giving the place 2 stars. No pub that I have heard of does tapas so I was already a bit put off: you're either ghetto or high end, not both. Portions were small, we were charged for things and quantities that we did not order and everything tasted like half a salt shaker was used in it's preparation, shame, cause I really wanted to like this place.\n\nI would however come back for a drink, but food, not until I hear they improve.
