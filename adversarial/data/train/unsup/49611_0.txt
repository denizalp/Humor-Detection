I went with two others and ordered the oysters, calamari and linguini with clams and red sauce. Portions are well-sized. The oysters weren't amazingly fresh, but they were on the larger size and not bad. The calamari was average. I highly recommend the linguini! The sauce was savory and broth-y, and the calms were fresh. \n\nService was great. Our waiter Alfredo was really friendly and very attentive to our needs. It's a small restaurant in the South Point hotel, but we went on a weekday night and there was no wait to sit at the bar. The place seems pretty popular so I would imagine there would be a wait on the weekends. \n\nThere are great lunch specials ($7.95?) with half off oysters and calms.
