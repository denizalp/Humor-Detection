My experience at this Denny's was one of the best I have ever had.  Parking was easy to find and our wait to be seated was very short.  We were about to come home from a long few days in Las Vegas, and we wanted to eat as quickly as possible and then be on our way.\n\nOur server was very good, and much friendlier than most of the staff that I have encountered at other Denny's.  I ordered the \"Build Your Own Grand Slam\" with pancakes, bacon, sausage and hash browns.  Our waitress asked me if I wanted strawberries on my pancakes, and I emphatically said \"Yes, and with whipped cream too!\"  My friend joked to her if she could put a smiley face on my pancakes.  To my surprise, my pancakes actually did come out with a smiley face!  I had never seen this done before and thought it was pretty cool!  I also added onions and peppers to my hash browns for 50 cents more, and they were superb.  I can't remember ever having a meal at Denny's that was this good before.  Everything was tasty, and I was really happy that we stopped here.\n\nAs we were leaving, I saw that it was much more crowded.  I'm sure this Denny's location gets really packed at peak times since it is on the strip.  I would not mind eating here again the next time I am in Las Vegas, but I can't imagine the experience being any better than it was this past weekend when we visited.
