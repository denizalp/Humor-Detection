I've been here once for an all girls birthday dinner! It's definitely a whole in the wall spot, but cute and small. I always order Pad Thai at every Thai spot since everyone makes theirs different. So I gave it a try and it was great! (4\/5) \n\nThey have great staff & were attentive and accommodating enough to take pictures of our whole group who took the whole middle row of tables. Haha\n\nOverall, will come back and recommend again!
