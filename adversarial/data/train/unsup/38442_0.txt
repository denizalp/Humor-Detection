I must say I was very disappointed. The event was very unorganized and vendors were unprepared for the amount of traffic. I was expecting a more organized event, similar to the Scottsdale Culinary Festival due to the fact the Taco Fest has been running a for a few years now and assumed these kinks would have been worked out...\n\nA Few Tips: \n1. Buy your tickets in advance. We bought ours online through their FB page about 30min before we went. That saved us an hour of waiting in the line for people buying tickets at the door. \n2. Bring cash. They do not have credit card POS system to purchase tolkens. ATMs are available, but the lines are long and there is a $3.95 service fee. \n3. Wear comfy shoes as the lines for everything are ridiculously long. Ex. Lines to order tacos and another line to pick up. Specifically, all the taco stands when you immediately enter the event all the way to the tequila tent. There are no signs telling you this, so make sure to ask so you don't waste your time standing in the wrong line. (And all this waiting ensures you will have a what-could-have-been tasty cold taco waiting for you upon pick up)\n4. Trash cans are limited, seats are hard to comeby and napkins are no where to be found. So make sure you don't order too much at once. Trying to carry all that food\/drink, while trying to eat at the same time will cause a mess. \n*On a side note...It was raining on and off throughout the day. I cannot imagine the mess that would have ensued if the weather was better....
