I gotta say... it is an odd place.\n\nHistory:\nMobsters need a place to launder money, so they build crap in the desert.  Too much crap.\n\nThe crap gets cheesy.  REALLY CHEESY.\n\nThen Steve Wynn comes into a failing mobster town... (this is a bit simplistic to say the least) and watches the town failing because the bottom line is *all of a sudden* really, really, really important... because there is no endless cash through illegal activities.  All the buffets, clubs, performances... once a silly, trite amenity are now the total business model.  And what was once becoming a disneyland town in the 90's is now sitting reinvented by Wynn as a world class place for the world to come and find the finest of everything.... \n\n\nbut it isn't.  It is an awkward pain in the middle of stopped construction going through tremendous growing pains and fantastic infrastructure problems.  Hotels have a price point about 30% anything I have ever seen..... and all this because the lack of the fine old illegal funds coupled with this world class nonsense... you have one of the most ridiculously overrated, overhyped, and overpriced town in the world.\n\nIt is fun with the right people... or person.  It is a blast.  It can be naughty, it can be romantic....\n\nbut it will always be depressingly, emasculatingly expensive... smokey enough to ruin suits, and a massive show of classless troglodytes yammering at tables, begging at slot machines, and mindlessly ambling, slack jawed, dazed, lost, and totally oblivious.\n\nI am always the latter.
