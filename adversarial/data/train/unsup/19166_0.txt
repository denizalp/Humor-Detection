Every year, my dad and my brothers travel to different part of North America and rent Harleys for a 3-4 day ride. This year it was Southern Utah and we rented 4 bikes from Eagle Rider in Vegas. \n\nOne of the bikes had an ECU error that prevented it from accelerating past 10mph. It did it once in Utah and once again 10 miles from Eagle Rider on the return day. Riding the narrow shoulder of the 15 highway at 10mph almost ended up in my being rear ended multiple times.\n\nMy expectations were simple: the bike had a serious issue and a significant portion of the rental should be refunded.\n\nThe response of ER could not be worse. They denied I reported the issue from the road (I did). They denied the problem existed (I demonstrated it for their check in guy) and they refused to discuss any compensation beyond 10% of the rental.\n\nTo anyone looking to rent a Harley (einschliesslich die Deutschen die so viele Motorr√§der von dieser Firme mieten), take my advice and look elsewhere.
