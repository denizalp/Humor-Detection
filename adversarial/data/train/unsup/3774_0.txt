This place is overrated.  The staff is nice the hotdogs are way overpriced for what you get.  They offer a variety of different hotdogs.  I have tried three of the the different beef hotdogs they offer and they were just ok.  I can get most of the hotdogs they offer in the supermarket.  My hotdogs were also not served hot.
