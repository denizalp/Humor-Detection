Cox, you've got a long way to go.  I had Comcast back east and I used to gripe about them.  They are lookin' pretty good right about now and I would switch to them in a heartbeat if they were available.\n\nYour cable:\n\n  *the guide scroll is poorly formatted and can be difficult to read\n\n  *I had On Demand with Comcast over 2 years ago.  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Hello, how long has Cox been asleep at the controls?  Hello?  Cox, are you in there?\n\n  *I had better service, more channel selection and On Demand for less than I am paying now\n\n  *When the digital tiles and we do reach someone we have been told more than once-\"No, it's not tiling.\"  and \"Just unplug it and try again.  Anything else?\"\n\nYour cable Internet:\n\n  *again, you fall far short of Comcast.\n\n  *your Cox.net homepage pretty much sucks\n\n  *Cox.net homepage is not very user friendly\n\n  *downloads and videos were faster and smoother with Comcast\n\n  *Comcast let you customize your homepage\n\n  *Cox.net e-mail program bites\n\nYour service & tech support:\n\n  *service center personnel are poorly trained.  I had to make four trips to the service center.  Four trips at my expense because you gave me the wrong equipment once, twice, three times a F%@$-UP.  \n\n  *Phone tech support has been entirely hit or miss.  Odds are about 50\/50 you'll get someone that has any idea what they are talking about.\n\n  *Tech support has banker's hours-or almost.  Comcast had 24\/7-really.  Not the \"24\/7\" tech support you advertise but no-one is available when you call.\n\n  *Your billing department is rude.  Period.\n\nYour phone service:\n\n  *again, you do not measure up\n\n\n\nIn short-you have a monopoly right now and that's the only reason there is not an exodus of customers to other providers.
