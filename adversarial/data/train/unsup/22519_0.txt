It was a very good experience walking through this mall. They have a lot of shops that you can check out, and a good fraction of them are very high end! Considering I was on a college budget at the time I went, I didn't feel like spending my money on anything here. The decorations and architectures of this mall looked really nice! My favorite shops here were Nike, H&M, Sony, and Apple. \n\nThis place gets crowded a lot. Make sure you hold onto your belongings carefully when venturing through the crowds, as I noticed some of the people in the crowds looked a little suspicious...\n\nWell, enjoy looking around!
