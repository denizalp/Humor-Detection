When in the area of Rancho and 95, and don't want to get out of your vehicle, this is the lair of the corporate titan is for you.  I have been somewhat obsessed with \"Dirty Chai\" lately.  This has caused me to reload my SB app.  The morning I rolled in to this particular location, I dare I say.......needed a triple dirty.  I also wanted to bring coffee in for my team.  Rolling into the parking lot, there was approximately 4 other vehicles ahead of me.  This would normally stress me out.  However, the cars flowed through the drive-thru just as smoothly as the espresso flowing inside.  When I picked up the goods, I was greeted with a smile some pleasantries and off I went.
