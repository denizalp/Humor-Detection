I would have given 3 stars except the fact that their Internet service was so slow I couldn't even open my email account while staying here for work. When I called to check on it they said there was nothing they could do. What? It's 2013. Not 1983. I would never stay here again. We thankfully got our rates on Priceline but I would never pay over 70 dollars a night for this place. And if you need Internet so you can do you work don't stay here at all.
