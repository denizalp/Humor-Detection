I have lost hope in the possibility of finding excellent Mexican food in the burgh. I have given this place at least three shots to make it to the top of my list but  another Mexican joint just didn't cut it for me. The service has always been great and I wouldn't be surprised if the drinks are excellent but the food doesn't cut it for me. I'm not from Mexico but I want authentic Mexican food not some cheesy gloppy mess covered with guacamole. Or a flaming skewer of shrimp and beef??? I had the Mar y tierra which is apparently one of the house specialties I'm surprised that this is one of the dishes that the server told me was their most popular. The presentation of the flaming skewer is nothing less than cheesy. And then to top it off the shrimp and beef were COLD after all that. Will someone explain the physics of that fiasco to me. The decor is okay and location is in market square which stinks for parking. If I'm missing something here someone please set me straight but I can't say that I would ever recommend this place for even drinks.
