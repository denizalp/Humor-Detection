Got my car washed at Desert Car Wash for the first time and it probably will be my last. No greeting when I pulled up to the car wash entrance. There's still Christmas decorations sprayed on the front & back doors. It's January 28, the holidays are over, time to take them off. \nAlso there was no soap in the bathroom, I was going to the cashier but he left to go outside. Additionally, there is expired Cheetos on the shelf. \n\nOverall on the $29.99 car wash it was ok, nothing special.
