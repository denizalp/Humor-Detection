Stopped by here twice and satisfied of their food. Both times ordered Southwest Caesar (kale, romaine, radishes, pico de gallo, chickpeas, carrots, pepper jack cheese and tortilla strips) with chicken and beef as added protein, served with Poblano Caesar dressing. Pretty generous portion and tasted good. This place also offers wraps and smoothies. Quick and friendly service even when it's busy. Will go back and try other type of salads and wraps.
