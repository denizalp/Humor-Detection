As a fan of DDD we've been dying to try this place. We don't often visit the strip but we were already near by so we stopped by. They don't take reservations so when we arrived we were told there was a 25 minute wait. We waited. The host was supposed to text us after seating was available but we never were notified so we walked up after waiting and were seated right away. \n\nFrom the wait we expected it to be busy. Half the seats were empty and some staff members were just standing around. We were pleasantly greeted after we sat down.\n\nI ordered the Mac and cheese burger and husband ordered fireball whiskey wings with a side of truffle fries. Food took a while to get to us but we were slightly distracted by the spicy bloody Mary's. Very very good! \n\nMy burger was huge and delicious along with the truffle fries. Burger was a little runny. The wings were satisfactory but did not live up to the menu description.\n\nDefinitely worth a second trip for a better experience and more bloody Mary's. They have a brunch we need to check out.
