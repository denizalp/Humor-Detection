Its great to see a alternative to Panera Bread popping up around town. \n\nSome friends and I decided to stop by Zupas not too long ago and it was a pretty good experience. The food offerings are simply a variety of salads, soups and flatbread panini sandwiches. There are tons of options and virtually anything can be customized. Quality wise the food has always been fresh and step above similar fast food spots. The chicken tortilla soup, pulled pork sandwich and bbq ranch chicken salad have been consistent crowd pleasers.  \n\nEvery meal comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry which can contribute as to why this place is so popular with the ladies. The menu rotates seasonally so there is plenty of variety and reason to come in regularly. I did notice the portions are pretty small, I could easily eat two of their paninis in one sitting. Also Zupas is closed on Sunday which I found out the hard way so diners beware. Overall a pretty decent experience and worth a second trip.
