We decided to give this Milestones a second chance after our disastrous visit 3 month ago.  It was like night and day from the previous visit.  The server was attentive and got all our orders correct.  The good was served at appropriate time limit and was hot and delicious.  Our experience improved 100%.  I am glad that my we went back to give this place another try.
