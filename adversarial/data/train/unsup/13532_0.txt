They NEVER showed up to our house and never made a phone call... I left numerous messages and they failed to return them. I paid the service before hand and they scammed us!! We are very giving and accommodating people.. They took all my credit card and security code Info. I was preparing for a baby shower and they left us high and dry. I cannot believe it!!! wtf!! Now I'm worried they are scamming us completely.
