Had a great server, Christin, who made a big difference in our dining experience. Started with the bacon old-fashioned, couldn't detect the bacon but liked the drink and the whiskey used. Brisket biscuits were ok, thought they would be more fluffy and buttery. Brisket was cold which was unexpected. Chicken and waffles with watermelon - the best fried chicken we've had. The collard greens side was a special and really delicious. They packed up leftovers nicely and even put the syrup container inside a cup to prevent spilling.
