Why did I wait so long to come back here!?  I first came here during their soft opening and really enjoyed the food.  So when my friend suggested another restaurant in the area, I suggested we go to Hop Social since she had never been.  We looked at the menu and decided to split the Strawberry Pear Apple Salad and the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger.  When ordering we told the waitress that we were going to split the meals.  Now normally this means that we get extra plates.  We we received our meals they were actually split in half.  Each of us received a plate with half a burger and some fries, and a small salad in a bowl (which looked beautiful!).  \n\nOur waitress was friendly, checked up on us regularly and our glasses were never empty!  I'm not going to wait so long to go back!
