I would stay away from this place; wait times are long with appointments, plan to wait 20 minutes past your wait time before your called back. And their billing dept. is horrible, I made my copay still received a bill for what was covered by my insurance. So if you like arguing with billing departments regarding your account this is the place for you otherwise, I would find somewhere else.
