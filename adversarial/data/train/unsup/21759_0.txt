The ice cream rolls that hits the flavor notes in your tastebuds! I tried the banana cream pie flavored ice cream roll, it was decadent and rich. There is a menu available or request a flavor that you want to get made. \n\nNino (owner), I had a chance to talk to him about on how he came about the business. He told his story that he saw a video on YouTube, that's what he wanted to do. And he opened the first ice cream roll business in Phoenix. What a nice person to converse about the possibilities  on the different flavor ideas that he has for ice cream rolls. Definitely, I am coming back to satisfy my sweet tooth!
