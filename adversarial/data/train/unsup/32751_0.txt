As the employees here are very nice, I will never go back there to get my nails done. I have got my mani pedi from them multiple times. Each time the gel nail chips and comes off in less than a week, the polish on my toes comes off. And my latest experience is the way he cut my toe nail it gave me a terrible in grown and infected my toe and I had to go to the doctors for it. I do not recommend this place.
