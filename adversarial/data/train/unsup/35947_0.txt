Took my 27 month old boy for his first haircut. They did a wonderful job, Rosa was great. I was nervous about how they would be able to handle a very squirmy\/active 2 yr and worried about him screaming and fighting the whole time. No need to worry, Rosa was a pro, she put him in the racecar seat, put on his  favorite movie, Cars, and showed\/let him touch every tool she used on him. She did a great job of keeping him distracted, and wow, is she a fast cutter.  Oh, and his hair looks good, too.
