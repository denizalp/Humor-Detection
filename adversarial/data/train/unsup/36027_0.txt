I've been to Bluebird several times over the past few years since I work so close to Market Square. Sadly after my experience today I won't be back. This morning I stopped in for oatmeal and a coffee and had to ask one of the employees to take my order. Apparently she was taking a phone order but never told me that. I told her what I wanted and waited patiently while she continued to talk on the phone. \n\nMore people came in and other workers took their orders. After about 5-10 minutes I became frustrated and told another employee how long I had been waiting and then left. \n\nThis is not the first time I've experienced bad customer service at Bluebird. Most of the workers are rude and unfriendly.
