O Face Doughnuts is located Downtown and the parking is terrible. The outside of this place didn't even look like a doughnut shop and looked closed. After finding out that is was open I started looking over the doughnuts. They were no signs on the doughnuts so I had no idea what was what and they were on top of each other with icing melting down probably because it was HOT inside. I had 2 different people helping me which was confusing for us all and after I got home I noticed that I only got 5 of the 6 doughnuts I paid for. Almost $14 later and I only have 5 doughnuts? The doughnuts looked sad and tasted worse. I had a cinnamon toast crunch doughnut that smelled foul on the inside and the chocolate doughnut I chose not to eat since there was fingerprints in the icing. I didn't enjoy nor finish any of the doughnuts I got from here. There are far better mom and pop shops around town to mess with coming back here.
