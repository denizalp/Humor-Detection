Don't be fooled by the sign or strip mall location, this place has the best Thai in town (any town really). Had the pineapple red curry with coconut rice and it was amazing! Also tried the peanut curry, which was equally as good. For apps we ordered the Crab Rangoon and pumpkin soup both were yummy and just the right size. Happy to have this hidden gem in port credit, only wish I had discovered this place sooner...
