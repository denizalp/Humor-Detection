I ordered some food to go. Chicken fingers and a french dip. When we got there my husband noticed they had made us chicken wings instead of fingers. They said they would make the fingers right away it would be 10 minutes. (I was waiting in the car) I told my husband to go back inside and let them know they would have to  have to remake everything because our fries will be soggy as well as the bread on my french dip in 10 minutes (plus driving home time). When he went inside to let them know they told him they were able to give him some fingers someone else had ordered and sent us on our way. The French dip is meat on bread. Absolutely no seasoning what so ever. The ajus tastes like warm oily water. There was no taste at all. I wasnt impressed with the chicken fingers either. Inside they were very dry not a lot of meat. Overall not worth $20. I won't eat there again. The fries were good as well as the ranch.
