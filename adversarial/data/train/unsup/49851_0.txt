Rent is high considering apartments are outdated and water bill is always $60-$80\/month. Playground needs updated. A lot of cats use the sand as their litter box. \n\nA lot of families\/kids live here which is nice since I have 2 of my own. \n\nMaintenance crew deserve 5 stars. Out to fix anything within 48 hours, and same day if emergency.
