At later dinner on a Friday night... the place was very dirty (floors), but I figured they must have had a heck of an earlier service, so I was encouraged that they have a good following.\n\nI ordered fried flounder and french fries, with a side of slaw.  The fish was fishy and the batter was so hard, I could't cut it with my fork!!!  The fries were fishy, too! EW!\n\nHubby got chicken and dumplings.  It was salty and slimy with very little chicken (both in quantity and size of chunks, they weren't chunks, really).\n\nSon got a giant burger, and it satisfied him.  I tried a bite, it seemed like a GFS frozen patty, to accompany his GFS french fries.\n\nOverall impression, this is a re-heat and serve place, which is how they can offer the cheap pricing that they do... not that they buy wholesome fresh base items, that aren't expensive to begin with, and cook those.\n\nIf this is fresh cooking, then this is an alternate universe, where everything is backwards.
