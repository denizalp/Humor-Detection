A great place for guys to get haircuts in Chambana. They have a big HD flatscreen on ESPN and totally run with the whole 'garage' motif. I have been to similar concepts in other places (there is a chain that decorates the place like a locker room, and another called State Street up in Chicago that goes old-timey) but this place is 100% local and has an innovative offering that delivers good value. Clutch's offers a whole bunch of a la carte 'manly' services, if you consider neck and nostril waxing and mint scalp rubs manly. They also do shaves. \n\nThey also serve beer out of a cooler that looks like a toolbox. Bud Light and Bud Diesel. Nothing better than a domestic lager in the middle of the day. It is a bit awkward to sneak sips in while fur is flying, but its better than not drinking beer.\n\nI just got the $20 shampoo cut and style, and was pretty happy with the result. I think the quality of the hair cut I got was nearly on par with trips to Ippatsu and almost as good as H20, but for half the price. They take appointments, but I walked in.\n\nOh yeah, one last thing that is probably worth mentioning: the hairstylists are hot. They dress the part too. So there's that.
