There aren't many options for breakfast or even brunch on a Tuesday morning which resulted in my visit. Flury's is cute spot with pleasant customer service. The food was delicious and at a very reasonable cost. I had a egg sandwich with hash browns while my husband had chorizo & eggs with hash browns. Both were fresh and simply good. We need to keep these type of business in business so I'd definitely go back!
