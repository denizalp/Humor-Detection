This place is absolutely disgusting.  From the stained carpet to the food that was all previously frozen to the terrible service experienced when going to this place.  Their hamburgers have the consistency of a leather shoe.  I will never be dining here ever again and would suggest that if you actually care what you out into your body that you stay far way from the food at this place.
