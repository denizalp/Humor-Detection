For $15 (plus gratuity) its a pretty good cut.  I've only had one bad experience where I wasn't really happy and now I know who to avoid.  The last time I was in the guy was meticulous.  For a minute I thought he was going to cut every hair on my head individually.  Just when I thought he was done, nope, it still took 10 more minutes.  I'd rather sit for a few minutes for perfection than leave with a just ok cut.\n\nNOTE: They don't take debit but they have an ATM if you don't mid paying the service fee.
