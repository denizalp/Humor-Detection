Terminal 3 at Pearson International Airport is truly one of the most poorly run, inefficient and disorderly airports I have ever been to - and I have flown in and out of airports in developing nations Myanmar, Mali, Senegal, small towns in Indonesia, among others. Staff are few and far between and are too overworked to provide any direction, passengers have no idea where to go or what's going on. And long lines winding together through poorly space are endless. Truly unfathomable and disappointing for a city like Toronto.
