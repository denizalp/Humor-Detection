Phat Phrank's has been on my 'To Do List' for a very long time.  I had a meeting on the other side of town and had to pass by the Decatur & 215 exit on the way home around lunchtime, so I decided to finally give Phat Phrank's a try.\n\nSince I'm on my Lent 'No Meat' diet, I was browsing the menu for Meatless items.  The man behind the register asked me if he could help out....I told him my situation and he was very happy to help me decide what to get.  He suggested a Cheese Enchilada ($6.99).\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA?select=diO_EDsbajdUCPr988G3Ng\nI went with his suggestion and also added a Bean & Cheese Burrito ($4.29) for good measure.....ha!\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA?select=ufDngqGNAIWOrMqXuAzvng\n\nHe chatted me up while ringing up my order and I discovered he was Phrank, the owner.  He's such a cool guy.  He's from So Cal and we were talking a bit about the State as I'm also a So Cal transplant.....although I left many years before he did.\n\nAfter a few minutes he brought out my order.  I was pleased to see that the Cheese Enchilada also came with a side of Rice & Beans....although it meant that I ordered too much food.  Sometimes my stomach tricks me into these situations.  Oh well.\n\nI went for the Cheese Enchilada first....and yum!  It was very, very good.  I'm glad Phrank suggested it to me.  Next up was the Burrito.....unfortunately, after all of the flavor from the Enchilada, the Burrito tasted just OK.  For a Bean Burrito though, it was solid.  Next time I'm going to order just one or the other.\n\nI'll have to come back after Lent so I can try out some of the other signature dishes.  If they're as good as the Cheese Enchilada, I'll be back a lot.\n\nReturn Factor - 97%
