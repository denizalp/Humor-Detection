I've been coming here for a few years and I always have a great experience. I never feel rushed. The nail techs are kind and do a great job. I've had a bad polish job here once, and it was fixed before I left. \n\nSome nail salons are loud and hectic, but Belle's is a great place to relax and visit with your girls. Prices are reasonable and drinks are free. Always happy.
