Spend the extra $5 and go somewhere else! I don't get my nails done too often so my standards are extremely low but man, not this low. My friends actually laughed at the results. I asked for a squoval shape but some of my nails have a sharp edge on one side and squoval on another. Sides weren't colored and nails were going over my natural nail onto the skin. Then they tried to charge me $10 to remove the crappy job. While I was in there another girl was complaining about her nails too.
