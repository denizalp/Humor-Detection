The decor is bit outdated.  If you go early evening during the summer, there is no way to escape the blazing sun, which I am sure becomes a beautiful view at other hours of the day\/early evening.  The waiter was young, a little inexperienced, but well-trained to cater to the retirement crowd (affordable fine dining).  The portions were huge, the menu was interesting, but the execution was terrible.  The chicken cutlet was burnt and covered up by an excessive amount of cheese.  The veal francata was drowned in butter.  It was inedible.  When the waiter asked why it wasn't eaten, we politely told him about the butter.  He informed the chef, who completed the sentence when the waiter started to say the dish had too much butter.  Although he informed us that he followed up, there was no offer to remove from our check (we didn't ask either).  We will not return to Vic's.  We asked to meet the owner and everyone was covert about his whereabouts.  If I were him, I would spend more time teaching the chef the recipes and updating the place.  Unless they feel that they have a captive audience of retirees and do not need younger people like us to frequent the establishment.  Of course, with the heavy-handed amounts of butter and cheese, the youngest of arteries won't hold up long enough to return.
