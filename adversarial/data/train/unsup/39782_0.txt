Tracy Riggs is the truth! Tracy understands that going natural...doesn't mean looking unpolished. Her technique is beyond measure and her haircare line is revolutionary. Tracy taught me that you don't need a whole bunch of products in your hair to achieve your desired results. I got a custom cut and color, and all I get is compliments. She is a one woman show so appointments don't come easy....but she is so worth it. Go to schedulicty and sign up and make your appointment that way.
