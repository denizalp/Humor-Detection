A friend and I came in for a quick lunch. The service is better than most standard Asian joints...however, I wasn't impressed with their food. Mediocre at best, we both had pho (seafood and beef) the broth was awful it was so lacking in flavor. Service was good tho. The ambience\/decor was definitely better than most Asian restaurants. Probably won't eat there again.
