I went to Vegas for my 21st and rented a 2bd\/2bth suite. It was amazing! We had groceries delivered for free, and anything we needed was promptly delivered to our room. Although I would have liked two adjoining suites, we had two side by side, where we could close the main doors and leave each bedroom door open, with a foyer type area. Over all, I enjoyed my stay at the Signature, and am glad I booked through Las Vegas Suites.
