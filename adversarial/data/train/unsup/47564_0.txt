Went for an anniversary dinner. Had their clam linguini and ordered their white shark pizzA. The pizza was as good as the ones you buy frozen in my opinion. But the pasta was very tasty. They were so nice to give us a complimentary dessert which was amazing. Banana cheesecake with coconut Ice cream on top. Will go back for the service.
