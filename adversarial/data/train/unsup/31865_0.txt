To my surprise.  This place was line up out the door at 8pm.  Host told us table for two would be 50-55 minute wait.  We figured we would wait instead of going to another location. The wait ended up being only 30 minutes.   I ordered the seafood feast with lobster. Crab legs. And two types of shrimp. For 33 dollars. And a fish taco with fries.  They give very little fries. But I guess it was just enough.  After eating all the food. It just hit the spot.   It was what you would expect. Boiled seafood dipped in butter.  Maybe it's just me. But I much prefer the Asian way of making lobster.
