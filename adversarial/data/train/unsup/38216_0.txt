Our experience was dissapointing.   The wait staff was not very responsive, our food was just OK and the menu selection was too creative without the basics that we were expecting.   For example, our kids just wanted some basic tacos and there were none on the kids' menu, we had to order them some appetizers to share instead.    The prices are pretty high for what you get and the food was just OK.   Other than the fact that is was convenient in the Mandalay Bay which is where we were staying, I would opt for something else next time.
