I have to say, this is my favorite Starbucks location, and the reason for that is entirely, the staff. They are the most cheery and efficient crew I've ever encountered.\n\nOften during the day, they are utterly mobbed with customers. Yet they keep them moving along speedily, yet never feeling rushed. \n\nI'm stunned that, with as many people as they deal with per day, they manage to remember so many names and orders. I want some of whatever vitamins they're taking!
