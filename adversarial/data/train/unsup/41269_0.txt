It's not Europe, It's not Puerto Rico, it's not any of the exotic islands I've visited down in the Caribbean........but I'm still a fan.\n\nPeople asked me if I liked Vegas, I told them I do.  I could never live here though.  The city is like a plastic dollhouse.  It's fake, but it's nice looking.  You want it to be real, but you know deep down what it really is.\n\nAfter all that, I'm still a big fan and can't wait to go back.
