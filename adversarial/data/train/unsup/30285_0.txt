To my surprise I haven't reviewed Olive & Ivy yet! I've only been for lunch and it's a solid choice in the area. Olive and Ivy is on my top three picks of Sam Fox restaurants. True Food comes in first place, followed by Wild Flower and then the lovely Olive & Ivy! \n\nLike all Sam Fox concepts, the menu has plenty of options. I love a giant salad and they do that well here! But before you dig into the menu make sure to say yes to the complimentary focaccia with pesto sauce. It's zingy and delicious! Really, it's pesto perfection. The Greek MediterreAnean Salad will not disappoint. A giant bowl with cous cous, feta, almonds, tomatoes with an oregano vinaigrette, add shrimp! Or, you can add chicken. The hummus plate is a great starter and perfect to share. Not in to salads? Fear not. Sandwiches, pasta, and savory entrees make up the rest of the menu. \n\nThey offer something for everyone no matter what time of day you stop by. In addition to the main restaurant you pick up goods on the go at the market place. Smoothies too! Olive & Ivy seems to always be busy so expect a wait or call ahead!
