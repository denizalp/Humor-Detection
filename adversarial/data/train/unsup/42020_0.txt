This restaurant was located along gates E and I had just enough time to go back to the restaurant to place a TO-GO order.  I got the Chicken Swiss Sandwich with fries.\nThe fries were so good as I craved something salty on the plane prior to getting off.  The waitress talked quickly and placed my order but I started to wonder how long it would be to put it together as time was ticking.\nShe gave me my glass of water to enjoy while I waited but asked for it in a to-go cup.  She returned with the cup only to flip it over across the bar onto the bar stool next to me.  Had it wet my clothes, it would have been a bad night.  She rudely threw the a wet cloth from behind the counter to her co-worker who was cleaning but very disrespectful.  Did I want to leave a tip!?  There isn't any ketchup packs so you have to disperse it onto your plate.\nAnyhow, I got my order and had time to eat a couple fries before departing (food welcome on charter plane).  The fries were good but the chicken was a little dry.  The bacon was okay because it was breaking apart and not really crispy.  I was so glad I had this meal because the plane returned to the airport to stay overnight due to the fog at my final destination.  The meal lasted me all night.
