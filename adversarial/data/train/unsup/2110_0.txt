This place is a total gem. Not only is the wine list robust, but the food will knock your socks right off. Being that my party is non-french speaking, the waiter went through the entire (daily) menu and translated every last word for us with a smile. Homeslice was informed and tres helpful. What more could you ask for? Oh, red snapper ceviche with strawberries and sour creme as an appitizer and  Veal Tar-Tar with a Red Wasabi sauce for an entree? Yeah...they have that too. Believe the hype, folks. Believe. The. Hype.
