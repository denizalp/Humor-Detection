Good Indian food not great.  Came in on a Saturday night, was craving Indian.  Not busy at all.  (Never a great sign).  The samosas were the best in town, piping hot with a great filling that was redolent of spicies and not super mild like some other restaurants.  The lamb korma and chicken tikka masala were okay.  For some reason it didn't pop for me.  It had nothing to do with the spiciness level, it was just missing that extra pop you get from a truly great curry.  I don't know if the spices hadn't been freshly toasted, or if it was lacking a crucial pinch of love that day, but I wasn't feeling it.  I left full but not quite satiated of my Indian food fix.  And the quest for the best chicken tikka masala in town continues....(oh I should mention the interior of the restaurant is beautiful, the service good, but the prices a little steep for my taste)
