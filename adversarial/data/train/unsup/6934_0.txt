every time i find a hairstylist i like, that knows how to cut and texturize short hair, they move away from me. i'm starting to feel diseased.\n\ni went and saw aubriel nearly a year ago, random, spur of the moment type thing after i got out of class. she did a fantastic job. it was $60 which was the reason i never came back, because i really don't think it's fair to have to pay that much for such short hair you know? guys get my same haircut for significantly less, and it's only because they have a dick between their legs. \n\nwell, i needed another haircut really bad and aubriel was the only one i could think of and that i trusted to give me a nice cut. i got 20% off for booking a \"last minute\" appointment, so the haircut was only $44. reasonable. the aveda products are great, they all smell fantastic, and i got a nice cleaned up haircut, plus everyone inside was amazing and friendly. i love the look of the salon with the high ceilings and giant windows, it makes me feel like i'm in NYC getting a celebrity style cut. way to go mood swings!
