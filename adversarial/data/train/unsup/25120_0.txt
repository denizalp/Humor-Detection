We were big fans of Oceana in NYC when Chef Moonen owned it. So we decided to enjoy his wonderful seafood in Vegas. Made a reservation for the upstairs dining room. Arrived at the reception podium and was blatantly ignored for an unreasonable amount of time, others were there and ignored also. Then we were mumbled to, we assumed we were to follow the mumbler \/ seater. We weren't heading upstairs... I stopped mid-restaurant and finally the seater turned around so I could ask about our upstairs reservation. We were then told the upstairs was being remodeled and the restaurant wad changing to a more casual environment on both floors. I asked to see a menu and was told I'd have to sit at the able for a waiter to bring a menu. Huh!!! Why did the reservation system ask you to specify which dining experience you wanted? Maybe if we hadn't planned on a nice dinner, and gotten such uncaring customer service, we would have tried the food. But we left, went to Wolfgang Puck's Lupo and has a fantastic meal.\n\nThis upstairs restaurant has now been relaunched in a new concept.
