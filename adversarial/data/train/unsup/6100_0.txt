I had the worst sushi in my entire life here.  It was disgusting and when I tried to ask for my money back they refused.  Terrible customer service.  Do not waste your money on the sushi here.  I have been to other Whole Foods and the sushi has been great.  The managers here didn't care that I was incredibly disappointed and that I felt ripped off.
