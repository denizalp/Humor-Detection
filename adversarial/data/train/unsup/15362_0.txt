Went here last weekend with my buddies.  Hadn't had any pho in awhile, and we all were somewhat craving it, so we stopped in.  It was my first time here.  \n\nOrdered the rare steak pho, extra large (+$1.50).  My buddy ordered 3 egg rolls (we each had one), and we had waters to drink.  \n\nPho-  The broth was really damn tasty!  The bowl had a decent amount of beef in it, but was a little light on the noodles.  My other pho place I go to (Pho Viet), hooks it up with more noodles.  Overall though, it was a really good bowl of pho and I would definitely order a bowl again.\n\nEgg Rolls-  These were perfectly fried little tubes stuffed with pork.  They were packed to the gills.  Pretty damn tasty!  I am glad my buddy ordered them for the table to share.\n\nOverall, It was a good meal.  Just a little bit more $$ than I like to pay for a bowl of pho ($16.00 per person after tip for a bowl of pho and one egg roll each), but at least it WAS pretty darn delicious!  Will I be back?  Not driving down here specifically for it, but if I was in the area, I would definitely stop back in!
