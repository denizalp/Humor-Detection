Upon arriving to Zappitelli's we were told the wait was going to be 25-30 minutes. We waited for over an hour prior to being seated. Two employees kept going into the parking lot to look for someone. When the last waitress came in, she said \"O there you are\" to a family in the corner who had walked in 5 minutes prior. They were seated instantly.   It is one thing to wait longer than you're told; however it is ridiculous for employees to go in the parking looking for someone they know and not seat people who have been waiting over their quoted time. Not to mention there was a table empty for 20 minutes before someone cleared and cleaned it and many others that were empty for a long time with employees walking by, looking at them and not stopping.\n\nOnce seated, our waitress was speedy and kind. I ordered the hot pepper parm and it was good (I would get it again, but it wasn't the best meal I've ever had).  My boyfriend ordered the Walleye, his potatoes weren't crispy, and he said his meal was \"ok\" but he wouldn't order it again.
