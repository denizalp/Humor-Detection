I loved coming to Olympic Stadium when the Montreal Expos played baseball here.  Alas, they no longer do.  In fact, the team no longer exists either.  Sorry, but the Washington Nationals are NOT the Expos!\n\nAnyways, Olympic Stadium and the Montreal Tower situated right beside the Stadium are iconic symbols of this beautiful city in my humble opinion.\n\nIf you are a tourist, then I highly recommend visiting here.  There may even be an event or concert you would like to attend at the time of your visit.  At the very least, you can take awesome pics of the unique stadium architecture and the tower!  Won't see anything like it in the world!
