I think I found my new hang out. They have delicious to eat tacos they are small but well packed with meat. They have like garage style doors that are wide open and you get a nice breeze. A little industrial look I really like this place. Great staff I met the owner manager everyone was very sweet. Can't wait to try the Happy Hour :-) also I just tried to tacos but I'm dying to taste their guacamole:) love coming here, very happy to see Xavier working today, great service and great conservation \nI know you all have noticed I come here a lot! Not just for the delicious food, not just for the refreshing drinks! BUT the employees are wonderful! Including the kitchen staff! I have gotten to know many & they always have me laughing & smiling!
