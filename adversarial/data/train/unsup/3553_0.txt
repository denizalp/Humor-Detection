Circus Circus is the seediest joint I've been to on the strip.  It wins my personal prize.\n\nYou know what though?  It's not pretending.  You can go in there and play some cheap games with your low rent pals and have a good time.\n\nThere's also a pretty awesome steakhouse which was completely empty when we went there.  Aged steaks and serious drinks.  Think of it as a value-priced Mortons.\n\nAvoid the penny pinching deadbeats at the poker tables.  Go elsewhere for that, but everything else is fine if you don't mind a bit of dust and grime here and there.  If you do, you had better pawn your ass and head over to the other end of the strip to play with the beautiful people.
