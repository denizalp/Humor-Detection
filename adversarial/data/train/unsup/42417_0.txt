A place has to be perfect for 5 stars but this place is deserving !!! The drunken noodles aka pad kee mau (sp?) were AMAZING. Also their Peanut Sauce on the Pra Ram rivaled with my all time fav joint in San Diego (bahn Thai)\nYes east valley....FINALLY worthy Thai dishes. Fresh, authentic and mouthwatering
