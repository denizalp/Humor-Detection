After spending the day at STC shopping and chomping. Both my cousin and I wanted dessert or, more specifically, ice cream. Being Canadian and around for decades, this was the place we had to go.\n\nLimited selection and all appeared to be variants of the same colours. Anyway, I had some of their crunchy chocolate chip. It was definitely creamy and made nearby if not in store. They maintain the long standing tradition of putting one of their lady chocolates on top of the ice cream. Takes me back when I was a kid. They don't appear to have a rotating menu as the flavours I had as a kid were still there (and I'm talking decades ago). Price point was reasonable although the portion was slightly smaller than anticipated (not that I needed any more)\n\nWhat Canadians do, we do well!
