Nice place to come shop for a car if you want to get ripped off.  We came in because of an internet price they had advertised.  After adding all their fees that 'they cant remove' we got up and left.  Their so called operations manager Paul came out to talk to us but this guy was more of a clown than any other regular sales guy. He talked himself up so much and said he couldn't negotiate bc of one thing or the other.  Paul please take a class on how to treat your customers or you'll be a used car salesman your whole life.  Then we tried to talking to the general manager, Jeff who was so busy watching football that he didn't have time to talk to us. I would not recommed this place to anybody.
