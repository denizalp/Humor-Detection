I'm over you Safeway. You're fired.\nYou were great until you started the Just 4 U (JFU), then I noticed my receipts.\nEnticing me by your \"get the Friday $5 special all weekend\", only to notice later on that you screwed me over and charged me full price.\nYou owe me over $12, and that's just from what I noticed from the last 3 trips. \nI should have known JFU really stands for Just F%cked Up, or Just F%cked U .
