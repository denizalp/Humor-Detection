The very best of the best. I have been to quite a few pet stores in Northeastern Ohio, and have refused to ever shop at some stores ever again. Here the employees knew everything about every animal, even gave cold honest truth about their experience with products. They even refuse to sell certain products in shop but will special order it if that's what you really want.\nSure, some tanks had algae growing on the sides, and a lot had snails in them, but I'm ok with that, because I didn't see any dead fish. They do what's best for the animals, not what is best for appearances. I mean, I've had over 10+ years of experience with fish tanks, and I was actually able to learn some new things today. Here I usually go in and teach teenagers at fish stores a thing or two after giving them a harder time than it should with my questions. \nThey're not about packing in as many animals as possible into a tank\/cage and getting as much money out of the customer as possible. For example, the sales guy showed me what they usually offer their birds for nesting material, but then he said it can be uncomfortable, messy, expensive, etc and suggested a crafting store I can get cheap burlap sack thread at. \nNone of the employees acted like they had better things to do, were too busy, and all were super friendly and enjoyed holding a conversation while answering my questions and then some. \nI regret ever going anywhere else!
