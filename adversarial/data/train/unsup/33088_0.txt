I LOVE this place! I have been here for lunch and dinner and it's awesome for both. Would like to come for breakfast next time too! I have had their dosa and idlis and both are really good! The chutneys and sambar and all that are awesome and their service is friendly and fast. I would definitely recommend coming here for authentic Indian food, especially South Indian!
