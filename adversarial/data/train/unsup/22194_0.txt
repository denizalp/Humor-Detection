Over the weekend, I really wanted to try this place. I have always loved a good burger. So instead of hitting up the beach, My friend and I decided to go to this place.\n\nThe service was really good. Our waitress was very attentive to us. As much as I want to like this place, it's not even that great. \nI had the hubert keller's favorite burger which was like 22.00 bucks. The meat was really tender and the spinach and sauce made it taste better, but for 22 bucks, I was really expecting it to be like amazing, but the meat wasn't that flavorful to me. I was really disappointed in my burger. Maybe I just had too high of an expectation.\nMy friend got the chicken breast burger, and it was a pretty good burger but for 15 bucks, I was kind of expecting the chicken to be more juicy and tender. My friend also said it's kind of plain so she took my sauce for my burger and put it on hers. The sweet potato fries were pretty good but it's the same everywhere else so it's nothing really special.\nI also brought back togo my friend an american classic burger and she said it wasn't even that great for 15 bucks.\n\nMy friend liked her burger and her experience here, but as for me, I dont think I will ever be coming back here. I've had better burgers for the price of $5.
