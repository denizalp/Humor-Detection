This is another addition to the Living Room\/ Rock Lobster\/Chop family in Downtown Ocotillo Plaza. I like the inside of this restaurant. It's got a contemporary Mission Revival style look to it and has a decent amount of space (about 15 tables). Cocktails are a big deal here so they have a large bar area. La Sala (\"living room\" in Spanish) serves a menu featuring a modern take on classic Latin American dishes. The server staff did their job. They took my order and I got my food. I just feel the staff wasn't very welcoming and were more engaged with their daily chores around the restaurant. Once I got my food no one checked on me and I was just handed a bill at the end. The chimichanga I ordered was delicious. It was pretty large and filled with a generous portion of shredded brisket. The meat was very tender and flavorful with a hint of spiciness. I was a little bummed they didn't serve chips and salsa as that is my favorite thing about Mexican restaurants. Overall I had an OK experience and will check them out another time. They offer a limited menu of discounted food and drinks on their happy hour menu.
