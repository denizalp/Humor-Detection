I just left Skin of Dreams. Now I know why they call it that. I just had 3 services done. Eyebrow tint, eyelash tint, tag removal and microdermabrasion. It was a 1st and Tiffany was wonderful. She was so friendly and professional. Before each procedure she would explain what she was going to do next. This place is spotless and so cute!!! My skin feels so good. I can't wait to go back. I am going to refer my friends and family!!! Thanks again for the services.
