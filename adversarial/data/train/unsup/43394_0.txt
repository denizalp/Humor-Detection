Excellent service, super friendly staff. This is the last stop of our Vegas trip before we headed back home, my husband was saying that this should be the first stop in our next trip, so that we can go here more than once before we head home. \n\nWe ordered a margarita pizza with prosciutto, it is unbelievable good. They put extra virgin olive oil on top of the pizza, it enhances the flavor. We were debating should we order the meatballs, glad that we decided to give it a try. It is one of the best meatball we had ever have.\n\nGlad to know that they have 2 more stores in LA. The staff was telling us they are going to open one more store on the Strip.
