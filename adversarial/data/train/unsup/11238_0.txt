Okay.....first of all......whoever put \"dressy\" in the description was being totally ironic. \nI drove by this place a couple of times and thought......\"hmmmmm....that's a dinky little place.\" During this last visit to Henderson, I decided to Yelp what's good in the area.....and lo and behold.....this sucker popped up. I called the place to make sure it was open because some yelpers suggested this place has funky hours. Anywho......the man said it was open till \"a quarter to 7 on Saturdays\" \nWe ordered the Italian Beef and the Hot Dog. The basic dog comes with mustard, pickle, hot peppers, and onions. I'm a wuss when it comes to hot spicy things so I spit it out and soon as it hit my mouth. (I'm usually not a spitter) But the dog was delicious! The Italian beef was great......I know some of you are going to hate me for this but I think if I added kethup to it......it would be better. \nIt's a stand so expect to roast with the outside cockroaches waiting for your order. :)
