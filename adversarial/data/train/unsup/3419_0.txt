Been here a few times to take the kids to the parks or join a birthday or barbeque.\nSmall parking lot, but street parking allowed. Public restrooms. Decent walk\/bike way.\nThere's a shaded area with about 6 benches with tables, in between two big playgrounds.\nOne definitely accommodates older kids and the other is for smaller kids.\nLots of monkey bars, different size and style slides, \"rock climbing\" or mountain area, chair style swings, lots of running space, and smaller areas where I've noticed kids like to play \"house\" or \"stores\".\nThere's also a splash pad for the warmer days.\nLike everyone who's been here has mentioned, I wished the play areas were shaded because we all know how hot it really gets in Vegas.\nGreat neighborhood park in the Green Valley and Paseo Verde area.
