While I am glad to see the Halal Guys doing so well and expanding to CA and now Vegas, the food still is not my favorite.\nThe prices are descent as are the portions, but the meats are just not very good.\nStill cannot decide which i like less, the chicken was dark meat, the beef rather dry, a mix of both seemed best.\nThe white sauce is pure mayo, I would much prefer a garlic or yogurt type sauce, the red is very spicy, but needed to cut the thickness of the mayo.\nNot bad, but also not worth returning for.
