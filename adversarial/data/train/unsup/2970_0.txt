I paid over $2.50 for an order of taho. It was served in a small to go container, not a drink container. I placed the contents in a measuring cup and it was barely 6 oz. The worst part is on our first visit, they used a drink container. No wonder the place was empty. No offering of any kind of excuse. Terrible and NEVER AGAIN will I go there.
