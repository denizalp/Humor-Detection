It depends on what you're looking for I guess. I was putting together a new household and needed housewares and the various crapstuffs to make my house seem more like a home. Also I would have liked to have found some toys and furniture for the boy.\n\nIt's pretty well picked over, and for the most part priced . .  um . . . optimistically. \n\nThe Goodwills vary greatly from location to location. The store on Chandler Boulevard in Ahwatukee foothills gets some really nice cast-offs. I have a feeling this one on 16th St. is in an area where there's too much competition from other thrifts for good donations, and where shopping thrift stores is so well-accepted that they can still drive their prices up on whatever stuff they get. \n\nI think there's a condition in the DSM-IV called \"Thrift Store Delusion Complex\" wherein people willingly pay prices nearly equal to new and think they're getting a deal. I'm all for helping the disadvantaged, but the idea of a thrift store is  . . . ahem . . . thrift.
