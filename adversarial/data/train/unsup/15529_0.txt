I am reluctant to say that I either like Java House or dislike it - the food is really not that great (and in some cases awful) however, it is dirt cheap and doesn't pretend to be anything that it's not.\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, they practically give pitchers of beer away here. The food is also very cheap - the first few times I came here I was convinced they left something off the bill. One thing to note though, is that this place is CASH ONLY. I have gotten stuck with the bill numerous times because many of my dirtbag friends didn't have any cash.\n\nThe service here is hit and miss. Sometimes you will wait forever to order drinks and sometimes you will get a very friendly (and attentive) server.\n\nThe food is very simple, but I suppose it is a good value. My favourites on the menu are the stuffed french toast (order this with the 'soup of the day' - it is cream of broccoli EVERY day but it's tasty) and the curry chicken.\n\nAll in all, if you are looking for a cheap place and have low expectations (for food and in life) you might want to consider hanging out here.
