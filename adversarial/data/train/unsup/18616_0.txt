I had a headache. I was tired. I was hungry. The symptoms of waking from slumber were stronger than usual. And yet the charm of Mount Lebanon and the approach of Orbis Cafe gave me hope, and I slyly persuaded my henchbrethren of the need to stop. \n\nOrbis Cafe differs from your normal specialty coffee shop in that it's willing to cater to hipsters and 85 year old grandpeople alike. It's a quaint little shop with some beautiful touches but without the meticulously crafted designs of their significant friends in some other parts of the city. The baristas seemed more flustered and less calm and cool, and yet happy. It's just a place that is capable of pleasing the connoisseurs without turning off the common people. A bit hidden is the obtainability of such a quality thing as a pour-over using Ceremony or Intelligentsia coffee. But it's true! You can even spend $40 on a few ounces of rare coffees like Geisha, Eugenioides and Sudan Rume! \n\nThey also carry local 19 Coffee Roasters which I had to try, in the form of a Colombian pour-over. I was a bit skeptical but it turned out to be about a 9.5. On a scale of 1-17. Not bad, not amazing. BUT, there was the heavenly broccoli Brie quiche. \n\nI was revived. I was awakened. I was filled.
