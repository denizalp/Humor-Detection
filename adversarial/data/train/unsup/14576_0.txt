My family has been here 3 different time.  Same Customer service every time.   They suck!!!!!    This last time I was giving it one last chance.  It was for my mom's birthday.  To remind y'all this casino isn't on the strip so the customer service should be better.   It was funny We asked for the manager and the manager tried to send the waitress to speak with us...... ah no I'm sorry We asked for the manager not for the waitress that ignored us the whole time.    We spoken to the manager on duty.  Didn't get her name but she was the older, skinny , Burnett.  She was no help at all.    She said that she trained her staff to have fantastic customer service........   yeah right.     I'm not sorry to say this but that Manager can't cut it as a cashier at McDonald's
