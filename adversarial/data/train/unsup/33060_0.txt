The Comrade serves the best cocktails I've had. And I've been lots of places. Their freshest most delicious (to me) is the one with cucumber and gin (can't remember the name now). There is a slice of cucumber wrapped inside the glass so it's pretty and i always end up eating it, which is the perfect finish. And then I ask for another one. \nExtensive list of bourbon and whiskey as well which suits my man just fine. \n\nBut their best seller must be their hot dog. It's pretty incredible. We went pretty late on a Friday once and ordered two of those. The kitchen was almost closed and we waited for 30 minutes but still no hot dogs. The waitress realized they forgot and ran to the kitchen to see if someone could still make them for us. Not only did we get them, but they gave them to us for free to apologize for the wait. \nCustomer service doesn't get better then that. \n\nOverall, fantastic cocktails, good food and great staff. Definitely a fan.
