I would not recommend this company to anyone.  Airtech installed a radon mitigation system in my basement prior to it being finished.  The radon level in my basement now tests higher than it did prior to the installation of the mitigation system.  Airtech's  website advertises a  \"life time guarantee without an additional purchase\" but don't be fooled.  According to Airtech, this just means that Airtech will provide the $12 worth of additional PVC pipe to enhance the mitigation capacity of the unit.  Removing and replacing the 15 feet of drywall that will need to be cut out to install this piping will be on you.  Oh, and when do they tell you about the limitations on their guarantee?  In a contract that they come up with a year after the fact that is unsigned and post dated.  Do yourself a favor and avoid at all cost
