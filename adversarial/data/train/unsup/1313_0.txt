This has become our casino of choice for several reasons. 1) We live less than a mile away, 2) Their buffet is 4.99 for breakfast, 7.99 for lunch and 13.99 for dinner and it is better quality than most although sometimes the selection is lacking, 3) We love Yardhouse and LB's and the movies, and bowling alley (although South Point is cheaper).  Kid's quest is great and not too expensive (8.50 an hour).  They have a great casino rewards card for locals.  Used to get freeplay weekly but they recently switched to more points, less freeplay which is disappointing for me but others seem excited.  They are always giving discounted rooms, free items and the occassional mixer (girls night out, football watching, etc.).  The rewards club levels out once you break into level 2 and reaching level 3 is difficult with little additional reward.  You do get a 2-1 buffet every month.  The circular layout makes it easy to get through the Casino to your destination and the entrances near the bowling alley and movie theater minimizes the kids' exposure to the casino when you just want to see a flick.  The sports book is the best of the off strip casinos.  The pool is the bomb.com and a great place to see concerts during the summer.
