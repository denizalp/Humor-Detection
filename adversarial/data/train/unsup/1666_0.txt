There are a lot of negative reviews for this place. I'm not sure what people are expecting, but I was actually quite pleased with my experience. I never expected something upscale or fancy. I like the atmosphere. While it was super crowded, that isn't a bad thing actually. I ordered an Egg Club and potato salad. It's possible that the place is a smidgen over priced, but the food was pretty good so I don't feel like I wasted money. They have quite a large menu with really just about anything you could want. I was surprised how many things there are to choose from, breakfast items like omelettes and biscuits and gravy, a good selection of hamburgers choices, sandwiches galore, daily specials, salads, and plenty of other thing things. Don't forget the sweets section with all kinds of milkshakes, floats, sundaes, and other \"specialities\"\nIf your in Davidson and want a fun experience, and a trip back into time I would stop in.
