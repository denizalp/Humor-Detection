Love Love Love their pizza. It is made just right. If you can get past the dated decor, you can really focus on the main reason to be there: their pizza. This is a 30 minute drive from where I am located, but well worth the drive. I would advice those that had a bad experience before to give them another try. My husband and I visit once a week, simply because it is the best pizza in town. We will continue to frequent there once a week for our favorite pizza!
