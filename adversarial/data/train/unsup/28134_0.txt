I keep telling this lady she's hurting me and she keeps telling me that she has to do it. So I told her maybe be a little more gentle because my feet are sensitive. Then she tells me that my feet are really bad and that I need to let her do it. So I said no- I shouldn't be in pain while doing a pedicure. So she threw her tool and said I want someone else to do my nails. And she said there was no one else so she has to finish.  I've never been in pain doing a pedicure and if they work for tips they shouldn't push me to deal with the pain if it's uncomfortable. She is STILL not understanding what SENSITIVE means. The worse pedicure experience I've EVER had!!!!!!!
