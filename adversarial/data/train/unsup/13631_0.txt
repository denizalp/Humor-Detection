The only reason I really gave this place 4 stars earlier was because of the food and the service.\n\nThe food is so horrible no one in my family has returned.\nMy mom and dad used to have favorites and none of them are even decent anymore.\n\nThe service is lacking now and when we had to wait forever they gave us grapes...?\n\nwtf. no more!
