Firstly, I love the portion sizes. For the amount of money you pay, you get quite a lot of food.\n\nShrimp Curry ($9): Let me tell you, this dish is spicy! I have no problem with that, I actually love how spicy it is; the bell peppers really give it a kick. However, this dish is a little too salty (not a big deal to me) and I wish the shrimp were just a little more tender. I have only eaten shrimp curry at one other restaurant, thus I cannot really compare this dish to other ones. This didn't WOW me though.\n\nPalak Paneer ($8): I have tasted better, this dish was quite average. Also, I wish there were more pieces of paneer (cheese) in it. It was still enjoyable though.\n\nButter Naan ($1.25 each): Holy moly! I did not expect the naan to be this big! At another restaurant, they charged $1.50 per naan (half the size of Makkah's naan) so I didn't expect this. The naan was also not too oily. The underside was quite burned at times though; eating burned food isn't very fun.\n\nOVERALL: The food tasted average. I wasn't amazed by the dishes. They were still quite enjoyable, but I have definitely dined at better Indian restaurants. I am a very big fan of their portion sizes though. This was my first time eating food from Makkah, but I'm not too keen on coming back though.
