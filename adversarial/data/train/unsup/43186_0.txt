So, after our last big rain - what do you know, we found a couple of termite tubes out on the back patio.  We hadn't had the house serviced since we had it treated for termites when it was built (over 13 years ago).  Anyhoo - I jumped on YELP to see if I could find a termite company to compare to our current pest control servicer (we have the house and yard sprayed for bugs every 6 months or so).  HDE had some great reviews.  I wanted to use a local company to keep more of our tax dollars in our state.  \nI called them up and David came out at a time convenient for us.  We already had a first quote from another termite company, so we had something to base it off of.  David provided us a quote on the spot.  He was comparable in price, but did a whole lot more explaining of what the process was and how the chemicals worked.  I worked in a termite inspection company in Calif - so I was familiar with alot - and he still wowed me with how he explained it in terms both me and my husband understood.  We gave David the head nod that we would use his service.  His office emailed the docs over for signature and away we went.\nDavid's guys came out and took care of our home.  They were quick and professional.   No termites since!  Thanks HDE
