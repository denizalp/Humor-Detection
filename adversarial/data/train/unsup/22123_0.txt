Their Febuary promotions sparked my interest, and also I have been craving bubble tea, so I decided to check them out.\n\nThe place is pretty small with not too much seating, but very clean otherwise. On a 7PM Friday evening the place was almost packed, so I decided to just do take-out.\n\nFrom their February special, I ordered the Sago Taro Milk Tea with 30% sugar and less ice. For 30% sugar, it tastes A-ok. It was not overly sweet and tastes just right. It is not creamy as I expected from a milk tea. Good thing the drink was at a discounted price. The drink just didn't meet my expectations when it comes to taste.\n\nMy BF got the Lemon King from their February special. This one is actually a better drink than the Sago Taro Milk Tea in my opinion. This is such a strong and flavorful drink. It makes sense that it is named Lemon 'King'. Very tasty and very sour at the same time.\n\nI would go back to see what their next month's specials would look like. It is worth going if you are taking advantage of their promotions. But there are way too many other better options in  if you are craving bubble tea, especially if you are paying the same price.\n\n\n\nReview 17 of 100
