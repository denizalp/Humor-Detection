I have eaten at the original Me Va Me many many times until a few months ago. On my last visit I saw 2-3 small bugs (cockroach type) on the floor near my table. The eat-in location right at Steeles\/Bathurst was finished for me. Despite my family's love of the place, I opt out when they decide they are going to eat there. The food was very good but I can't stomach eating a restaurant where I blatantly saw a bug infestation in the dining room. To top it off, the wait-staff is hit\/miss. I still frequent the take-out location on Steeles for my shawarma fix (best I've had in the area) and await a chance to try their new eat-in\/take-out location at Bathurst\/Rutherford which is still (after several months) not open!
