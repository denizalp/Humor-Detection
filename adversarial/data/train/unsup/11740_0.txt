It proved I'm not a vegan and can never be one. Got a slice of blueberry uncheesecake but it wasn't tasty at all. The overpowering almond smell, the weird pie base, and most of all, no blueberry taste at all! Also, the green water they gave us, tasted like toothpaste, it's actually water with mint syrup. \nEhh, I am retuning to my carnivore life!\nThe service was chaotic as well, we got asked three times what we wanted by three different people.
