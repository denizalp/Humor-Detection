I had the lobster mac n cheese.  The dish was advertised with shallots, but came with green onion. The lobster was extremely overcooked, like chewing on tire. Also went overboard with cheese,  left the dish swimming in liquid. Service was great,  but there was not a host upon arriving which left me wandering around looking for my table.  Overall just average, but advertised as fine dining. I would like to go back to try something else.
