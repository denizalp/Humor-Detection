Visiting PHX the first weekend of May 2018 was brutally hot (spoiled Californian).  So naturally we're looking for cold desserts and beverages.  Conveniently located near our stay, and recommended by our hosts we stopped by - and definitely a worthy stop.\n\nThey have a lots of custom blended smoothies and teas, luckily we came with a group so we were able to sample more.  I think the main attraction is the Diamond bars, they remind me of popsicles, but shaped like a diamond waffle, or diamond ice cube tray.  You can order just the bar, or go Deluxe, and add a chocolate dip, and choose toppings - its all very overwhelming with the flavors, then the dip, then the toppings - so just peep out the menu before you go - or just ask one of the very friendly staff for help.  The bar with toppings was great, it was just sweet enough to beat the craving and cool you down - and light enough to where you didn't regret have a Large smoothie with it.  Definitely need to order both though.  Enjoy the photos!
