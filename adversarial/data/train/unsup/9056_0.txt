I dream about Made in Mexico's Pico de Gallo. Not even kidding.\n\nDelicious food and great atmosphere. I recommend the Charro soup, Tostadas, refried beans, and their fresh chips. \n\nAlways busy, service has gotten better but it can be a little slow during steady periods, which is understandable. I find when I order extra sauce they normally forget.. love the jalape√±o hot sauce, I add a little to my soup. \n\nOnly ever disappointed with the fish tacos, they tend to lack flavour.\n\nOtherwise I highly recommend for a night out, lunch, or take out!
