I wanted to wait to write my review until the full effects of the botox had settled in and worked it's magic. Leigh takes beauty to another level ! Upon arrival Leigh measured my face and had a full consultation with me describing my face and it's proportions! Who knew I had wide set eyes! I really appreciated and enjoyed the time and care she took for this meeting. She administered the botox and was precise and painless in doing so. Upon leaving she set up a follow up appt , gave me a darling ice pack and gave me additional beauty tips and tricks. I was also so happy that I didn't have any bruising or discoloration whatsoever. I was able to get photos taken that very night. Two weeks have passed by and I can honestly say, I am THRILLED with the results. It doesn't look as though I am eternally surprised or perplexed. The results are soft, natural and utterly perfect. If you are looking for an experienced, amazing beauty guru in the Scottsdale area... Look no further! , Leigh Asher is your answer!
