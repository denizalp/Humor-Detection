Excellent!  I booked a week at Nobu Hotel inside the Caesar's palace and I had to give this place a try.  I am a sushi\/sashimi lover, and the fusion of sushi\/sashimi dishes I have seen in magazines, made me put this place in my top 10 sushi trips.\nI came for dinner, and there was a special menu.  It had samples of different types of sushi\/sashimi, and even tapas style Japanese cuisine.  The plate, which included a variety of mini desert bites, was about $120, which was money well spent.\nThis place is trendy, and definitely a spot to hit if you love sushi.  \n\nI didn't leave here bloated or wanting to explode.  I was satisfied with every bite1\n\nMost people complain about sushi prices, or claim to love sushi, but order sushi rolls.  Which cover the taste of the actual fish.  The presentation is beautiful and taste is superb.  If you enjoy all-you-can eat sushi for $15.99, this is not a place for you.\n\nYou won't find poor quality fish here.\n\nI ordered a 8 piece High Roller bento box for room service.  One of the pieces was lobster.  It was $250, now I see why it was called the High Roller, lol\n\nThis is a place I will be returning
