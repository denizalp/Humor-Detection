This place is horrible! The owners and empolyees are sort of shady in my opinion. I purchased a sectional from Vdub, and its a piece of TRASH. We even took it apart and looked under it, nothing but plywood,metal springs and a cloth for support. My back killed me when I had that sectional. We just had to throw it away! But I went through a hastle still going through it. I disputed the couch on my debit card because they refused to honor their return policy and warranty. So I had no choice to dispute the purchase. And when I won the dispute, they sued me. For twice what I paid. And the couch didn't even last 16 months! I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. Not only is a bad quality but the service is awful too!
