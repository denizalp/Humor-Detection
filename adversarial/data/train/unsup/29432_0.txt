The high marks prompted me to try this for a breakfast meeting.  Wasn't expecting to place order at counter and have self service drinks.  Not a bad thing just a surprise.  Found a table outside since the music and kitchen noise was a bit high inside.  Had to fix the outside table to keep it from wobbling. After a few minutes the traffic noise was too loud to carry on our meeting so we moved inside.  \n\nFood came in about 10 minutes. Quality was fine however my guest said pancakes were a bit tough.  Likely over cooked.  \n\nMeat lovers scramble was good with crisp hash browns.  \n\nService was fine and appropriately attentive.
