Typical diner that serves bad food at okay prices. Severe lack of vegetarian options. I got the \"Big Breakfast.\" The waiter wouldn't let me substitute orange juice for my coffee, even though I offered to pay the additional 45 cents and give him a handjob in the bathroom after our meal.\n\nOverall, pretty lackluster restaurant. Looking back, the only positive aspect of this place is the giant EAT sign.
