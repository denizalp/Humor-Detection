One Five Guys regular bacon cheeseburger is never enough for me. I find myself saying that after I devour one, along with most of Cajun Fries that I'm supposed to be sharing. \n\nFive Guys really hits the spot when you're craving a burger while in this part of town -- so does In-N-Out, but that's another review. Taste is consistent throughout other locations I've visited. Can't go wrong with their simple burger selections and variety of toppings -- grilled mushrooms, uh, YES PLEASE.\n\nThe fries are definitely not as soggy as fries I've had elsewhere; they're just softer and deliciously greasy. The Cajun Fries have a little heat to them, and they are DELICIOUS.\n\nThere's two downsides to this place. First, it's expensive. I paid almost $25 for two burgers, two drinks, and a bag of fries. Those are gourmet burger prices, folks. Secondly, this isn't a major concern, but their menu doesn't differentiate between a regular burger and a little burger -- the former has two patties, while the latter has one. \n\nThis location is large with plenty of seating, unlike the Downtown Summerlin spot that's smaller and always crowded. Also, I do like the service here. \n\nAfter giving Five Guys' burgers and fries multiple tries, they've grown on me. There's no turning back now.
