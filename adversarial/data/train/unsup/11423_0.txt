I will never ever shop here again this use to be my go to place for all my fishing\/hunting and camping needs. They treated us with such disrespect. We came in to purchase a fire arm for protection and they refused to sell to us because my boyfriend said to me \"are you coming\" cause I was going to get gum from the car. They said he has trying to buy it for me and refused to sell it to us. They were wrong and then called all the gun stores flagging us when I really need it cause I have a dangerous stalker who's trying break in to my house. I feel my second amendment rights are being trampled on by sportsman warehouse.
