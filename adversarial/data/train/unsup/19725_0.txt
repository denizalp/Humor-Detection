Where is my little muffin? I got the salad, but it came with a piece of decent wedge bread. There was no sign of the Lemon Poppyseed muffin that is usually present. The Mediterrean salad was good, but only had one container of dressing, not the normal two. I haven't been here in months, but bring back that muffin. Otherwise, still a good salad for the money. ($8).
