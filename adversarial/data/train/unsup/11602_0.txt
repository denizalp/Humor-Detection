Not the best place in the world for vendors.  They advertise they start at 9:00 AM, but most vendors are never setup on time, thus making other vendors look bad.  We were new to the Farmers market and couldn't believe how unprofessional this organization runs things.  When tried to reach out to management, never ever received a return phone call and\/or nobody on site.\n\nThey have some cool vendors like the Kettle Corn Popcorn and organic veggies and fruits vendors, but other than that nothing special.  Bunch of useless arts and crafts you could find less expensive at a yard sale.  Tiovli Village is already a dying strip mall, but this puts the nail in the coffin.  Sadly we won't be coming back.
