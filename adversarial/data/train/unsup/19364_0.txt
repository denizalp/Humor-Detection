It's been said that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and that you shouldn't skip it.  Let me give you a little advice: Skip having breakfast here. \n\nTo say that I was unimpressed with the quality and choices is an understatement. I guess what I was expecting was an affordable full-on breakfast buffet, not a meager selection of breakfast items, some being mediocre in quality and flavor.\n\nOne side of the buffet is open while the dessert and back sections are closed off, so everything is located at the front of the buffet. The basic breakfast items were all there, like bacon, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, pancakes, Belgian waffles, and sausages. \n\nSome of the offerings were simply, not good. The Portuguese sausage was greasy and flavorless, and that \"omelet\" -- no idea what compelled me to put that on my plate -- was obviously artificial and straight out of the package. Speaking of omelets, the omelet station is the highlight of the breakfast buffet. The cook -- I think his name is Manny -- is such a cheerful man. He's obviously a morning person and seems like he enjoys his job. Plus, his omelets aren't bad, and you know he uses real eggs cause he cracks them right in front of you. Aside from the real omelet I had, I did like the beefy and spicy breakfast burrito with jalape√±o slices. Of course, the bacon was good, but needed a good pat down on a napkin to absorb the excess grease. \n\nBreakfast is obviously not the strong point of this buffet. For under $10, you could probably find something better in the area to kick-start your day. However, I still recommend trying their lunch buffet. I just hope it doesn't end up being like the quality of their breakfast.
