Been here like two times by force.  For some odd reason my coworkers love this joint.  For me I'm not sure what the heck I'm eating. \n\nThe parking is horrible, good luck finding a spot, and the restaurant both time was horribly crowded and messy.  It looks busted at best.  Quite shocking how busy they are.  The staff however was always friendly and helpful and kind.  \n\nThe food here is confusing, what the heck am I eating.  The jerk chicken rice or whatever... gross, how could you mess up rice? It was like dried but not dried, kinda like white rice, but not white....Gross.  The Jade chicken was tasty in an orange chicken kinda way, but still quite odd and very dry and hard, like they deep fried it too long or left it out for a few good hours.  See it's so confusing, I can't even describe it.  \n\nHonestly I won't be back even by force.  On a good note, the soda was tasty.  Good soda, decent quality stuff.  3 stars only because my coworkers say so.  If it was up to me, 2 stars at best.  Deuces!
