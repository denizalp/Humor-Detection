Since my friend keep telling me Village Seafood Buffet has a very good all you can eat seafood, so I guess I should make a try. Well, a little bit disappointed since I think their seafood, especially for raw fish wasn't that fresh..oyster was bad because I can taste the sand! crab leg was fine, didn't impressive me a lot, it still a good place to go if you are seafood lover!
