Overall satisfactory experience with Air Transat.\n\nBought a round-trip from Toronto to Faro for less than $800. Air craft was new and clean. Service was good. Seats were comfortable. \n\nOn my return, the air craft had a gasoline leak (scary)! The crew made an excellent decision that safety was the most important. They arranged a 5 star hotel for all passengers near a beach in Algarve. Their handling of this incident was excellent. \n\nThe coordination could have been better. Their crew was inexperienced which caused many hours of delay at the airport. We were trapped in a lounge for 4 hours before they announced the leak could not be fixed. The next morning, from leaving the hotel (7:30am) to departure (12:20pm) was another 5 hours of long wait. All of the crew was friendly except for one lady who was a bit rude.
