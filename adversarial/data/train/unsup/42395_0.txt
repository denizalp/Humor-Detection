Since I was a kid, I noticed the picture of the guy holding a lobster that was the size of a Doberman.  From that time I always wanted to experience the Rosewood Grille.  Overall, I'm happy to say I did!\n\nFirst off, expect to pay....a lot!  Afterall, the downside to eating such a huge lobster is that like any lobster, you pay by the pound.  Market price for a lobster is usually about $20-$25\/pound.  Just remember this before you choose the lobster that weighs as much as Rosie O'Donnell.  My wife and I got a 6.5 lb lobster, Oysters Rockefeller, a couple of drinks and the check came up to about $250 with tip.  \n\nIf money is not an object to you (and let's face it...this is not the most expensive restaurant in Vegas by far), then you DEFINITELY WANT TO COME HERE! \n\nThe staff is VERY friendly!  Attentive, yet not annoying.  (You vegans may not like this next sentence so...fair warning...skip over it)  They'll let you pick out your own gi-normous lobster out of the tank and let you take a picture with it before they cook it!  \n\nThe dining room is small, intimate, quiet, and unpretentious.  In the current day and age of Las Vegas where everything has to be uber-hip and trendy, its nice to see something a little more laid back, yet still nice.  It's also a plus to not have to climb through a smoke-drenched casino, tripping over ditzy drunk twenty-somethings trying to get laid, to have a nice dining experience.  \n\nGo check out Rosewood Grille!  Just make sure your credit card balance is paid down before you go!
