Mr. Wong, the man himself, spoke with me today. First time in a year. Kudos to him for the original name of the restaurant and not falling into the trap of Big Wang. I'm serious. Do a search. There are about 5 billion results. Now search for Big Wong. It's the first result. Now, it could be that I'm in Vegas and the local results are being pushed to me, but I prefer not to think in such pessismistic terms. Being the #1 Big Wong is a massive accomplishment.\n\nOf course, I don't come for the conversation. I'm a frequent diner here with my classmates. Why? Where else can you get salt and pepper chicken wings for $4.95? This kinda thing doesn't even happen in the SGV. My friends from Taiwan and China approve of Big Wong. That's gotta be worth something. It's comfort food at its finest. They even accept credit cards. \n\n-The wings come out smoking from the deep fryer the second they're cooked. I've personally witnessed this. The chef in the back makes a hand signal, the wings are rushed onto the griddle, and the owner rushes it to your table. They're extra crispy with just the right amount of salt and copious amounts of thinly sliced peppers.\n\n-The Ong Choy is always crunchy, fresh, and would not cause me concern if it were to come from my mom's hands. Multiple options are also offered -- get it garlic cooked, Thai style, or with soy paste. All is not perfect though -- the dish is sometimes served with too many stems, and not enough leaves. Still a great value at $5.95. \n\n-The seasoned rice tastes great. I would eat it by itself. Combine it with ribeye for $4.95. FOUR-NINETY-FIVE. See the theme yet? Extraordinary. Just extraordinary. \n\nThank you for all you do, Mr. Wong. You are a real man of genius.
