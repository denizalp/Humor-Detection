don't eat here! Service sucks and the food is atrocious!.i ordered the half bbq chicken and it was down right vile! I wouldn't even give that crap to my dog.  Nachos were decent but then again, how can you mess up nachos....the title is right, it truly is the last resort if nothing else is open! We only came here because our feet were KILLING us & we were all drunk and hungry. So yes it was our closest and  last resort.
