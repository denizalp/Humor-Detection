I read somewhere that they have a sirloin burger that was AMAZING, but apparently that source was mistaken. There are absolutely no burgers on the menu. So automatically I am disappointed. No amazing sirloin burger. No burgers at all. Ordered the prime rib (well done) with mashed potato but was not impressed. The beer was good, but I cannot give the Keg the credit for that. Overall I was unhappy with the experience.
