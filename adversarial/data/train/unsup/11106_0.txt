I went to Diva Nails for a Spa Pedicure yesterday.  The location is new and is beautiful!  I noticed the lovely decor as well as the comfort and cleanliness of the shop.  The spa chairs are comfortable and include the all those relaxing massage buttons.  They spa chairs also include liners that are changed with every use.  One of my priorities with a nail salon is cleanliness.  They have the top of the line machine that cleans all the tools after each use.  My pedicure was relaxing and my toes are ready for sandal season!  Thank you, Cindy, for making my visit so enjoyable!
