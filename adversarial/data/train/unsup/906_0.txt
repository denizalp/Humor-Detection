Location is right off highway 74 and is pretty popular. There is parking and some stores and hotels within walking distance. I have been there several times on different days and times and and they will have two lines circling the place. The drive through is insane. FYI the inside is just as crowded. Since it's in a good location near highway 485 and 74 it's a busy place. The staff can be nice but they can be talkative with each other and ignore you a bit. It's similar to the other chick fil a chains. The place is clean and the food is good. Enjoy!
