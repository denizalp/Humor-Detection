Prices are way too high. However it is organic and non gmo so that isn't cheap food.  \nTacos are garbage\nMahi Mahi was really average \nchips and salsa are some of the best in town.\nChicken Milanesa is seriously legit, very unhealthy and very good.  \n\nThe biggest problem is the mamalukes who work here. Out of my 10 visits or so I'd say the service was awful 8 out of 10 times. One time we sat at the bar in front of the bartender for almost ten minutes and he never said a word to us.. figured he was a barback. Then another couple walked in and the guy could not have been friendlier to them .  Was one of the strangest Encounters in a restaurant  I've ever experienced. The staff is constantly rotating I've only seen one guy the whole time that I've been coming here that's still there everyone else is always new each time.\nHowever, for 24 hour Mexican food that's organic and non-GMO I'll continue coming back and paying the extraordinarily high prices and enduring the shitty service because overall there is some really good things on the menu. AND great chips and salsa. Lastly, I want to mention even though some dishes are average everything is high quality ingredients.
