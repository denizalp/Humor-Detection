This small ice cream parlor is located on the heart of strip on Las Vegas Blvd and Flamingo Ave with all the new shops.\n\nI first saw this place a couple weeks ago when I visited Vegas but I didnt have time to stop by to try. I came back a week after and I got to try the ice cream finally.\n\nI tried dondurma - authentic turkish ice cream in Korea where turkey guys will tease you giving ice cream. I was imagining something similar to that and I guess I cant really tell if the ice cream had the similar texture but it was good nonetheless.\n\nThe girl was very kind, offering us samples on ice cream. I got to try Staberry and Caramel which were pretty good but a little too sweet to my taste. I went with Pistachio and I am glad I did. It had a very good amount of Pistachio in it and it was toasty.\n\nThe best part of the fun was that I was checking in when I was about to pay and I got an offer saying I can get a free 'fun' size with the check in. Saved me about $5. Definitely coming back here next time I am in Vegas! Try it, it will keep you cool since it is getting too hot now in Vegas.
