I have been told that Artistic Pool is putting in the pool at the home behind my home. All last week my husband & I listened to a jack hammer at decibels of high 70's to low 80's. We could feel the vibration on our kitchen counters as well as the floor beneath our feet. After speaking with someone representing the company, we thought that today, Mon., would be different. Once again, they started with the jackhammers at 7:30this morning. I don't believe this company cares about adjoining neighbors or the possible harm they are doing to the surrounding retaining walls with the constant vibration.
