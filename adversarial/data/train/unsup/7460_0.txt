As another reviewer said, this is a true hidden gem. \n\nVEGANS: if you are looking for treats, look no further! Their fudges and superfood balls are amazing. And, FINALLY, a place that has perfected the vegan Caesar salad! It's made with Brazil nut sprinkles and cashew dressing. So good. \n\nTheir drink offerings are original and made to order. Espresso\/coffee can be added to just about anything for that extra pick me up. Not into drinks? Not to worry, they have plenty of bowls to crave your hunger as well. \n\nBut me, I'm a fan of the salads. They are a must try! Super original flavors and amazing homemade dressings.\n\nSit at the counter long enough, and you'll get a few free samples.
