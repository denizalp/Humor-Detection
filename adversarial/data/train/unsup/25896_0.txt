This restaurant is so customer-oriented..I'm amazed with the service and the warm welcome of Ab & Amir. I ordered the Shish Taouk (skewer chicken) and it was very delicious. Make sure to order the grape leaves warm, they're divine! All the different dishes, sides, and even the drinks are freshly made. Definitely give their fresh lemonade with mint a try, it won't disappoint. Ab was very kind and gave us complimentary hot tea and a taste of their baklava. Overall, very, very pleased with everything from this restaurant, I will be coming back for sure!
