Omg came for an event and have visited a few times since. I think this store in going to be entirely responsible for my empty bank account and requiring a bigger size pants!!  But in a good delicious sweet way!!\n\nLocation:\nIn Richmond Hill in a plaza that you wouldn't expect to find it in.\n\nParking:\nSuburbs plaza- lots\n\nThe Goods:\nCakes and pastries and other sweet delicacies. Oh my..\n\nThey make pastries, macaroons, cakes, and coffees and lattes. \n\nThe display cases is filled fresh every morning and is emptied by customers every night!\n\nYou can get any of the cakes in their catalogue (all the ones you buy at Longos and other groceries) baked fresh for you. They just need 48 hours notice.  May. Suggest anything with hazel nuts. My kryptonite!\n\nEverything delicious.\n\n\nDecor:\nThey have tables and chairs so you can sit and sample your purchases. Make sure you get a latte!!\n\nStaff:\nI've loved everyone I've come in contact with. Everyone is so nice!!\n\n\nSo yeah. I'm coming back soon because I love the goods!!
