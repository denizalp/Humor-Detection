If I were to ever leave Cleveland, this would be one of the places I could never re-create. Treated like family from the moment my boyfriend and I walked in.  What do you have on tap?  Genesee Cream Ale for $2 (big, big glass).  Yes, please,  Would you like a shot for $2?  Yes, please.  \"Top shelf\" drinks are like... 3.25?  Would you like the appetizer of chips and hot sauce?  Sure!  Giant meat sandwich for $8 (my bf always gets the ham for $6, I get the pastrami... to die for).  Same server always waits on us and we love the stuffing out of him.  BEST juke box in town.  When James Brown comes on, everyone bobs heads, from the young ones to the bartenders to the old timers who have been going there since the opened in the 70's.  But don't take the place for granted... the servers don't play.  That's why everyone's been gettin' along in there for so many years.  Once saw somebody's grandma act a mess in there, get a warning, and get walked out.  \n\nSeriously, it is a magical place.
