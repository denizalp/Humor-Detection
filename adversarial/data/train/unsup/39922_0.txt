Do not let the name change from WAMU to Chase fool you, your money is not safe with Chase. With Chase in charge of WAMU, I suffered an identity theft which the fraud unit of WAMU detected and warned me about. Chase subsequently denied reimbursement because they could not figure out how the theft occured. Basically, accused me of theft.
