I never thought I would ever eat at Golden Corral for a very good reason. I just don't like buffets. Just the idea of bulk food being pushed out ASAP. It has been years since I have been to one. But today was my lucky day, Our aunt wanted to take us out for dinner after I was nice enough to help her at her apartment. Now this place has a lot of food! And a lot of people! I had their steak, medium but it was more like medium well and tasted like leather. Wanted a bun, but this one lady decided to take all twelve buns at once and left none! Asked her if she had enough, I can easily get another plate for her and take it to her table! She just looked at me? How rude! Anyway, I had some other food. They did look good, but just didn't taste that well. This place was a mess, tables were dirty, crumbs everywhere. But what do you expect! Only came here because of my aunt, this is not a franchise I normally go to. Only because I am not a buffet person.
