This restaurant has been on our list and finally we dined in. The staff was very friendly and service was prompt. We started off with an order of crab rangoons. The order of four hot pieces was delicious!  They were filled nicely and were real crab, not imitation. The filling was creamy and rich, a nice change from a clump of cream cheese which you normally get around town. We ordered the small boil with all three spices. It was as enough for two people. The sausage was spicy and the crab was plentiful. Potatoes were fine but the corn was a little mushy. We also ordered the Madison Roll. A sushi roll with crab and avocado which is deep fried. It was served with a spicy mayo and we couldn't get enough of it. It was so big we had several pieces to bring home with us. Glad we tried it out and we would return again and try more menu items.
