The Palliser Hotel was built in 1914 was named after Captain John Palliser, who was an explorer in the region during the 1850s. It's architecturally distinct as are many of the other former Canadian Pacific Railroad hotels.  And like the Hotel Mac in Edmonton, my experience is limited to exploring the public areas and having a drink in the lounge so I can soak it all in.\n\nThe hotel is still close to the railroad tracks, although with all the hustle and bustle of downtown Calgary, you'd hardy notice.  The VIA Canadian train now travels through Edmonton, but if you want a historical and scenic railroad experience that links to Banff and Lake Louise, the Rocky Mountaineer has a nice package that can include the Palliser.
