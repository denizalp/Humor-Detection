You know that little voice in your head that says not to go down that alley or drink that last drink? I was feeling that when booking for this show, but I thought, \"Hey, it's Michael's music, I can do that.\" \n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nAny time that you are seeing an impersonator, you have to remind yourself that they will never be as good as the original. Good, maybe even mediocre, and most of the times just god awful. This falls into the category of sheer fuckery, almost comical, and a bit sad. \n\nIf you're playing Michael Jackson, you have to have the chops to not only sing, but dance as well. I felt that I was at a Happy Hour Karaoke, the dude's voice annoyed the heck out of me and he also forgot the lyrics most of the time! The mic went out at some times too. I found myself completely ignoring him and focusing my attention on the dancers and the musicians--that itself tells you it wasn't worth the price!!\n\nAs much as I was glad it was over, it was only an hour! Really?? I hated that the switching from song to song was so fast, it didn't give enough time to let the moment simmer, so to speak. It was like a game of how quickly I could get through the songs. SMH.\n\nThe audience seemed amused. Some people really go into it, so what do I know. The place is circular with seats, plus a bar that charges ridiculously for their drinks. Meh. \n\nDo yourself a favor, save your money and go see MJONE at Mandalay Bay.
