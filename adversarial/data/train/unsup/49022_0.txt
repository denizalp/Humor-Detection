The absolute misleading place I've ever been to. I was quoted  2 different prices 2 different times. This place does dishonest business. They try to hustle all of these different eye test that you don't need, they run the test and tell you pricing later. The staff is unprofessional. I called up after I decided to go to take my business elsewhere they told me  and the contacts place who called up for my prescription different information, because I chose to take my business elsewhere. Ask about prices ahead of time, and do not get hustled and scammed by this business.
