If you're in vegas to see a show, you NEVER need to pay full price!\n\nThere are tons of people trying to sell you cheap tickets, but you never know if they're legit. With Tix4Tonight I've never had issues getting what I paid for and I've bought tickets for 6 shows with them.\n\nThe only thing you need to watch out for, are their \"bonus\" deals... the whole pay three dollars and get 50% off a buffet stuff usually has a catch.\n\nI'd give them 5 stars, but you always have to wait in line for at least 30 minutes... If they'd change that somehow, I'd give them 5!
