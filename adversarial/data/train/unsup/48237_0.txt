2nd visit review.--- decided to give this place a second chance.   I am glad I did!!  Service was 5 starts for sure!  Nathan was our server and he was amazing.  Checked on us frequently and or drinks were always full.   The food was also good...\n\nWe order the fondue again,  cheese was amazing this time.  Zucchini fritters with aioli were very good.  Burger had good flavor and fries were great.  Lastly the carnitas were also very tasty.   \n\nI was hesitant to come here again after my last experience,  but the second time was amazing!  We will come back here again for sure!
