The service was great from Armando and Roberto. But the steamed clams were too salty. Bread is not included with the clams, and I've never had that happen before. The waiter brought us some of the garlic bread they use for croutons, to sop up over-salted juice. The charred octopus was more like a warm salad, with lots of tiny veggies and kind of rubbery bites of octopus. I can't recommend either right now. Greatly prefer the steamed clams at Pizza Rock at Green Valley Ranch, which comes with lots of focaccia. And more if you want it. I really wanted to enjoy that meal, but I really didn't--just like the Michael Jackson show I saw afterward.
