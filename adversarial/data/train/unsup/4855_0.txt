I don't think words can express the detail and imagination that was put in to the display. The beauty and the detail is beyond words. Even if you don't stay at the Bellagio, you have to check it out! I mean, I'm surprised it's free! No charge! \n\nYou can not see it in the pictures, but there are moving parts, as the tree in the pictures sings and talks. I felt going at night was better because of the sky lights.
