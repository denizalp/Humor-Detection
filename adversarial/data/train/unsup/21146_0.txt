This place is disgusting. The few name brand items they carry are over-priced compared to an actual grocery store. Their in-store made food is inedible, Well, in fairness I've never tried it so it may edible if you have no standards for your food, or like eating trash. But chicken salad should never be brown, and I'm pretty sure something made \"fresh\" isn't fresh one week later. It all looks like food served in a private prison. \n\nWhen you first walk in, it smells like raw sewage, I asked one of the employees about it and they told me they didn't smell anything out of the ordinary. That means this place always smells like sewage and the employees are just used to it. This store might have been great back in the day, but it's horrible now. I wish they would just close this place and put in a Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, or even a Giant Eagle, \n\nThe only nice thing I can say about Shaker's is that they have a decent beer selection, this make sense because you would need to be drunk to continue shopping here. It's an insult to the people of Olmsted Falls and Olmsted Township to keep this store open and classified as a grocery store. You would have more luck buying your food at the CVS across the street, they will have a better selection of edible food and better prices. \n\nPlease don't bother with this place, drive the ten minutes to North Olmsted, Berea, North Ridgeville, or Avon. Or find a local dumpster, they will have about the same quality, but you wont have to pay outrageous prices for it.
