So I came here on high recommendation. Food was about right for the atmosphere and reputation. Service was not.  Very impersonal and rushed. I was handed the check before service was even complete.  It wasn't overly busy on my visit.  I will rate the two stars because of the atmosphere and food charm.  But the place needs a reset on focus on experience and less focus on how fast they can turn tables.  Unfortunate, but I won't be back. $30 a person for dinner is a small ask for experience.  Not asking for much, just some decency.
