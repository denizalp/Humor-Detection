Good little neighborhood sports bar with great deals on canned 16 oz PBRs. Decent place to watch sports.\n\nServers are very friendly and the owner Dave is frequently working the bar when I go. Nice casual working man's bar. They also have a restaurant area with booths if you are interested in a meal. Food is pretty good.\n\nA little tough to find - just south of Honeywell plant and Deer Valley Airport in an industrial area. Would have given it 5 stars if they had outdoor seating.
