One of the better TJ Maxx's I have been to in town. It is combined with a Home Goods, so the square footage of the store is quite a bit larger and it also means that the lines for checkout are that much longer as well. The good thing about this location is that once they noticed that the line was getting extremely long they hurried quite a few more cashiers to the front to alleviate the wait for everyone, which I really appreciated. Nothing like seeing people have a sense of urgency to help others once in a while. \n\nThe selection was nice and I found quite a few things to purchase from the shoe and handbag section. I didn't spend a lot of time browsing, but look forward to coming back to this location soon and spending more time perusing the racks.
