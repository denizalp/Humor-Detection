Solid three stars. The menu is \"globally inspired\" but still manages to come off as little more than another New American restaurant riding on its gluten-free, veg 'n' vegan laurels. If you think Pei Wei is \"globally inspired\" good eats, you'll probably dig True Foods. Or if you're looking for a place to take even the pickiest of eaters be they bland food lovers or gluten-lactose intolerant vegetarians.\n\nTip 1: Beware the nouveau health guru buzz words on the menu. \n\nEnjoyed the ginger carrot elixir, thought the pomegranate juice was mega overpriced, and why? Because of the omg!antioxidants? Potatoes have freakin' antioxidants but I'm not about to drink a tater slurry.\n\nTip 2: The food is chain-restaurant quality.\n\nThe apps are fairly meager and like everything else on the menu, too expensive for what you get. Hummus comes with a couple measly pita triangles, so make sure to ask for more. The caramelized onion tart is another small but tasty option to share between two people.\n\nThe TLT (tempeh, lettuce, and tomato) was a major bummer. The tempeh was cold and hard to bite through, the bread was so dry it tore up the roof of my mouth, and they left off the avocado and mayo. Bison burger was much more moist but practically fell apart upon first bite, so make sure you got a knife and fork at the ready. The kale salad and sweet potatoes are the bomb though. Consider just getting 'em solo to avoid a lackluster entree.\n\nTip 3. Your food will take freakin' forever to get to you.\n\nThe service is obsequious and annoying, but also manages to come off as condescending, impersonal, and rushed? WTH? Doubly annoying since the food usually takes a loooong time to reach your table.
