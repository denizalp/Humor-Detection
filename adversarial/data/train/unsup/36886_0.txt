Went with family for Lunch. With average expectations. \nWe ordered Chola Bhatura, Chilli Pakora, Schzewan Noodles, Mushroom Masala, and more. \n\nAs per my friend this was the best Chola Bhatura in US, I loved the schzewan noodles its like typical Indo-Chinese flavor that is available in India. \nVery good place, surprisingly very distinct Indian food.
