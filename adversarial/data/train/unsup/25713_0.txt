I am not a pretentious burger guy but I found my burger to be amazing.   First - The story on the back of the menu says a lot.   Bubba grew up as a meat guy.  Anyone who knows a great burger understands that a burger is not all ground beef.   There are certain amounts of pork in a burger.\n\nMy burger - The Bonino, Bonino, Bonino Burger\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4RBtw01TZfo\n\nIs a special aptly named after our Hockey Star :)  It is a blend of burger, sausage, grilled onions, and provolone cheese.   It is served with fresh cut sweet potato and traditional fries.\n\nI have a new burger place :)   \n\nBtw they have a pretty good beer selection.
