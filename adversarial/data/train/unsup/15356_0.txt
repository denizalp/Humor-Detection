Good place if you can muster the bill. \n\nThey charge $99 for diagnostic and then apply towards your repair. That is not that bad. However, they quoted me $1150 for this repair. I called around and even dealer had cheaper price by $200!!!! Dealer, for crying out loud.\n\nOn a positive note they took my car in right away. Drove me to work (I work close). Diagnosed my car correctly and in timely manner. All in all everything was very professional. \n\nIf not for the price they surely would be wrenching on my car now. But they not. Ohhh, well.\n\n\"I confuse\"\n\nEugene
