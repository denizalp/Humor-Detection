I have never waited less than 30 minutes in the waiting room then another 20 in the private room typically an hour wait We had an appointment and called to let them know that we was running 10 -15 minutes behind was told we would not be seen and need to be rescheduled no other appointments for more than a week rushed there to get there on time and waited almost an 1 hour more
