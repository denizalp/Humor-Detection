Great chicken balls & lo mein noodles! Fast delivery (I recommend calling vs. using the online ordering system). Very professional and friendly phone reception which makes ordering so much easier. I gotta add that I was pleasantly surprised by the classy delivery service.  I've never had fast food delivered by a sweet young lady carrying a Prada bag lol... interesting. However, I have to take 2 stars off for not-so-good crispy beef, a \"pork-y\" texture & flavour to the inside of the chicken balls (batter is still great though) & below-average value meal combo's.\n\n-#1 Egg rolls: $1.00\/ea\n-#47 Sweet & Sour chicken balls $7.95\n-Q94a Chicken Lo Mein (one of their most popular dishes, choose pork, chicken or beef) $6.75\n-Q69 Crispy Beef $6.75\nGrand total: $32.37\n\nA little pricier than I prefer but we enjoyed it so it's still a nice treat and we would order from East Moon again in the future.
