Was in the area waiting, and decided to give them a try.  Compared to some of the burger places, the prices were nice.  Found the burger to be pretty tasty, especially the grilled onions.  Didn't realize until later that I could have asked for a lettuce wrap or a whole wheat bun (dang small text on menu). Found the fries to be marginal at best.  Assume that they just purchase the pre-done frozen numbers.  They had little to no taste.  I didn't try the shakes, but those suckers were flying out of there while I had diner.  Figure I'll try the onion rings next time.
