This place is really bad.  Doughy, conveyor-belt pizza.  Basically, it's Papa John's inside a cool old gas station.  If you grew up anywhere up North or somewhere that has real pizza, skip this place.  It is really awful, and you're just asking for disappointment.\n\nHowever, if your concept of \"good pizza\" is Papa John's, Domino's, or Little Caesar's, this place is for you.
