This is a chic and sleek place to grab a cocktail after work. In my experience it's pretty dead on the weekend, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because the bar is so small I don't think it could fit more than 25 people comfortably.\n\nThe small parking lot shared with Starbucks and Pei Wei sucks, it's so tight to maneuver your car in there.  Luckily I live within walking distance so I can avoid that nightmare.
