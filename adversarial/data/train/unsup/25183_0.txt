Went to see Toby Mac there on Sunday.  It was a great show, but I wish that it would have been somewhere else.  The Alliant Energy Center Coliseum needs some work.  It's barely been updated.  The acoustics for concerts are absolutely horrible.  I love the fact that it is a smaller venue, but the sound is bad.  The reverb and the echoing is hard to ignore.
