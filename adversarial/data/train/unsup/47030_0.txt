I really really wanted to love this place, but overall, I can only give them an OK rating. I walked in on a Friday at 7:45 PM, service was very lacking, but I understand since they close at 8 and it was a Friday. \n\nNow for the juice, I got #1, #2, #6, #10, #16 and #20. Price isn't bad, around $10 per juice, though it was the first juice place that charged sales taxes (for me at least). I have been to many pressed juice places and this place's juices are definitely sweeter than what I am used to. People might love this place for this exact reason, but I don't. #1 is the only juice I think is ok, but it's really too mild, they really need another mix with more of a kick and all greens. All the other juices I tried are just so so, too much fruit juices in the mix for me, way too sweet overall. I couldn't even finish the kitchen sink and the green milk (I know other people love them, they are just not for me) I will stick with my #1.5 and #4 juices at pressed juicery in the future.
