The experience I had with this business was horrifying. First of all, Harold talked down our Jewellery like it was trash, but he seemed awfully interested in it. We are not idiots. The two rings we wanted to sell were not great and they were not trash. They were middle of the road and we had realistic expectations when we entered Harold's.\n\nSo, after he took possession of our rings he immediately got on his cell phone. He remained on and off his cell phone for the entire hour we were basically held hostage in his back room. Whenever we tried to negotiate, the phone magically rang. He screamed at his wife. He yelled at every single person he talked to. The conclusion i could draw was that he doesn't respect a single person he talked to on that day. In the middle of this nonsense, a group of men came in. Obviously Harold didn't like the looks of them because he locked up the cages and made them talk to him through bars...even as they could plainly see us sitting comfortably at his desk. He talked to them like they were scum and in the end there was no transaction completed. \n\nFinally, he came back to us. At that point, I wanted the rings back and to get out of there ASAP. He refused to offer a fair price so we took the rings back, at which point he treated us like we were in the wrong for not taking his price. He was rude, arrogant, and pretty much mean. I'd never do business with Harold the Jewellery buyer, even if he was the last gold buyer in Toronto.  This experience is the mark by which I measure all bad customer service, and I have yet to have another experience reach the pinnacle of bad experiences that this instance did. Please, do yourself a favour and avoid this place at all costs.
