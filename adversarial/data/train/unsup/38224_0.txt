I've been to OHOP before in Dallas, but have never tried their signature dutch pancakes and thought this was the perfect opportunity for me to try them when my friend came from OKC to visit me in Scottsdale. We were craving pancakes and were excited to find out that there's an OHOP in Scottsdale near Fashion Square, not too far from my apartment in Old Town Scottsdale!\n\nI finally tried the dutch pancake and ordered the Junior Dutch Baby. This pancake was so big and it's the smaller version of the larger original Dutch Pancake! I ordered this and a side of biscuits and gravy. \n\nService:\n\nMy friend and I were seated immediately even though the restaurant seemed pretty busy. It looks like they have more open tables for smaller groups because larger groups of families come here on Sundays for brunch. The waiters were friendly and frequented our table asking to refill our water glasses throughout our brunch. \n\nFood:\n\n*Junior Dutch Baby* the smaller version of the original dutch pancake was still huge! Don't let the name of this fool you. I was only able to eat half of it. I took the other half home. I would say that the dutch pancake tasted like a regular pancake except more eggy. \n\n*Biscuits and Gravy* Two soft and flaky biscuits smothered in sausage gravy. My favorite! I ate half of this and took the other biscuit to-go.\n\nI would highly recommend this place if you don't want to go to IHOP, but are still craving similar breakfast-y type foods. There are a lot of options to choose from the menu. There's something for everyone whether you like a healthy omelet, are craving pancakes and want to stick to the basics, or want to try something new like a dutch pancake.
