It's time for a Public Service Announcement.\n\nLocal Bar + Kitchen now serves a weekend brunch (from 10AM-2PM) according to a flyer we were handed during a precarious evening stroll down douchebag-and-bimbo-infested Carson Street last night (what I would have given for a truckload of Molotov cocktails and legal immunity), but when we went this morning, we saw...a fire truck!\n\nIt turns out that a fire in the kitchen put LB+K out of business for the time being. The apologetic owner greeted us at the door, promising us a hellaciously good brunch whenever they reopen, and I hope they do.
