I heard about this place and decided to try it. All I wanted was a salad. I was happy to see a blue cheese and pear salad..which..i am happy to report...\"blue\" me away it was so delicious! Roasted pecans I think topped this salad and my tongue was very happy. Service was good, friendly, and i want to come back and order something with a beer! A very simple lunch menu is a good thing, too. It tells me the chef thought about this and only picked his or her best items to include.
