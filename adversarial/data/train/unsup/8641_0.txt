If you are not getting comped or expensing dinner, definitely don't go to this Ruth's.  The place is in the pennysaver Harrah's resort.  It's depressing inside the casino, this environment should have been updated 20 years ago.  \n\nI loved Ruth's in Pittsburgh, Louisville, and several other locations, but this one is just not up to the expectations Ruth's advertises.\n\nIf you are looking for an elegant dinner experience there are 100's in Vegas, this is not one.  \n\nThe first indication of an upcoming bad experience, well after entering Harrah's, is there is no enforcement of a dress code.  People had cut off jeans, crop top shirts and flip flops (without the bodies that should be wearing such revealing clothes, I'm talking 200 pound women where the shorts are vacuumed up locations best undescribed).  This wasn't unusual, it was the predominate outfit.  This isn't the pool, but it was the norm when we were there, Monday May 2, 2016.\n\nPretty good cocktail prices, around $15 for specialty drinks.  4 shrimp (1 order) cocktail, the best part of the meal $22, 11 oz (although it looked larger, more like 14 oz) filet for around $60. Sides were priced at market rate.  The Oscar topping was horrible, canned or old crab meat definitely ruined anything it was served on.   It reminded me of the \"cheese\" sauce you buy in 64 oz cans at Sams. It also, seemed like it accompanied almost everything.  The steaks were cooked to order, good but not spectacular.  I'd rate the experience and food quality as that you'd see in a chain, such as Texas Roadhouse, etc.  Not what you'd expect from \"fine\" dining, or prices in this category.\n\nServer John was very attentive, helpful, and was busy but efficient.\n\nExpect to pay around $100 each for a truly uninspiring dinner.  Save your time and money and go elsewhere.
