If i could give more than 5 stars, I would. Tom was absolutely professional and communicative. He really is the best realtor that I've ever met. When the sale of my house took longer than expected because of bank issues, Tom worked tirelessly and was absolutely patient and thorough to get the job done! Thanks for everything, Tom!
