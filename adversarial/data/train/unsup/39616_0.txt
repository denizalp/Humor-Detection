While I was on Vacation in Las Vegas with my wife, we decided to give this restaurant a shot. I had really high hopes for this place, but unfortunately they all came tumbling down. You pay upfront like at a fast food restaurant and the tip is asked about upfront as well if you're paying with a card. How do I know how much to tip if I haven't experienced the customer service or the food quality yet?\n\nWhen they brought out our food to the table, we were surprised to see the paper plates and plastic utensils. Customer service was fine, but the food was mediocre at best. These types of dishes are not meant to be served fast food style and the quality and the taste of the food suffered greatly because of it. Haleem tasted like lentil soup, Chicken Tikka Masala tasted as if it was just reheated, and the Bihari Kabob (beef dish) wasn't cooked all the way through. They charge dine-in restaurant type prices for fast food.  Not worth it. I was very disappointed with my experience. If you're looking for Halal options, I understand there are very limited options, but I would keep looking.
