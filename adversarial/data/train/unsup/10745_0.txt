BEFORE YOU GO:\n--Know the address and where to park: If you type in Camelback Mountain on Google Maps, it will take you to a residential neighborhood and you'll never get to a trail. Instead, type \"Cholla trailhead camelback mountain - parking\" which will take you to a long street that has street parking on both sides. The address is 5121 N Invergordon Rd, Paradise Valley, AZ 85253. Parking will be tough on the weekends so go early!\n\n--Bring gloves: you will be touching a lot of rocks and it will hurt. I got lucky and fortunately had a bandana in my camelbak that I forgot about. I ended up wrapping it around my hands when touching rocks.\n\n--Bring a camelbak\/drawstring\/bag because water (duh) but also because you want to keep your hands as free as possible when you reach the rocks.\n\n--Bring a hat and sunglasses\n\n--Bring sunscreen\n\n\nTIPS\/SUGGESTIONS:\n--Go early: parking gets tougher later but also you don't want to go up when the sun is out and in full force.\n\n--Take your time: it gets more difficult as you get closer to the top; don't feel the need to go all the way up if you can't or don't want to. Some people told us they didn't go all the way so no pressure.\n\n--Let people pass if they are right behind you because you don't want to feel rushed. Everyone goes at their own pace and the trails can get narrow at certain points. Stay to the side for a bit until they pass.\n\nThis was probably the toughest hike that I've ever done but I loved every minute of it. I loved climbing the rocks and feeling tired but wanted to keep going. Overall it took us three hours to go up and down but we took a decent amount of breaks along the way. It was a bit scary at times because my shoes would slip while on gravel and there were other times where there was a steep drop but overall it was fun. The view at the top is good but not great but I think the hike itself is awesome.
