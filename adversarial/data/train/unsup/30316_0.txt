I am going to bump up Firkin today because I honestly cannot find any fault with them.  I have been in a few times now.  I have tried the fish'n'chips, the Guiness steak and mushroom pie, Mama's meatloaf, calamari, onion rings, and Irish nachos.  It has all been fantastic.  The meatloaf is frilled and tastes like steak.  The tartar sauce is so good my dad says he could eat it with a spoon and nothing else.  The fish is big pieces and perfectly fried leaving the fish inside tender and flaky while the batter is crunchy.  It is all so good.  Equally impressive is the staff.  Always professional.  Always personable.  It is a beautiful restaurant on the inside.  The bar is amazing.  The beer selection is extensive.  I am telling everybody I know about Firkin.  Vegas locals and out of towners take note, Firkin is a place you really ought to stop into at least once.
