Traveling and saw this reviewed well on Yelp. Both my wife and I got tacos and they were excellent.  I tried the street corn because it was something different I had never tried before. I'm still a Midwest kind of guy, so corn on the cob with a little butter and salt is perfection for me, but this was a nice dish with the cheese and spices, worth trying at least once.  Next time I'm in town I will definitely visit again.
