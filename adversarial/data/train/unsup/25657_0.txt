Topgolf is one of the best ideas I have ever heard . It's a driving range\/bar .\n\nThe driving range is not your typical driving range . It's three stories high with each group having your own lane and clubs. Wish they had a better selection of clubs though. Their is a couple of games you can play with the group from competitive to just having a great time . All levels of play can go and succeed at the games . \n\nThe bar is really packed on the weekends and tough to get a drink but once you get on your lane which can sometimes be a hours long wait you have you own personal bar tender which is awesome . \n\nI definitely recommend going to top golf. The only reason I give it  4 stars is because of the slow bar service and the amount of choices for clubs is slim
