Awesome tacos,  delicious sides, everything tasted really fresh. I had the frozen strawberry margarita and my husband had the house margarita, both were excellent. Portions are a tad on the small side for the price, but the quality was really good. It was about a ten minute wait at 7pm on a Saturday. Prompt service, clean bathrooms. My only negative was that it was pretty loud in the restaurant.
