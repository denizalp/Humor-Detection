I go to this location all the time only due to convenience.  I always order some sort of iced coffee and 9 times out of 10 its a sloppy mess that is running down my hand and car.  I don't understand how they even pass the drink out to me in the drive thru when they see that it is clearly not wiped down on the sides.  I was hesitant to write a post since I go here often but I'm pretty much over how careless these employees are and how much I pay for sloppy coffee messes.
