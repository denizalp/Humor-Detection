All McD's these days are new and updated.  Electronic kiosks to pay, an updated interior and exterior.  This McD's is not that old.  This entire section for this Smart Centre is relatively new.  New stores, new mall... so new the roads aren't even done yet (closer to Major Mack and Weston).\n\nThis McD's has their rather busy drive through facing north and it seems this place has a busier drive through (which is 24 hours by the way) rather than the dine in.  The place has THREE parking spots up front.  That's right 3.  All the other parking is basically on the other side of the drive through.  \n\nWhen using the app I wasn't sure what the address was of this restaurant because there's a McD's at 3500 as well as 3600 Major Mack.  I had to ask.  I was told this place was 3500 and that 3600 was the McD's inside of WalMart.\n\nThis McD's didn't have to be renovated to meet the new modern look.  It's been built so recently it didn't have to be.  \n\nIt is sort of a pain to get to however... you have to turn into Cityview and then turn into the parking lot while cars are coming from both directions of Cityview.  Getting in and out isn't as easy as it should be and the restaurant rests adjacent and visible to Major Mack for the sake of knowing it's a McD's, their store is their advertisement.\n\nStill, sort of a bottleneck to access...
