About a month ago I came in looking for help building a computer. I said I wasn't buying anything that day and the guy pretty much got rid of me as fast as he could. A week later I spent $2,700 online for parts instead. Today I figured I'd give them another shot. I was trying to get a monitor that the average price is $750 but their price is $800. They wouldn't price match it. I'll never buy anything from here or even try from now on. Best Buy is so much better than Fry's commision hungry workers.
