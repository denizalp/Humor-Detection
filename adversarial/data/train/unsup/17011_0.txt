I come here for three reasons: 1. My roomies are always hungry. 2. My roomies are always drunk and want ice cream. 3. They have good ice cream\/gelato\/boba\/smoothie. EVERYTHING.\n\nI really don't know where to start as far as for flavor. They have everything and they always have something new. You can go back as much as you want and they won't have the flavor you had yesterday but something new will replace it.\n\nIce Cream: First try, I had a medium. OMG Too much. Second time, a small. Still A LOT. Third time, I got the kid's small. Two scoops. Perfect for me. For the adult size, you can have 1 or 2 mix in (depending on the size). Mix ins varies and there are a lot of choices!\n\nBoba: I'm a true fan of boba. But their best ones are the fruit smoothie bobas!\n\nI would defo come back here. Especially on a very hot Vegas summer day.
