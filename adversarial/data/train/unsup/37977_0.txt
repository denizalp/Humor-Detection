I have been going to this nail salon since it opened. I may not come every other week to get my nails done but whenever I need a mani pedi, this is my go to place. I have noticed a decline in the quality of the regular mani pedi. There's inconsistency in the quality, depending on who I get. I recommend Leah, she's meticulous and she treats her customers well. Unfortunately on my last visit, I had Nancy doing my toe nails and Joanna my finger nails. They got both done in less than half an hour (25 mins to be exact). It was very rush!!! It wasn't busy at all, only one other customer getting a shellac. It's not like they had other customers waiting for them. My toe nails looked very sloppy. The top coat on some of my finger nails \"bled\" to the sides because it wasn't applied properly, which I didn't notice it until they're dried. The drying process took 1\/2 hr because the fans were completely clogged up with dust, there's very little air coming out of them. No one came back to check on me until I removed myself from the drying machines. Both of my nail technicians were too busy playing with their phones! \n\nNext time I will call in advance and I ask for Leah. This is still one of the more affordable places along Yonge St for nail services, so I'm hoping they'll step up their game and get their quality back to where it was when they first opened. And please, clean the fans in those drying machines. They're pretty much useless.
