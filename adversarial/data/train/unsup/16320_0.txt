This place is VERY new. So new that I think not many people know about it. \n\nI'm not really into the club scene but the BF wanted to check it out. It was a Sunday night. We got on the guest list and got in free. The place never really reached its full potential. It never got full of people. But that doesn't mean it wasn't nice and that people shouldn't give it a chance.\n\nThe music was great. All it truly needed was more people. The place was very clean and looked nice. \n\nThere was a bathroom attendant and he was super cool. I don't know if this is the norm in vegas clubs but he started my water and would pump the soap for me when I would wash my hands and even give me a napkin to wipe off. He was probably the coolest part of coming here for me personally haha.\n\nOverall people should check this place out. I think it has the potential to be big. All it needs is to have a solid base of customers and for that to happen people need to stick with this place.
