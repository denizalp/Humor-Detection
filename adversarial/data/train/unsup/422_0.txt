The corned beef hash wasn't from a can which is always nice.  They also used red potatoes instead of russett which is unusal and awesome for corned beef hash.  The fruit was high quality. And the pancakes were super tastey. I wasn't a huge fan of the seasoning on the home style taters but they were cooked properly so us just a preferance. \n\nI was happy with th service. Nothing above and beyond, but nothing negative to say either. \n\nThe establishment was clean and their batfooms were above average.
