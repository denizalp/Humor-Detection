It was our meal in Vegas before heading back to good ol' Southern Cal. We were looking for some good dim sum but initially was mildly disappointed when we looked at the menu and it consisted of only a number of dumpling dishes. \n\nIf you are looking for a comprehensive dim sum with carts of piping hot dim sum navigating the tight spaces between tables, this place is not one of them. However, if you're looking for some authentic Shanghai style dim sum and food, definitely check this place out.\n\nWe ended up ordering an order of Shanghai Style Noodle and  3 different style dim sum, Pan Fried Xiao Long Bao, Steam Xiao Long Bao and Fried Pork & Vegetable Dumpling. \n\nAll the dishes were good and it did take a while for our dish to arrive so I can only surmise that the dumplings were made\/cook to order? It tasted as much as the dumplings where hot and juicy but the wrappers where not soggy, a tell-tell sign of frozen dumplings. \n\nThe dish that stood out the most and highly recommended was the Pan Fried Xiao Long Bao. I've never had these before so when the waiter brought them out, I was a bit surprised. They didn't look like the usual steamed ones I'm accustomed to eating.\n\n Instead, these look like tiny little Hum Baos with sesame sea and chives on top. Once you bite into them, the soup begins to ooze out. I can't stop thinking about them. I'm on the look out for a Shanghai Chinese in SoCal just to get a chance to try these Pan Fried Xiao Long Baos again. Anyone in the 626 know of such a place?
