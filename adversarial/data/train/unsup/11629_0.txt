The Vig has DEFINITELY become one of my very favorite spots, so I am doing an update. \n\nYou absolutely have to sit out on the patio for the best experience! Especially this time of year (early spring). \n\nTry the artichoke dip and the Alfredo tortellini with a glass of the Kung Fu Girl Riesling. I'm serious. If you don't, you are making the worst mistake of your life! \n\nThe service is always friendly and pretty quick. Pam, the manager, is normally bopping around making sure everything is running smooth. \n\nI don't mind walking across the street to park, and it is super cool that they have The Vig Rig ... a free van that will pick you up AND take you home, all for a tip! I have never taken the Rig, but I keep the card handy in my wallet should I ever have an insatiable need to visit the Vig once I am already imbibed. Or without vehicle. \n\nAlso, it is worth a trip to the bathrooms. They are really cool and smell so great!
