I am a believer!!!! Best 1.5 hours I've spent here door to door. Came to Vegas for a work conference, after having a street cocktail\/slushy and then continuing with wine, then another cocktail - it's no surprise that I woke up at 5:30 am with the inability to keep anything down, focus a thought, stand\/sit up without shaking. All while I actually needed to work through the day. (We were in bed by 10pm so I couldn't even chalk it up to a ton of bad decisions)\nMy husband joked \"you should call Hangover  Heaven, they'll get you back to right\". ... Another hour into the most epic hangover I googled it (as the suggestion was very passive) and as soon as they opened, I called.\nStaff is amazing!!!! Everyone there was courteous, professional, clean and safe. Best money I've spent on this trip. A pill to help me stop shaking, anti neausea and anti pain all while rehydrating ... Add that to the blend of antioxidants and the shot of B12, all while breathing some oxygen (which as a non smoker Vegas Casinos have plugged me up with all the smoke\/perfumed cover up pumping out of all vents. True concierge service level in every manner.\n\nI left a better woman than I've felt in a whole long time\n\nThanks y'all - hope I don't have to see you again but won't mind if I ever do!\n\nYour San Antonio friend, with the bad neausea
