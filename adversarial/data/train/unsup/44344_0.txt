This store is always empty and the owner is a big jerk but  I had to make a quick grocery run for Persian desserts and begrudgingly opted to go there as it was very close to my house.  1 star rating for the jerk owner and 5 stars to the very nice young lady who went out of her way to help me because the rude owner couldn't be bothered helping the one and only customer in the store.   My Persian friends won't even go there.
