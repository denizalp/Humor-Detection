My rating is 3.5 stars.\n\nI have a few food phases happening in 2018. The earlier part of the year was fried chicken. My current quests are chicken wings and shawarma.\n\nI have noticed that I spent a lot of time having shawarma in Mississauga, mainly because my favourite shawarma place, Pita and Grill, is located there. I just happen to also work in this city, so it's easy for me to get my fix.\n\nWell, how about Markham? Where can I go for delicious shawarma? I decided to give Shawarma Stop a try the other night.\n\nI got there at around 7 pm on a Friday night. i walked in and there was a bit of a lineup. It was a good sign.\n\nI went with the chicken shawarma wrap. I got everything on it, except the hot sauce, garlic sauce, and turnips. The woman putting my wrap together was so nice, as was the man who set up my debit card purchase and packed up my order for takeout.\n\nWhile waiting, I looked at the enormous box of poutine that a table had ordered. There were four folks there. It is delivered to them without closing the lid. I hope that they were sharing it. It is way too much for a single person to devour, except if you have been on a fast for four days.\n\nMy wrap was put together pretty fast. It was huge! The ingredients were fresh. It was good, but the chicken wasn't as yummy as what I get at Pita and Grill. The problem towards the end was that everything was falling out of my wrap. I needed a utensil to pick up the remaining quarter of the filling. It does get messy, but you have plenty of napkins to help you out!\n\nThere is plenty of parking, even with Shanghai Nook Restaurant's recent grand opening within the same plaza. I parked in front of Blinds To Go, which was pretty dead.\n\nI will try the platter next time and see if this place becomes my shawarma stop close to home.\n\n(349)
