BB&B is a fantastic place to shop.  I stopped in for a garlic press.  I stopped by customer service for directions.  Once I got to the kitchen utensil area there was another worker there to assisted me in locating one of two types of garlic presses.  After my selection was made, I went back upfront to pay and the same worker opened a register to ring up my purchase.  Service was quick and with a smile and I like that a lot!  This BB&B is clean and although the isles are filled with more items for purchase, they store did not feel cluttered and everything was in its rightful place.
