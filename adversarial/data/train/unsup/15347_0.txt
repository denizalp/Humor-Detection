I really can't say that I am a fan. Crucify me all you want, but no ramen place in town has been able to touch Monta. I know they are different type of ramen broth, yada, yada, yada...but no ramen has left me craving for more like Monta has. \n\nThis place is located on the corner of Trop and Eastern, in the Burlington Coat Factory parking lot, next to Baskin Robbins. I met Jaime W here right as they opened. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant clean and simple yet modern. I opted for the tonkotsu miso with extra side of chashu. Jaime went with their Tan tan ramen. My ramen was okay, the pieces of chashu were extremely fatty and falling apart. The broth was very salty without much flavor. I finished my bowl as I felt it was okay, not return worthy, but not gag worthy either. Jaime left practically entire bowl untouched. We also had a side of chicken kaarage of which I could not eat more than one small piece. The meat was just so fatty and poor quality while also drenched in grease.\n\nThe couple next to us with whom we struck up a conversation were not pleased with their food either, and left their bowls practically untouched. Maybe it was just a bad morning?  The prices were reasonable, the server friendly and when asked to split our check she didn't look at u like we just asked her to split an atom. \n\nAlso, don't go bathing suit shopping after eating a bowl of ramen. Just a heads up.
