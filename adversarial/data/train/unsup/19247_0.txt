What a joke. Book a room in the west tower and get here to find that they OVERBOOKED so they stick my ass in the manor lodge that is less expensive, without refunding the difference. I WAS a frequent guest at this hotel, staying here every couple of months but after this stunt, that will not be happening again. This is how you treat loyal guests? You just lost one.
