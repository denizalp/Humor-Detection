I was leaving from the Pittsburgh Airport early in the morning so I decided to stay here for 8 hours before my fight. I quickly determined this to be a very bad choice. First impression wasn't good as the parking lot had no lights on when I pulled in. It got worse from there. The door to the room didn't latch right and I had to push quite hard to close it. The room was odd smelling and you could see a line of dirt around the room where the vacuum cleaner couldn't conveniently get. The bathroom toilet wouldn't flush right and the power button was broke on the air conditioner (to turn it on and off you needed to press the surge protector \"Rest\"\/\"Test\" button). They claimed to have WiFi but something was wrong because it wouldn't allow me to connect. The best thing about this place is I got to leave without getting stabbed.
