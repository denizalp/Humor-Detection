This is definitely the \"It Spot\" for a great Italian meal in the East end! I came in here on a Friday night and there was a line up out the door for tables. They don't take reservations unless your a party over 8 so be prepared to wait. Luckily our wait was only about 15 minutes.\n\nWe were seated at a cozy table right beside the bar. The place was packed mostly of couples. It's a rather small restaurant with tables spaced pretty close together but I suppose it makes for intimate dining especially with the dim lighting, exposed brick walls and Frank Sinatra playing in the background.\n\nOur waiter came over with the menus and pointed out the chalkboard on the wall with the nightly specials. We started off with two glasses of Zindfandel as we browsed the menus. Everything looked soo delicious so we just decided to share a bunch of mains.\nAfter placing our order the waiter brought over a basket of fresh sliced whole wheat bread and butter for us to nibble away on as we awaited our feast.\n\nPizza\nWe decided on sharing one of there wood burning oven pizza as an appetizer.\nPopeye Pizza - Tomato sauce, goat cheese, spinach, prosciutto, and mozzarella\nThin crust pizza with ample fresh toppings arrived probably within 10 minutes fresh out of the oven. I couldn't flaw it, completely delicious!\n\nFor mains\nSpaghetti Bolognese - Ground beef finished in tomato sauce\nThick chunky meaty sauce with perfectly cooked noodles came out piping hot topped with generously shaved portions of fresh Parmesan\n\nSeared Salmon Filet - Served w\/ grilled vegetables with a balsamic reduction\nPerfectly cooked generous portion of salmon and grilled vegetables with a nice smokey flavour plus that delicious balsamic another wining main\n\nEverything came out fast, fresh, and piping hot and generous in size!\nAfter that meal we were sooo stuffed but couldn't resist taking a look at the dessert menu\n\nChocolate Gelato - Two scoops of rich chocolate gelato topped with a strawberry\nWashed down with a fresh cup of coffee my o my we need to be wheeled out of the restaurant!\n\nI can totally see why this place is always packed! I'm soo happy it's in my neck of the woods! Fast, fresh, authentic italian food with friendly service what's not to love!\nPlus our meal of a pizza, two mains, two glasses of wine, two cups of coffee, and dessert came to less than 80 bucks! It's definitely worth the trek out to the East end!\n\nFYI its located at the end on a strip plaza so parking is limited. Park directly across the street at the CIBC
