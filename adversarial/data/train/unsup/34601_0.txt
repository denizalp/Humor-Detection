I mostly go to the Liquid Nutrition in Cours Mont Royal although I've been to the one on Guy a couple times.\n\nThey serve all kinds of smoothies and meal replacements, protein powders, vitamins, wheatgrass shots and other foods for the health conscious person.\nMy favorite are their milk-based smoothies either made with regular milk or almond\/soy milks. The menu has changed a bit over the years but they keep a wide selection and when you walk in the store, you can easily read and understand what every drink is made of.\n\nI've tried their \"Early Bird\" meal placements which are on the pricier side and do make you feel full but unfortunately don't taste so great. The chocolate or vanilla flavored protein powders is something I'll never be a fan of.\n\nCompared to Jugo Juice, Liquid Nutrition is actually cheaper and has more variety.\n\nIt's something I like to treat myself with once in a while - I can easily make these at home but when you're outside and feel like something refreshing or a snack, this does the job.
