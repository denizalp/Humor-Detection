Just got put in my place by the barista because she didn't bother to read the side of the cup, apparently my $6 beverage is too complicated to bother her. I'm guessing she won't be working there long. Upside, the other staff member at the register was extremely helpful and should be able to clean up her coworkers mess. Lucky her.
