I was happy to see this place open up in Peoria, since the only Brazilian steakhouses I've been to have all been in Vegas.  And for that reason, my expectations were set pretty high.  \n\nThe food was excellent, the wine list was decent and included a number of things I've never tried, and the atmosphere was conducive to good conversation.  \n\nDinged them one star because the prices were Vegas prices, not Peoria prices. A little steep for the average night out with friends.  But if you're hungry for some amazing food, and you're a baller with cash to throw around, this is the spot.
