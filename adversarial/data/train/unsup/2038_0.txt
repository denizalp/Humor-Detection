Good espresso for a great price! Probably the best bang for your buck in all of downtown Toronto. The flavour is lighter than what I prefer and I wish they had more breakfast options.  Right now they have baklava, bougatsa, spinach pie and some muffins in the morning.  Lunch options are available and change daily. \n\nThe decor of this place is gorgeous. I would decorate my house like this. Outside in front of the shop is a cute little bistro area for sitting. They are doing construction  for what I am guessing is a backyard patio.
