Absolutely delicious!! Different, fun and yummy!\nWe arrived 15 minutes after opening (5:15pm). The place was pretty much all to ourselves! But it didn't take long for this place to start hopping!\nWe are currently in the keto diet so this was a great place for us. We ordered the hell out of some meat! Honestly my favorite was the chicken and thought least of their signature. My hubby ordered the original broth soup while I had the spicy. I am a huge spicy guru and they mild is pretty mild. If you're like me get the medium. Now he did explain that if it's not spicy enough he will fix it up for you. \nUpon entering they were right at our side explaining everything to us. There is high energy dance music playing which was pretty pleasant. The waiter was very good, attentive and fun. He let us know if we aren't making a mess then we aren't doing it right! \nThey have a type of sauce buffet where you create your own sauces. That part was a lot of fun. A bit later I saw a long line to the sauce bar. I was very happy we had it all to ourselves when we enjoyed that part of our meal. The food is severed immediately. \nThey have a conveyor belt with plenty of extras. \nWe left stuffed! They asked if we would like desert but we couldn't eat another bite. \nThe prices are amazing. We had everything we wanted and kept ordering and walked out paying $50 including tip. \nI highly recommend this place. It's fun, fresh and worth every dime.
