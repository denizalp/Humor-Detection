Came here for takeout after work one night. I ordered two combinations with steamed veggies. It included grilled shrimp, beef and chicken with lots of onion, broccoli and carrots.. More veggies than meat I should add. It would have been fine except all of the meats were overcooked. Not just overcooked but dry and bland. The two items came with standard small boxes of rice. $11.95 for each of these meals were hardly worth it. The only uplifting component to the whole experience was the very friendly cashier ringing me out. \n\nIt was bad enough I was craving more savory, calorie ridden dishes, and I was actually trying to be good this time.. But this doesn't warrant a return customer. Sorry.
