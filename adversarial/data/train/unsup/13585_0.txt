The most AMAZING breakfast to be found at Payard \n\nAfter stalking them out on Yelp, Sis & I planned our visit for a scrumptious brunch to send us on our way, back to SF \n\nWait staff was uber-friendly & super-attentive w\/ the water & coffee which was incredibly appreciated, given our state of dehydration & decaffeination \n\nSis had the Cheddar & Broccoli Quiche w\/ a side of Pommes Rissolet; the Brioche French Toast for me \n\nQuiche was thick & high & the crust tasted completely homemade - buttery & flaky \n\nFrench Toast was the best I have *ever* tasted - so custardy that it pulled apart like goopy custard - paired w\/ freshly macerated fruit in all its own natural juices, provided the perfect amount of sweetness \n\nThe Home Fries were phenomenal - flash fried, we see this huge plume of fire coming up from the prep area but the chef wasn't worried so we knew all was well.....that fire crisped up the taters but left them mushy on the inside = ooo, ahh, heaven \n\nAnd Sis, who is a ketchup fan, didn't even feel the need to use a drop b\/c those taters were so yummy \n\nPayard is definitely our GO-TO b-fast spot for all our future Vegas jaunts!!
