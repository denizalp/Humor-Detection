This store was mostly clothing for men, but it did have vinyl. So this is my review on the vinyl section only. BUYER BEWARE! You are being ripped off. I'm a record buyer. This is my job. I know my shit and what I don't know, I look up (yes, there is a blue book for vinyl collectors). I picked up a Todd Rundgren album and this place was trying to charge 90 bucks or so for it because it was a first pressing. First pressing or not, it was only worth 20 bucks at the most. We sell it for 2 used. The clothes seemed overpriced and generic also.
