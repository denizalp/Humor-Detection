If I could give this company zero stars I would.  I had ordered a package from Nespresso.  They shipped it to me via OnTrac.  When the package did not arrive on the expected date, I went online and tracked the package through OnTrac's website.  It showed that the package was delivered in Santa Maria and was left inside the gate.  I don't live in Santa Maria AND I don't have a gate. I emailed their customer service department and asked them to look into the problem with my package delivery.  After 3 days and no word. I called OnTrac's 800 number and sat on hold for 1 hour.  I was told that they had instructed the driver to go back to the address where he left the package.  After another 5 days, I received an email from OnTrac telling me that the driver confirmed that he delivered it to the correct address and that I should contact Nespresso for a new shipment.  What??  I contacted Nespresso and they replaced my order and I told them to never use OnTrac if they want their goods delivered to the correct address.
