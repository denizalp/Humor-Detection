We purchased a car stereo from big box retailer, but because of their high installation charge, opted to have it installed elsewhere (mistake!!). Everything seemed fine with the installation at first, but a couple of days later I tried using AM for the first time, and found that it didn't work. They did fix it when I returned but, presumably due to damage caused during the first installation, AM stations were very unclear and practically unusable. A couple of months later, the stereo stopped working entirely. Rather than return to Number One Sound, we had a friend fix it. He found that electrical tape was used in place of soldering, and the connection had come loose. Very shoddy work. Thankfully, he was able to fix it for us, saving us another trip to Number One Sound.
