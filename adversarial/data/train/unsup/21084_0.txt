Charlotte-Douglas Airport is pretty standard for those jetsetting or catching a connecting flight to the left coast. Don't be late, don't give a bunch of guff to TSA, understand that airport vittles, restaurants and other eateries most likely won't receive a Michelin Star, and don't leave your bags unattended then you'll probably have a palatable experience. \n\nOne thing I do love about the QC's airport is the variation in security checkpoints. If you A and B are slammed busy, walk down about 50 yards to C or D and the lines are almost always shorter and typically faster. Most people congregate to A and B since they are closer to the beginning of curbside drop-off. Fear not! On those buys travel days, seek out the slimmer lines of the other TSA's at C and D. You'll be happy you did. \n\nGlad to have a very accessible and friendly airport in town. Happy to fly out and even more excited to fly back in! Also, I think most of the construction at baggage claim is wrapping up for the most part. Lookin' rather clean! Great job!
