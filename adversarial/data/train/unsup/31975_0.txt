Security is on their A game and there's plenty of them, which makes for a safe environment.  Once you enter there's a dance floor and a DJ booth. Towards the back there are classic carnival games and pool tables. There is also a clean restaurant adjacent to the bar in case you get hungry. There are TV's spread out around this area. If you walk further back you'll exit onto the huge foyer area where there's more games like bean bag toss and a mini stage with live performances.  They did a great job renovating this place and making it a nice little hang out spot.  My only gripe is it can be a little crowded especially in the small bathrooms. However,  they do have a bathroom attendant inside.
