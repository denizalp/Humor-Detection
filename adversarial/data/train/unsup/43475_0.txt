The food here is excellent. Everything we had from the apps. to Ramen was to die for.  Excellent flavors, super fresh and the noodles are made in-house.  It's a cool vibe, good, loud music (Bowie, The Cult, etc.). My only complaint is I forgot my to-go container at the table and went back to pick it up within 5 minutes of walking outside and they had thrown it away.  VERY disappointing.  I was looking forward to the leftovers. Other than that it was great and we will be back!
