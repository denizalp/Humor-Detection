Visiting the new location in Oakland! Couldn't be happier!! I got the B.B. King bowl and it's amazing. Fresh ingredients, healthy and flavorful. The staff is so friendly and Emilee is fantastic! I've been to the Sewickly location too where I did a CLEANSE and anyone needing to detox or just reset - DO IT! Don't be scared. I did two days and never felt hungry  - ask for Brooke if you have any questions on cleanses. Highly recommend.
