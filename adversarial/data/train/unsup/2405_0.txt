I was a pretty odd child growing up.  I knew more Beatles songs than I did Top 20.  I watched \"Grease\" more times than I can possibly remember.  I owned the \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack.\n\nSo ever since I heard about the Australian Bee Gees show at Excalibur I knew I had to make my way down there sooner or later.  Fortunately, I found a good deal on tickets one day and jumped at the opportunity.\n\nThis is a pretty no-frills show; but what they lack in stage production, they make up for in every other way possible.  These performers look and sound very similar to the Bee Gees.  The music is spot-on.  If you consider yourself a Bee Gees fan, you will really enjoy this.\n\nOther than \"Saturday Night Fever\" and a few more songs I knew, I assumed the Bee Gees were pretty much a mid- to late- 1970's group.  Imagine my surprise when I got to the show and didn't know many of the songs they were singing!  It definitely gave me a new appreciation of this band.  It was a lot of fun to sit around and listen to some music, and they even opened up \"Club Mo\" for everyone that wanted to dance to their more popular disco songs.\n\nOne of the downsides to the show was that it was an older crowd (at least the night I was there), so the audience wasn't getting too lively with the music.  Also, the banter between the performers was a little slow and forced.\n\nI considered giving 3-stars because the show is a bit slow at first.  But then I decided that it wasn't fair- it's just the nature of the earlier Bee Gees songs and nothing on the part of the performers. \n\nIf you are in any way a Bee Gees fan, I think you'll love this show.  For those that are interested but aren't necessarily a big fan of the group, I think this would still be a fun show to see- especially if you can get a deal on tickets.
