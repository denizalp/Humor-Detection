Today is national coffee day. Started my morning with a venti ice caramel macchiato from Starbucks... From the flamingo location. \n\nSince I'm off from work today I wanted to enjoy myself so I went to this location inside Target to get a Venti ice water with 3 scoops of matcha powder... Which I always order every day at work for myself or even for my team at work. Tell me why this guy who rang it up came to almost $6? As much as a ice caramel macchiato? I always order the water with matcha powder and it's always under $3. I asked why so much? He replied they charge $2.50 for every scoop of matcha... Wth, that doesn't make sense for one scoop to be that pricey. I told him I've ordered it before here and it wasn't that much, he than just smirk. I don't mind paying $6 for a drink if it's worth it, like my venti ice caramel macchiato but for water and matcha powder?! So I said nvm and walked away... Basically ruined my Target shopping experience lol. Not coming back to this Starbucks location since I can't purchase my drinks at the prices they are suppose to be.
