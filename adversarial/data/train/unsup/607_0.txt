I took in a rocking chair to be recovered, parking is awkward. You have to park in the back then carry your item quite a ways, or park on the one way road out front.\n Very sweet owners, helped us pick fabrics that would last.\n They offered to touch the wood up for me, I generously said ok. \n However the cost was a shock. Major sticker shock. I'm glad they are doing it, I feel totally supported in good hands.
