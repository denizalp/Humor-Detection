This place is hidden in the caverns of Container Park. But once you find it, you'll feel like you just completed a level on Tomb Raider set to expert mode. \n\nI'm a certified coffee junkie, I like to drink it at all hours of the day. So after a brief meeting in downtown and a shopping spree at Kappa Toys, my energy levels had greatly decreased. As I checked-out of Kappa Toys, the fella behind the counter noticed my sluggish demeanor and mentioned that I'll get 10% off my coffee purchase at ChillSpot with my receipt. Yay for caffeine & discounts! \n\nI walked through the Container Park trying find the elusive coffee spot, when a  beacon of angelic light bounced off a window and blinded me, as my eyes refocused there it was, \"ChillSpot By SasaSweets\". Right behind the elevator, in probably one of the smaller locations in Container park. \n\nThey not only does this place offer coffee both Iced and hot, the also have boba drinks, shaved iced, and ice cream made with liquid nitrogen... Science! Chill Spot will be the got-to-hot-spot in Container Park during the many warm months here in Vegas. \n\nBack to me... I ordered a basic iced coffee with some type Thai flavored cream instead of my usual nonfat milk, with the worker's suggestion. The guy behind the counter offers it to me and says, \"Try it, if you don't like, I'll make you another one. No Charge\". I tried, I liked it, I bought it. The drink wasn't overly sweet and the cream wasn't super thick, a nice change from the normal iced coffee companion. The larger cost me $3, not bad considering I pay around the same amount at the BUX. \n\nThis place not only offer solid drinks, but their customer service is stellar! Next time I'm at Container Park, it's boba time!
