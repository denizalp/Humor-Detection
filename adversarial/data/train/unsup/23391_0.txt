What's that noise you hear? Oh, that was me grumbling that Gandhi Roti[1], though delicious, is too expensive for a hole-in-the-wall take-out joint that doesn't even have the decency to throw in some free chutney or pickles--or any other freebies with your order to compensate for the long waits and trapping pungent odors reminiscent of a NYC cab in your hair, long after you've paid and gone home to eat your food.\n\nLucky for nit-picky, pain-in-the-ass diners like me, and the 10 other Yelpers in our group, partner establishment Mother India has the same exact food as Gandhi Roti at the SAME prices BUT also provides: menus, tables, seats, servers, real plates, real cutlery, and carafes of water to fill your metal cup.\n\nFOOD\nI went with my favorite: saag paneer roti at medium heat. The saag (spinach puree) is dense and creamy, interlaced with the occasional potato chunk and cube of paneer (homemade cheese) to break up the monotony. All of it is tucked snug into a big sturdy blanket of tasty roti (Indian flatbread). And when they say \"medium,\" they really mean medium, not wimpy Toronto medium.\n\nMy saag paneer roti tasted exactly the same as at Gandhi but I think the portion may have been smaller because I was able to finish it this time. (Or maybe my stomach has adjusted to piggy-Toronto portion sizes.)\n\nWith one bite of Connie T's mutter paneer, I was hooked on the buttery curry of peas and paneer. So mutter-flippin' good!\n\nThe vegetarian roti start at $7.95 and the non-vegetarian roti are around $12.95 (butter chicken, for example). \n\nSoda, lassi and teas are available but no alcohol.\n\nSERVICE\nBrisk and efficient; blessedly free of the \"Yes, right away, ma'am\" and refilling-my-water-glass-after-every-sip business I see at other Indian restaurants. The dishes arrive as the kitchen prepares them so don't expect all 11 roti to hit the table at the same time. But I adhere to the old rule that it's OK to eat when at least three diners have been served, anyway.\n\nVIBE\nA no-frills dining room that looks like it could be rented out after-hours for AA meetings.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nEverything I love about Gandhi Roti, minus everything I hate about Gandhi Roti. 5 stars.\n\n==================================================================\n[1] See my review http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/gandhi-cuisine-toronto-2#hrid:CyIrVNuKjgUIfE9q7PxM-w
