Hemenway Valley Park\n\n5 Stars!!!!\n\nI didn't come here for a BBQ.  I didn't come here to shoot hoops.  I stopped by Hemenway Valley Park to see the Big Horn Sheep.  The park has a lot of open field.  There, you'll find Big Horn Sheep just minding their own business.  They're just chillin'.  And if Big Horn Sheep wrote Yelp reviews, I'm sure that they'd give this park 5 Stars too.  \n\nTIP #1:  Located in Boulder City, NV\nTIP #2:  Views of Lake Mead\nTIP #3:  I didn't see any goats
