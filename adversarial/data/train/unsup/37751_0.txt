Ordered the Bibimbap.  Server gave me a red bottle which I thought was the red sauce.  It came out a strange yellow.  I thought that was odd, thinking he must have given me mayo or something.  Hoping that my food wasn't ruined, I tasted it to see if it could be salvaged. Turns out it wasn't food, let alone mayo, it was DISHWASHING DETERGENT.\n\nNeedless to say I won't be back.
