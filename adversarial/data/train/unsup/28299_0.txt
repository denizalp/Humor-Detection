went there yesterday for the Veteran's Day special. Turns out they allowed you to pick out anything in the menu and they paid for it. I had the beef brisket cheeseburger with smokey bbq sauce. Executed perfectly and tasted fantastic. their signature beers were only $5 for me and my guests. I just want to thank BJ's for making an old veteran feel appreciated. and in the words of MacArthur, I shall return!!!
