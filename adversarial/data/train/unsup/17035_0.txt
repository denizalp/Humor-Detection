Lets face it folks, its hard to review a mall, BUT reviewing Yorkdale is damn near impossible. Not because one doesn't know what to say but because it's impossible to know what not to say about it. Plus on any 2 consecutive visits this mall is seldom the same, always growing, changing, evolving, improving - a sign of great shopping centre.\n\nMost recently they have closed their long standing food court and opened a down right classy dining experience (still a food court) called Dine on 3, located near the Rainforest Cafe (3 floors up).\n\nAlso they are in the process of renovating the main hall near Harry Rosen AND adding a new wing to the mall with 40+ new store. Holy Hell. Ladies and Gentlemen, start your swiping (credit cards). The new wing is eating up a portion of one of the parking lots which I feel might hurt them in the long run as parking can be scarce as it is.\n\nInsider tip: For $5 you can pay for valet parking near the Holt Renfrew entrance, my personal recommendation for the busier shopping days.\n\nIts not wonder this is Canada's most profitable mall! While it's not the biggest they have maximized the space here with great high shopping options for all budgets and incomes.\n\nCharge it!
