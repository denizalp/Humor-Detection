Nice staff but horrible dentist. they told me I had to pay 80$ out of pocket for a cavity since insurance   would not cover it. then they bill be for 200$ for a cavity. then to top it all of they didn't fill it right causing me to drive a half a hour away to get it filled at there other office 2 more times. save your time and money and go somewhere   else.
