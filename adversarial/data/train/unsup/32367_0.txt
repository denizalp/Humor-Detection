Food was okay. Small bar despite how big it looks from the outside. Smelly and on the dirty\/old side. Service was a decent speed, but they don't come to refill or check on you unless you are buying another bottle at the bar. They have some bar games like darts and video golf. Overall, probably won't go back.
