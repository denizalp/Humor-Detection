Amazing! Dahl is so awesome. I went here over a year ago for my first Botox treatments, great results. The following 2 times I received Botox injections I went to a place closer to work and cheaper. It was ok, but my brows felt super heavy and I had no movement upward. (I only wanted injections above my brows as well as expressed interest in having my brows more symmetrical each of the 3 times I've gone.) My left brow has always had WAY more lift\/arch than my right. Dahl nailed it that first treatment. They were SO pretty and symmetrical and the lazy right one had an arch!!  Treatments 2\/3 at the other place they were so heavy and lost almost all of the arch. I decided to go back to Dahl this past Monday and literally the by next day my arches were on point. Each day it's getting better. They don't feel heavy at all, and I'm loving my results. I would highly recommend Dahl. At $9.99\/unit it may be more than other places, but we all know you get what you pay for! Also, I have some pretty large spots of texture from acne scarring. I met with Pat, the lead esthetician and I'm so excited I have a consult with her soon. Can't wait! She showed me before and after of another client she is treating with micro-needling and I can only hope my results can be like the pics!
