This used to be one my favorite Mexican spots in the city. We found on our last trip that the menu had been changed quite a bit. No more enchiladas and no taco selection - you have to order 3 of the same kind. I always thought their drinks were a little on the expensive side but loved the Paloma's. Seems they're now using some kind of grapefruit soda for these and they're no longer the same. Food is tasty but it seems like it's just about a money grab now and I don't think I'll be going back.
