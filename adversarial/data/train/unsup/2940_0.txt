After looking at the other reviews I got the feeling that the ambiance is more important than the food.  The prices reflect the ambiance so if you want more ambiance,  pay more and go there. The reason the service is a little slower is because they make the food fresh and it is worth waiting for!  I prefer my food fresh and hot, verses fast and crappy. For those of you that go for your first time, BE SURE TO ORDER THE WOR WON TON SOUP!!  It seems a little pricey until you see and taste it.  It is loaded with meat and veggies and is enough for at least 3 maybe 4 people so if you do the math, it really is a bargain. This is a specialty there in my opinion (and the kids).  Your best bet is to go at lunch with a group and try a couple of lunch items to share and see what you like best because they do have a great selection of lunch specials.   My kids love the chicken fried rice and it will come out hot and fresh!  For veggie lovers, order the lunch veggie special.  It is fantastic and I usually prefer meat  but the kids ordered it and loved it so much that I gave it a try and I had to say it was awesome!!  It appears that they are beginning to update the place as the last time I was there, they had new menu's (with higher prices) but same great food and still worth the price.  Great place to take picky kids that don't like veggies.  They will eat them here!
