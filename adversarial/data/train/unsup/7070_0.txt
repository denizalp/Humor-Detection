Very sloowwww service; they need experienced staff to run this place; ramen was waayyy too salty and the boiled eggs were still raw inside; we know what authentic ramen should taste\/look like - what they serve is not even close. We shared our thoughts\/experience with the manager. He provided us with 2 free meal coupons, but we won't be back. Ramen is too far off from 'authentic.'
