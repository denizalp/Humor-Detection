If I could give this place a negative or zero stars, I would. First of all, screw this place! No wonder this hotel isn't known. I've never been here before and my first visit is my LAST visit! Never fricken again!!!!Customer service SUCKS asssss! Then room service SUCKS! They don't keep their fricken place clean for crying out loud! There's dust in their rooms, I found a cockroach in my bed sheets, and they need to clean the fricken toilet! Shit. Even a quick scrub! When I first walked to my room, I had to use the toilet. Lifted up the toilet seat and I find diarrhea splattered all over the toilet !!! Grosssss! I don't like the staff. The shit that threw me off was their customer or room service. It took forever just to get one thing done. The staff really brought down my rating really really really really  really really really really  really really really really really really really  really  really really really really  LOW. They're the reason why!! I don't like how any of them talked to me. They've talked to me as if I'm a stupid head! Like shit, \"sorry, your job must be sooo haaaard.\" Please. Cut the attitude and just fricken serve me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
