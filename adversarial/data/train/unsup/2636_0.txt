Now! I have an issue! The issue is that all the reviews for Totto Spa suck! This is complete and total BULL$h#*!!!!!!!! I have been going to this spa for years! Spa & salon! And I think that people are not used to having culture in spas!!!! Everyone who works here is a different nationality!!! Which is amazing because the all have great work ethic and from the moment you walk in you feel right at home with the \"cool\"receptionist Sarah, your offered snacks, wine, cheese, coffee, tea. The people here have thick accents and are some of THE nicest people you'll ever meet! All the Estheticians are very sweet and professional! The place itself does need a little fixing up but the awesome decor makes up for it nicely! If u have never been inside ask for a quick look and someone would be happy to show you around. I'm sure people on here write crazy reviews about competitors or just because this spa is not your typical stuck up your a$$ spa! If your in the area please give Totto a chance.. I took my mother today for mothers day and she LOVED every moment of it!!!!!!!
