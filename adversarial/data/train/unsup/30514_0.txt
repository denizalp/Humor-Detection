First time I came here I ordered the panko-crusted fish burrito. Most of the typical toppings you'd expect from a burrito place. I also like how they finish it in a Subway-type oven to quickly crisp it and warm it up. The panko taste really came through since it was actually a few small pieces of coated fish. As much as I love panko, it also took away the taste of the fish. I ordered the habanero sauce, but i found heat and overall taste to be lacking somewhat.\n\nI returned a couple days later and tried the chicken. I asked for more hot sauce than before, as well as burrito sauce. Again, a pretty solid burrito, but nothing that really pops either. Perhaps I'll go with little to no rice if I return in case that is a cause; but that hasn't been an issue at other places I've enjoyed.\n\nReliable and better than some places, but still needs some more flavour.
