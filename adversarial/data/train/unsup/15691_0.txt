Farm Burger with duck breast bacon + english sharp cheddar + topped with a fried egg, Truffle Parmesan Fries & a Caramel Pudding Chocolate Shake which was the absolute ICING ON THE CAKE. By far the best damn Milk Shake I've ever had in my entire life. Yes, the food was great but I f'd up & ruined my appetite sucking down that damn crack-infused milkshake before my burger arrived. I'm STILL having withdrawals... Can't wait to go back...
