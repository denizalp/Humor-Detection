I mean I guess with as many reviews as this place has, the secret is out! I absolutely love the concept of Postino and this location was great. A very hip interior and a lovely patio make this place a dream to come to...and that is before we even start talking about the food and drink. If I lived up in this area, I would probably come for their bottle and board special (1 bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for $20! INSANE) all the time. I of course did try their wine and bruschetta which were very good. They have $5 glasses of wine or $5 pitchers of beer daily from 11am-5pm. Their bruschetta stole the show for me though. A couple of my favorites were the smoked salmon with pesto, warm artichoke spread, and their seasonal (when we went it was a sweet lemon mascarpone that was to die for!) Move a location down to Tucson please!!
