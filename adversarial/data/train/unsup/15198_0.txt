If I could give ZERO stars I would!!! Horrible place!! I called two days earlier to make an appointment and asked on the phone how much was there basic teeth cleaning was they said $60 so I went to my appointment and they did my X-rays and pictures and they said they will not do my work because I need the deep cleaning... they rather loose a patient rather than just doing the work!!  CEASAR JOYA (office manager) claims he will not do the work on me because I do need the most expensive one!!! I ASKED FOR THE LEAST EXPENSIVE ONE AND I UNDERSTAND NEED THE MOST EXPENSIVE BUT I DO NOT CARE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO A DENTIST AND GET THE WORK THAT I WANT SINCE I AM THE ONE PAYING FOR IT!! Do not go there, it's a waste of time they're staff is horrible.
