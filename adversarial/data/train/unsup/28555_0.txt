Walking around the MGM looking for someplace to have a drink before catching our flight out of Las Vegas, we came upon this place.  The sign outside advertising the sangria closed the deal..\n\nThe hostess at the front didn't glance our way, nor did she welcome us as we walked to the bar.  The bar area was pretty empty, so we figured it was still early for people to be out.  \n\nWell after waiting for more than 15 minutes to get acknowledged or even given a menu, we finally decided to leave.  This was the worst service we have received in Vegas.  We then knew why it was so empty, no one was around to do their job.  We'll take our money else where.
