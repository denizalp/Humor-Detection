Peter Lik - Venetian\nOverall \n5 Stars\n\nGold Medal - Wall Sized 4 Panel Pictures\nSilver Medal - Vibrant 3D Pictures\nBronze Medal - Pictures Appreciate\n\nPeter Lik is a brilliant landscape photographer.  His gallery exhibits some of his famous pieces, that range from $4K to $40K+.  \n\nI saw a amazing wall sized 4 panel piece.  This piece was $25K just for the framing.  The price of the print depends on the picture.  Only 300 of each image is released.  When the image is new, the the price is roughly $4K.  As the images become sold out the price appreciates to $40K.  If you purchase a wall sized 4 panel picture, plus an almost sold out image, it would cost you $25K + 40K, roughly $65K.  The price of a car!  The framing is done with the same glass used on an airplane windsheild.  It is supposed to be bullet proof!!  A multi-purpose frame, does that justify the pricing? The framing can be used to dodge bullets and not just for a pretty piece of art.  The framing is also suppose to fight the effects of fading for a lifetime.\n\nThere are these cool side rooms in the gallery where you can change the lighting.  When the lighting is changed on these pictures, the images become almost 3D and alive.\n\nGreat gallery with amazing pieces of art!\n\nHAPPY PETER LIKING!!
