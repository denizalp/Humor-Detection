After three attempts to make a reservation for a party if 10 at 7:00 for 10-9-15, I have not received a return call yet? I also sent 2 email messages. Each call I made was transferred and I was told to leave a message. I sure hope we will be accommodated this evening at 7:00? I which I will change my review at that time! So far, poor team management!
