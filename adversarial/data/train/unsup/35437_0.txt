I didn't want to write a review because I wanted to keep this place all to myself.  \n\nI'm always excited to try a new restaurant in downtown Las Vegas.  This is truly the most exciting discovery in more than seven years.  \n\nNot being a fan of heavy meats or even chicken, nor breads nor fried foods I suppose I'm considered a picky eater.  This is the first place where I choose a dish not by process of elimination but I have to flip a coin throughout the menu to narrow my choices.  The people arewilling to substitute chicken with jumbo shrimp which helps me in my predicament.   There are beaucoup snappy vegetables on each plate for lots of taste and texture.  \n\nI avoid lunch hour because there are less than 10 tables and I'm not a fan of delivery.  Once I get settled in the afternoons I'm always happy with each recipe.  A big plus is that the eating area is captures natural light which helps me enjoy our short winter days.  \n\nDon't expect to find on-street parking on 3rd which is one-way going south.  Try one block west -- its an easy walk.
