Been looking on yelp to find a decent Japanese restaurant in the strip and came across Social House\n\nNeedless to say my experience was very intersting there, Went with a big party. Mind you it was my best friends birthday, who is japanese, and it was a friends and family dinner. The waiter passed out the menu and then gave us a 30min lecture on the menu. I was way more confused about the menu after the lecture than I was before he blabbed on about the menu itemsI Also he kept of saying Social House is very non traditional and that all the traditional stuff on the menu is boring and not to order it. Dude half of the people at this table is Japanese and they pretty much took offense to that. In their defense I would have taken offense to it as well if I were Japanese.  Also he was talking to us as if we were trying Japanese food for the first time. He was trying to explain to us that edamame was soybeans. SERIOUSLY!! HE was a very annoying waiter if you can't tell. Totally had to dock a star for that.\n\nOn to a brighter note. The food was delicious. We ordered edamame, yellowtail sashimi, tuna sashini, soft shell crab, popcorn shrimp, kobe tacos, lettuce cups, rolls and the scallops. \n\nSashimi:\nBoth of the sashimis were delicious. I would highly recommend both the yellowtail and the tuna. However I liked the TUNA ALOT!!!!!! The different sauces and flavors were just amazing. I would definitely go back to eat the tuna again. \n\nPopcorn shrimp:\nBOMB!!! Came with these amazing suaces. There was one that was really spciy and delicious. I would highly recommend this as well. \n\nLettuce cups:\nSO GOOD!! A bib lettuce with a piece of miso cod. Filled with so much flavor and deliciousness.\n\nI would highly recommend the three dished above. \n\nThe atmosphere is very trendy. I felt like I was in a Giesha House but in Las Vegas, but with better food. It is definitely worth trying out.\n\ngood eats :)
