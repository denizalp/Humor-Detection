After shopping at this location for many years (its literally less than a mile away from me) I have never been more disappointed than today. I parked and was walking towards the entrance by 8:20ish pm when the unexpected happened... I GOT STUNG BY A SCORPION! a damn SCORPION in the parking lot. So here I am barely getting home at 1am from the ER when it was suppose to be a \"quick run to Walmart\".  -- I didn't even get a chance to go inside the store and get what I needed! I was in so much pain. \n\nI'm giving it a 1 star because now their is a 1% that I'll ever go back to this location even though I know it's not the store\/employee\/management 's fault, I'm just a big traumatized baby.  \n\nUNLESS, they were to get more lights for the parking lot! :D
