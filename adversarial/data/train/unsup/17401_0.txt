The market is really a central area bordered by Dundas to the South, Kensington and Augusta to the West and East and College St to the North.  The area used to be a section of Toronto where immigrants lived and a part of Chinatown Centre.  \n\nI was at the Market area to distribute flyers for our film playing at the ReelHeART Film Festival.  As I was distributing flyers, one of the street team members from ReelHeART gave me a brief description of the area.  Simple terms, an area for some simple food, and also a flea market..\n\nAfter the short visit to ask complete strangers to view a free showing of our film, In My Living Room, (a little plug), I went back to Kensington on a Saturday walk along from the hotel I was staying.  One of the better days in Toronto, humidity is lower, sun is out.  \n\nAs I arrived in Kensington Market area, I was able to go from one shop to another.  it's a really an array of 2nd hand shops and cheap stores.  I rarely go to Flashbacks in Hillcrest but here I am in Toronto shopping through the 2nd hand shops (or for the real shopper, the recycling of good quality goods).  I have to say that I was impressed to see a variety of items that could prove useful for certain occasions.  For one thing I was looking for something particular at a really good bargain for the same reason.  \n\nAlas this did not proved fruitful.  I was able to purchase other items but this trip was an interesting one and a good recommendation to visitors in Toronto looking for that certain piece for a party or event but failed to bring with them on their visit.  The natives are already aware of this area, my advice is for first timers to Toronto.\n\nBargains are to be had in Toronto after all.
