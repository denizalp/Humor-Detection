Finally managed to try this place but we were disappointed. The two stars are for the cleanliness and the friendly staff. The food ranged from \"okay\" to sad. A dim sum restaurant with only one dim sum, available in four different meats. They were out of beef, pork and shrimp were boring, and the chicken was disgusting. They're large, at least. I thought the long-life noodles were okay, but hubby's entrees were boring, tough & chewy. It doesn't matter how organic it is if it's badly cooked or kept out in warming trays for too long. I might return for noodles some day, but nothing else.\n\nPost visit note: NOW they've added more Dim Sum, I'm sure I'll want to try them because I love dim sum but I'm sure it'll be quite a while before I do. I need my memory of this visit to dim more.
