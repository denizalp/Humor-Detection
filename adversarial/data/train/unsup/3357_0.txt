Sammy Hagar cooks?  Yes he does and he even has a cookbook published.  I learned of this reading French Laundry's magazine \"Finesse\" featuring chicken.\n\nWe came here for breakfast before our flight from LAS terminal C.  The bacon and cheese omelet was actually pretty good!  Smoky flavors from the bacon, and I liked the liberal use of fried onions to add lots of flavor (4 stars).  The French Toast had blueberries and all and was just OK (3 stars), but that side of grilled sausage was actually pretty decent and was a step beyond the frozen stuff at say, McDs.\n\nService was quick and efficient.
