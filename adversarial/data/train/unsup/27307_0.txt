Used to love this place but apparently they are only unlimited toppings for certain people or items. I asked for extra cheese and was given an attitude. Then after I get a little more cheese and the 5 pieces of meat I was allowed. I asked for more cheese and was told \"our district manager wouldn't like this amount of cheese\" the person behind me is told you get unlimited toppings. I ask for more cheese, since I'm only getting a cheese and pepperoni pizza but they refuse and only offer feta and goat cheese. Sad they are about to lose a customer and they don't care. Just know they are stingy with the cheese and toppings
