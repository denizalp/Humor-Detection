I have a goal this year to write at least ten In-N-Out reviews in 2017.  Here is In-N-Out review number one. \n\nI've been to this location a handful of times.  It's conveniently located by one of my offices.  It's so close that I could smell the Animal Fries from across the parking lot.  I think that I would be here a lot more, but it's so damn busy.  The drive thru lines are long.  The lines inside is even longer.  A typical order for me is a Double Double (spread only & extra toast), with fries, and an extra Cheeseburger (also with spread only & extra toast).  Lately, I've been sticking to just two Flying Dutchman's (4 patties \/ 4 cheese).  Overall, I can't complain.  The lines may be long, but always worth it.  In-N-Out is a staple meal for me, especially when I'm dieting.  \n\n2017 In-N-Out Review #1 \/ 2017 Yelp Review #6
