Quick service with a smile! Early on Sunday morning there was someone at the door to greet me and open the door for me. Plenty of good cheer once I was seated as well. Service was prompt and courteous. Eggs, bacon, and sausage were cooked perfectly.  My glass was never empty and we had great conversation. Easily walkable from the multiple hotels on this street.
