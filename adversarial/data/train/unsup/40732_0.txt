Absolutely delicious. We started off with their sampler platter. Great Venezuela choices and the sauces\/dips that came with it were interesting. Amazing flavours. Watch the little one it takes a few seconds for the hotness to kick in, but loved it. I had the bean burger and my friend the pulled pork sandwich. I enjoyed the \"bun\", not your typical. The sides healthy. We were pleasantly surprised how yummy gluten free is. Service was friendly with no long delays. We loved our dinner and definitely will be back for more.
