Before venturing to Pusateri's you need to know 2 things about it: \n1. The North location is the real location\n2. It is expensive\n\nThat said, I don't care if I have to be waved in by a police man (this is true by the way, the place does have a police man on Avenue road stopping traffic for the place), or if I have to wait 3 hours for a parking spot while some Louis Vuitton vixen chats to her pool-boy on her cell phone before pulling out, or if some precocious princess yells at me for taking her mommy's number at the deli, I'm going to Pusateri's and I'm going to like it!\n\nPart of the Pusateri's experience is hating every, single moment that you're there on one level but at another level being absolutely amazed by their goods.  Not to be confused with Whole foods that tricks you into believing their food is actually tasty and of good quality, Pusateri's is far and away the best fine foods store in Toronto.  Their deli is spectacular (try their homemade turkey breast it's incredible), their produce is beautiful and their meats are Grade A.  I have yet to try a disappointing prepared food from that section of the store.  Pusateri's also has an extensive and intricate bakery, interesting cheese department, and everyday grocery section.  The store is amazing!  Even for those on a budget it's worth going shopping for that extra special night or if you are in the mood to splurge.
