Delicious pasta! All the sauces are made from scratch. I went during happy hour (buy one get one beer or wine) but you have to get the same exact drink for both. Loved it here! It is such a cute little hole in the wall in a not so populated area! They need to expand and get more menu items without meat! They did substitute out the meat for tofu though and it was so tasty. The desserts I had were lemon (topped) cheesecake and lemon cakes. The cheesecake was slightly thick but that's nothing a good thaw won't fix. The lemon cakes were $1 and super delicious! Highly recommend!!! And the worker there-I'm assuming was the manager-was totally gay and totally sexy. Mmmmmm momma almost gave him my number, but I'm not a local so I just stared in lust imagining being his wife one day... Just sayin
