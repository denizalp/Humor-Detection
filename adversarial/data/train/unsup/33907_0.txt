I've been coming here for over 2 years now. Every esthetician at this point has threaded my eyebrows and I have had not one bad experience. If you're looking for a place that you can walk into and have perfect eyebrows this most definitely is the place. Along with being amazing at what they do, the South Park location is always extremely clean and inviting. Since coming here all of my friends and family go to this location and have had  the same results. If you want your brows to be on point (and never over threaded) you have to go here. \nPS: since I went to college this is still the only place I go to get my brows done. Tbh getting my brows done here is one of the highlights of coming back to Charlotte.
