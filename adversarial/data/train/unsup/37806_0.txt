I came here as a kid once and remember not being impressed but as an adult Wolfgang Puck holds some meaning since he is a world renowned chef. Unfortunately it was another negative for me. The shisito peppers were good but there were more mushrooms than peppers in the app. The pizza was dry and terrible. I ate almost none of it. The group I was with got more traditional pizza and seemed to like it although my mother's crab cakes were almost miniature in size and that was strange. Pizza-wise... It seemed like there was a lot of food but not a lot of quality. It was blah in flavor and dry in texture. Sorry WP I am unimpressed again.
