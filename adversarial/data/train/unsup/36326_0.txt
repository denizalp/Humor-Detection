One of the most well organized car rental centers around!  No kidding, there are helpful people everywhere!  Its very well organized and you can get in and out in less than 30 minutes all day!  Plus, I've come into Vegas after midnight and departed very early and the centered is staffed and working!  \n\nIt might be a little bit more expensive to rent from the companies in the center, but compared to the off property clown acts I've experienced, including having to call a cab to get to airport, its worth every penny. Signage on the highway and in the center is top shelf as well.
