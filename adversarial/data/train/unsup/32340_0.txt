This is one of my favorite places to go in Las Vegas. The atmosphere and decor in this store is amazing.  They have great products at decent prices.  It is wonderful that they do so many activities through out the year for familys that are free.  If you go in the spring or summer, the boy scouts are usually cooking brats or burgers on a grill outside, so bring a few extra dollars.
