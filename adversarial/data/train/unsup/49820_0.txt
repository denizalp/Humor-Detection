My son took me for my birthday.  We sat outside and enjoyed the weather.  We did mention it was my birthday but no reaction from waiter.  Guess you order if you want to celebrate.  Anyway, I had burger and fries.  I had to special order it.  No problem.  Burger was delicious and came just the way I requested.  Fries wonderful!  Son had pasta with shrimp and loved it.  Prices typical strip. Nice place to have lunch and walk around through the Linq Promenade.
