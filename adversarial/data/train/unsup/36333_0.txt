This is more than a great place to eat.  It is like going over to a friends house and having them take care of you. Stop reading reviews and just go!  \n\nYolis has been our favorite breakfast and lunch place for years. The food is excellent and the owner Yoli and Rick along with their staff are wonderful.  They spend the time to cultivate relationships with their customers and always make you feel like your part of the family.  \n\nThen there are the pancakes....they are perfection. There is a secrete menu...ask about the volcano...
