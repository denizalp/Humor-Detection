I recently started renting a unit at this storage facility, and have been impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the convenient location. But after only going to the facility twice, I am considering switching to a different location because of how dangerous the ramp to the building is. Both times I've been there I have caught my foot and almost fallen on the unsecured wire mesh on the wooden ramp while bringing things into and out of the building. The ramp is several feet off the ground, so falling off the ramp would be awful, but could easily happen given how dilapidated it is.\n\nThis would be a simple fix for the management. As it is now, this is really very dangerous and doesn't give a good impression about the facility as a whole.\n\nAlso, later evening hours would be much better, rather than just until 6pm.
