Man I loved this place. \nIt is chocolate heaven. The free chocolate tasting sample was an interesting lesson in how they pick and mix beans. It was like going from bourbon of the middle shelf level to trying a single malt scotch. \n\nThen I downed a root beer float and gave myself type ï¼œ3 diabetes. \nSee what I did there? *sigh*  \n\nHave to say I had never seen anyone actually making chocolate in front of me. \nYay for chocolate.
