This is one of my favorite places to eat at the Strip. Grilled chicken (served every day) there is very tender and flavorful (well, most of the time :P) Ceviche and shredded pork (only available on weekends) are the best. For appetizer, grilled bananas is strongly recommended. Try chicha for drink. And rice pudding for desert :  )
