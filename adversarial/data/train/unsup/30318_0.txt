What a cute addition to this popping plaza. Boteco is a much needed wine bar\/tappas spot in a plaza that already has some great finds, but was missing a classy late night drinking spot. The plaza is filled with tons of day time restaurants and a slightly grimy bar- Boteco was exactly what I needed. \nThe place is brightly lit and the indoors has a daytime brunch feel. If you're looking for a dimmer, more romantic spot this might not be it. Or just sit outside. \nThey have a nice selection of wines, a prosecco flight and just 2 beers on tap. I would have loved to have a wine flight option! \nThey didn't have any tapas that stood out for me. Also only salad for a vegetarian option. \nThe bar was completely empty on a Saturday night. I have high expectations for this spot- hopefully things pick up!
