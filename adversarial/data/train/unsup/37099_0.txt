The classic serviceman is an idealism long thought dead. One would think that the days of a competent, uniformed and courteous house calling service repair person were long extinct. They aren't. Ronald is a renaissance repairman that stepped straight out of 1955, into some booties, and onto your tile (he wears booties in your house!) Doesn't that say so much? The best part isn't his tidy uniform, his well stocked and clean service vehicle, his cheerful disposition or even his ability to put you at ease. Nay, the best part is that Ronald knows exactly what he is doing and :::get this:::: he takes PRIDE in what he does!  It's a long lost art folks! \n\nRonald fixed my dishwasher 5 months ago. He expedited the needed parts and got the job done, and it's worked flawlessly since. When my refrigerator broke a few weeks ago, I knew right away that I had to convince my home warranty company to use Elite Pro Appliance Repair Services again. This time he quickly assessed the problem. His fingers looked like an 80's video arcade champion's, as they pressed secret buttons, took off panels and reset my fridge with a hidden switch. He clearly knows what he is doing. There's no standing around with a befuddled look on his face. For a second time, he expedited a part for my appliance and then he was back a few days later fixing my oven door and a broken fridge drawer to boot. Thank you Ronald and Rachael at Elite Pro!
