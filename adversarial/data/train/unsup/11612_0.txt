Have you ever watched them make this sandwich?  It's a special craft for sure.  They take two pieces of white Italian bread.  Pile on your choice of meat and cheese....then the grand finale....cole slaw and fries!  Then the put both hands on the sandwich and proceed to smoosh it all down flat. All this is done with their bare hands, no gloves here, so all you sanitary peeps beware! \n\nI don't know why it's such a fantastic sammy, but trust, it is!  I think it's just the combination of delicious (and fatty) ingredients that does the job.  It's just one more food experience that makes Pittsburgh's dining unique. \n\nIf you're visiting Pittsburgh, go here?  If you're new to Pittsburgh, go here! If you just need your fill of a sandwich with more sides on it than you usually order in a regular sitting, go here!
