Pretty nice hotel and casino. I got a great rate on the room. Only complaint is the beds are not all that comfortable and there was no toothpaste in the room. Seeing as I sleep on a Tempurpedic at home the bed thing is expected, but having to make a rush into town for toothpaste wasn't. I will be back in the area next month and I will likely stay here again.
