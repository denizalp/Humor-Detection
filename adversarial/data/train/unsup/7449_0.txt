Booked a 2 room suite for my sons 21'St birthday.  This hotel was so disappointing.  \n\nThe rooms need major renovations, plumbing work and detail cleaning.  The master bathroom was missing the seal under the shower door creating a flood on the floor. The shower head was fiercely strong causing pain if it touched any sensitive areas.  Mold was on the frame of shower door.  Carpet was also dirty and needed vacuuming in missed areas.\n\nThe throw pillows on the furniture had ripped fabric.  The second bedroom, bathroom area (adjoining room) had a sewage smell that was like rotten eggs. \n\nWorst part was I failed to inspect all the bed pillows ( both sides).  I woke up and realized I had slept on someone's blood.  Not like it was laundered but still stained.  It was obviously not changed out after the last guest.  Oh how I wish I would have discovered it came from me or my husband but no.  It was not us :(.   \n\nThankful we only stayed 2 nights.  I could not take another night.  Upon check out we informed the manager.  We would have done so immediately but I'm certain half our short trip would have been wasted getting this sorted.  She did refund the resort fee though I'm not really sure what we benefit from that fee anyways.   Between the show tickets, hotel, food, drinks spent with the MGM brand I am so disappointed!
