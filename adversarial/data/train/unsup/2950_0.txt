I'm usually not a big fan of buffets so to give 4 stars is saying a lot. \nAlthough the line seems long, it goes pretty fast. I want for lunch on a Sunday and waited about 30 mins. Although the price on the higher end, the food quality is worth it. Lunch includes unlimited mimosas and champagne, juices, coffee and soft drinks. \n\nThe food selection is pretty good. Everything was really fresh. I really loved their seafood section with the warm king crab legs, clam bake, and shrimp cocktail. To my disappointment, they only had oyster shooters and not fresh oysters even though they had oysters on display. \n\nThe taco stand was pretty awesome with a wide variety of home made salsas. Make sure you try the mango habanero salsa. \n\nThey were very generous with the unlimited champagne and mimosas. \n\nI heard they now have check in kiosks to minimize the lines and fresh oysters during dinner.
