I initially booked my wedding with a chapel in Vegas. With invitations sent I was days away from making my final payment and realized the venue was not going to be a good fit. I researched and found Wedgewood only 2 months before the wedding. With such a short timeframe I was very concerned. From the beginning Jacquelyn reassured me everything would be perfect. And boy did she deliver. My day was perfect and more than I had ever expected. Jacquelyn,  Stephanie and DJ Murphy were A1. My guest are still raving. My husband after enduring all my torture was overly excited and happy with the outcome. There wasn't one thing that I could complain about. The day was absolutely flawless. The banquet hall was beautiful. The event started on time and moved smoothly just as rehearsed. The music was off the chain (do people still say that. Lol). I recommend Wedgewood to anyone who wants to be worry free and have a classy and beautiful wedding
