We had the Saturday Brunch, small plates tasted 12 of the like 20 items on the Brunch Menu plus bottomless Mimosas. One word to describe it... DIVINE!! Everything thing was delicious , complex layering of flavors to tickle every taste bud upon the tongue. If you have not experienced a \"tapas\" type meal I recommend Border Grill. Our server Mike was fantastic knowledgeable about the menu and knew intuitively what would tickle our fancy. Also very personable and funny! A treat to interact with! He made my young daughter feel at home and engaged her in banter and recommended the Ceviche Trio for her. SHE adored it, for a child she is very adventurous when it come to food. I cannot over state how wonderful the food , service and atmosphere is in Border Grill. Go ahead take the plunge and try it! You wont regret it!
