I'm not exactly sure why, but Fiesta Burrito blows away the 'somebody-bertos' which are all over the valley.\n\nMy first clue that this place would be better than the average was seeing the fire truck and ambulance parked outside. Firefighters are typically great cooks, and if they are eating at a place, it is a great sign.\n\nMy most recent visit, I was hungry, in a hurry, and wanted something tasty. I was in the area and hit Fiesta Burrito. I got a carne asada burro and a plain cheese crisp. Even though the line of cars was six deep, the line moved smoothly and before I knew it, I was paying for my lunch.\n\nGetting back to the office, I was pleased to discover a tasty burro and the cheese crisp was very good. Please note, this is not America's or Gallo, but it is good in a pinch. As a bonus, you're eating at a place called 'Party Burrito'! How can you lose?\n\nGive it a shot, you will not be disappointed.
