I brought my dog in for an interview here and think any current camper parents should be aware if their camper is used as a \"test\" dog for interviews. The way they conduct interviews is not appropriate and quite frankly reckless.\n\n1. There was no human evaluation prior to exposing the interviewing dog to campers. \n2. Exposed interviewing dog immediately to a large same sex dog in a corner. \n3. Upon the interviewing dog expressing she was uncomfortable with the first dog, they let in a couple more dogs, while the interviewing dog was still cornered.\n4. When asked about the specifics of what happened during the interview, the staff member would not give specific details and only reverted to \"general\" interview practices. \n\nThe \"interview\" in its entirety was under 6 minutes. I saw my interviewing dog cornered from their monitor screens. I saw more dogs introduced in less than one minute. When I asked the staff member how much time she allowed my dog to acclimate, she replied with, \"I can't keep time, but maybe 10 minutes.\" Remember, from when I released my dog until she returned with her was under 6 minutes! If my dog really was aggressive (side note she passed with flying colors at two other day cares which she regularly attends) why did the staff think it was a good idea to expose her to more campers? Further, if she is that aggressive, why even expose her to the first camper? Why was a human interaction evaluation not performed first? I'm glad my dog did not pass here. I would be totally uncomfortable with having her be a camper here and subjected to this as a potential tester.
