Overall good experience with the environment like downtown glendale you can't help but walk around and ordering pizza didn't stop us from doing that. The place is cute and even has a place to eat outside to enjoy the weather. Pizza has a good balance of cheesy and marinara sauce and you have a variety of toppings to choose from. Great Place.
