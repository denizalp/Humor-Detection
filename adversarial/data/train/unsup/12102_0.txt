This experience pertains to the phone conversation that I had with a Stratosphere Rep.\n\nI just wanted to know what the current prices and offers were and the rep tells me she doesn't speak Spanish. Mind you, I was speaking English and was born in the US, I mean I'm the type of person who had to take Spanish courses in high school. I told her I wanted to speak English not Spanish and she tells me,\" Sorry, it sounds like you are asking to speak Spanish.\" This typically wouldn't have led to anything had she not been so catty on the phone and quick to interrupt when I was trying to ask questions about the property. Now that I'm on my computer I'll just google the answers and not bother the Rep's.
