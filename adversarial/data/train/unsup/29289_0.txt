One of the most fun and delicious places in Las Vegas for snacks, desserts, ice cream and amazing chocolates!  They give free chocolate taste tours.  They sport their own chocolates and lots of other competitors chocolates!  They serve specialty milkshakes with alcohol!  I don't drink but many say they are so delicious!  It's a great place to buy unique souvenirs too!
