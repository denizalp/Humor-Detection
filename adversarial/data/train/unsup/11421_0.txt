Know what you're getting into before you do this.  And if you're a male, avoid this place at all costs because they almost exclusively work on women.  \n\nFirst, you probably think that while they're students, they're somewhat close to graduating and can cut hair.  My stylist had never used clippers before and was clearly uncomfortable even using scissors.  Her instructor gave her direction and then said \"you ok\" to which she was hesitant to say anything else but yes, and then the instructor walked off.  I had to ask her if she was ok and she said \"she'll give it a try.\"  Great!  \n\nThe instructor there never actually watched my stylist cut, but just gave instruction and walked off.  You think I was nervous, hell yes.  This girl I had was so bad and so lost because she was nervous and always had to wait for the instructor to come back.  Keep in mind, these instructors work with many students at once.  Anyway, even the wash was awful, I mean seriously, have you never washed anyone's hair enough to know that when you're dripping wet, that's not a good thing.  I had to ask for a towel to wipe off the water dripping down my shirt.  This stylish I had showed little enthusiasm for this job.  At this time, I was thinking, should I just say thanks and leave and go to somewhere where they can finish the rest, but I seriously did not want to be such a tool for a learning student, so I just smiled and went a long with it all.  After all, for a guy, you can always get everything shaved off and start clean.  \n\nAt the end of it all, I thought the instructor would have checked it, but she didn't and the stylist said \"well, I guess you're done.\"  Too right I was done, in so many ways.  Anyway, avoid this place like the plague.  Seriously, you could go to one of those places like Supercuts where it's $12 and get someone that has actually cut hair before going to a place like this where it's $15 for a male hair cut.
