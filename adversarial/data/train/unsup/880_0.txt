Pretty cool restaurant.  They have sushi too which totally threw me off but whatevs.  We did have some sushi apps, they were good but not as good as some other places.\n\nOur dinner entrees were really great though, we had 2 steaks, the salmon and the veal-- all of us were very happy with the food, and our server was super sweet and efficient.\n\nThe bread they bring to the table was Excellent-- probably one of the best bread rolls I've had in a long time.  I pulled a granny move and asked to take the leftover rolls home.  I want to make mini sandwiches with them tomorrow for lunch.  Why waste good food? Eh?
