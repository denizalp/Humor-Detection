I'm going to disclaimer this review & the 2 stars from the start & say that I almost always despise buffets. So if you actually enjoy the buffet style (which boggles my mind), then you may actually think Dragon Buffet is worthy of a higher rating. But the combination of buffet & Chinese (also another non fav of mine) doesn't really bode well for this review.\n\nThe food actually does taste pretty good for buffet food, from orange chicken, to beef & broccoli, to all your favs, they have quite a bit on tap. They have the usual rice options, & I actually enjoyed the vegetarian egg rolls. But I wouldn't recommend the ice cream, it's just a little too dicey for me. So they do have plenty of options & I'm sure a Chinese buffet fan would love to peruse the options all lined up for the taking. And along with the set price & rapid quick seating & service, I can see why people keep this place quite packed.\n\nI probably won't be heading back here anytime soon, but they do have plenty of Chinese food options for a good price. So bring your appetite along with an open mind (if you're like me).
