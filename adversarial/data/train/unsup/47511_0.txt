Im a bit of a foodie and I've lived in Toronto all my life, but have never been to a smokehouse. Im glad to that Bourbon Street Smokehouse was my first. \n\nI went with two of my foodie friends and we all decided to each get the \"Sampler for One\" meal so we could try a variety of food. \n\"Sampler for One\" includes 2 mains and 2 sides. \nI didnt expect the portions to be as big as they were.\n\nWe all just had to try the Texas Beef Brisket for our first main... you CANNOT go wrong with it! That is a promise!\nIt smells incredible and as for taste.. out of this world!\nIt is so rich in flavour and  melts in your mouth, its kind of an experience you have to live yourself in order to know. \n\nRibs were great, especially because is was brushed with their homemade  BBQ sauce. \n\nSausage was pretty good, but not something I was really wowed by. \n\nThe sides were AMAZING. \nCesar salad... was a Caesar salad but it was elevated with there in-house smoked cheese. \nMac and cheese was to die for. Very cheesy and even tasted very smoky. It tasted more smokier than the meats tbh. Don't know if they used a specific cheese, smoked their cheese as they did for the Caesar salad, or added liquid smoke. \nBeans were delicious and had a nice sweetness to them. \nColeslaw.. I can only say that it was good, because I'm more used to a mayonnaise-based coleslaw not a vinegar based one.  \n\nThey give you a set of sauces; ketchup, mayo, malt vinegar, BUT their home made sauces... SO GOOD!\nMississippi BBQ sauce was smoky with a very mild kick to it,  we at first assumed it was the best, since they gave us two full bottles of it, and it was... we finished both bottles. \nMemphis BBQ sauce was pretty similar to the Mississippi BBQ but slightly sweeter from the pineapple. \nDidnt try the Carolina Sauce, cause we were too into the first two. \nWhite gold, tasted very similar to a caesar dressing but was slightly different, I couldnt put my finger on it. \nI tried a dot of the Ghost Pepper sauce, the first few seconds were good, but the heat slowly builds. So if you like spicy, this one's for you.  \n\nThat was the food, but as for service, our server was a little slow in the beginning while taking our orders. Seemed like she was still trying to understand how to place an order on the tablet. That was okay, we were patient enough to wait. \nBut as for the rest of our dining experience, she barely came by our table, but more like looked at us from afar. \nWhen we were done with our meal, we asked for to-go containers and the bill. She left and never came back, only clearing half of our table. \nWe tried to patiently wait, but seeing as she pretty much ignored us, because like I said, she would look at us from another table and looked away, we talked to the other waiter. \nShe was very helpful, and gave us whatever we needed within seconds, which made the experience a lot better.\n\nAside from the service from that one server, I definitely recommend trying this place out. You won't regret it!
