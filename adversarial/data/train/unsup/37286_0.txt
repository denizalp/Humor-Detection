My first experience with Boba left me unsure, but now I am a die-hard fan.\nIt is a great experience of texture and flavor and something you have to try to understand, explaining it just sounds weird.\nThis place is quaint and friendly, with a great variety of drinks and interesting appetizers, both meat and vegetarian. They have something for everyone, even if you are not adventurous enough to try the boba.\nThere are tables and soft, comfy couches to hang out and wait or enjoy whatever you order.
