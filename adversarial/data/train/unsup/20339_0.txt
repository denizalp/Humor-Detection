Not that this posting needs anymore reviews but its one of my fav places to go when ....well lets be honest when im hungover... Im black so of course i had the chicken and waffles ....it was different than i expected but a pleasant surprise none the less. It was more of a gourmet take on the classic i loved it so much i tried to make it at home ....i was not successful.... anyway i have not tried everything on the menu but what i have has been good .....i experienced good service good food and big portions wich im only a fan of when im hungover because you can have 2 meals from it without having to cook . all in all i personally have different  places i go for different reasons and this is my go to \"i need breakfast now and im hungover and i dont want to go somewhere like denny's) place.
