It's a no from me. My friend came into town and had heard good things about Mangos. So we went mid day on a Saturday. I had the Island chicken with green beans and French fries. I read somewhere that the fries were cooking in a garlic oil. They were not. There was a tiny smidge of a garlic and herb sauce that was on the fries (See photo). The beans were decent. The chicken was cut up in random pieces, dry, and bland. Fries were basic without sauce. Green beans were good. There's a mustard sauce for the chicken. It wasn't good.\n\nMy friend had curry goat, rice, and green beans. She thought her goat was a little chewy, but had decent flavor. Their cocktails were good.\n\nThings went left with the tacos. First, the taco appetizer was $11.25. It came with three tacos and I couldn't help but think how I could go to Cabo Fish Taco and get an entire meal for the same price. The pictures on Yelp showed 3 tacos. The waitress said there would be 3 tacos. They come out and there are 2 tacos. Of course I point out the obvious and she says that it's the kitchen's choice. ????!??!?! So I asked to speak to management. He comes out and says that there are two because he was delivered larger tortillas and so there's more on each taco. The pictures looked the same size as on Yelp and the waitress just said there would be three. If there was a change of plans for today, she should have known. I told him I felt like we were being jipped. He finally conceded (almost as if it's not worth arguing) and sent out a 3rd taco. He wasn't rude about it, but didn't seem to understand that consistency and managing expectations in a restaurant is a big deal. The tacos were okay. Needless to say, I won't be back.
