I'm gonna go ahead and disagree with the prior review on this one.\n\nI was initially excited to hear about the opening of this new Indian Fusion restaurant as it's right next to where I work and I love South Asian food. The concept was new, interesting, and unique. The prices were incredibly low and the pictures on the outside looked pretty good. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed when a bunch of buddies and I went to finally try it out (we all happen to be brown by the way). \n\nI can appreciate the fact that the food isn't supposed to taste exactly like Indian cuisine as it has culinary influence from several different areas of the world. But what I personally found was that the flavors and textures of the dishes they offered were as uninviting and bland as the yellow interiors of the actual establishment. We tried the red beans, the chicken korma, a couple of wraps, eggplant, and another chicken dish and somehow I couldn't even finish my food. Maybe it's just my bias since I grew up with this type of cuisine, but I'm not gonna pretend that I would even consider coming here again.\n\nTo put it briefly, you get exactly what you pay for. For $5 at lunch time, you're going to get $2 quality chicken, $1 quality rice, $2 quality taste. It's like waiting in line at the school cafeteria. In the back of your mind, you're hoping for something good today, but ultimately you end up wishing you hadn't even made the effort to get in line.\n\nYou can tell that some of the flavors are there in terms of identifying it as coming from a certain part of Asia, but you won't find the boldness or adequate seasoning in any of the dishes. The wraps were of course leaking everywhere because they put the actual chicken IN it's gravy into the tortilla. Not a clever move.\n\nI was also charged $76 because she \"pressed the numbers too quickly.\" Hopefully the void shows up in my statements, otherwise I had an unbearably overpriced lunch....\n\nI suppose if you've never had Indian food in your life, this might pass as edible.\n\n2\/5
