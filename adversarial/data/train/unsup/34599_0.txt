I finally had the pleasure of enjoying a Shake Shack Burger! My husband and I waited in line for less than ten minutes. The service is quick. If you're indecisive the employees are patient and helpful. For many years I've been obsessed with In-N-Out Burger. Now, Shake Shack has made its way into my heart!\n\nThere are several signature sandwiches to choose from along with hot dogs and french fry options. I ordered the single-Shack Burger with a strawberry shake and fries. The burgers are more expensive than I initially thought they'd be. They're a decent size, the beef was seasoned well and had those nice crispy bits that you get with a good smashed burger, the potato bun is soft and delicious. \n\nBy the way, I didn't realize you could order beer and wine? I look forward to enjoying a glass or two during my next visit.
