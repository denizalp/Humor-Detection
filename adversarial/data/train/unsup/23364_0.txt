An easy go-to if you're not a BBQ snob. \n\nIt's not the best I've ever had, but it's certainly passable BBQ and ranks in the top 10 for Charlotte BBQ places. \n\nPretty affordable with dinner+drink running you about $12-15. Hidden gem here is the drink specials which are sometimes too good to be true. A few friends and I split a bottle of wine for 3 bucks each, which doesn't get any better.\n\nThe true standout is their biscuits. I'd come and eat only those, to my own detriment. I know you'll ask for seconds of them.
