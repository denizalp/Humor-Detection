I have taken all 4 of my pets here for years and I absolutely love Dr. Huskey! I have a pet who has some significant health issues and every time we go in they know my pet and make it a point to be extra gentle with her! They even call and check on her after she's been in! I would recommend Dr. Huskey to all my friends and family!
