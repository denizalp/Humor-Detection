stumbling in at 3am being the only one in this palatial room being able to order any breakfast munchie known to man kind is way cooler than getting laid in vegas. on this particular sozzled night of mine, i happened to be craving maple syrup. i ended up ordering maple syrup with eggs, sausage, and hashbrown as sides. believe me, everything went into the syrup. ever dipped sausage into syrup? yeaa baby it's good. they were cool with that.\n\nthis place is gorgeous. quality of food here is exactly what you should expect from the Venetian. and it's not expensive. unless you're poor.
