TERRIBLE SERVICE.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went in to pick out my engagement ring and none of the employees spoke a single word to us the entire 30 minutes we were in there. We are a middle class, white, mid twenties couple, and went in there with the intent to spend a large amount of money. We will never be going into a Jared again.
