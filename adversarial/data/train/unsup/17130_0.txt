I could not have designed a better place to get drinks in the Queen East neighborhood. The Comrade is newly redesigned with a combination of brick walls, modern furniture and old signs and wall hangings it is a designer's dream.  \nThe drink menu is pages long, made up primarily of pages of beer and wine.  There is, however, a great selection of house-made cocktails.  I tried both the Gin Fizz with elderflower and the Dark and stormy, a rum and ginger beer delight on a hot summer night.  \nThere are also an array of typical top shelf liquors.  \nWe sat in the front, super comfy chairs, but ventured back to explore the lovely bar stools and the back room would be great for a private event.  \nThe servers and owners are adorable. The night we were there, Dean, the bartender was all daper in bowtie and vest. A real 'old-fashion' experience.
