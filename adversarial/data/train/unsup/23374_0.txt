My husband comes here for his weekly fade.  We've gone to other barber shops in town and I can honestly say Cesar is one of the best.  He's got true talent.  You should call in advance and make an appointment as he is typically busy all day.  If you don't have an appointment you may be in for a long wait.  \n\nThe shop is clean and comfortable.  There is a soda machine and a pool table to make the time go by.  He's got pictures on the wall if you need help deciding how you want your hair to look.  Remember this is a true barber shop.  His razor fade is amazing!\n\nLocated off Sahara and Lindell in the strip mall near the huge asian restaurant.  Prices are extremely reasonable.  If you have a mustache he even trims that up nicely.  \n\nAny of the complaints listed on here are simply because these people don't plan ahead.  Make an appointment. And yes, it's a Spanish shop but they do speak English too.  If you're lucky (like I was) you will be at the shop when his wife is making Cuban coffee.  YUM!
