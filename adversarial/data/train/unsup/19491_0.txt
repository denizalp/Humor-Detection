This is place is off the charts C U T E !!!\n\nI went here with my best friend for a quick casual dinner, mainly to try the infamous frozen hot chocolate.\n\nWe both got salads and they were pretty average, but good.\n\nThe service is out of control though, our waitress was everywhere. I felt bad for her because she seemed so frantic to accommodate everyone.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate basically tastes like a wendys frosty but with a more malted aftertaste. \n\nI'll go back the next time I'm in vegas for another frozen hot chocolate ( probably will share between 2 people)  because serendipity is so cute!
