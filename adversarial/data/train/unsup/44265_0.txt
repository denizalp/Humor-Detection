I was helping my friend moving from a small apt to a bigger home and I was half dead, extremely exhausted.  Luckily, my friend referred me to this spa and I was greeted by the owner Lee and I was able to get a whole package from Judy, the masseuse.  She first provided a whole bucket of hot water to relax my feet, then she started to work on my head gently to help me relax.  At that point, my sinus and headaches felt much better due to the gentle touch.  Next, she started to work on my neck, shoulders, my feet, back and she even put some hot stones on my lower back cuz I told her I have back pain.  Her hands were amazing and I felt like she is like an angle that saved me from hell.  I had never met anyone who is as skillful or as patient as she is.  Thx again, Lee and Judy for the outstanding services and I will definitely bring my friends and coworker if they ever need.
