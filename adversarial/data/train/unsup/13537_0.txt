This gas station is probably one of the nicer and more convenient out of the gas stations in this area. Staff is friendly and they have the basics of what you would need for your basic short-distance road trips. Sometimes, they're out of stock of the items you want to buy. \n\nBEWARE when coming after it gets dark: sketchy people are loitering outside and sometimes near your car. Doesn't make me feel comfortable even if I'm going inside real quick to pick something up.
