Brand spankin new pizza joint up in the black hole of N Phx. \n\nThis location has been (most recently) a Chuys, and an Indian Place. There is a horseshoe shaped bar but I didn't see any beer or wine??\n\nThere is plenty of sitting indoor or on a indoor patio type.\n\nThe service was an old dude and a young server, both were cool and still working out the systems. I can see lunch being an issue unless they have more people then on a Sunday @ 7:45pm.\n\nThe cook in back was a little gruff with the servers but I liked the ATTITUDE it was charming. Grumpy Italian dudes are funny. \n\nThere is a good selection of pastas and pizzas, we opted for the PIE.\n\nLarge 16 inch New York was a little over 18 bucks. Sausage, Peperoni, onion, Black Olives and Mushrooms. Had a nice medium crust. Thicker then Rays, less then Barros, but did have a nice flavored crust. The cheese was plenty but not too much like a Rosatis. The sauce was more like a Rays style, but was seriously lacking something. Seriously.\n\nAll and all the pie was good, they have great ranch unlike Amelios who use buttermilk ranch. \n\nI would like to try some of the pasta and go from there. I know i will be back I just hope the sauce has more flavor. Otherwise I cannot justify 18 bucks.
