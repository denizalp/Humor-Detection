We stopped by for Reno's pro jam on Saturday night. They moved the jam here recently and wanted to check out the new venue. We were the first ones in the smoke free back room and the waitress came by with menus. We ordered two appetizers, the wings with teriyaki sauce and the loaded tots. The sauce was so good that I asked if it was homemade and it was. The tots were so unusual because they had meat too. I only wish that they weren't smothered with so much cheese. What I liked best was the friendly staff and smoke free option. The music was great and the sound system was good but it was an off night so a small crowd. We will go back again. The jam starts at 9 but recommend getting there later.
