I found this shop on Yelp - Thank you, Yelpers!  For the four and a half star review, I already 110% trusted them with my alterations. Yea, I am that naive! Anyway, I took two dresses over - one a bridesmaid dress that was two sizes too big and a black tight dress that I accidentally cut with my scissors.  I didn't know if the dress can be saved, but I took it to this place anyway.\n\nI tried on both dresses and was told that it would take approximately 4 days to fix. The price to fix both dresses were a little pricey, but I opted to pay anyway.  In my eyes, you get what you pay for - and in this case, I am paying for \"perfection\". \n\nI strolled in yesterday to pick up the dresses and there was the owner sweet and happy as the last time I saw him.  He remembered my name and already had my dresses in his hand asking me if I want to try it on.  I first tried on the dress that was  two sizes too big, it seemed tight at first. I was thinkig, \"Oh my! If I zip this up anymore, I am gonna break this zipper!\"  I had one of the workers help me zip up my dress and when I looked at myself in the mirror, it was perfect!  Everything I asked him to do with the dress was EXACTLY what he did! I then tried on the black dress and that too was perfect.\n\nNow, here's the hard part- I now have two dresses that fit me perfectly!  That means I can't gain any more weight.  So here's the problem: Christmas is a few days away and I've already eaten a brownie, fries, cookies, and a pecan log in the past hour.  Hopefully I still fit in my \"perfect\" dresses on the day I need to wear them. Otherwise, they wouldn't be so perfect anymore. haha
