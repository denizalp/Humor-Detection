A tough week calls for a pick me up dinner. Sometimes I worry about going to a new place with crazy rave reviews as I feel my standards are jilted to high and come out feeling like it was over hyped even if the place is good\n\n I ate words- \n\nlike \"yum\", \"oh that's fresh\", and \"lets get another order\". \n\nWe really wanted to try all the specials so we started off there. \n\nToday the chalkboard had:\nBig Eye Tuna- had a richer, tuna taste than regular tuna. \nAnago\/Saltwater Eel- this was delish. It's softer and less slimy than freshwater and as much as I like unagi, I wish more places would have this. \nJapanese Snapper- this was very delicate of a flavor and very fresh. I find some snapper has a very chewy texture and almost muddy taste. \nAji\/Spanish Makerel- this was nice. I like the grated ginger on top, but I love gingery stuff. \nWhite Clam- the BF doesn't normally enjoy such thing but even he appreciated the flavor. I thought this was good and must for people who love the chewy nigiris like tako, hokkigai, ika. \n\nRegular nigiri menu:\nCajun Albacore- good seasoning. I appreciate that their ponzu sauce isn't overtly citrusy and is much more delicate than other places. There's some places that have that \"fake\" lime taste and kills all other flavor.\nAlbacore- good and fresh\nSuper White \nYellowtail- buttery in texture- very fresh\nMackerel- good, but with the cure+ soy is too salty. 2nd order I asked for ponzu and it was much better this way. \n\nOne thing I noticed about the nigiri cuts is that some have a very faint citrus note on it. Not like someone squeezed lemon, but I suspect that they wipe their blades with a citrus water which imparts a hint of it. If you douse your rice in soy, you won't probably taste it, but I barely dip any soy onto my fish. This is something I've seen done in Japan so kudos if that's what flavored it. \n\nEven at my current favorite place, there's some days where certain fish is just okay. Everything today was fresh and on. The daily specials rotating is a great idea since those are intriguing and were all fresh. \n\nI like there is half rolls- we tried the Calico and Ecstacy which are both pretty decent as far as rolls go. \n\nAppetizers: \nThe famed pork belly was pretty tasty!- Crispy, melty, salty, sweet and tangy balance. \nDynamite- most places but too much mayo. BF liked this and I appreciated it was a bit crispy on top. \nOrgasm salad- nice that you get a little sashimi salad action and it wasn't overly dressed or too much greens to fish ratio. \nHamachi Kama- we love yellowtail collars and theirs was good. I wish the skin of it was crispier though....nothing beats when it's like fish skin chips, but only one ayce so far grills it to that (Island). \nGrilled Yellowtail- this was on the specials board and was a good piece with some sweet glaze \n\nDessert: I like that you can get more than just one dessert (though some desserts have a 1order pp limit). BF and I shared the green tea creme brulee, green tea cake and tofu cheesecake. The green tea creme brulee was the winner for both of us. It isn't light on the matcha though so if you don't like the strong green tea taste then it might be a bit much but it is creamy, bittersweet burnt matcha and sugar goodness. \n\nService was great! That was one that put it over the edge for us. Servers checked on us often, was on top of drinks, had some suggestions and were friendly. It wasn't too busy until the end of our meal and the service didn't suffer just because we weren't the only ones there. The sushi chefs were super nice, funny and personable. We had Tony during the first half of dinner then Fredo came in. Fredo is all jokes and curses. I'm all for it, but just a warning to those who can't handle a fucking joke. I also like the decor in here- definitely one of the nicer ambiance ayces around. \n\nWe will be returning soon (and I will be coming sooner for the UYE) ! I feel we might be coming here on a regular and making this our favorite spot if this service and quality stays true.\n\nEDIT- Just wanted to say that the UYE had so many people (25) plus a filled restaurant and our service was still friendly, organized as possible (had separate checks ready for all us) and a reasonable pace on the food. Kudos to the staff! They work really hard here to keep up with the crowd.
