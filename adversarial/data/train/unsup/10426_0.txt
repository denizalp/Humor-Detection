Overall, a GREAT time.  I'm behind with my reviews, but when something irks me, i make it a point to review same day.  While I'd love to give Chase 5 stars, (I took 1 1\/2 away because this one is big), I can't for one big reason...  Their lack of assistance for disabled people.  Not all of us use wheel chairs.  This is a HUGE pet peeve I have.  They shouldn't call attention to the fact that I don't look handicapped, so why do I need assistance.  Yes, I live in the Desert, and I have a sun allergy.  I wasn't asking to \"cut\" in line, but being with my 7 year old, it's not like I could have him hold our space in line with 10,000 other people.  Another person shared her story with me, and had the same issue with their ignorance.  She asked if I was planning on citing the ADA and reporting them. \n\nI can't believe the run around I received \"go here, talk to this person, go to window 2, you're not on a list...\" down to \"These people have been waiting all day, you just can't walk up and try to cut the line\"!!!! Really?  It is illegal for them to ask what my disability is.  I showed them my medications, and only because they were calling me out and were doing it in front of a few hundred people waiting in line.  They should at least have a waiting area with benches to accommodate those of us with disabilities.  Please don't judge the illness' you can't see.  My kids didn't ask for a parent with an issue, why should they be penalized if I were to stay home 24\/7? \n\nThey retweet your #tweets \/ #pictures before and during the game on the mega tron. That was a fun way to kill the time before the game starts. \n\nWe sat in the \"all you can eat\" seats.  A great option if you have kids.  There is a small fee added on per ticket, but the savings were more than worth it. Hot dogs, soda, bottled water, popcorn, peanuts in the shell, and chips.  Make sure you stock up before the 7th inning, that's when they pull the food and drinks.  \n\nWe got our \"Nacho Libre'\" masks, good fun for the boy.  They offer complimentary sign making services, lots of easy to find restrooms. Overall, we had a great time and will be back. Maybe even buying Season tickets. \n\nThe down side, the migraine that has already kicked in and will last for the next 24-48 hours.  Worth it for a night out with my son.
