This place is so so so good ! It took a while for the sushi to get to our table but It was worth the wait ! The waiters checked on us and were very attentive which was nice not having to wait for the longest to order more sushThey have different types of rolls that aren't at every sushi place so it was nice to try something new. The price was well worth the food ! I' so glad this place is close by to where I work . Love love love !
