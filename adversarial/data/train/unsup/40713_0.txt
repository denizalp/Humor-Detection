Very nice and a very sporty feel. We went 4 times this week and I enjoyed 3 of my 4 meals. the first meal was gross due to the awful dressing for my salad. However the fried steak, corn beef and cabbage and hot ham and cheese was amazing and the wait staff was great. The drinks were cold and I would love to go again.
