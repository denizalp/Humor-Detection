This is one of the better mom and pop restaurant's in town.  I really like the food, the customer service and the atmosphere.  I used to come here all the time.  I eat here much less frequently since I moved to a different part of town.  The orange chicken they serve here is very unique.  It's just like eating a fillet.  This is a very traditional style restaurant.  I would prefer this place over panda express any day if the week.
