We came here last night for dinner. We had reservations so we were able to get seated when at least half of our party arrived. The restaurant was packed!\n\nIf you haven't had Brazilian steakhouses before, this is an all you can eat type. You have a paper circle...green for bring me the meat! Red for please stop, I have the meat sweats. \n\nThe salad bar had a lot of options so it's hard to not stack up on that. You want to try everything but you also want to save room for all the meats. \n\nThey also bring you fried bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheese rolls. Fried bananas were amazing!!! Not like what we have had before. It's not rolled in dough, more so covered in sugar. We got multiple dishes of it. Lobster bisque from the salad bar was a standout as well. Not too heavy on the seafood smell and very buttery. \n\nLOTS OF MEAT! The second you turned that circle green, it was a bit overwhelming with how fast they come at you and ask you if you want certain cuts. If they didn't bring something you wanted or you missed them, you can always requests for the cut. Standouts for meat would be the sausage and the filet. All of the meat was well marinated and incredibly tender. \n\nGreat place! Be prepared to eat a lot. We would be back for special occasions but not an every month type of place for us.
