I love this place. My first time here. I will be back. What a nice experience it was. I came in to get a to go order. I have always heard such good things about the food here. So I wanted to try it. But, being short on time I wanted to get it to go.\n\nI was greeted right away by a nice guy, who showed me the menu and told me a little about the Pizzas.\nI ordered a Meat Pizza, I think it was called the Skinny, as well as a half a spinach Salad and a Tiramasu Cake. (Just a Slice) Heehe\nI sat and waited ,he said about 20min. He and another girl asked me if I would like something to drink while I waited. I declined ,but very nice of them to ask.\nI was working on some paperwork,and the time flew by.\nEverything was packaged up nicely. The Pizza was piping hot when I home. The Salad was nice and cold ,and the cake even had a side of fresh whipped cream!\nThis place is a winner in my book and we will be coming back for sure.\n\nWhen we did have dinner at home ,it was all excellent. We even had leftovers for the next night.  Everything I ever heard about the Pizza is so true. EXCELLENT!\nThe dining room was clean and there was a nice warm atmosphere here as well.
