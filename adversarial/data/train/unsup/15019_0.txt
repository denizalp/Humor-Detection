It was a surprise date night, was told to be ready to go by 8:30pm, but I was running about 15 mins behind, only clue he gave me was that we are going somewhere where there are other people, so that could have been anywhere, so off we went, and boy was I surprised to find out that we were going to see Chris Kattan at Stand up Live! \n\nI'm not going to do the review on Chris's show, it was funny, but the review is more about the venue, it was my 1st time to Stand Up Live, I have been to the improv hundreds of times so I was familiar with the 2 drink min but what I did notice is that the table seating is kinda tight, but my date and I sat further back from the front of the stage, we had a long table top of sorts little bit higher than the bottom floor so that with people seating in front of us we could still see the show, I think I prefer were I was sitting. \n\nThe drink special of the night was called Night at the Roxbury which was raspberry vodka, Chambord, and sprite, that drink was sweet and perfect! I did get 2 of them, also ordered the warm chocolate cake with chocolate & camel sauce and vanilla ice cream, the cake was good, but it wasn't warm, I like warm cake to melt ice cream, but both were equally cold, but it was still good.\n\nI found that service was a little on the slow side for me, but once the show started I forgot I was still waiting for my order. \n\nIt was a great date night, and I will be back! It's great to have a venue down town that host live comedy shows!
