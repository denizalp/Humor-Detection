Oh what an enormous disappointment... I grew up coming here. I remember my mom taking me here as a kid and they had the best fajitas. I decided to try them again for the first time in 15 years and I was so excited and then so incredibly let down. The first thing I noticed was the decor. It literally hasn't changed in the last 15 20 years. It's completely outdated. Next was the price. Are you kidding me? $30+ for fajitas!??? The owner has got to be out of his mind to charge that amount. I have never in my life seen fajitas so expensive. Literally double of any other restaurant. It's completely unacceptable. I should have walked out right then but my BF convinced me to stay and we'll just share an order so we can at least try them. Soooo- incredibly not worth it. Not at all. The shrimp were tiny, the steak was well over cooked, the tortillas were very small and they only gave us three even though we were sharing. We asked for more but was told it would cost extra. There was barely enough food for one person let alone two. The chips and salsa were okay and because of their overpriced ridiculousness we only had water, which tasted dirty, so it was tap water, not filtered. I would never go back here. I was so saddened by what has happened to this place. A place that used to be beyond popular is now a place to avoid. Lower your prices by half, up your quality and quantity and maybe we'd return. There are many other places that are way better in price, quality and quantity then this place, so don't bother.
