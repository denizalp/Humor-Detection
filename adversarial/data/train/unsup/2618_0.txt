Going to Amelie's is always a treat. The Park Rd location sits behind the shopping center. There's plenty of parking and outdoor seating.\n\nOf course, the French-inspired grubs are yummy! Amelies also offers wine! Yes, please! Naturally, Amelies is a Great place to unwind, work, or meet with friends. The atmosphere is great, and the staff is friendly. I always appreciate their recommendations. Overall this cafe is clean and tidy. \n\nThere's a lot to choose from if you're interested in pastry and desserts, soups, salads and more. I'm truly obsessed with the macarons, the flavors change each season. I had the pleasure of trying the NEW Lavender Lemon Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich! The Lemon sorbet was zesty and refreshing. I would recommend sharing this dessert with a friend(it's huge). Naturally, I couldn't leave without purchasing a few other Macarons, I tried three new flavors (Passionfruit, Key lime, and blackberry basil). FYI the blackberry basil is DELISH!
