Love the Steelers or just love football in general. If you're in Pittsburgh be sure to stop by Heinz field and take the $6.50 tour. It's 1 1\/2 hours taking you all through the stadium, locker rooms, sky box, press box, luxury suites, cheap seats and the field. Our tour guide \"Jack\" was very informative and friendly and you could tell he loved his stadium. Our tour went 30 minutes over so don't schedule things too tight in case this happens to you. \n\nOn this visit the 6 (yes 6) Superbowl trophies were there on display, quite the added bonus. Usually the ones at the stadium are replicas and the real ones are located at their training field. \n\nIf you're not a walker don't go or request a wheelchair if you have someone strong willing to push. Since you go down ramps you need someone who would be able to control the chair. I'm a Steeler fan by marriage but I would recommend it even if it's not your team. It is an amazing field.  If your a fan it's as good as it gets.
