The absolute busiest subway station in Toronto as it is the interchange station of the lines that go North-South and East-West, THIS is where everyone changes lines if they have to go a different direction.\n\nThere's been several instances of EXTREME delays and efforts are definitely here to restore the station with many ttc staff here bright and early in the mornings to direct traffic. \n\nIf I had to rate the station alone, I would probably give it a 1 star, but I think the announcer and staff on this station in particular deserves the extra boost. Unlike a lot of countries where subway stations have automated messages now, or at least people that speak in it as if they were automated messages, this subway station has a live announcer that definitely cheers me up in the mornings and during rush hour. I don't think they're always there every morning, but amidst the huge lines and stressful rushes to get on the train to get places, this announcer is an MVP of this ttc station.
