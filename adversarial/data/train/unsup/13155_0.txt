Impressive!  \n\nThis little place is a modestly decorated, scrupulously clean fish taco joint with a fresh toppings bar and very, very friendly employees who really go out of their way to greet you and make sure you know what the offerings are.  \n\nI liked it.  Considering it's walking distance from my office I'll be back.
