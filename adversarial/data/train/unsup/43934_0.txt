I come here often in the early morning at the end of my work shift for a bagel before heading home. This location has always been clean, the staff friendly, and the service quick! \n\nI've found there is usually always a group of a few adults who meet up here in the morning to grab a cup of coffee together, which sounds like a good indicator for the friendly service and good food. \n\nAs always, I'll be back :)
