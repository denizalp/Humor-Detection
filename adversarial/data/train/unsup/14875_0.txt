Someone else paid, so I shouldn't complain...but I won't let that stop me. \n\nHarvest is one of those places with tiny silly portions that comes on a plate squiggled with butternut-rosemary-goat teat-pear seed reduction. Perhaps I am a complete plebeian Midwesterner, but after 3 courses, I left not full  and unimpressed with the food.\n\nThe food was interesting. It was complex. It was intellectual. It was edgy. It was NOT yummy. From appetizer to main course to dessert, there is nothing I tasted that I would ever care to have again. It's sort of like if you're dating some pretentious film student who makes you sit through all these gems of Swedish cinema, and you're thinking, \"People do not watch these movies unless other people tell them they should because they are without emotional power.\" The food at Harvest is like that, very heady without senorsy attraction. Would other people covet it so if it wasn't so widely coveted? \n\nThe service was very great. The meal was well paced, and we were able to have a long, relaxed conversation. I realize that this is one reason that people go to really expensive restaurants -- it would be nice if the food were an attraction too.
