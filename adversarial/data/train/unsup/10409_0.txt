Steeped in the traditions and trappings of an \"Old Boys Club\" industry, the Calgary Petroleum Club is a unique experience in Calgary.  Often accessible only by membership or invitation, you'll find wood panelled walls, phenomenal food, and amazing service.  Remember to wear a tie though or you'll stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nSide note, check out the washrooms. WOW!
