So this is one of the local places in our new 'hood!\n\nWe drove by it a few times making trips back and forth from the old place... you can tell just by looking at it that it's going to be GREAT or TERRIBLE. Obviously, I mean, for what it is... the neighbourhood delivery place... not gourmet, but homemade and pretty high quality.\n\nWe were suspicious of the HUGE range of options on the menu... but it was the only place I recognized on my virgin journey of ordering food on Just-Eat.ca... not to mention ordering for the first time in a NEW neighbourhood! \n\nSo... It was great! Thank goodness we now have a go-to place for food delivery (I hope... will def. re-review the next couple times too)!\n\nTwo meat-eaters (Mr. Rosie S., also known as \"D\"... and my MOM!) and me, a veghead. THAT was the challenge in trying to find a place for all of us... I was pretty sure my Mom would prefer anything BUT pizza, and D is on a health kick, so I needed a lot of choice.\n\nGO DIAMOND PIZZA!!! You saved the day!\n\nD and my Mom split a whole chicken meal (and had leftovers) with rice. OH MY GOD THE RICE IS FANTASTIC. They put crack in it or something... it's wonderful.\n\nSo here is what we ordered:\n- Whole Chicken with BBQ sauce, coleslaw & buttered french\nloaf & your choice of rice, potatoes, rice & potatoes, or fries. \n(We chose rice and it was UNBELIEVABLY good. My fave part of the meal).\n- Greek salad with all the trimmings - and their house-made salad dressing is AWESOME! Produce fresh and flavourful.\n- Spanikopita & Tiropita - We got a call from Diamond Pizza themselves that they didn't have Tiropita... unclear as to whether they meant THAT night or ALWAYS - spanikopita was OK, but the edges were too hard and chewy - had to cut them off.\n\nSo other than the spanikopita, which wasn't very good, the rest was great, and just what we needed.\n\nYour friendly neighbourhood delivery place!
