I came to Border Grill today because it was one of the few bottomless mimosa restaurants with good ratings. I was definitely impressed. I ordered the unlimited tapas brunch as well as the bottomless mimosa. Each mimosa was different with a different type of juice, not similar to your regular orange juice and champagne. They were all very good. The tapas as well as the guacamole were very good. Some of my favorites where the steak and eggs, Peruvian shrimp and grits, and the stuffed waffles.
