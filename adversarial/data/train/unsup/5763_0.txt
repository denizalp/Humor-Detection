First off, what a incredible show. The venue is in the Mirage Hotel, a fantastic location with plenty of choices for your pre-show meal. The show has a gift shop with anything that you could think of regarding the Beatles, as well as some other items that might surprise you. There are no bad seats in the house as the stage is in the round, and it is somewhat customer interactive. Not only do you get a fantastic catalog of Beatles music, you also get an amazing acrobatic act in full Cirque fashion. The show lasts a full 90 minutes and it will seem to fly by leaving you wishing there was more. The interpretation of the music seems spot on, with a musical investigation of each emotion transitioning each Beatles hit to the next. Bottom line, this show is a must see for both the hard core Beatles fan as well as someone looking to expand their horizons, DONT MISS THIS!!!!
