I went back and actually got pretty decent service. Although I think I'm just too white trash and not enough hipster for this sort of place\n\nMy burger and drink ended up costing something like $19.  Ridiculous.  At Red Robin for around $12 you can get a burger, all-you-can-eat steak fries, and a drink.\n\nThe fries here are little tiny shoestring things that don't taste anything like potatoes.  What's the point?  I want steak fries dammit.\n\nThe bun is this weird sugary glazed dinner roll type thing.  It confuses my mouth.
