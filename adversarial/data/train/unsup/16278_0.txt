Went to the Grey Eagle for the Wynonna concert and thought we would try the buffet before the show. Big mistake.  The lineup wasn't an issue. I had issue with being made to pay in advance and then being told we had to wait to be seated because we had a odd number of guests. We watched table after table of 2 3 and 4 people being seated, even watched a couple walk in through the line and plate up and sit down. At a booth for 4. Table was greasy when we sat down, we were on our 2nd plates before we got acknowledged and had a drink order taken and our server never came back with our drinks. Mentioned it to the hostess and she just snarled at me and shrugged. Never again.
