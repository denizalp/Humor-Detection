As any nosey K-drama fan would, I had to add Paris Baguette to my list of musts, since their logo\/name pops up prominently on so many sponsored end credits. And with over 1800+ locations, probably one on every other block in Seoul, this is Nevada's first PB, located inside Venetian's Grand Canal Shoppes. \n\nThe mini chocolate croissant (Cocossant) was nice & flaky and only $1.50. I was tempted by a raspberry cronut but I had other dessert stops on my itinerary and had to decline.\n\nTo be expected their regular sized pastries & desserts are on the pricey side and they do have a few take home\/souvenir treats attractively packed for purchase.\n\nThey also had similar pastries that can be found at home (macarons, sausage bread, mushipan, cream cakes, etc).\n\nIf I was staying at the Venetian, or somewhere close by, I would've returned to try their quick bites (sandwiches, ice cream popsicles, iced coffee, etc) & stopped in upstairs for a relaxing break to people watch from above.
