Don Juan's is little more than one of those small food trucks known in Canada as a \"chip wagon\" or cabanes Ã  patates, literally meaning  \"potato shack,\" with generator running and food offering signs plaster about it operating on Front Street near the  Metro Toronto Convention Centre. Basically its offerings are little more than greasy but tasty enough street foods the likes of Polish sausages, hot dogs, burgers and fries, though seemingly as an overlooked token gesture of healthy eating, a veggie hot dog. \n\nHowever it does specialize in one the more truly Canadian, albeit Quebec in origin, food offerings called Poutine. If, like most Americans, you are not acquainted with Poutine, it is traditionally a serving of French fries and cheese curd topped with a brown gravy sauce. Though I didn't order this particular dish at Don Juan's, what I saw them serving up as Poutine substituted true curd for a grated cheese that to me tasted as being that of a sharp cheddar. \n\nThe staff of Don Juan's are friendly, quick witted and full of humor. I know that having learned I was from Florida, when my order was ready they called it out as being \"pick up ready for the Gatorlander.\"  LOL!
