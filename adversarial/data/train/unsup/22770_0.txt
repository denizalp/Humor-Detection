Decent drive-thru coffee, dudes! They don't offer a food menu, but the drinks here are divided into hot and cold, as well s fruit smoothies and kids beverages. The Granita is their take on a frappe, and it seems to be a best seller- you can get $1 off their already-low prices if you go between 4-6PM. Right now, they're really pushing the smoothies during summer- and the acai flavor is especially filling and refreshing. Service is friendly teens, and even better: no obligatory tip line on the receipt!
