I have a sushi problem. I can't even say I crave it at this point because it's constant! It would be like saying I crave air- I need it! In the last few years I have been to Nori Sushi probably 1000 times and it's consistently fresh and delicious. I was caught in a downpour this afternoon while doing some shopping at Desert Ridge and it was the perfect excuse to treat myself to some lunch.\n\nSince it looked like a scene from the cinematic masterpiece Sharknado outside, I was the only person there. I shimmied my way up to the bar and was greeted quickly by the bartender. She made a great recommendation on Sake and I'm glad I listened to her and ordered the Mio sake that was not on the menu. Fresh and bubbly!\n\nFor lunch I started out with quail egg and yellowtail. Their quail egg was some of the best I've had, and I get it everywhere. Perfectly spicy and flavorful. The yellowtail was good- a pretty basic cut of fish. Next was the Poke bowl. A generous serving of Ahi Tuna and sticky rice. Add a bit of Poke sauce, some avocado, wasabi and voila! Party in your mouth! Everything tasted fresh and great. My only complaint is that I wish I could have options for more ingredients in the bowl. This was very basic. But did the job. \n\nIn the past I've had just about everything. I would highly recommend their Toro, Spicy Sashimi Salad, Tempura Udon, Gyoza, and Crispy Green Tea Waffle for dessert!
