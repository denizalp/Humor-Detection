Best manicure ever! Ask for a dazzle dry manicure which is normal polish (not gel) and it lasts for over 2 weeks. \nI also received an amazing massage by Bonnie. I highly recommend her.\nMy hair is done by Priscilla. She weaves both high lights and low lights in my hair. I really like it!\nGreat salon!!!
