This is my favourite croissant in Montreal.  There, I said it.\n\nI know others will disagree, I've heard my fair share of arguments of other places that are \"better\" but it isn't going to change my mind!\n\nBrioche a Tete have mastered the art of a croissant with a crunchy-crackly outer shell, with a soft, buttery, fluffy dough texture on the inside.\n\nBut don't stop there!  Not to be missed are the Choco-Marshmallow Cookies (just as delicious as they sound), and the Chocolatines.  As well as a host of other viennoiseries available in the display cases, yum!\n\nThey also make quiches (meat and vegetarian options available), sandwiches, and fresh coffee.  Hibiscus tea from Atigh's (Le Khaima) across the street is also available.\n\n\nI know it's a little hyperbolic, but words cannot describe the perfection of the croissants here, so I won't try any further.  That being said, my conscience is torn about giving Brioche à Tête a five star review because unfortunately not every other viennoiserie is as on point.  I'm going with five nonetheless because this place is just a little slice of heaven for me.  Since I moved to Toronto, hell even before I moved I already knew they had something special, but now I definitely miss them!\n\nGo and see for yourself!
