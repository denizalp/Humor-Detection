I suppose it's weird to think of a liquor store having \"character\", or providing an experience beyond fulfulling the basic need to purchase booze. In my experience, most liquor stores are no-bullshit, utilitarian establishments, operated by people with whom you should avoid making direct eye contact. They're not typically places you want to linger. But then again, this is Bath, Ohio. Money grows on trees here. Anything is possible, even yuppie liquor stores. \n\nJohnny's is a strange and occasionally wonderful place. It sits in the middle of nowhere, flanked by a couple of garden centers and truck depots on an otherwise desolate stretch of Cleveland-Massillon Road, but Johnny's teal-colored cinderblock building looks downright festive. It says, \"C'mon inside, let's buy some liquor and party our asses off.\" The guys working behind the counter can be just as colorful, too. (I imagine that if you embarked on that timeless cliche and attempted rob this liquor store, the clerks would attempt to engage you in some kind of Socratic dialogue, then try to sell you a fancy $10 chocolate bar, instead of opening the register and handing over the cash. It's that kind of place.) There's a whole lotta liquor, and the beer selection is a microbrew paradise. They don't take credit cards for booze, and they're closed on Sunday. Minor inconveniences.\n\nThe upstairs is for wine. Again, it's an odd arrangement. Most of the wine sits on the floor in dimly-lit crates, like it's the U. S. Customs warehouse or something. You've got bottles of $6.99 Argentinian hooch sitting right next to $500 bottles of fine Grand Cru Bordeaux.  There's no rhyme or reason to it that I could ever decipher. It's like a treasure hunt for dedicated drunks. \n\nThere's really nothing like it in the area....there's no competition if you don't want Giant Eagle or the Circle K gas station dictating what kind of wine or beer you can purchase on short notice.
