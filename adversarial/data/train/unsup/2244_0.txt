Went for the first time on Saturday and wow was I surprised how big and gorgeous this place was!There are so many different areas to hang here which is really cool.  On Saturdays in the summer they have bands that play and you can bring a picnic blanket or chairs and just hang out on the lawn and enjoy the music for free(!). They also have an outdoor covered bar\/outdoor pizza area where you can sit and eat and enjoy being outside.  There's also the restaurant with an outdoor patio area (first come first serve for that outdoor seating - no reservations there).  Inside, there's a room off to the side that is the tasting area where you can have 2 samples for free or pay $5 for 5.  We'll do that next time.   \n\nWe were going for dinner inside - i would recommend reservations for sure or you'll have to wait  a while to get seated in there.  They have seating at 5 pm and 8 pm and they fill up pretty quickly so make reservations in advance.  Luckily our friends made reservations and we were seated right away.  Food wise, it was very good!  Hubby had Colorado lamb chops which were cooked perfectly.  I had the lobster and shrimp arriabbiatta which was filled with huge lobster chunks - very tasty.  Our whole table enjoyed the meal.  Please leave room for tiramisu (or get a piece to go) It was the biggest piece I ever had - I shared mine with hubby and we had enough to share more on the next day too - whoa.  We will definitely be back we had a great time!
