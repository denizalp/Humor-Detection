Went in with a flat tire and had no idea i was about to learn how to change it myself, in fifteen minutes, at no charge. Of course i left tip in the jar, but there was absolutely no pressure to. They seem to genuinely want and enjoy helping people learn about bikes and becoming more self sufficient.  I have since changed two other tires without guidance. So proud of myself and thankful and appreciative of this place. These guys rock! !!!
