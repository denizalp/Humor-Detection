This is my first time learning any type of martial art. I was nervous first coming in, not knowing anything about Jiu Jitsu, but Michael made me feel right at home. He is welcoming and informative. This place has a great atmosphere and the instructors are awesome. Everyone is there to learn and help each other, no competition. Looking forward to training at Gracie Jiu Jitsu for many years!
