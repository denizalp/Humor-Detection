I have been to a number of chiropractors over the years, and have had back and neck pain since my early 20s, but I have never found a chiropractor so competent in his skill and helpful in his technique than Dr. Ely. He combines a gentleness with strength, pinpoint precision in identifying and resolving the problems, and a genuine concern for my whole person, unlike anyone I've ever met in his profession.\n\nI never get the sense that Dr. Ely has anything other than my best interests in mind, and that of my whole family. When I am under his care, I am the most important person in his world at that very moment.\n\nI drive about 45 minutes to get to his office, passing by dozens of other chiropractic offices, and will continue to drive to receive this kind of quality care.
