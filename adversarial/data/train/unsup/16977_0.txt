I'm not one to tear a place apart...  Sorry Wah Sun, you asked for it.\n\nNormally, walking into a place that has all tables and no counters, no \"actual\" menus, only takes cash, and is run by an angry Chinese woman armed with an adding machine is a good sign -- seriously.  I'm all about no-frills authentic.  So I had high hopes, especially eating here on a recommendation.\n\nLong story short, we kind of planned on getting stabbed by the worker for asking questions.  Don't ask what comes with anything, what kind of sauce, etc.  At Wah Sun, this should be common knowledge.\n\nAnyway, the food took forever, and the place smelled like it was about to burn down, or had already partially burned down recently.  They don't take cards, no big deal.  We got screamed at a few times and ran away with our food, hoping for the best and receiving the worst.\n\nAll the food tasted like fish, and fish only.  Unfortunately none of us ordered fish.  Even the rice tasted like fish... not good sushi taste, but heated-up-in-the-sun fish juice from a dirty street fish taste.  Usually you can wash it down with an egg roll, but I think that's what they used to create that fire scene mentioned above.  It was like a black log.\n\nFour of us got take out, four of us did NOT order fish, four of us wanted to vomit, four of us did, and four of us would have had to call in sick the next day if we hadn't been off.\n\nWah Sun?  Skip it.
