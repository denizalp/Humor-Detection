My favorite sushi restaurant in the valley.  I don't think I've ever had the Korean bbq there because I'm always at the sushi bar.  The fish always tastes fresh, the price is good, really good if you do the all you can eat menu.  Its really rare to find a place with better service and this place has the absolute best, nicest, most charming sushi chef in town.  The owner makes a point to remember his customers and often chats among them.    Even if you were disappointed with the bbq I'd highly suggest giving the sushi side a try.
