We booked this hotel via Expedia.  the room was clean and a good size.   The pools were all closed except one tiny one.  They had as many chairs as they could stuff in there.  It was packed and super unpleasant.  We stayed on the 34 th floor and on Saturday night, you could hear the music from the nightclub.  It was pretty bad.  The staff was very pleasant.  The resort fee covers the cost of wifi. Not awful but not remarkable.
