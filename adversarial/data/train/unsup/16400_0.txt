Immovable Objects, If They're Bank Vaults, Make Pretty Restaurants\nMary S. Dallas\n\nDear Crop,\n\nI think you just put Cleveland back on the map. This is the most sought-after dining destination.  Steve is dedicated to assisting Foodie Orgasms and continually exceeding guest's expectations with exquisite culinary creations and exceptional food service  \n\nI am Lured to the culturally rich Ohio City, where is now the new home of \"Crop Bistro\"  This may be the best place to rub elbows with Clevelands Finest.  I would have to say these were some of the best dishes I have ever consumed and no I am not Liliane Bettencourt who lives a luxurious lifestyle, traveling throughout the world, but the food here was F$cking Fantastic.  \n\nI love my Ahi Tuna like my men  \"Firm and flaky\" in texture Crop executed it fully.  \n\noh those Deviled eggs, if Hell serves them let me sin! \n\nand don't forget the beloved by so many Chicken and Waffles- Spiced Savory Maple Syrup topped on pecan crusted pan fried chicken.  That's a slice of heaven on a plate.  \n\nHudson Valley Foie Gras- Cherry Compote, Challah, Cinnamon Honey.  I questioned this at first, boy was I wrong for not trusting the kitchen.  This was \"liver cotton candy\" melt in mouth the flavors synced like my ipod to my teenagers hand kind of dish! \n\nHere is the problem- I live in Dallas,  so now am currently fantasizing about re-living my Foodie \"O\"  \n\n Thank you again Crop (Enjoy big flavors  here)\n\nMary S.
