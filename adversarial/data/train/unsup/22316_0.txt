My boyfriend and I love coming here and have been coming here a lot. However right now as I am writing this, I'm sitting down in front of my ramen and pork buns that I have no appetite to eat FOR BEING TREATED RUDELY BY THE SERVER AND THE MANAGER. We got told off not to use the \"flash\" taking pictures RUDELY by the server. I felt upset by it so I tried to talk to their manager whose only intention was to push the fact to \"not use flash\".\n\nDuring today's day and age, what kind of human being doesn't take pictures especially of places they think are cool and hip?\n\nWell if you want to come here DO NOT TAKE PICTURES W YOUR FLASH OR PICTURES AT ALL BECAUSE THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEM MAKING SURE YOU ARE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL.\n\nVERY VERY RUDE
