My husband and I had a disappointing stay at MGM Grand. \n\nWhile we love the MGM Grand Pool and their reservable cabanas, I have to say that the hotel is lackluster. \n\nIt was our anniversary and we were primed for upgrading our room. But my husband got an email telling us to check in by phone only. We were reluctant, but then saw a huge line to check in, so we just did the mobile check in. It literally gave us a room on the lowest floor with zero view (I think we could see roof HVAC equipment and that's it) and no chance to upgrade. We were annoyed but thought we probably wouldn't spend a ton of time in the room so we could grin and bear it. \n\nWe purchased early check in, which worked fine, and late check out. My husband called the front desk to confirm that we were indeed checking out at 3pm, they confirmed. \n\nWhen we returned from the pool we came back to a maid in our room. It was really annoying because we had already confirmed that we had the late check out. In addition, our keys wouldn't work, so the maid called security on us to make sure we were the occupants. It just felt awful and offensive. \n\nDefinitely not a place we feel good about spending a lot of money at. Between hotel room and cabana, restaurants and gambling, we dropped a lot of money here and feel awful about how we were treated on our wedding Anniversary.
