The guys that we have worked with have been nothing but professional. Its such a large expense to put in a pool and they certainly have made it easy for our family. Paul spent a ton of time at our house and created several different revisions to match our desires and budget. Paul the foreman was ALWAYS available to help me with any questions. He also came out regularly to make sure things were going well including prepping for the freeze. Brandon in the office was always helpful and addressed ever issue in a timely manner. The pool in complete and looks great!!! Thank you Desert Springs Pools
