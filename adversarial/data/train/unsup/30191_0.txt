Service was excellent! Food came out quickly and tasted very good. I like really spicy food and ordered spice level 20 out of 10. The waiter warned me that if it is too hot, they can't adjust it. It sort of made me scared. But, the spice level ended up being about a 7 out of 10. The flavors were great. If I had to make one minor compliant, it would be that the beef tasted just ok. I'm from Miami, and there is a restaurant named Ruson that has cooked the same dish, Beef Basil, for me about 30 times. There beef tastes better than Archi's beef. Not sure if it a different quality or just a different method of cooking it.\n\nThe bottom line is that I highly recommend Archi's. There prices are actually too low! They could charge one and a half times what they do and no one would complain.
