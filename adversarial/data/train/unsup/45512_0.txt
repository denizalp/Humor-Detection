The food was EXCELLENT, but the service was subpar. Apparently there was also an ice shortage because our drinks came with like 1-2 ice cubes. After flagging someone down, my iced tea was just luke warm tea. The lack of service, plus the 45 min wait def pulled down their score card...but again, the food was excellent. \nThe buffalo wasabi wings was an interesting mix. If you like wings, I would def recommend it.\nThe mac n cheese burger was pretty good. Again, and interesting mix of flavors. The pulled pork burger is a def recommend! Really good flavor. We liked how the fries come in a variety, so you don't have to choose between curly, shoe string, or crinkle fries.
