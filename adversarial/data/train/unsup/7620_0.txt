28\/30\n\nI went here for my birthday one year; dressed in a red satin cocktail dress and metal heeled stilettos (that one of my dude friends told me made me sound like a clippety cloppety billy goat when I walked, hahahaha) and felt like a sophisticated grown-up lady. Who knew? \n\nLive jazz, with an amazing drummer who kept the beat even though at one point he was drumming so fast that one of his sticks flew out of his hand! Listening to amazing music, while sitting on a bar stool at the table, sipping red wine, nibbling on fresh fruit, bread and pear jam will make you feel so. money. \n\nThe menu doesn't have very many vegan options, but you'll find that Beat Niq is pretty accommodating. I've been here several times since that Fancy Birthday and it's been an awesome time every time. \n\nFood service starts at 9 PM, and it's free corkage on Tuesday nights. Maybe one of these days, I'll be hip enough to have a membership. But then again, you know what Groucho Marx says about becoming a member of any place that would ~have~ you as a member... ;)
