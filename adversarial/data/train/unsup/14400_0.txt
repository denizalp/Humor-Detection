Masala dosas, savory and crisp and pleasantly sour, just like in Chennai\/Madras. Super mango lassi so thick, I was still sipping on my drive home. Worth a trip!\n\nIf you don't know what a dosa is, it's South India's answer to the crepe. Made of fermented rice and lentil flour, it's typically stuffed with spiced potatoes or coconut chutney. South Indian fare is typically gluten free (and usually vegetarian), as they rely on rice instead of wheat for flour. \n\nBring a handy wipe or hand sanitizer, because the most authentic part of this experience was eating with the hands. As with any hole in the wall, service was fast, food was cheap, and bathrooms were not advisable.
