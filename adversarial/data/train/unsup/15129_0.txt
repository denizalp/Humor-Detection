Definitely worth a try!\n\nI remember seeing pictures of a ice cream rose all over instagram and knowing I wasn't going to new York anytime soon, I was super excited to know Vegas had a spot that made it. To our surprise, its the same shop! Its not simply eating gelato, its a gelato rose! How often can you tell people you've tried that?! \n\nYou basically choose the size you want\/pay then you tell them what flavors you want and the girls did an amazing job building our rose for us.
