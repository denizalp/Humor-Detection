Yes, Just A-OK! \n\nI came to this location because I was in the area, and looking for a Car Stereo! As I entered the Store....it is the Same As All the Other Best Buys in the Valley, But....when it came to Getting Assistance, Well, that's where it all went Downhill for me! I saw someone in the Mobile Audio Department, but he was on the Phone...His Cell Phone! Didn't Even Bother to ask if I Needed any Help at All!!\n\nI went to the Area where they Sold Tablets, and while looking around, All I See are Employees Standing Around, Talking to Each Other...I am Sorry! But You have just Lost a Consumer at this Location! \n\nLike I have Said Before, This Store is Like all the Others in the Valley, but When it comes to Customer Service...That's where I got Turned Off! I think I will just stick to My Best Buy that I always go to!
