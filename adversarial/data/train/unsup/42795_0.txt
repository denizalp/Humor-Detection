Get the Bison Burger!  Great food, good location, cooked well, this is one of the best places to eat in South Park (Library) love eating here.  Now they have another location in Mt. Lebanon right on the main drag in town.\n\nBnD'z Burgerz & Dogz isnt the cheapest place, its not Burger King cheap but the quality, taste of food and service is again, outstanding.\n\nEat here, you wont be disappointed.
