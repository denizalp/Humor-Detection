My usual stylist is a far drive and now breaking out on her own is even a further drive. With work I was finding myself taking 2 hour lunches which well isn't really something I should be doing very often just to get my hair done- she no longer took clients on weekends :\/ ....so (yes I felt necessary to provide that explanation) I decided to try my good friends stylist as her hair always looks great.\n\nI was lucky to score a 5:30 appointment yesterday and get parking in their lot (score)! I found the old B&B very charming but I wasn't really sure where to go...I wished my hair dresser gave me some direction as to what room was hers. Eventually I asked another stylist and met Christy who was very polite and quickly got started right on time. \n\nShe consulted with me and upfront stated her prices ... The cost was about $30 more (when you factor in tip)  than my stylist who was by no means cheap...so I was really hoping to look great. I also like how my old stylist always offered a beverage...no drink here. At one point I had to let my highlights develop and was ushered into a room for a very long time- she took another client in between which I felt was a bit odd. As a result it took about a half hour longer than my old stylist - but she did apologize saying the other woman wanted her hair flat ironed. \n\nNow on to the really important part- the color really came out beautiful and she did a fantastic job with the cut and especially the style - a partial color and cut without tip was $160 - maybe standard for some but I cringed a little. \n\nRegardless, I walked out of the salon feeling like I was in an herbal essence commercial. I met up with friends later who oooh'd and ahh'd so I may stick with her for awhile...hey I can always have a glass of wine post-salon.
