I have never experiences such direct RACISM before in my life. I visited the Westgate community today and I have to say I am very disappoint in the management their. I walked in their office where I was not it knowledge. At first I thought the women in pink was busy helping someone else but then I noticed someone came in and she immediately it knowledge them. When she finally got to me she was VERY rude and abrupt. I asked her to see the Arizona units and her reply was \"I don't  have any open right now\" then asked \"well when are  you looking to move, we have a 60 day notice and no one has given notices yet.\" I am not looking to move until March and IF I had been able to look at the unit  and like them enough I would have made other arrangements to possible move in April or May and put down a holding deposit. But she was so rude towards me that I couldn't even get her to show me a unit or even talk about the different options. \n\nI have read other post on different website about how horrible the management is their. But the post where all about 2 years old. So I thought things would be different sadly I was wrong. Although the community is in a nice locate and has nice features. The management their needs some serious help.\n\nIn case anyone is wondering I'm young well spoken Africa American women. I walked in their office today in jean short (an appropriate length), a nice full length shirt, and with a nice hand bag. Nothing about me says I'm \"ghetto\"  or I hang out with a \"bad crowd\".
