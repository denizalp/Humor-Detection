Great place that is out of the way. \n\nSan Tan shopping is like 10 mins down the road. Not too bad. There is a chevron gas station on the corner. However, if you \"go green\"as in  not have the room cleaned one night they give you a $5 credit which we used for snacks. The snacks were reasonably priced for a hotel. \n\nClean rooms.\nGreat shower water pressure.\nGreat body wash, shampoo dispensers. Nice, clean citrus scent.         They should sell some of these  products in the lobby. \nMicrowave fridge and coffee in room plus plus. \nThey have a bar in the lobby.\nThey serve breakfast and dinner. \nNice firm bed with soft pillows. \n\nThe only thing I wish they had was a jacuzzi hot tub by the pool. I'm not going to take a star off for that. It's the gamble you take when you bid blind on a deal. Stayed here two nights. \n\nStaff was friendly and all smiles at all times! Thank you staff.
