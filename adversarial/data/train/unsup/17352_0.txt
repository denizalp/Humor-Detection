Second time we've been here.  The wait is the usual barber shop wait, maybe 10 - 20 mins.  \n\nThe first time we had a different barber (didn't get his name) he did a nice job, didn't take forever... was nice enough, charged us a fair price for a 6 year old sized head :o)\n\nYesterday we had the asian guy... that sounds stupid I know, but I didn't catch his name.  But lemme tell you, he's frickin AWESOME... very precise, very fast, and just did an awesome job.  We get Dom a #1 on the sides and #2 on top, line up the front, sides and neck - this is the best hair cut he's ever had.. adorable little man!  The barber lined him up with a straight razor!  I almost had a heartattack, but the end result was very CLEAN.  \n\nIf you want a great hair cut that looks like its worth 50 bucks for the low low price (for kids) of 12 bucks, go here.  These guys are hard workers and know what they're doing.\n\nThey have a pool table in there, but I didn't see any balls or que's?  So, maybe next time we can play while we wait?  2 tv's in there playing sports.  Rap\/ Hip Hop\/ Spanish Hip Hop playing on the speakers (unsensored - if you care).
