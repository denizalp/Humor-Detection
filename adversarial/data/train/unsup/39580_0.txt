This is a GREAT Denny's, as far as Denny's go.  I used to work here, and I can tell you that everything is very clean, and the staff is well-trained. \nSomething to try: The strawberry lemonade. It's lemonade with strawberry preserves blended into it (comparable to cheesecake factory).  When people ordered it, I used to just bring them a carafe (free refills, so no extra charge), because everyone always wanted at least 4 refills.\nSomething to watch for: Ordering 2 eggs, toast, and bacon will cost you A LOT more than ordering the combo. A new server might not know that they have a combo that includes what you're ordering, and might input the items separately, if you order them that way.  \nSomething to avoid: Complicated orders.  Hate to say it, guys, but the cooks here very rarely speak perfect English.  It's very difficult to make them understand the special requests.  Either way, if you want your breakfast cooked on a separate griddle, with \"just a splash of grape seed oil\" because you have a \"sensitive stomach\" you really shouldn't be eating at Denny's in the first place.  Of course if you want something substituted, sauce on the side, poached eggs etc. that's completely fine.
