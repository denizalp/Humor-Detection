It doesn't get much better than $29 for a prix fixe on the Strip, let alone a seafood restaurant inside the Cosmo. You can probably expect to pay at least that much for any one of these dishes during dinner service. Did I really need a three course meal for lunch? Probably not. But hey, I'm on vacation!\n\nWe arrived at 11:30 without a reservation and were seated immediately. The terrace is gorgeous and airy and overlooks the strip, making for some pretty great people watching. We started with delicious crusty bread and the most amazing olive oil that I've had outside of Greece (humblebrag, I know... sorry).  The server came over with a fresh oregano plant and tiny scissors and hand-snipped a few into the oil. Adorable. I'm not sure that it imparted a ton of flavor, but I giggled about it on and off for the rest of our meal. \n\nThe charcoal broiled grilled octopus starter ($10 supplement) was SO GOOD. It was super tender and minimally seasoned, and just perfect. It came on a bed of onions and capers and a fava spread that I wasn't a huge fan of, but it did help balance out the richness of the octopus. The lobster pasta (+$15) was so pretty I almost didn't want to eat it. Almost. You get an entire lobster with perfectly al dente noodles in a light tomato sauce. The portion size was definitely generous, but they were nice enough to box up the rest for me to take home. Dessert - get the greek yogurt martini. You won't regret it. \n\nDid I just turn a $29 meal into a $54 meal? Whoops. But for the ambiance, the quality of the ingredients, and perfectly executed dishes, it's worth every penny.
