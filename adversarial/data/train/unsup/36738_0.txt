Great service and food. My wife and I stopped in today, with only a short time for lunch. The waitress was wonderful and very attentive to our time crunch. We both had the LA wraps and throughly enjoyed them. This was our second time there and will be back on future trips through Boulder City. \n\nAlthough we weren't on two wheels, we do appreciate that they are motorcycle friendly including dedicated moto parking.
