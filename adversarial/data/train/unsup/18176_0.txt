Review is only for gates of hell haunted house. I went to the housebwith an open mind and was hoping to be scared. Please know I don't scre easy and only the thought of late payment of my bills scare me.  I found myself awkwardly attracted to the dead bride and was hoping she would grab my crouch twice with her shocking nails. It may also be because I had to be in front and feel like everyone in the middle got scared.  My friend got grabbed on the boob, but she was warned by me from fellow yelp reviews.  I say fright dome is still best if u can put up with the kids.
