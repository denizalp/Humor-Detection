Bac lock and drop it is friggin' right. \n\nOh, that's right. My maiden voyage to Bac to eat has happened, and it happen well, my friends. See, in the past, I've only been able to have drinks here and have had to live with the fact that I still had not experienced the food. It was seriously a difficult road. \n\nBut my suffering finally ended when my Columbus colleague came into town to visit. We needed a healthy spot for a delicious dinner. I suggested Bac--and was damn excited about it. \n\nI enjoyed every-single-thing-I-ate--beyond thoroughly. First, the spring rolls very freshly handmade and fried to perfection. Then, the tom yum soup was the best I've had in the city of Cleveland. It was spicy, sour and had plenty of tender shrimp to find in the delicious broth. I was honestly full at this point, but then the scallops came out and my lack of hunger got thrown out the window. They were seared to perfection, placed on a sweet potato mash with a hint of ginger and sided with asparagus in a divine sauce. So good. Just keep in mind they were from their seasonal menu, so you better get their quick to grab those scallops. \n\nMy lovely dinning partner shared the spring rolls and ordered the scallops, as well. But she did order the papaya salad, which she completely finished. So, you know, it had to be good! (Pssst... she also told me it was beyond good!)\n\nI can now see why my older sister's Yelp checks-ins at Bac are multiple times a week. I'm thinking I may need to become a permanent regular. I seriously cannot wait to come back and check out the 80 bajillion other menu items I was tempted to get.
