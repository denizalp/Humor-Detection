So happy we decided to do the South Rim VIP Express tour. Be warned it is a  really long day BUT we had an awesome time. Only 6 people plus the driver so way better than a huge bus and worth the extra money! Lunch is included as well as unlimited bottled water and there are plenty of stops for snacks and restrooms. Our tour guide Ben was AWESOME!! So friendly, knowledgeable and fun! \nThe people with us were also awesome ( which makes the day so much better bc you are stuck with them for a really long time) \nYou make stops at the LV sign, Hoover Dam and a really cool old place on Route 66 on the way in. \nThe canyon is breath taking and Ben knows all the tricks for some great pics!! I would most definitely recommend this tour to anyone thinking about it!
