We didn't even make it to a table... A man was putting up chairs outside, so we asked if the restaurant was open.  He said well, the doors open isn't it?  Then he mumbled something.  I said oh your open sign is off.  He said yeah but the door is open... He continued: you must be one the one in a million people that actually care whether or not an open sign is turned on.  I said oh ok. He repeated, unprompted, once again how the door was open and how no one ever cares about the open sign being turned on and that it was clear the restaurant was open.\n\nI asked if the owner was a smartass too.  He said he was the owner.  We turned around and walked our the door.  Poor guy seemed absolutely miserable. \n\nPlease, do yourself a favor and don't visit this place apparently owned by a rude asshole who rejects customers... Are you open is a very simple question one would think. It was around 445pm. I guess the owner's rudeness is what the other yelp reviews meant by a very hipster place???  \n\nThere's plenty of places to get pizza and beer around the area... In Michael's now... Welcomed warmly!  Pizza is great too and has a rooftop area.
