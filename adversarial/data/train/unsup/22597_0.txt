TL;DR -Very sales-pushy and deceptively friendly.\n\nThis veterinary hospital is excellent at pushing sales. They are absolutely AMAZING when it comes to repeatedly asking you to submit a stool sample in the days leading up to, during, and after the examination. Unwavering confidence in the idea that you'll come around to it anyway, so why not spend that extra $100 now? They must really love poo! Hate knowing about honest, upfront costs? Good news- with suspicious, yet calming reassurances like \"I can get you a sample size!\" or \"I'll go ahead and get that stool test kit for you!\" you're covered. For a fee of course, but that's not important right now. No. Better to deal with that later when you're too embarrassed to ask them to ring the total up again minus that sample, and stool test kit you just didn't refuse hard enough for the ninth time. Nowhere else have I encountered a veterinary staff possessing all the salesperson savvy of a personal trainer selling you a gym membership. What a time to be alive!
