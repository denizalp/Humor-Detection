I really like the Rustic Burrito with the Jalape√±o sauce they serve with it. Rustic is an awesome little place if you need good hearty breakfast and a quiet atmosphere to get a little work done. There seems to always be a group or two of regulars having breakfast solving the worlds problems when I go in for breakfast.
