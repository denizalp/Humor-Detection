Cleo is one if the most tasties restaurants I've been to.  Especially for such a good price. Must try the Wagyu beef kababs. They are well seasoned and very tender. You probably saw reviews for the brussel sprouts and I agree,  they are amazing. Flavors are different than any other brussel sprouts appetizer I ever had. They also had a smoky watermelon drink that was very unique and full of flavors. I will go back again!
