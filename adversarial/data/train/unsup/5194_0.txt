This is a very charming Victorian era cemetery with rolling hills and beautiful groves of trees everywhere you look. It offers an extremely tranquil setting where you can bring you dog for a moderate workout or ride your bike - both of which we saw going on while visiting.\n\nThere are still tons of plots open for burials, so if you lose your loved one, and want somewhere to bury them in peace, Homewood Cemetery might be a solid option for you.
