I was going to give 2 stars for them being nice and not rude about anything or process but at this point I'm just frustrated. I go in to get an oil change, the guys was very nice and made small talk. I left because it was going to take about 45 min. I get a call 20 min later to say my thread on the pan was stripped and I needed to get a new one which would cost $450 & they did not have the part. I understand the thread was stripped and was just curious on how all of a sudden it was stripped and not caught before. I called my automotive friends who are master techs for Honda & Acura and they said because it's aluminum it's easy to strip if not installed correctly or over time. At this point I told them to go ahead and put an over sized bolt in and I'll go ahead and sign the waiver forms. Took it over to Honda and they took care of me. I specifically asked when I first walked in if they top off fluids on top of just changing oil and guy said yes.. Well guess what... It wasn't. I called back the next day to ask again to make sure and the guy on the phone said yes normally my guys do and to bring it in, maybe there's a leak but I doubt there's a leak for all my fluids that needed to be topped off. I went ahead and did it myself. He also mentioned and threw in there that he's the cheapest oil change in town. I work in customer service and I know things happen and mistakes can be made but at this point my experience was just not ideal. Maybe if they actually topped my fluids off I would've gave an extra star but I had to pay an additional $15 to top my own fluids. It's like what did I even pay for?  A $17 oil change that turned into $32, left me car less for a day, & just a headache. At least I saved $5 for checking in.
