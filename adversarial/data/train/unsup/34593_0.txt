Very poor customer service. I purchased an item online which is defective. I took it back to the store in Las Vegas hoping to do an even exchange. The store verified it was a defective item and didnt have the product in stock. I told them i would be more than happy to exchange it for another product and I couldn't.  I made a special trip to the store, now I have to head home with my defective product. A wastes trip totally and they told me to try again later which means another trip back.  This is not what I would call good customer service. Today I learned to hate Body Shop.
