I came in to pick up some sandwiches for the homeless men and women I take care of. I usually make them myself but, I'm having a pretty tough week.\n\nI went in and ordered a few meals. The order wasn't much. You should have seen how excited my guys were. \n\nThe restaurant itself was clean and the staff was wicked friendly. \n\nThe people I help were extremely grateful for the delicious food. \n\nI'll definitely be back. Thanks for the speedy service.
