We had a company social gathering at the PSH. We had a good time. The food we had was catered there by the staff and was delicious. We played pool, bowled a few sets and there was even a ping pong table if you were so inclined. The outdoor setting has corn hole and a great seating area for nice weather. This is a place I could see coming after work or on the weekends with friends.
