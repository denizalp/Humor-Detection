Let's just say this, if you are white trash, you will love this place.  You truly will fit in perfectly, since that is all that frequents this fine establishment.  Their food is not fit for humans, their service is very sub par, their clientelle is, as I've already stated, rather Apache Junction-like and the atmosphere is just depressing.  So come on down and make sure to wear your finest Metal Mullisha T-shirt and bring multiple packs of cigarettes to enjoy on their smoke filled patio, with the rest of the toothless patrons.
