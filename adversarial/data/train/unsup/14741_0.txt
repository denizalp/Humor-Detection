We have been to this location multiple times previously to have my boyfriend's hair cut. Each time we visit is a guessing game as to whether or not he will get a good hair stylist or not. He has been four times and each time their is a different staff and hair stylist available. His previous visit to this review was not good either so it appears we will be looking for a new place to get his hair cut. \n\nThis last visit was the worst as his hair was butchered beyond immediate correction. I suggest next time my boyfriend really take the time and look his hair over and make sure it is cut the way he requested. That way they can make any changes or corrections to it because once you leave you have accepted the cut even if was done crappy. It was really bad after I examined it later at home, half of the hair was cut uneven with one side longer than the other. I had to take my hair scissors to it later at home and trying to correct a bad cut is hard to do if you are not an experienced hair stylist or barber.\n\nOK so he went around  looking even more goofy and nerdy for two weeks until it grew out so lesson learned!
