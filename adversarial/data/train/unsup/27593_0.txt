You seriously cannot beat the Kirkland brand. Their coffee brand.. Well... Know they work with that green lady .....Lived in Seattle for ten years, not only is the quality excellent, meat the best.. But they always have copper river salmon when it's in season!  It's THE BEST!!  (Not farm raised artificially colored stuff).  Love our Costco !!  Just wish NC allowed the liquor license too, so I highly love visiting family in Kentucky for that!   This company treat employees reallllly well too.  Will always support that!
