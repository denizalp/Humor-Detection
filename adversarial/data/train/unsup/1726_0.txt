I'm really surprised at the large assortment of STUFF that Dollarama has inside their store. I mean for a dollar (or two), you can pretty much buy all the big named canned goods, chocolate, and miscellaneous goods at a discounted price. They even have loaves of bread for cheap! I can't say I've bought it, but I mean it looked decent and I'm sure that people who are on a budget who does not need to live off Dempsters \/ Wonderbread will be completely satisfied with what Dollarama has to offer.\n\nThey are always so on the ball with upcoming events, are readily stocked with new decorations for either valentines day, halloween, christmas - you name it, they are ready to sell it weeks in advance. It sure beats buying expensive stuff at a department store if it's a one-time use.\n\nI have to say that this place is best for GUM. While usually having to wait for a sale at shoppers for a four-pack because the good stuff can get pretty expensive, i'm happily going to dollarama for the 69 cent or so pack of excel, which would be cheaper than any 4-pack anyway. I know the price isn't going to change and I can pick it up whenever I want.\n\nwow... this review has totally made me realize how frugal i am.... please don't judge.
