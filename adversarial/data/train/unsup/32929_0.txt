Coming from out of state it was really hard to find a dentist that takes my insurance and one that I like! The workers here are great. My dentist does an excellent job with my teeth and always leaves me laughing with a smile. They are super flexible when it comes to booking appointments and cancelling as long as it's 24 hours in advanced!
