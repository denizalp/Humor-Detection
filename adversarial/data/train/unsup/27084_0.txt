I get so sick of ordering Pizza from Dominio's and Pizza Hut, I thought I would try Libretto's !   Well, not the most pleased. I ordered the Chicken Parm , the 18 inch with Grilled Chicken, and Ricotta, and fresh mozzerella, I like the crust , the ricotta was pretty good but the Chicken and the fresh Mozz were not there. I could not find them anywhere ...a couple of brown small pieces of what looked like fake meat but no grilled chicken. I also ordered a 18 inch  Il Diavolo , well I received a 10 inch with 5 pieces of Pepperoni and a couple small pieces of what I think was sausage. Once again, I liked the crust, but the pizza was so lacking in toppings it was ridiculous on top of being 8 inches too small!  They did refund me 10.00 but I dont know if I would ever chance ordering Pizza again from them.  Now for the positive. I also ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms which were probably the best I have ever had! The cream sauce over the top was so delicious I could have drank it as soup!!\nMy thoughts are so confused on this place. Not sure what to do?
