We had a great experience at the Cornelius, NC Enterprise location.  Brendon was quick to wait on us and when he mentioned an upgrade we were a little skeptical but after seeing the car, a 2015 Challenger, we quickly decided it would be worth it.  Thanks Brendon and Enterprise for a great experience.
