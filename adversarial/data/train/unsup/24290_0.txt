Came here for dim sum twice and feel like it's always a solid choice. Service is only passable but the tea set\/chinas are adorable. It takes a long time to get your water refilled or get the bill. The dimsum itself is standard and comfort food. Never disappointed. \n\nDon't come before 11. It'll be cheaper but holy crap it's a warzone and be prepared to wait amongst a sea of crazy Asian people. \n\nDecor is probably more grand than other dim sum places as it is a banquet hall type venue.\n\nThe larger parking lot does get full during busy times so be prepared to look for parking!
