Like a few other bars on the Ossington strip, Sweaty Betty's seems to have (as a few other reviewers have noticed) garnered a reputation as a \"hipster\" bar. Besides the obvious fact that this is a basically meaningless insult generated from whatever zero point of cool you feel you and your friends occupy against a, I guess, less authentic, more affected, tryhard version of the same, there is also the fact that Sweaty Betty's is pretty much different every night of the week, so, if you went on a day full of whatever your  version of 'hipsters' is, but liked the bar anyways, go back another night, it'll probably be drastically different.\n\nEven better, go back with 6 friends, show up early, and hog the back room. The couches are sorta shit, but its really cozy and a fun place to be loud or quiet or whatever you are in the mood for. Those of us unlucky enough to show up too late for couches will glower from the bar, chat with the (very nice) staff, and mutter 'hipster douchebags' under our breath, but feel free to ignore it.
