They have time-honored italian entrees in a very cozy atmosphere. The portions are enormous and the prices are reasonable by Vegas standards. Each meal includes wine, garlic bread, salad, the entree, a side of pasta and a cappuccino. So it's a full-service joint.\n\nThe servers are usually on the ball and the hosts handle reservations well. Their 90-year-old accordion player is a rare treat but sometimes he lingers too long for tips, which can confuse first-time diners who don't know they're supposed to fund him.\n\nMost importantly, you'll never go home hungry. Opt for this place over the usual chains and you'll be glad you did.
