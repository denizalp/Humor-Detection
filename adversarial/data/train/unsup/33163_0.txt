Attended this festival this past weekend and had an amazing time! Extremely well organized and a great venue....my only criticism is the lack of food choices\/options & the bathroom situation...i know this is primarily a drinking festival & not food but that's just me. The selection of libations and creations were fantastic and some of them were quite creative! One of my favourite drinks of the night (4 tickets) was jameson, cold brew coffee & coffee grinds on top!  The lineups were not long at all...less than a 2 minute wait for drinks and the venue was not packed at all. Would definitely come back next year! Cheers!
