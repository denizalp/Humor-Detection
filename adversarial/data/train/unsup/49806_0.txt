We just used this company this past week. The crew they sent did a great job and were terrific to work with.  They showed up right on time and worked for 2.75 hours in  the extreme heat!  Billing was exactly has we had been told and we appreciated the fact that they bill in  15 minute intervals after the 2 hour minimum. We strongly recommend this company and will definitely use them again in the future.
