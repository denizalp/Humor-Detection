Ate breakfast two days in a row at SWB during a weekend stay at the Hyatt Scottsdale. It's the only sit down restaurant on property to grab breakfast. We were lucky enough to have an awesome waitress named Amy who just happened to also be from Hawaii where we're from. We decided to sit outside on the patio as the weather was still nice enough to enjoy sitting in the shade. \n\nHere's what we enjoyed:\n\nHuevos rancheros - My husband loved this dish with crispy tortillas and even though I usually don't care for a heavy breakfast, I too thought it was wonderful too!\n\n\"Oscar\" Crab eggs Benedict - This came served on bread instead of a traditional English muffin. It was Southwestern style crab hash with bell peppers and hollandaise sauce.\n\nYogurt parfait with granola and fresh fruit - What kind of dork orders yogurt parfait while on vacation? This dork right here and it was everything I wanted! Light, healthy and keeps my body beach ready 365 days a year.\n\nLoaded hash - I mistakenly ordered this instead of listening to my instinct to get the steel cut oats. It was too heavy for me to enjoy, but if you love a good potato hash with the kitchen sink in it and eggs over easy, this is the dish for you.
