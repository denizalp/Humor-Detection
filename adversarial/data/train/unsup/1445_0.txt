I don't get it.  There are so many positive reviews of Espos.  Almost certain our flauta plate was frozen not long before being served.  The centers of the flautas were ice cold.  Ice cold chicken.  Hmmm.  Had them remade.  The second batch was hot, but tasted like cardboard.   The enchilada plate sauce was delicious, but the cheese enchiladas themselves...well, after a couple bites that exposed the center of the enchilada, it was just a hunk of unmelted shredded cheese out of a bag.  Unmelted.  Just a lump of shredded cheese.  I could have done a better job of melting shredded cheese at home.   Moving on, the refrieds would have been tastier if they had come out of a smaller can.  Seriously they were just flavorless brown mush.  \n\nThe chips with melted cheese were fine, but greasy.  The salsa was spicy.  \n\nI can think of 100 other Mexican restaurants I'd rather patronize in the valley. \n\nBut hey, I was able to get a beer and sit on a neat patio.   And I certainly had good company.
