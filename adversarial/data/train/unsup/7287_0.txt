Oh what a night!!!\n\nI knew I wanted to see a show while I was in Vegas and knew I didn't want to go far from our hotel nor see Phantom. When I found out Jersey Boys was playing at the Palazzo, and I could get discount tickets with my Grazie card, I immediatly called my Mom (who was joining us) and a couple of friends who were going to be with us Friday night as well to see if they wanted to see the show. All of us were a \"yes\" and even my mom's friend who had seen the show before could't wait to see it again.\n\nThe show started right on time at 7 and ran like a well oiled machine. It was engaging, the music fantastic, the singing\/acting superb and finally learned more about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. I even learned there were songs that were there's that I had no idea who to give the credit to. \n\nThe theatre was packed and I am sure most of the shows are sold out and can't believe the energy coming from the stage to the audience. I would see this show again in a heartbeat and am happy to say that this is how I ended the last night of my 30's!
