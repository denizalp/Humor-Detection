We stopped in here for a quick bite during a day of shopping at STC. Not wanting too heavy a lunch, we opted to share a 'Persian Kebab' between us. According to the picture, it appeared to be Vaziri... one koobideh and one chicken breast. With rice and a side of chickpea salad, it was plenty enough food for the two of us.\n\nI have to admit, I was a tad disappointed with the kebabs. The chicken had a texture that left me wondering if it was ground chicken formed into a kebab and the koobideh... seriously,  even I can make better koobideh than that and I'm as Canadian as they come!\n\nThe rice and chickpea salad were the saving graces of this dish as both were quite flavourful.\n\nWould I eat here again? Possibly. I can't honestly expect true Persian cuisine from a food court and it was a little pricey for what we got but they seemed to have a good selection so I'd definitely try other dishes.\n\n2 stars for the kebabs but a 3 star for finding 'Persian' cuisine in a food court.
