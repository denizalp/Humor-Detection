I've ordered take out from this place 4 times and I've loved everything I've tried.  Chicken tikka masala is my favorite, but I try to order other things as well.  The vegetarian balti is really good, as well as the channa masala.  This place is great, I'm so glad its around the corner from my place.  Can't wait to get a sitter sometime so my old man and I can try the buffet.
