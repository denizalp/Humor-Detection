I went there with an upper respiratory problem and the arrogant PA kept wanting me to get an EKG. I told him I didn't need an EKG since two months prior CMC did a complete workup and I have no issues.  He never looked at my throat or ears, didn't listen to anything I said.  After going to my doctor a day later I was told I had walking pneumonia and an ear infection.\n\nHow do you spell incompetence?  The girl at the counter didn't even get my name correct on the printed documents even though she had my insurance card and driver's license.
