I've engaged in many conversations in my life surrounding the joy of foods that come in pockets. Jamaican patties fall into this category, and I love 'em. They are cheap, spicy, meaty and go great with any hot sauce. You can get two for well under $5, and were a staple of mine as a student.\n\nThese patties can be found in convenience stores and snack stops all over Toronto, and all of those satellites revolve around the mother ship, Patty King. There is nowhere cheaper or fresher than the source, so if you're after a cheap bite on the run in Kensington, Patty King's got your back. \n\nBeyond being a regular customer in my younger years, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Patty King because it's one of the first places I took my American bestie in Canada. He gave his cash and was given back two patties and a handful of change. He then bristled \"Excuse me, I gave you a ten.\" The sassy Jamaican lady burst out laughing and replied \"And I gave you $6, can you count, junior?\" Ah, Canadian coins fooling foreigners. Always good for a giggle.
