Two visits so far-  and MANY more to come!\n\nFirst was with a good friend. We each had a cocktail, she had the brisket sandwich with side of cheesy jalapeno grits, I had the farm to table veggie plate. \nOMG!\nThe sandwich was solid, the grits were amazing! (She complained they were too cheesy. On my planet, there's no such thing!)\nThe veggie platter was one of the most perfect plates I've ever had! Tri colored cauliflower, heirloom tomatoes, garlicky Swiss chard and grilled asparagus. Beautiful, delicious, and a huge portion! \n\nThe following week, I brought out of town family. There were 6 of us - and we were all over the menu. Everyone was quite happy with their orders - and my cousin who is a bit of a foodie\/veggie snob pulled me aside to say it was the best meal she had while in AZ!\n\nAcross the board - the cocktails, the entrees, and the dessert were top notch. Service has been flawless both times - and I am so glad I live close to this place!
