My friend & I  wanted something quick before seeing the Criss Angel show (excellent show by the way) and stopped in at Tender since it's adjacent to the box office.  The entire staff was accommodating in providing quick, yet attentive, service.\n\nWe decided on a variety of appetizers: the pumpkin ravioli (awesome), tomato & buffalo mozzarella (fresh & light), the surf & turf sliders (delightfullly different) and split the Kobe chili (just the right flavor). Of course, pre-show cocktails were a must and love that our martinis were shaken at the table.  Nice touch!\n\nThe ambiance, service and quality of the appetizers has sold me to return to experience a full dining evening at Tender in the VERY near future!
