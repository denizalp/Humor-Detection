Usually one of my favorite delis in Las Vegas. But today's visit was a disappointment in customer service. I ordered a beef dip sandwich with roast beef. It came with delicious crispy french fries and really good coleslaw.unfortunately the sandwich itself was almost inedible.it was stacked high with roast beef and a nice soft roll but the roast beef was so dry it was more like eating paper.it's one thing to have an occasional disappointing meal, but when I talk to management about the sandwich there was little empathy about my situation . I got no apology only excuse is that no one else has complained about the sandwich. Not offered to bring me something else or even discount it since I didn't eat half of the sandwich. I'm sure I'll be back but just be warned if you complain about the quality of the food or that you just simply don't like something don't expect the management to care.
