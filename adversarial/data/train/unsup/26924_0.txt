I got the triple burger, burger was well cooked but the service was not good.  The cashier was not paying attention to my order whatsoever (had to repeat myself twice and asked it to be to-go and they plated it, causing my stay longer than I liked). \n\nIf you don't care about quality of service and just want a good juicy burger with fresh vegetables, then this is a good pick.
