For the treatments themselves, I would give maybe 3 out 5 stars, for cleanliness of the office and rooms 5 out of 5 and friendliness of the staff would receive 4 out of 5. I had my second to last treatment for hair removal yesterday and that was the first time I had the pleasure of having Ashley be my technician. She was working efficiently to help everyone that she could with the unexpected technical difficulties they were having. I felt she was the most relatable members of the staff there. Although everyone here is helpful she was helpful AND personable. As far as the treatments themselves, they're nice but for me PERSONALLY, it would be more worth it if it was a little cheaper. I felt like for the amoubt I paid, i expected to see way better results. (Maybe 10% my fault because of the length of time between my appointments but 90% the staff's fault for not making it 100% clear to me how important it is to come 6 weeks apart for treatments rather than 8 weeks) Yesterday Ashley was the first to explain why you would see better results by scheduling6 weeks apart. If you do decide to come here for hair removal, I would make sure you ask them to explain in detail what would help make the treatments most effective UP FRONT. But overall, between the treatments themselves, the environment\/staff I guess I would be willing to rate 3-4 stars out of 5. Just wish I'd seen better results but I guess everyone is a little different.
