I am absolutely floored with this place. Lets just say First impressions are everything I just drove over to this place from Scottsdale a half hour ago after hearing about it from some of my buddys.  I pull in to park and first thing I see one of the guys sitting around and drinking alcohol and being loud as if he is drunk. First of all this is VERY unprofessional looking. I'm supposed to trust a guy drinking on the job to take care of my vehicle that I worked hard for and have money invested in so I can enjoy my hobby of offroading? I think not. Do these guys just drink all day on the job and than drive home like this? Are these guys checking and driving customers vehicles while they are under the influence? I will be taking my business elsewhere and I hope everyone reading this will to or you will have some drunks working on your vehicle. Your choice. This place is less than 1 star in my opinion.
