Love this place day or night! This Vegas type club is exactly what we needed in CLE! The club is all outdoors with the trains passing by several times a night, it is just such a cool concept. By day the pool is a nice spot to spend your day with fun DJS and a party experience. By night this is the coolest and my absolute favorite club in Cleveland! The drinks are the same price as the other places in the East Bank, and they have many actual bars so that you do not have to wait long for drinks. You can also reserve a cabana for the full VIP experience, but you should do that a week in advance. Get there before 11 if you don't want to wait in line. I also love that there are many stalls in the women's restroom, I've never had to wait more than few minutes, even on a crowded night. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Come here and dance the day\/night away and enjoy the beautiful summer outdoors in Cleveland!
