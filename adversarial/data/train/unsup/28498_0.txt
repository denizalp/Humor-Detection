I'm disappointed from the outcome of the hair dye that I received. I got my hair dyed black recently and you would think that it would be easy to do but I was very annoyed that the black hair dye seemed to have hardened on my scalp and I had to keep trying to remove it for 2 weeks, this has never happened to me before. Also it wasn't that long ago that I had it done and the colour is already fading. Not too impressed...
