I attended a private event here and I was very unhappy with the service and the staff.  The event had over 120 people and they didn't have enough staff hired to accommodate.  Dinner took over an hour to be served the guests with the food then being cold.  The staff was often rude at times when asked a question or requesting something.  I'm sure this place could be good when it's just a regular restaurant but as a place to host a private event they failed!! \nWouldn't recommend it at all.
