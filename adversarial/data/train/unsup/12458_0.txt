While I have never dined at this restaurant, I am giving this a 1 star for my experience with them over the phone. I was trying to order a bottle of sake for my friend who is celebrating her birthday there this evening because I am out of state. The hostess was very helpful and went to find the manager. The manager told her they could not do it. How do you take reservations for your karaoke rooms? Over the phone credit cards... Basically a lazy manager who did not want to help make a night more special for my friend. I have worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years, and that is not hospitality. So though I live in LA the next time I visit Phoenix, this will not be a place I will be stopping by. Great job!
