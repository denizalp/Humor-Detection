My husband and I come to eat at CJ's many times and always have a great time. The staff is always so pleasant, nice, friendly. The manager is great also. The food is awesome except for the pizza, I am not a fan of their pizza at all. My new Fav is their Black Tie Chicken Pasta !!! It' sooo yummy and awesome.. I tried this dish about 1 month ago for the very first time. And their seasonal Pumpkin Cream Cheese Pie is to die for.. My husband and I know it comes out just before Thanksgiving and we go to CJ's for this and order 1 slice after our meal. It is soooooo AWESOME..We love Claim Jumpers in Avondale.. I can not wait to go again.
