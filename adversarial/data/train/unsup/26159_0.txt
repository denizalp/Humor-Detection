We were in Vegas staying at the venetian, we had Sunday brunch reservations here for later in the weekend, but were walking by hungry around lunchtime on a Friday and decided to go there early. We kinda miscalculated and thought it was Saturday(Vegas will do that to ya!). We wanted eggy, brunchy food - but it was proper LUNCHtime.\n\nAlas no eggs on the menu, but we all got a great bloody mary (with crispy, crispy bacon in it). And we split the fried green tomato appetizer - which was soooooo good we really though we were on to something great. (crispy panko tomatoes with a nice thick yet tender slice of pork belly and some pimento cheese!)\n\nSadly my fried chicken biscuit with crispy chicken was not crispy, nor was one gals \"crispy fried chicken\" sandwich. 3rd gal got shrimp and grits and said it was tasty.\n\nso bottom line - go for the tomatoes and a cocktail and you will be Happy Happy
