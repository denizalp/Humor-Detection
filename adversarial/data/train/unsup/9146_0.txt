If you've only shopped for frames at Sears and you're accustomed to taking photos of yourself as part of the eyewear decision process, Eyeopia might be a little intimidating. If you're really fragile, sheltered and emotionally challenged, you might even find Eyeopia insulting and\/or condescending. There are few professions as socially violent as optometrists after all. It's THOSE four-eyed beasts that roam the streets mugging widows and burning down orphanages. \n\nEyeopia is a full-scale eyewear boutique. One goes there to be serviced by a careful, learned, talented and invested staff member who wants you to leave not just satisfied but elated. If you want a pair of frames that will keep the metal filings out of your eye when your operating the third shift punch press go to Wal*Mart. If you want of a pair of frames that will blow the tits off your date and impress your friend from Manhattan then go to Eyeopia. If you're \"a little bit of hipster\" and your own vanity matters to you, you'll fucking love Eyeopia as long as your not a lunatic who could benefit from decades of therapy and megavolts of electroshock therapy. \n\nI'm been to both boutiques, Dr. Pete has checked my eyes for the past three years, and I have been thrilled with the frames I've been put in. He and his staff take into account your hair color, face shape, skin tone, eyebrow arch and all sorts of factors when they fit you with a frame most suitable for your application. Each frame that adorns your face is evaluated. On my last visit, no less than five people (FIVE!) were consulted as I narrowed down my final collection. Bad genes gave me shitty eyes, but Eyeopia gave me stellar frames. The trade-off is a net win.
