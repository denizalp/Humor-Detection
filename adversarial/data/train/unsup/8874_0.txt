I wasn't impressed at all with the food, the service, or the atmosphere.  The silverware was dirty, the glasses had spots on them. The plate was chipped. Had a pizza. The dough was undercooked in the center, dry and bland.  The toppings weren't fresh. Mushrooms looked like they sat around for a week. Never got a refill on my ice tea. Price was high and left me feeling like they're trying to push this place as a high-end bistro, except the food and service were more like a fast food joint. Didn't have dessert because everything in the case looked like it had been there for months. It didn't look freshly made so I stayed away from it. \n\nI won't be back. I wouldn't suggest this place if you asked.   It's not good.
