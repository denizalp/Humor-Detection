Where, oh where, have the employees gone? That's often how I feel when I'm standing at the registry desk or looking for someone to answer a question. It's hard to find knowledgable staff here who can answer questions accurately about the products. Some of the staff clearly have personal experience with some items, or just a bit of exposure to them due to working there, but many are young and inexperienced and totally unreliable when it comes to answering questions and providing expert guidance in the \"baby item\" arena. \n\nTheir price matching really is no hassle and it's already come in handy a couple of times. I'm glad it's so easy. They'll price match an advertised price from any retailer excluding amazon. \n\nThere are good registry perks here, including 5-10% back on all registry purchases, a completion discount, some free items and samples when you sign up, and a great return policy (up to 1 year without a receipt for items purchased from registry). \n\nThey have a decent selection. But they really are the only \"big player\" around for baby items. So I guess their customer service doesn't have to be very good. \n\nConsidering I don't like the other options in town (small boutiques with expensive and unusual baby items, and a much bigger in-store selection than Target) I'm sort of stuck coming here for all of my baby's needs unless I shop online (and I feel much more comfortable seeing things like strollers in person).
