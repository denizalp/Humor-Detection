Jimmy Wan's has the best sushi and Chinese food!  My husband and I usually sit at the bar and we get the best service from bartenders Steph, Adam and sushi chef Alex.  Alex is creative and has us try new things.  We always leave happy and full! We will continue to go because if the great service and food.
