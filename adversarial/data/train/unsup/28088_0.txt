I was considering not writing a review for Blush, but because I went there based on the previous Yelp reviews, I thought I should share my experience and why I will not be returning. Let me start off by saying, my stylist was very nice and gave me a \"good\" haircut. Having said that, it is not a $50 haircut, it is not a high end salon, nor was it a high end experience. Let me clarify by saying that I know $50 isn't really a high end salon, like where you go get a $200 cut, but for $50 I do have some expectations. The salon seem shabby and dirty, an employees child was there, well behaved, but interrupting her when she spoke with a client. The mirror I was handed to look at my cut was dirty, covered in dust or something. It just didn't feel professional. To top it off, while I was being shampooed, the stylists sleeve caught on the sprayer and I was sprayed in my face and chest, soaked. She did apologize, but again, it wasn't handled professionally, no manager came to apologize, there was no discount offered (They did give me a 20% new client discount). Apparently it had happened to someone else previously and my stylist thought it was funny then, and that's what she gets for laughing at other stylist. So, nice stylist, fine haircut. Could have got the same at GreatClips for $15. I don't know why all these other reviews are so positive, but don't be fooled by them. When I go back and look at the previous reviews, they seem planted. Too many 5 stars.
