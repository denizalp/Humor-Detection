I've tried both chiropractors there and have been going there on and off for about 6 years. My only fault with them is that they want you in and out of there as quickly as possible. You're typically suppose to get 15 minutes and they'd fix your problems. HOWEVER, whenever I (or any of the other 3 people I know who go there) went I got 5 minutes and it would be \"okay tell me what's wrong with you\" and of that list he would pick three things. So he might crack your neck, your back, and then realign your hips or whatever it may be. And that's it, see you two weeks from now. So if you want to get your money's worth don't go here, but if you just need a quick fix then they're pretty decent for what they do.
