Had a problem with engine light, erratic tach and minor surging which was diagnosed and repaired in reasonable time and fair price.  Polite staff all around, nice waiting room and excellent facility.  Would be a 5 except that they are so busy that there is a long wait when getting work done.  Have also used them for parts and they are very efficient.
