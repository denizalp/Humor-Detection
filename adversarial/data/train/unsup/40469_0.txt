I have eaten here about 50 times over the last 7 years. I cannot say enough good things about the food, service and ambiance. I love the food so much I had my baby shower here! The prices may seem steep at first glance but you do receive a lot of food for your money. Rice and veggies are all you can eat.  The service is fabulous and we always get a table. Eat here! It's a unique Japanese experience and absolutely delicious!
