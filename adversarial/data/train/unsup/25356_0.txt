I have been going to Nails with love for several months and Jenny does my nails and is always up for the challenge of the designs I bring to her :) The salon is updated and clean and everyone is always so nice. I have been to many salons here in Las Vegas\/Henderson and Nails with Love is by far the BEST I have been to. I highly recommend it!!
