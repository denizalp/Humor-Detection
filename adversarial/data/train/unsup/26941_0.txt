Buyer beware. I really wish I could give positive feedback, as I get no pleasure from giving a negative review. Im putting this out there for one simple reason, to try and help someone else avoid making the same mistake my girlfriend and I did. These folks are dishonest and do not honor their word. They told us we were covered with a 100 day warranty, we were charged the $100 deductable for the warranty when the car was purchased. Within 2 months of buying the car, well within the 100 days, we find out the U joint and entire drive shaft needs to be replaced. We took it to Goben and not only did they deny that we had a warranty (despite the fact we were told we did, and charged the deductable) , the owner was flat out rude, and pretty much told us to get lost because it is not his problem, and he refuses to fix it. I would never reccomend this place to anyone. There are plenty of other dealerships around. Two thumbs down. They are deceptive liars that will tell you what you want to hear to make a sale, then after that they dont care what happens. Avoid at all costs.
