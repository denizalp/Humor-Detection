I forgot to write a review Cirque du Soliel!  I'm a huge fan of all of their shows and my life long quest is to see all of their shows, all around the world.  Which is quite easy because they travel and rotate their shows from country to country, city to city.\n\nEven though this wasn't my favorite show the venue of having it at Radio Spectacular... the place is just a great space to have Cirque du Soliel perform.  The special effects they were able to produce were amazing!  I heard they had a few hiccups in a some other shows, but ours was just fine.  I didn't understand the story line of how his lover died and this weirdo baby thing was representing her life?  Eh but the performances were pretty solid.  \n\nI thought the sand artist was pre-recorded.  I sat there for 5mins talking until I got shushed trying to figure out if it was pre-recorded or live.\n\nAt break, there was a long line for the women's bathrooms.  It was ridiculous.  There was plenty of food and drinks but luckily we'd eaten before we arrived.
