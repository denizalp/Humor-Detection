Really good pizza. \nBut, if I were to do it again, I would order a large pizza, put it in the fridge for 2 hours, and heat up individual slices on aluminum foil (or a pizza stone) for 5 minutes at 475*F. Something magical happens. Sounds crazy, but I actually enjoy Those Guys Pies twice as much on the reheat. It becomes perfectly crispy and chewy, as real pizza should be.\n\nNot all pizza reacts this way. But real NJ\/NY pizza does. (This is meant to be a compliment to Those Guys Pies.)\n\nGive it try. Experience the alchemy.
