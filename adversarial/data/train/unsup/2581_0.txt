It would seem that Calgary, Alberta, is always one of the last places to embrace all of the good things that exist. Vegan and vegetarianism being no exception, as I've experienced living 'round these prairie parts as a vegan for 8 or so years. However, it is restaurants such as the Coup, which give me some hope. Aside from the long wait times, as this has become some sort of hipster hang out (dietary restrictions are obviously hip, guys), I have never really had a Coup experience that was less than pleasant. It is ambient when it's quiet and you are having dinner with a friend or two by pseudo candlelight. It is buzzing and full of positive, warm energy when it's busy; a reminder of Calgary's growing globally conscious, veggie fueled community. \nA lovely little nook for eats indeed. After trying everything vegan friendly on the menu at least twice, I'd have to recommend the Sundried Tomato Hummus and Upstream Burger with yam wedges for those who have never been. I have a friend from across the country who when he visits, basically forces me to go for Upstream Burgers. Threats are issued if I'm reluctant. I have also stopped into the Coup jussssst for the vegan chocolate torte and a coconut rum chai with almond milk. Just sayin'.
