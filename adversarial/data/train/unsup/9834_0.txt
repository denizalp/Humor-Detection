I'm not even sure where to start. We stayed for 2 nights this past weekend and it was a horrible experience. The elevators were down so often that there was often a long line to get on the only 2 working ones. And as an added bonus, there was no air conditioning in the elevators or in the attached hallways. Waiting in that line and in a crowded elevator full of people that have been in the desert heat does not smell nice...27 smelly floors. :(\n\nWhile we were there, we went to the pool and rented one of the family umbrellas. Throughout the day we had to fend off people trying to come in our rented space (our kids chairs while they played). It would have been nice if they occasionally checked in to monitor that. Also, I waited for a cocktail waitress to show up until after 1pm. When I finally see them walking around, they never make it past the first row of chairs to take orders. \n\nFor the $71 a night, you can definitely stay somewhere nicer.
