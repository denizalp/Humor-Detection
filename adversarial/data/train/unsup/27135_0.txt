Most the food was really good, gave four stars because the sushi was not good, fried rice was so bad I regret putting in my mouth, and a couple other items that's my opinion, green beans with red peppers tasted so good I had seconds, most deserts were to rich overall I enjoyed would go back.the mini jelly was excellent.brisket was tender tasted great.chicken was dry.
