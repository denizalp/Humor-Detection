I visited yesterday, and I have to say that I was impressed. My first time here, and the guys working were very helpful and answering any questions I had. I had recently converted to Judaism, so I've been trying out a bunch of new foods and recipes. I purchased some varnishkes while I was here. It was delicious. I will definitely be back. Thank you for putting up with my questions. Will recommend this place. Shabbat Shalom.
