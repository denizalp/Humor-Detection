I'm really quite surprised at how highly this place is rated. I've been here 4 times now because my family enjoys how cheap it is but I hate it. \n\nThis place is filthy. The floors are sticky and the tables are covered in a layer of grime. Eating here is like playing an hour long game of 'every surface of this restaurant is hot lava'. The photo of the restaurant here on yelp is dated.. Don't let yourself be catfished.\n\nThe service is also abysmal. There are usually two waitresses for the entire restaurant and they are quite rude. Tables remain littered with used plates for over 20 minutes after guests have left. I've seen many customers get up to grab themselves utensils and napkins after being ignored by the waitresses over and over again.\n\nIf you care at all about the cleanliness and service of a restaurant, I would avoid this place like the plague. You're better off with a rest stop McDonald's on the civic long weekend...
