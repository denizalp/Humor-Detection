It's pretty basic in-a-pinch type of snack. Price with tax for pepperoni or basil is $3.75. Guys, you're going to need 2 slices: thin and light on toppings. It's as advertised: New York style. If you live in the hood it's good to have another low-price place to eat - but I'd like to see something a bit more wow to repeat the performance. Thumbs up to owner Tony for keeping St. Henri moving in the right direction.
