1st his place is off the hook good. The vibe is amazing, I'm reluctant to write such a positive review as I hope this place does not become infected with lumber sexuals. Yeah I know I said it.\n\nFor starters they have live music on the weekends. The service is amazing and dranks are pretty reasonable. Don't come here asking for a fancy drinks, not really that kind of place. \n\nThe owner is really seems like a cool person and likes the people who visit. You get a nice mix of peeps at this joint, Culturally diverse. Oh I should point out that he was grilling jerk chicken durring a friggin Ohio hurricane while transformers were blowing out\n\nOkn let's  talk about the fact that the bird is the the freaking word here. This may in fact be some of the best bird I have had in the 216.  I have never met a jerk chicken that did not like. Yeah this jerk was off the hook.  Yes this was bone in jerk ass chicken that is slow grilled in a barrel grill. This imparts a rich smokey flavor. This chicken was such a jerk that it slapped me in my pie hole and I like it.\n\nThe curry chicken was really fantastic as well. The dinner plates come with rice and beans, the bird of choice, callaloo, and some very unique Mac and cheese. I mountain of food, really really good food. To steal a quote from DID flavor town\n If want  excellent island food, great vibes, cool peeps and  live music your not going to do much better than this  joint. Lumber sexuals please stay in your craft beer holes.
