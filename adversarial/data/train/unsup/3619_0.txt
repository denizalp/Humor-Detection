This place is 100%, hands down, a tourist trap, AND I DON'T CARE.\n\nJudge me all you want you judgy judgersons.\n\nI made friends Jen F. and Mike C. come along for the fun and we posed with all of the wax figurines with the best of them.\n\nIf you get creative and have some fun and don't worry about people judging you for hitting up the wax museum, you will really have a good time here.\n\nSome of the figurines are such dead ringers that it is totally creeper. Some of them totally miss the mark.\n\nThe Fear Zone, or haunted thingy, whatever it is...was totally lame, but they certainly get you all revved up for the scare of your life. It's too funny!\n\nSo go ahead, put your face in Jenna Jameson's crotch, punch Al Roker in the junk, put your lady giblets in Tiger's hooker eating-out face, make Snoop Dawg grab your titties. THIS IS VEGAS, why be PG with the wax figurines?
