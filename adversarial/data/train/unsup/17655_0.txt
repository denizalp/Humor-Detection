The spot is great for random nights out on Ossington but I have two good reasons for the two stars: 1. The basement washrooms smell of terrible water damage and mould. Extremely Damp, we could barely breathe and we all ran up the stairs to breathe again. Serious issue.\n\n 2. I saw a bottle of bubbly in the bar fridge and another on the ledge above their bar. I asked hey got any bubbles? (just thought I'd ask you never know).The bartender says no, I point out the Ace of Spades (I know what it is but perhaps they might have something else). He replies \"oh you can't have that. That's like a $800 bottle of Champagne, it's Ace of Spades. \" \n\nI work in wine, I study wine, I know people that are ambassadors at LVMH, I buy obscene amounts of wine and champagne. Of course I know what it is but the tone and rude comeback was not necessary. Also this is a pure hipster bar, wtf is it doing there? This isn't Maison. I'm confused.  \n\nSo the washrooms smell like serious mould and they proudly display a $300 (retail) bottle of Ace of Spades. \n\nI don't quite understand their priorities. For hipster bar they should have some hipster estate produced champagne like Jacquesson, Bereche, Chiquet, Bouchard, Lahaye. Not some over priced yuppy brand.
