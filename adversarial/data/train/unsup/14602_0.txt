This Tropical Smoothie Cafe is located just right off the freeway and is in a pretty good location. The parking lot is a little tight and you will need to squeeze in to park because they share the parking lot with other businesses that can be quite busy. The staff here at Tropical Smoothie are always so very friendly and patient. The take and make your order quickly and precise. They have a Huge variety of smoothies to choose from and the price is just right with the size of smoothie you decide to try. Not only do they have tasty smoothies they also have great tacos and wraps that are also good. This location has a small dining area but luckily the times I've been it hasn't been too busy enough to be uncomfortable. I definitely recommend people try Tropical Smoothie Cafe for an all right delicious and cool experience.
