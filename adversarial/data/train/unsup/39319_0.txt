We were visiting, in the process of moving to Cleveland, and just Googled \"corned beef.\"  The deli was on the way out of town, so we gave it a try.  It is your typical diamond in the rough.  The corned beef was juicy, tender, and plentiful.  As another reviewer noted, the neighborhood ambiance keeps it from being 5-stars.  It's kind of like the best Chinese restaurants in SF Chinatown.  The more stairs you need to climb, the better the food.  We had to stop along the way home to eat, because there was no way I was going to be able to drive and eat that monster at the same time.  It ended up being lunch and dinner.  As Arnold said, \"I'll be back.\"
