Since I discovered Opiano earlier this month, I've been there at least 6 times. \nSadly, today is their last day before their 3 weeks-long summer vacation. \n\nI tried their bulgogi and spicy chicken Dosirak (combo box). Each box includes a bowl of miso soup, a salad, a good portion of rice, two pieces of vegetable tempura, 5 pieces of sushi and the main dish of choice. That's a lot of food!! Portions are always generous, and the bulgogi is one of the best I've had in town. We also tried one of their sushi dishes. It came as 6 rather large pieces - it was good, but not as satisfying as the dosirak. But it's great to share with friends if you want to try different dishes!\n\nNow on to the bingsoo. I'm seriously addicted to it. No kidding, I think about it everyday and wouldn't mind eating it every morning and every night. We even came up with a chant for it! \n\n\"Shaved ice! It's so nice!\n Shaved ice! Every night!\"\n\nWe tried pretty much all flavors at this point: matcha, mango, strawberry, chocolate, coffee, red beans, rice cake. The matcha is still my ultimate favorite, but the mango is close behind. If you never had Opiano's shaved ice, today's your chance!!\n\nI'm going there tonight for dinner, but I don't know what I will do for the next 3 weeks. I guess I'll go hide in a corner and *cry*
