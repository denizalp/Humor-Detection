Firstly, I ordered a lamb gyro, which cost $6.95. The menus aren't posted on the wall. There is a menu at the counter and a lunch sign with the specials. I originally expected it to cost less so I wasn't prepared for the extra change I had to get out of my bag. So in my clumsy exchange, I accidentally knocked over the lunch sign, which knocked over a stack of cups. The lady behind the counter must have been quite cross with me for knocking over her set up. Very embarrassed, I gave her the right change and straightened the sign. For future reference, be more prepared with extra change on hand. My friend ordered the pork gyro, which was cheaper by about a dollar. The gyros were ready in a few minute and quite warm. My friend thought his lacked the tzaziki sauce and I thought mine could use some more fries but that's just being picky. They were very generous with the meat and it was moist and crisp at the edges. The gyros are also bigger than I expected. I was  very much enjoying my gyro until I reached the end. All the oil and grease had pooled to the end and the pita bread had soak it up. I was literally dripping at the end. I lost out of my last 3 bites of my gyro due to the overwhelming amount of oil. Overall, I enjoyed it very much and plan to return to try their other options with the appropriate change.
