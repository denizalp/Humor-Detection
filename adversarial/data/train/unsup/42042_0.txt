My wife was nagging me to try this place ever since it popped up last year. \nFrom the outside it looks vibrant and inviting especially at night when it's lit up.\nMy better half had the fish tacos which she loved, fresh fish and ingredients used and a generous but not over generous portions served (perfect amount of food) \nHowever my bacon cheeseburger I ordered arrived raw in the middle ( I wasn't asked how I'd like my burger) and the bottom of the bun was soaked in grease, and not up to the standard it should have been. I sent my food back and was waiting a good 15 minutes for a properly cooked burger to arrive back at our table, by then my wife had finished and my hunger had surpassed, I asked my waiter to box it up for me to take with me.\nI was given this part of the meal for free by the concerned manager, he was apologetic and seemed disappointed.\nI think it was a one off Bad burger experience and I was the unlucky person that day. I ate the burger at home shortly after, it was now over cooked, I wasn't surprised maybe that was karma for the complaint. \nI haven't been back as yet, but never say never.
