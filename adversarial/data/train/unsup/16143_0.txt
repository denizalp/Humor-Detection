I was driving by and looking for a nail shop and happened to pass by this place. I debated whether I should go in because it was so close to closing time, but figured if anything they would tell me to come back. They were very nice, and took me in. \n\nI wanted to give 3.5 stars, but I can't, but here's my reason for the 4 stars - EFFORT.\n\nSome places, around closing time, are rushing to get you out and will do a sub-par job. Having said that, I tried to explain to the girl that I wanted ombre nails, but she didn't seem to know what that was nor did she really understand me. I tried to explain it several times, but figured it was better to just show her pictures so then I pulled it up online. She seemed to get the concept, but then was fixated on the colors, which is not what I was really wanting. Anyway, she began prepping as if she understood.\n\nOnce she got to the nail painting, she asked to see the picture again and went to show the boss Leslie. Leslie then proceeded to clarify what I wanted and had to explain to the girl what it was that I was asking for in their language. \n\nAlthough the nails were not QUITE the ombre look I was going for - especially because I was comparing it to the last time I had it done at a different salon. She just painted two layers of different shades, and then added glitter to help \"fade\" the colors. It turned out pretty good. Her techniques were there for nails and for what it's worth, she took the time to actually do her best at something she didn't really know how to do.  She gets an A for effort.\n\nI will probably return, but I probably will stick to something simpler if anything.
