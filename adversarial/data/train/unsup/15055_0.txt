Word to the wise: don't come here if you (a) lacking in self control and\/or (b) have things to do later. If you're looking for a lot of sushi, nigiri, tempura, teriyaki, etc. for an incredibly reasonable price (that yung $14 lunch special), look no further. I almost didn't want to write this review so I could keep this sushi mecca somewhat underground, but I gotta give the people what they want. You're welcome, people. Cancel your plans, slip into your sweats with the stretchy waistband, and buckle in for the ride. \n\nIf you're a sushi snob perhaps you may look down on the sushi quality, but I think for your average Joe-san it's more than satisfactory -- it's some of the best sushi I've had in this price range and all you can eat. They have a wide variety of common rolls (you can also get them as hand rolls, which are kind of like one large piece of sushi in the form of a seaweed basket); I'm personally a fan of the spicy tuna and the eel and avocado, but I would stay away from the crab. Specialty rolls are also great, and their Crazy Volcano Roll is just the right amount of fried -- I think the Las Vegas Roll is fried a little too heavily.\n\nMake sure you visit the bathroom (just do it -- top tier bathroom, and trust me I know bathrooms) and get the green tea ice cream!
