What can I say....all the flavors what do I choose. \nSo most of the flavors are good. \nThe guy who Helped us was I guess nice but not as friendly as he should be considering he's working somewhere directly with the public and a vacation spot where people want to have fun and see smiles clearly he was not having a smiley and happy day LOL\nOther than the fact that they are using the concept of a slushy and adding alcohol plus I guess promoting Alcohol abuse this is a great concept.. Lol good job.
