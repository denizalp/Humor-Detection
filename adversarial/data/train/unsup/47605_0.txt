Wow. Top notch late night bites..... we got the fries, a turkey burger and a bacon cheeseburger. It was so much food! We totally couldn't finish it all. I had the turkey burger and it was amazing - it was seasoned perfectly and was super filling. My fiancee loved cheeseburger, and like me he could not finish it. We probably took 2\/3 of the fries to go as well as it was such a large order. It was insane and delicious and such a nice surprise. Our server was super nice and attentive the entire visit.\n\nThis is a great place to go for anyone who is a fan of Guy Fieri or burgers or late night bites. What you get for the money is more than worth the price - it is super delicious and the portions are large.I would for sure return next time I am in Vegas craving a burger and fries!
