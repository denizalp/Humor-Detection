One of the better buffets on the strip for your money. Especially with the unlimited beer and wine. There are so many food options and always fresh. I have never been disappointed going here. The staff is very friendly and the bartender was awesome- we stopped for a brunch and he made us \"mimosa's\" with OJ and Moscato tasted just like the real deal.
