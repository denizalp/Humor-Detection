Oh Avoid this place @ ALL Costs. They will double bill your insurance, run tests that they do not bother to #1 inform you they're running & #2 you cannot get test results even on tests they run. They are very unprofessional & treat you as if you are a hassle to them. You will get billed for $53.00 for going in on Sunday which they consider to be a weekend visit. My son wound up going to Southern Hills Hospital & what a blessing it was to meet Dr. Sondrup & his staff. Dr. Hayes & Dr. Daulat have no business in the medical field. They spent all of 7 minutes with my son on 4 different visits {not the 5 they are billing for}. Honestly, they should be ashamed of themselves & may God have mercy on their souls.
