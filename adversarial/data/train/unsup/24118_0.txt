Been meaning to check this place out since it opened but never managed to get the chance, so when I noticed they started offering delivery service I jumped at the opportunity to give it a try.\n\nWe ordered the platter for two, which came with ribs, wings, brisket and pulled pork. Sides were cole slaw (included), mac & cheese (our selection) and hush puppies (a delicious, delicious surprise).\n\nI don't remember the wings clearly, but the other meats were delicious and tender. Sauce not too sweet (I dislike super sweet sauce) and portions were generous. Mac & cheese and cole slaw were decent. As noted above, the hush puppies (which came with a chipotle aioli) were delish. \n\nNext up, a trip to the restaurant so I can try some of their bourbon cocktails to wash down the delicious food! And what's this about pie!?
