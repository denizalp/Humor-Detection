My wife was involved in a rear end collision. There was no doubt where to get her Jag repaired. The staff at New Look did not disappoint. They kept us updated every step of the way with email notifications and progress reports through phone calls. The car looks amazing! It truly is that NEW LOOK AGAIN!!! Thank you to Paul, Lou and all the staff at New Look Collision for a seamless, easy, stress free experience! There is no other shop I would even consider getting work done on any of our cars!!! Thanks again New Look Collision for a job well done!!!! And oh yeah, THANK YOU FOR A HAPPY WIFE when she saw her car looking new again! As they say, Happy wife, happy life!!!
