The only reason I go here is because its close to my house and this place doesn't have a 1 to 2 hour wait like most AYCE sushi restaurants. I love the fact that I can walk in and never have to wait for a table. I've been here a few times and the price for AYCE sushi is reasonable but the quality of the sushi is just ok. Honestly you can probably get better & fresher sushi from the grocery store. \n\nHUGE SIDE NOTE - I dunno if anyone else has noticed the fact that the staff and chefs are not Japanese. I've heard them speak Chinese to each other. Possibly the biggest reason that there isn't a big following for this restaurant due to the fact that it is not an authentic Japanese sushi bar :(
