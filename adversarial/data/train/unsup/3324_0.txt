I was at the Airport coming back from a trip. Mind you this is on the outside of security. \nI first went to LoLos but, no one was working it seemed.\nSo then I moved on to America's Taco Shop. It was fairly busy. I have heard good things about it , so I thought I would give it a try.\nI ordered 2 beef Tacos and 2 Chicken Tacos. Both on soft shells. I figured I would take home dinner for the Family.\nWell, One person rang it up and then another girl made the tacos. She was wearing plastic gloves while making the food, but here is the best part. WhILE MAKING THE TACOS SHE PUT A PIECE OF MEAT IN HER MOUTH.\nYES, I WATCHED HER DO IT. RIGHT OUT THERE IN FRONT OF ALL. Now I know that they probably get hungry and maybe they did not get time for her to have a break.\nBut, please , do not eat off your hand and continue to make my food with the same gloved hand. Because, I saw it, I just could not enjoy my food at all. My girlfriend asked why didn't you just cancel your order and get your $$ back.\nYes, I should of , but I did not.   I know probably worse things happen in restaurants and Kitchens across America. But, know that is all I can think of whenever I see one of these places.  With the Measles going around at the time and all the crazy Flus it just freaked me out. Sorry, I will never be back for a 2nd chance.
