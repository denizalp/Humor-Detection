Was excited to see a new location of this great Chicago spot pop up right in my area! Went last night for the soft opening and had a great experience. We were greeted before we walked in and seated right away. Our server was really friendly and did a great job. We got the Lou deep dish and they said it would take 30 min so we got an appetizer to snack on. We ordered the bruschetta, which took a super long time to come out but was worth it because it was so good. The tomatoes on it tasted incredibly fresh! Then our Lou pizza cane which has spinach with garlic, mushroom, and tomatoes. It was really good! A crispy crust, just the right amount of cheese and sauce! A bit pricey, but worth it. Cool atmosphere too, very open and I like the palm trees up front. I'll come back for sure!
