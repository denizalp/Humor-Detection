LOVE embraces your inner hippie and lets loose your oppressed rebel  using music from the Beatles, visual projections and world class acrobatic talent. For Beatles fans and non-fans alike, the show reflects our nations youth across a few decades.\n\n- Remastered music.\n- Talented cast.\n- Well thought out integration of music and visuals.\n- Expensive for front row.\n- Comfortable seats.\n\nWhile on a memorial trip to Vegas with my wife and uncle, Cirque du Soleil makes a sure bet for a memorable trip. I have seen many Cirque du Soleil shows in the past and they all differ in their own way. LOVE helped bring back some Beatles nostalgia for my uncle and provided a unique performance for the audience.\n\nSitting in the front row is a good idea 90% of the time with Cirque du Soleil shows and worked out well in this case. I scored the tickets from the fan club, well under the going rate and it amplified the experience being so close. Characters practically sit on your lap and do front-flips like you're the only person in the audience.\n\nWith Cirque du Soleil LOVE, the audience honors the musical legacy of the Beatles through remastered recordings, special visits from the iconic band members, and fictional characters pulled right from the songs.You'll find yourself watching Sgt. Pepper who encounters many familiar faces, including Lucy in the Sky, Eleanor Rigby, Lady Madonna and Mr. Kite. \n\nThe unconstrained story of the Beatles starts at the Blitz, moves through the band's founding, climb into superstardom, and their break-up. Using the master tapes at Abbey Road studios, they have created a unique soundscape of The Beatles music for LOVE. With panoramic sound and visuals, the audience will experience The Beatles as never before.
