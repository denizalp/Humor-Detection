This place is amazing the food is great. Just moved from LA was looking for a good breakfast spot and this spot is it. Caitlyn (might be spelled wrong) was our server she was the best server I have ever had. Always checking in on the table answered my silly questions (why is one location named different to why do u have these things that slide over the top) she explained it all. She was always smiling. If I was her boss I would send her to Disneyland for Christmas she deserves it. Just my opinion.
