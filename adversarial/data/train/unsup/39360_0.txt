I wanted to like this place, I really did. Being from Texas i was hoping to find a decent tex-mex joint here in Toronto. This sadly isn't it. I ordered the chicken tacos, thinking this was about as safe a bet as you could find. The shells were soggy, and the filling was an overly salty but an otherwise flavorless coagulated mess. The beans tasted otherworldly (not in a good way). the only reason im giving 2 stars is the place has amazing drink specials and good service. Thank god for groupon, I didn't wind up having to pay full price. Bottom line, I'll be back, but it'll be up at the bar.
