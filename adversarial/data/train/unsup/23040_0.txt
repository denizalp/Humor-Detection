The food's ok, but nothing we couldn't get in LA for less $. Likewise, the cocktails were good classics, but light on the liquor and heavy on the small-cubed ice. First time out, we sat in the restaurant, not the bar. We had the duck rillettes and the quail and waffles. The rillettes were pure heaven--so good that we came back for a farewell meal of them before leaving Vegas. The quail was a heavy, over-breaded gimmick. The waffles were bland. Totally not worth the $26\n\nThe service was...interesting. Interesting as in, I could write a thesis called Gender Dynamics in Las Vegas Cocktail Service on the experience. Our cocktail server on our second trip was friendly, but she made a point of serving my male companion everything first to the extent that when she accidentally set down my drink in front of him, instead of moving it over to me or allowing me to take it, she put it back on the tray, served my companion his drink, and then served me mine. \n \nNote to Cocktail Servers: The guest with the penis isn't always the one who picks up the tab. Treating all guests equally will probably land you better tips overall than will treating the ones with ladyparts like second class citizens.
