Just gets worse every time.  I'm done.  It's not just the Fox News the manager switched my game to in the middle of my lunch.  The salad bar was 1\/2 empty and the greens looked sad.  They had sunk to pizza dough rolled in sugar for desert and the last time I was in they had raw apple cake. Yesterday they had thrown in the towel and there was just and empty dish.  The pizzas used to have a variety of toppings.  The manager should find something better to do than to switch the programming to lies and propaganda.  Lame.  Topper is that I said something to 2 different employees and they don't care about you.
