DO NOT GO TO THIS DOCTOR OFFICE!!!!!!! LIARS! INCOMPETENT! THIEVES!!\n\nI can not even begin to express my dissatisfaction with this place. Let's start from the beginning. I have a history of sinus problems. I went to Dr. Page's office for a tension headache that I had for over a week. He explained it was a sinus infection, which I already knew, and prescribed antibiotics. I asked for something for the headache and was told the antibiotics would be enough and to take ibprouphen. Well it wasn't enough because my tension headache lasted another week straight. I did not go back to this doctor's office again. Nothing irritates me more than people who don't listen. If I tell you I have a history of sinus infections, obviously I will need something a little stronger than normal antibiotics. Now this, is not even the worst part of my story. When I left the doctors office I asked the woman at the front desk if my insurance had taken care of everything or if I needed to pay. She told me that my insurance took care of it all and I didn't owe any money. I asked her to double check. I ALWAYS ask them to double check. She assured me that my insurance had taken care of everything. This all happened over a year ago, and this morning I was woken up by a collections agency saying my account was sent to them by Dr. Pages office. The NERVE of this office! How dare you send me to a collections agency and tarnish my credit after you specifically told me I did not owe you money! It's not even an issue of money, I paid in full this morning. This \"doctors office\" will waste your time!! They are either liars or incompetent, but either way they are CROOKS!!!! and THIEVES!!!! \n\nDO NOT GO TO THIS DOCTORS OFFICE!!!!!!
