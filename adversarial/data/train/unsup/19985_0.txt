Not giving this place five stars simply because I don't go here, and I don't know too much about campus life.\n\nHowever, I do love the campus in general. My girlfriend doesn't like it too much because she goes here, but I like it because it always reminds me that I'm close to her. \n\nAlso, is it me or are they deliberately removing more humans sculptures from their \"walking to the sky\" pole.
