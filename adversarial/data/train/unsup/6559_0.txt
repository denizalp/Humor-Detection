Very good hotel that totally exceeded my expectations.  \n\nI was nervous to book at LVH because of the other reviews on yelp. After I read the reviews, I still booked a  premium room.  I know, that is a risk but I did it.  Trying to live my chaotic life on the edge, I became extremely nervous about my choice however, the price was totally awesome and I am not one to pass up a deal.  \n\nThe front lobby area was very clean and I was greeted by a very nice agent.  He was so nice and funny.  He upgraded my room to a suite as well as gave me deals to various amenities within the hotel.  The suite that I stayed in was totally worth my money.  It was spacious and beautiful.  My husband I were visiting for his birthday. I was so amazed at the service that we received as well as the open suite model that we stayed in.  \n\nThe only reason that I am not giving the hotel 5 stars is due to their club scene.  The club called Oasis or hoasis is not a place that you want to be if you are a respectable person with dignity and self worth.  The club inside of the hotel is for the ratchet and raggedy crowd.  On a Saturday night, it makes the hotel look like a run down motel.  I was so happy that we left and went to the strip for some fun rather than to stay and take in the hotel hoedown.
