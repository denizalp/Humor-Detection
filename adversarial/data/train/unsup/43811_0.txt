Just came in with my baby.  Waited 5 minutes, with several servers walking by, and was finally greeted by a guy working the bar.  He apologized and sat me. Thanks to him! After being ignored for an additional 5-10 minutes I decided to walk out.  A simple, I'll be with you in just a moment would have saved you a customer.
