Unfortunately Yelp let me down on this one - a coworker and I had this place on our bucket list for a while due to the seemingly good reviews. We ordered the chirashi as well as some nigiri and unfortunately some of the fish was just not fresh, and overall the fish quality was a clear step below even nearby local alternatives. I get that some of the nigiri is pretty inexpensive and other Yelpers have rated this place high based on value, but the chirashi at ~$20 wasn't good value given no special selections were included in our spread - it was just standard, run-of-the-mill sashimi cuts.\n\nService was OK; refills on tea and water were efficient, but our experience was also diminished by our waitress' lack of familiarity with her own restaurant's menu, which made her unhelpful for recommendations and ordering assistance. Additionally, she seemed unaware of the distinction between \"chutoro\" and \"otoro\" (the menu simply said \"toro\" and I'm not usually a fan of \"otoro\" as I find it too fatty), and worse yet appeared annoyed when we asked if she could check with the sushi chef.\n\nSolely because of the good reviews by other Yelpers, I may give this place a second chance and update should my experience improve - but honestly, even the money I'd save with the \"value\" nigiri lauded by some other reviewers isn't appealing when I know I will consistently get better fish at other nearby sushi spots.
