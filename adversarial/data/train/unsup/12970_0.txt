I came to QQ boba when I was in need of a boba fix one day. Since this was a new place for me, I tried a Thai tea (Thai tea boba is my go to drink when I go to new boba places so I can evenly rate all these shops). The Thai tea was mediocre. The Thai tea tasted like it came from a powder mix and not freshly brewed. Though it was refreshing, it was not a memorable tea. But the boba was good; it had a slight chewiness to it and was not tough. \n\nThis place is a good stop to get boba drinks when you are driving near it, but the drinks were average.
