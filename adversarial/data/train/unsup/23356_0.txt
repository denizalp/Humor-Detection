It has been a long time since I've been here. As always, Win gave me an amazing haircut. Prices are reasonable and reservation is easy. I usually don't exactly know what I want for a hair cut. I usually just show him few photos of what I like. He would look for commonality between them, said ok, and bam delivers much more than what you are expecting. I cannot be any happier that this salon is so close to my house.\n\nThe only cons about this place is that he does \"multi-task\" quite a bit. Meaning he might be working on you while working on other clients. While you might not get his 100% attention, it will not compromise the quality of what you will be looking for. I highly recommend this place for anyone who is looking for an amazing haircut that fits your needs.
