Blessing in disguise.  So my girlfriend was checking out hotels for our trip to Vegas and accidentally booked a hotel without intending to do so.  Oops.  Renaissance Las Vegas Hotel?  What the hell is that?  WHERE the hell is that?  3\/4 mile from the strip?  Noooo!\n\nWait a second.  No casino?  Hmm, that means that it will be quieter, cleaner, and it won't take you an hour to navigate out to the street.  It's right in front of the monorail so you don't have to deal with cabbies trying to rip you off?  Whoa whoa whoa... 24\/7 pool and hot tub?  SOLD!\n\nSo yes, it was a blessing in disguise.  The staff was very pleasant for the most part, and everyone was willing to give directions (even if each person gave you different directions).  The hotel was clean and 100% smoke free.  The rooms were fine, nothing crazy, but they were clean.  No view from our window, but the bed was pretty comfortable, there were a few comfy chairs for sitting, a desk with a small LCD tv on it, and plenty of closet space.  The bathroom was nice as well, with separate tub\/shower and a nice modern feel.\n\nIn fact, this was such a blessing in disguise that I have a hard time believing that I will ever stay on the strip again.  Would I stay at Renaissance again?  Sure, the prices were reasonable, it was clean and quiet, and I loved the 24 hour hot tub access... what better way to wash away the day of dirty casinos, sweaty nightclubs, and the rest of the Vegas filth?  I might try another place off of the strip, but all in all the prices are reasonable and it's a solid hotel.\n\nThere are nicer hotels in Vegas, and it all depends upon what you want, but if you're looking for a quieter option that doesn't stink like money, smoke and prostitutes, then this is a great option.  4 stars.
