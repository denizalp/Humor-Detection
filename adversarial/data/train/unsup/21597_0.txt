8\/25\nThin-crusted Whitestone Bridge pizza (garlic, ricotta, mozz, spinach, tomatoes, and olive oil) was good!  Could've been a little bit crispier, but I was happy.  Spotted their thick-sliced Sicilian pizza and mentioned to Paul that I was not a fan of thick-crusts, bec. I found them too soggy and too doughy, and he graciously offered me samples.  Thank you Paul, but I'm still not a fan of (approx. two-inch) thick pizza.\nBensenhurst baked ziti was very delicious!  Penne, ricotta, house marinara, parm, and mozz.  This must-try dish came w\/ garlic knots, a popular appetizer.  Perhaps these knots are better when they're fresh- I tried them re-heated (toaster oven), and they didn't do anything for me.  Will have to visit with a few friends in tow to try this dish and app fresh from the oven!\nAlso tried a gyro sandwich.  Not bad, but for the price, I'd rather swing by Tempe's Haji-Baba's and spend a buck more (plus gas money) and get TWO wonderful gyro sandwiches.  \nFive tables present, but the space didn't feel inviting enough to stay and dine in.  This venue screams \"take-out\" loud and clear.
