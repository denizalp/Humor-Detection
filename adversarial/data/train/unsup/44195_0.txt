Worst pepperoni pizza I've had in years. I got the $11.49 Large 16\" one topping special (coupon offer in menu). The cheese is terrible- bland and squishy. The pepperoni is generic and not very spicy and the crust is boring as well. The staff were friendly and service was reasonably quick, but I'll definitely not be getting pizza from here again.
