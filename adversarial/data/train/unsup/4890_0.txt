When in Las Vegas you have to go see the Pawn Stars! Especially if you need wedding rings! \nFun fun fun! Great service and unique things to see. \nAfter watching the TV show and LOVING it, it's nice to see that it is an actual store...open every day! It was my first trip into and making a purchase at a Pawn Shop.  \nI had the pleasure of trying on rings and making my purchase decisions with Cheryl. She was so patient and helpful. \nShe told me I could find the \"stars\" working next door and gave me directions to the marriage license office. She knows her stuff!  \nRichard Harrison graduated from the same High School that I graduated from in a tiny little NC town and look at him now! \nLots of people visit so get there early and you won't have to wait long. But it's worth the wait.
