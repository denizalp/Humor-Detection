The response is a little too late. The allegations are very serious and very unfortunate that you after 17 years of being in business are unaware of your driving instructors practices. It's all good to take peoples monies under false pretences.  I will post your driving instructions car with advertisement for mortgages shortly. I have enrolled my son with Young Drivers and have regrets with not going with them from the start. I guess you get what you pay for.... this is clearly the case
