This place is pretty good for a food court shop. I especially am a fan of their grilled chicken fresh rolls, they are just fantastic and are served with a peanut dipping sauce. I often grab them to take home for dinner. Their other dishes are good too, it's fairly good thai food to be honest, which is why they have big line ups at lunch. \n\nTheir food is fresh, and not overcooked nor does it sit in the hot table all day either. good service, friendly counter staff and good quality food keeps me coming back. :)
