My boyfriend and I were in town from Buffalo and had some time to kill before a dinner reservation.  We were walking around looking for somewhere to grab a drink and decided to stop here.  The customer service was quick and friendly and they had a nice little patio to sit on!  The drink menu was pretty extensive as far as beers and ciders go, but none of the cocktails stuck out to me.  The server was super friendly and accommodating and did not seem to mind that we were only in and out for one drink.  I almost wish that we didn't have dinner reservations because the food menu looked delicious!  I will certainly keep this place in mind for dinner when I'm in town next time; I would love to come back.
