Browsing through Yelp, I am often surprised by how few reviews this store attracts. \n\nI'd guess that Sporting Life appeals to a less tech-savvy demographic, but if you ever pop by the hard goods section, and eavesdrop as gearheads chat with well-informed staffers, you'd find that hard to believe. \n\nA Toronto mini-empire, Sporting Life has built a reputation on customer service in a field governed by unresponsive chains and snarkier-than-thou hipster boutiques. Whether I'm there on a mission or just browsing, staff is always friendly, and outside of hiring season, pretty knowledgeable. Want to start a fight about the merits of Patagonia v. North Face? Descente v. Phenix? Polo v. Lacoste? Informed opinions abound. Catch the right person on the right day, and they might even comb the warehouse upstairs for the truly deep discounts. A $250 suede bomber (originally over $700) will never leave my shoulders. \n\nFull disclosure: I put myself through university selling men's sportswear, skiwear, golf-and-tennis, and anything not bolted to the floor. Need a Speedo? I'm your huckleberry.\n\nDespite the occasional failed expansion attempt (Bloor Street, we hardly knew ye), Sporting Life successfully targets the weekend warrior and occasional serious outdoorsman alike. All manner of ski, tennis, golf and outdoor adventure clothing, in sizes to fit just about anyone. A wall of shoes may confuse, but is easily resolved following a consultation and gait assessment. Accessory hounds can lounge by the glass case, and keep an eye out for sales. \n\nDownside: 48 weeks of the year, it isn't cheap, and the perpetual sidewalk sale is an eyesore of sun-bleached special purchases. However, when the real clearances hit, Sporting Life is a lot of fun.
