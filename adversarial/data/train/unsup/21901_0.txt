Angry crab is my go to spot for Cajun cuisine.\nBasically been to all locations and loved the food every single time.The trifecta sauce which is a combination of Cajun, lemon pepper and garlic is Perfect and pairs well with any seafood.\n\nWe generally get the shrimp or the Dungeness crab with red potatoes and corn.\n(Seafood is sold by the pound)\nDon't forget to pair it with some corn bread to balance the heat.\nThe spice levels range from 0 to 6 \n\nLevel 0- Wimpy\nLevel 6- grim reaper \nI have gone up to level 3- I can't feel my lips hot\n\nThey also have some great specials on the menu, recently tried the lobster crostini and it was pretty good with generous amount of lobster meat.\n\nPersonally this location is not my favorite because I have had a few mix ups with to-go orders but the food is Legit.\n\nCheers!
