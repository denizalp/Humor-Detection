Frequent Uber user in SFO, DC, NYC, and Dallas. Yesterday was a mess at DFW due to weather. 12 midnight put in request for Uber and updated App  asks for destination. Driver called me to confirm and said would be there  in 5 minutes. After 10 minutes I looked and the entire trip was gone and out of App. Driver had looked at the short trip and he CXL it. I called him three times and threatened to complain to Uber. Finally called me back and I was in another car and he lamely said he had a tire issue. He Cxl the request and abandoned me. \n\nThe new driver Al told me he had heard of this a few times as Uber expands it's driver fleet. I reported to Uber support and they said the would give me a $10 credit. I gave them driver  phone number to reprimand, but who knows. The expense account will get that credit and no good for my hassle. BEWARE of putting in destination as you to could be abandoned by UBER!!!
