Go to any gun shop in Las Vegas, then call Discount Firearms and ask for price on same gun ... Probably $100 less!  I was on Blue Diamond and asked if they would price match, they said no, but bring the gun here after you buy it and use our range. When I asked Discount on the phone if the price was right, he said \"our name is discount, what do you think\" ... Easy enough.\n\nBy the way, the building use to be a swingers club ... Gotta love Vegas.
