I recently visited Star Nursery to research and find plants and containers to accomplish an opportunity to begin a business endeavor I have dreamed I would succeed.\nI was overwhelmed by the interest the employees I met and assisted me with this endeavor.  I returned several days in a row to order product, select additional plants as my project grew with success!\nI would not have been able to satisfy my client and receive their honor without the these employees who made it possible.\nThe Manager, Marco, who helped me be within my project budget with genuine care; Erica with her knowledge of their plant inventory - came to my aid when alternate choices were required; Richard helped with ordering containers - calling me with notice when they arrived; Brandon & Alfredo who worked their delivery schedules to assist my time of need; the girls at the checkout register - Courtney and Ivonne - showed a sincere interest and eagerness to help with care - requesting the results of my 'First Account' in my Dream adventure!\nI do not want to forget Wesley, the delivery person who called when he was leaving the nursery with each delivery of three days.  Called when he delivered to my project site- verify each item!\nThis experience exceeded my expectations of Customer Service!  I am from an era where Customers were expected to be treated with Special Care!  I thought this attitude was from a forgotten Time!\n\"Thank You Star Nursery employees who truly made my Dream take a real step forward!\"\nForgive me if I missed someone special!\nI look forward working with you on future endeavors!\nBettySue
