Awesome customer service, awesome product.  No upfront fees either.  \n\nJim came out on a Wednesday afternoon to discuss our options, and Raul came out to install our system the very next morning.  It works perfectly, and is super easy to use.  Both Jim and Raul were extremely professional and friendly.\n\nYou can see from all the 5 star reviews that JPG is the most highly recommended home security company in greater Phoenix - and for good reason.  Don't bother going with any other company.
