Updating this because it's been a while since I visited & guess what?! Ritter's is still just as good (*surprise surprise... note the sarcasm). Our group of 4 was seated right away on a cold Saturday morning around 11:30 am. I ordered pancakes, egg whites and bacon. I was given a huge portion of three fluffy pancakes, a large portion of eggs & three pieces of bacon. The bacon was actually a little disappointing- it tasted as if they bought the cheapest kind, or maybe it was just a bad batch? Everything else was delicious. I saved one of the pancakes for breakfast the next day & it was just as good. The egg whites were perfect and were super filling. My boyfriend loved his french toast, home fries and sausage. The home fries were delicious. I love that you can listen to music on the jukeboxes while you enjoy a delicious breakfast!
