I read the review that Steven E. wrote only minutes ago and quite frankly I am so embarrassed by the filthy conditions of this eatery. As you know, the Japanese take extreme  pride in cleanliness and neatness. This restaurant  is a disgrace to the Japanese culture and community at large. I have not eaten there nor will I unless they clean up their act! The owner, if he is Japanese, should consider hari kari. I hope he hasn't damaged our reputation too badly! My suggestion is to close down for a couple days and scrub, clean and polish from top to bottom and keep it that way! My apologies  to the loyal patrons for this sacrilege.
