I am very impressed with this place!\n\nFor starters the staff is super friendly which makes for a good day when you start really early - they were open at 6.\n\nI love corned beef hash and theirs is a unique twist on the classic.  A huge non-greasy portion that didn't have a single tough piece or gristle.\n\nService was quick and the waiters were very attentive.
