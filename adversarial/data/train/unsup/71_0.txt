Eating at a Michelin star restaurant is a culinary experience that is supposed to exceed all your expectations.  Not only by the food and service, but those little extras that make you go wow.\n\nBy now, you probably have read how extraordinary the food is.  The visual food art these master chefs create is crazy and how these plethora of different flavors mesh and match into a edible masterpiece.\n\nThe culture instilled in these food service professionals is not the same as you high end  Morton's or lowrys.  From the exec chef to floor manager to waiters to wait help all work in unison.  It's not my table, section or your guest or section.... It OUR guests!  You can ask anyone for a request and they will honor it immediately with a \"certainly madame\" and they will fulfill it, not ask the person tending your section to do it.\n\nAnother thing I like is they don't nickel and dime you for insignificant items, such as bottle water. Many will charge $10 per bottle you drink. At Guy Savoy, one $8 charge gets you as many glass bottle Evians you need.\n\nFinally at a Michelin star restaurant is you want surprises and to be wow to the point you say, you win, I can't eat another bite.  With Guy Savoy, you get your amuse dessert, two main desserts.  Then they casually roll in the dessert cart with bite sized tart, pies, mousse, ice cream, bread etc.  So after you have loosened your belt two notches, they bring out a single scoop of sorbet, earl grey tea and black pepper to be exact.  This leaves your palate cleansed.\n\nOn your way out the hostess hands you a small box fresh baked coffee cake to savor later.  These wow moments and special touches is why this is the best of the best in Las Vegas.
