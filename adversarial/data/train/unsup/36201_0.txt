Wow. What a blast! So much fun playing all the different pinball machines. It was a little warm in there but not too bad. And there were some dark creepy corners but the cheap fun made up for all that. I was a little worried that the crowd would be tourist, douchey or over run with dick teenager but it was average group families, first date night couples and middle aged nerds... My kinda crowd. They had so many unique games and a lot them were only a quarter. Can't wait to go back.
