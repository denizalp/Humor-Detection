A fantastic seller of imported goods from the Mideast and India.  We always stop here for holiday and birthday shopping.  They sell everything from exotic musical instruments to swords to Buddhas, not to mention incense.  Plus, the owners are very sweet and knowledgeable.  I'm always left with a good feeling when buying something there.  Check it out!
