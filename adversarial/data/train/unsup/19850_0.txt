Renee & Meagan... awesome!  Great teamwork & fun.  Always remember what I drink, make room for me at the bar, remember what other regulars eat & I love seeing them.  Some of the best bartenders in our local community.  It does mean a lot & you are appreciated.  \n\nI love the Hearts of Palm Salad, Steakhouse & Brussels Sprouts Salad w\/ that shaved Parmesan.  Mmm!  Also the baked yams & horseradish mash or plain steamed broccoli, delish.  Steaks are always cooked to perfection.  The largest, most amazing Alaskan King Crab & if you want something smaller the app Lump Crab is great.  All of the seafood has been great & you can add Oscar style or choose from a variety of other additions.  \n\nHanks is the bomb!  It's like an upscale Cheers lol lots of regulars!  Love the live band, sitting at the piano, bar or in the very elegant dining area w\/ the chandeliers & fireplaces.  Ambience, along w\/ the lite bar counter space & TV's w\/ sports on are such a nice way to wind down in the evening.  They also have HH w\/ a huge selection of Martinis.  \n\nThe wine list could be a bit more consistent such as twice they've changed my fav wine by the glass, Freemark Abby & another awhile ago to something new.  Maybe even a bigger wine list.
