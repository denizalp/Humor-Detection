The Salt Cellar has been a culinary landmark in the valley since I was just a kid, so I was aware of it's reputation.  I would definitely recommend it based on it's historical significance; however, if you're looking for great all-around seafood experience, you may want to consider some of the other notable seafood restaurants around the valley.\n\nThe atmosphere is cool - in that, the dining area is located underground, making it dimly lit, and the theme is old nautical.  (Although, I did feel slightly claustrophobic once we were seated and had to quickly down some wine to relax that panic.)  The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and we didn't really have to wait long to be served our drinks or meals.\n\nWe ordered the Monk Fish, Crab Cakes, Baked-Stuffed Lobster, and the Salmon.  Everything was tasty and fresh, but the flavors were definitely in line with traditional Seafood dishes.  Not that this is a bad thing - I guess I have just become more comfortable with seafood dishes that have something extra regarding flavor.\n\nI'm glad that I had the experience - hopefully the Salt Cellar has another 30 years left in it, but if I have the taste for seafood again I probably won't go back.
