Note to employees of Pei Wei: when I order online and give an empty restaurant 30 min to make 1 dish don't act surprised when I come in to pick it up and you clearly haven't started it. \n\nNote to management: to increase customer satisfaction you could teach your employees that when they forget to make an order they can offer something to the customer such as a free drink, a cookie, extra meat, etc. It would go a long way. \n\nWhy 2 stars? Because I love the food.
