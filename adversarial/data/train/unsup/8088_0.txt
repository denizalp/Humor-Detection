Another great concept Sam Fox has created. Last Saturday was my first time at this Juby True location. There are many options for cold press juices in the area but having ties to Fox Concepts is a name you can trust. The location is perfect with plenty of parking. This location has plenty of options from Cold Press Juices to healthy food options, to coffee and teas. The modern feel of a hip grocery juice bar is the feeling I gained. Several of tables to sit at while you wait or dine. Decorated with hip art and menu on the wall. \n\nI was served by a gentleman named Juliene. He was not the most helpful or friendliest employee which is a surprise as all the restaurants that are linked to Sam Fox have the best customer service. Not sure if it was a bad day or his personality but I would have bought more if he was willing to help better explain options for me to choose from. I felt alone and researching products on my own. I went ahead and made a small purchase. I purchased one cold press juice. It was extremely tasty. I am going to try a custom cleanse real soon to see how the other options taste. Hopefully this time around will be a much better experience.
