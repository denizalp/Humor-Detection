I'm visiting my grandparents in Vegas and we were looking for a good Mexican restaurant. I yelped this place and saw the reviews were good so we decided to give it a try.  Let me just say - this place is AMAZING!!! I got the stuffed avocado with beef.  OMG! Absolutely delicious! My grandma got the same thing with shrimp in it and loved it. My mom got the same thing with only cheese. She loved it as well! The soup is DELICIOUS! The homemade flour tortillas are amazing too!!! My grandparents are so happy they found a great Mexican restaurant nearby! When we are back in Vegas next time we will be coming back here! I highly recommend this restaurant! This is coming from a girl that lives in Orange County, California! With no shortage of great Mexican restaurants around.  Oh I almost forgot, the chips are delicious and their avocado salsa is to die for!!!!!
