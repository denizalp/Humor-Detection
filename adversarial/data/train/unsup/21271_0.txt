I'm part Jamaican, didn't ya know?  Well, not really, but my best friend since the 7th grade is Jamaican-American and her house was practically my second home growing up.  Her huge family is like my family and I've traveled to Jamaica with them three times, so I do know a little about the food.  Guess where my second family likes to eat when they're in Vegas?  Yeah, mon, Tasty Island, so you know it has to be good.  My girl was in town with some of her clan this past weekend and they wanted to have lunch here so we did.  I always get the oxtail with rice and peas and a slice of plaintain, washing it down with Kola Champagne (best soda ever)--oh yeah!  I had a beef patty as an appetizer and that thing had a slight kick-it was fresh out of the oven and it was a little spicy hot for me.  I can't do the jerk chicken because I'm too wimpy for the spicy, but my son had it and he ate it up (he's also almost Jamaican by default).  He usually gets the curry chicken, but they were out.  Service here can be on the slow side while you wait for your food, but that's why you should have a patty in the mean time: they have beef, chicken, and veggie patties, which are pastries with your choice of filling.  Some dishes are served with festival, Jamaican dumplings, and I tried my friend's, but it was kind of dry.  Other than that, we had another great meal here.  Everyting irie at Tasty island, mon!
