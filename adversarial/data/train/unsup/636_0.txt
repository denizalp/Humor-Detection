Mmm mmm mmmm what can I say....I love meat!\n\nAnd when a craving for meat hits, Texas de Brazil fulfills the craving. We came to TdB with a group. I think it's ideal for groups because it's a set price for each person. We also ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was delicious.\n\nThe cold and hot salad bars that are available offer a variety of items. Some of my favorites are the (hot) sauteed mushrooms and buffalo mozzerella with tomatoes.\n\nThe selection of meats that come around are delicious too. Well seasoned and the portions are just right. I especially like the filet mignon and flank steak.\n\nThe service is on point and all the staff from host greeters to our main waiter were polite and attentive. \n\nMinus one star because it's in the Town Square area. A lot of the clientele seems to be walk-in traffic from the shopping area and as a result the lack of a dress code doesn't make you feel like you're eating in an expensive establishment. However, it is a solid restaurant and I would definitely recommend TdB when you're in the mood for all you can eat meat.
