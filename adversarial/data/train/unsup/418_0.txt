This review is going to be short and sweet... just like the surgery that my son had to have today.  Dr. Dean Smith was our anesthesiologist and was above and beyond incredible... both with me and my husband, but most importantly, with my son.  You can tell he's highly respected amongst the staff at PCH as well.\n\nDr. Smith's bedside manner was top notch.  He prepared us for exactly what was going to happen and everything went smoothly.  He spent time with us both pre-surgery and post-surgery and answered our many questions.\n\nOn the bottom of Dr. Smith's business card are the words \"clinical excellence\" and \"compassionate care.\"  He delivered on both and we are extremely grateful.
