Tasty fried chicken. And gizzards. And fries. And waffles. \nEverything we've had here was tasty, and cheap too, which is always nice!\n\nGizzards come a ton to an order, for under $4. BF's a fan, and with the buffalo sauce from the chicken and waffles dish, they're solid: crispy, and served hot.\nChicken and waffles are a dish I've never quite understood, but the sweetness of the thick, fluffy waffle plus the syrup contrasted nicely with the hot chicken and buffalo sauce. Would get this again, and it's a steal at $3.\nTwo-piece \"snack\" comes with some deliciously-seasoned fries and a roll. This is a meal even for my unrestrained appetite, not a \"snack\".\n\nAll in all, this is a solid place for fried chicken. Service is friendly. Location isn't in the best area and the interior isn't impressive, but the flavors sure are. Wish it wasn't so far of a drive for me.
