I tried it out because I was in the parking lot and was already going to get boba from OMG Boba right up the street so why not just try out the new place while im already shopping in the parking lot. Loved the fact they had samples of their house made tea, im not a tea drinker but it actually had good flavor. My mom and i ordered our smoothies and they were ok, tasted like sugar is added or powder because it wasnt the same amount of sweetness throughout the cup. I still prefer my usual place up the street from here.
