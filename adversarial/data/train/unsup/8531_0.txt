Came here at 11:40 last night (Sat) and it wasn't real busy. We had a great time, it's all lit up with black light with hilarious props everywhere. I laughed at almost every hole.\nIt was nice to come in the night, so my eyes didn't have to adjust too much.\nPrice was about right, with student ID or military ID it was 6.50 a person :D score.\n\nWe had a big group ahead of us, but we were having so much fun, we decided not to play through, and just laugh at the paintings of sharks and eels!\n\nThis place would be perfect for groups or adult, groups of kids, families, or even a first date. We can here after ending a work shift at 10:30pm, and before hitting a bar,lol.\n\nI don't know what took me so long to come here, the place has been open a while. Would definitely return. I especially loved that they were open till 1am last night.
