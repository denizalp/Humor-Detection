Lunch $ 21.00 \/ Person - Dinner $ 26.00 \/ Person for AYCE.\n\nRice, rice, rice and a brick of rice in my belly. This place really knows how to give the illusion of a good fish to rice ratio by giving lengthy fish slices, but underneath you meet your doom of impending rice. They compacted the rice so it was thick like a rock.\n\nThe menu selection is not great for AYCE, you have many limits on what and where you can order from. No sashimi, no soft shell crab (only in rolls), no half rolls, all the rolls are large standard size -mostly 8 pieces with the exception of some that are 5 pieces (still the same large size as the 8 pieces, just cut differently.) Not a great place if you want to try a bunch of different rolls. Even the nigiri selection was limited and overall pretty unimpressive.\n\nDon't even think about ordering the ahi poke, seafood salad, salmon skin salad, or any of their salads for that matter. They were crazy weak in flavor\/ fish\/ execution. I wasn't happy with them. At all. \n\nThe only redeeming dishes were:\n1. Dynamite appetizer \n2. Salmon belly nigiri\n3. Baked mussels \n4. Green tea creme brûlée\nAnd that's it...\n\nThe service we received was below average. They weren't even busy! There were 2 other tables dining besides us. We had to ask multiple times to different servers to grab us wasabi and hot sauce. Our waitress was missing, most of our dinner.\n\nIn the end, we left feeling uncomfortably stuffed due to the dense rice expanding. To top it off, it was hot and stuffy in there, and the music made my ears bleed. I agree the interior design was new, modern, beautiful, and spacious, but the overall night club vibe of the restaurant was highly disconcerting. \n\nIn a city that loves a good AYCE sushi joint, this is not the place to go. I would recommend another Korean ran spot that does a better job: Sakana. \n\nNow, with a belly busted from rice, I bid you good luck and good evening.
