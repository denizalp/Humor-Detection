I give the review 1 star because that is the lowest option available.  I found this clinic as a drive by, advertising first visit free.  I went with our new dog, had her a total of 3 days.  She was having problems with her eyes.  They made the appointment and told us she had allergies, gave us a prescription and told me they were the only place to get this medication.  You could not get this at a normal pharmacy.  We paid approximately $70 for this 'free' visit.  A month passed, dog still had problems and could possibly be pregnant.  We took her back they gave us a 'discount' for this visit.  They again diagnosed with allergies, and added an infection.  They advised without harming possible puppies they could not give anything else, and again said only they could give the medication.  Again we paid approximately $70.  We waited another month, and drove her out of town to be seen by a vet that we know and trust.  She did an eye scrape, did not see any mites but said the behavior was still suggesting such.  Gave us 2 months worth, advised to stop medication after 2 weeks of no symptoms.  Her eyes are great, they're better and she's stopped digging them.  The hair has grown back and she's a happy dog.  In short, we paid $150 for not one but two idiots to misdiagnose her.  I had suggested mites to the second vet as I did some research of my own and was told nooo... not even close.  I should have listened to my instincts, both times we walked in there were dogs screaming.  Both times my dog was frigid and nervous.  A good vet makes your animals feel at ease...   Avoid this place.
