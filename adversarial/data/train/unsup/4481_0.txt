I have periodically made purchases at JVF over the years. Most of their merchandise is okay if you don't mind the open bins in a largely unsupervised store and a staff that may be less than helpful.\n\nTheir nuts, however, are to be wary of. More often than not stale nuts are mixed with fresh nuts. That includes peanuts, cashews, almonds and pecans.\n\nOne time I called the Department of Heath because there were insects in the pecans. JVF, who had refused me a refund,was made to get rid of their entire stock according to what the D of H reported to me. I got my refund.\n\nJVF products are found in a number of retail outlets including some supermarkets, sometimes under different labels. Beware. They are just as bad, often quite foul. Check the labels and beware unlabeled or no name packages.\n\nPlanters Peanuts used to represent the ultimate in quality peanuts. It was taken over by JVF a number of years ago and  Planters Peanuts are now less than mediocre.
