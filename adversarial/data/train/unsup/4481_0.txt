The horrible Saturday country music blaring out from the pool from 5pm to 7 pm is extremely annoying ,Loud and unpleasant and if you intend to rest up after a long day exploring Scottsdale and its delights , then think again. Upon repeatedly requesting to stop or lower the irritating volume to the front desk, nothing happened and our irritation mounted. Never again!!!
