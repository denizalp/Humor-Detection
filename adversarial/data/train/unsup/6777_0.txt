Oh, Mermaid's Casino, how I'm fond of thee.\n\nWith your ghetto style little casino with your overly strong drinks that cross between consumable and something similar to Windex, your handing out of plastic beads and raffle tickets, and your location next to a strip club that says ridiculous things like \"Zounds!\" and \"Indeed!\" when the video models take off their tops.\n\nThe real pull is the fried wonderments that they serve.  Fried Oreos and Twinkies?  Those deserve a \"Zounds!\" of their own, and they don't even have to take their tops off to get a response like that.\n\nThe real pull for me, however, are the hot dogs.  Their Nathan's hot dogs.  It's weird: These are hot dogs you can easily buy in a grocery store, but they do something apparently magical to them that make them delicious.  And they're cheap as well.  The truly weird thing is they actually taste really good whether you are sober or inebriated.  You truly can have it all here!  And those employees behind the counter with their clearly bogus little nickname name tags?  Oh, you scamps you, with your witty ways....\n\nPeople are frequently drunk here, whether it's the slot play and comped drinks, the regular stupidly sized yard long drinks, or just wandering in from other venues.  Even their video signs are amusing to watch as the models they have are enjoying their food and beverages WAY too much.  I can't help but doubt their sincerity a little, but their bravado must be applauded.\n\nAs gaudy as the place is, it works for the venue.  Actually, I doubt it would be as entertaining if it actually were refined and trendy.  But seriously, their hot dogs are strangely compelling enough to die for.\n\nWell, perhaps not, but I sometimes get the \"evil eye\" from overly techy patrons in there.  It must be my need to collect as many bead strands as possible.\n\nWe all have our vices....
