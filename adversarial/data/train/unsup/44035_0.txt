I have to say I am a little picky when it comes to fast food burger places.  My husband had been to Five Guys many times and kept asking me to try it.  I finally agreed and was not disappointed.   They burgers are great.  Lean , fresh, meat, not frozen and most importantly NOT SALTY!!   Most burger places rain salt on their burgers, not so at Five Guys.   In fact I even asked for my burger \"not seasoned\" and the cashier explained they do not season their burgers.  You can get as much of any topping for no extra charge.   Customize it any way you like.   The orders always come out accurate.   Fries are great and always come out hot and fresh.   I have been here several times and will continue to go back.   Give them a try.
