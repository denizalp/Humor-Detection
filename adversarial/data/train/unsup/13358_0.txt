Very cool champagne bar located near the forum shops entry within Caesars Palace. This place is really decorated nicely and has an amazing vibe to it. There's a ton of artwork on the walls, a very nicely done bar, tons of drink options and some really chic seating. These guys pride themselves on champagne and essentially blend it with other types of alcohol to make a truly unique cocktail. Their menu is quite substantial and their blending concoctions are very good. This could be a solid 5 star concept\/idea if it weren't for the daytime bartenders, they seemed rather disinterested in what they were doing, maybe they had a rough night the night prior...? Nevertheless, this place is worth giving a shot as the uniqueness of the establishment and cocktails make it difficult to pass up.\n\nPros-\nDecor \nAmbiance \nDrinks \nEclectic options \nArtwork \nDrink mixtures \nChampagne menu \nSeating \nLounge feel \n\nCons-\nDisinterested servers \nFood doesn't start til 6pm on weekends \nOdd location\nSignage outside almost makes it appear closed\nPricey
