My mom had recently just used Flash Plumbing to get her hot water heater replaced. She said they did great work so I went with them when I needed to get a new shower faucet installed. The plumber was super friendly. He replaced then new shower faucet easily with no problems. Overall the price seemed fair after calling around to a few different places. My mom and I will use Flash Plumbing for any plumbing issues from here on out :)
