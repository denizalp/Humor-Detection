I came here with a friend (we are both women). We paid for 90 minutes Thai and Reflexology massages. The woman was very put off that we were there and had not called ten minutes before to confirm we were indeed coming (I had called to make appointments, and I didn't understand that she wanted me to call ten minutes before). She was upset that we wanted to pay with credit, even though they did have a working cc machine. After we paid, we each went into our respective rooms. \nMy massage was awkward, and not even remotely, a real massage. The woman rubbed the same places on my body strangely. There were long pauses where she did not do anything at all except keep her hand on a spot on my back or leg. I thought she was falling asleep. She often leaned her body into inappropriate spots on my body. Suffice to say, she knew nothing about massage. \nI wanted to leave, but I felt bad. I should have cut her off after the first twenty minutes, when it became clear she wasn't really a masseuse.\nThen she demanded a tip. \nA man came out as I was trying to leave and gave me a funny look, like, \"what is a woman doing in here?\" And that's when I realized my suspicions that it was a sexual favor place were pretty much confirmed.\nMy friend's experience: After 50 minutes of a decent massage by another lady (the one who charged the credit cards at the beginning), and paying for 90 minutes, the woman excused herself, left, came back, and told her she could not continue\/finish the massage. She refunded her 30 out of the 100 dollars she paid since she did not do the full 90 minutes, and then she demanded a tip. A cash tip. \nI had to write this in case anyone does what we should have done and checks Yelp before going to this place thinking its an actual massage place.\nIt's dark, creepy (like the above post says), and they are very rude. Plus, it's not really a massage spot, but a tug\/rub place for men who need to pay someone to get them off.
