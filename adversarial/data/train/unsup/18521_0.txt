One of the best bars in Vegas.  You'll get original music and a varied crowd.  Lots of hipsters.  Hipsters lol.\n\nThe drinks are cheap and there's always something to see.  Just east of the downtown casinos so access is easy.  \n\nFirst Friday is like New Year's here.\n\nCheck their website for the latest schedule and arrive 45 mins later than whatever is posted.
