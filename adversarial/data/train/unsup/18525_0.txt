Bachelorette weekend means pole dancing class! I had to book something fun for the bride to be! Plus the classes are quite affordable. Booking on their website was very easy and you pay ahead. Also sign their waiver online before hand. \n\nIntro to pole was for beginners and first timers. But it was tough! It's an hour long class but it went by so fast. We got towels and alcohol to clean all our poles before we start. They also supply knee pads for the floor work. We start with a warm up stretch. Then we get started. The moves were more difficult than we expected. We did each move a few times then did it to music. Then towards the end we separated into two groups and did the moves to music with the instructor. They ask you wear shorts and no leggings. You can bring heels, socks or go barefoot. There are cubes for your things and purses. \n\nOverall it was fun experience for us all. I just wish the moves were more simple for an intro to pole class. It went too quick for us to get all the moves. But the girls had fun and it was great to learn.
