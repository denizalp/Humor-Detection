If I could leave less I would!\nI am so pissed and this is a long story! Going back to October 2017 is when I first became their customer. I was making my payments on time and I only had a limit of $400. In May this year with no prior notice I get a notice from credit One that my payment was declined due to stop payment. I NEVER STOPPED A PAYMENT AND MY B ALANCE WAS ALMOST PAID OFF. When I called their customer service I could hardly understand the person with a really strong Indian accent and after the fifth time I repeated what went on and why I was calling the person unfortunately got cussed out until they put me through to a supervisor! Funny how they understood all the four letter words I was using! The supervisor tols me that my bank stopped the payment. When I called my bank B Of A, they said Credit One had not even attempted to charge my card with my payment! Then I called Credit One back and called them on the game they were playing because I was almost done paying off my balance and then another supervisor told me they didn't have all the digits on my account number so when I was paying online the payments weren't going through!\nI screamed  'WHY DID YOU ALL LET THIS GO ON FOR SO LONG!? WHO WAS IRRESPONSIBLE ME OR YOU FOR NOT ALERTING ME THAT YOU DIDNT HAVE ALL MY INFORMATION BEFORE CHARGING ME WITH INTEREST AND PENALTIES UP TO OVER $1,000! WHO THE FUCK DOES THAT!\"\nI continued to make payments until I tried to make a payment yesterday 7-11-2018 and the person I spoke to informed me that my account had been charged off and sold to someone they don't have the information for and as of 6-28-2018. Even after trying to rectify the situation, no notice was given to me and so as they tried to fuck up my credit  I am doing everything I can to fuck up their reputation! I am telling everyone I know not to be their customer! Also, stop sending our jobs overseas to people that can't understand or speak English! What the hell is wrong with you? All these jobless people willing to work hard like I do and you send opportunity to another country? Hell will freeze over before I am ever a customer with you ever again! #nojusticenopeace!
