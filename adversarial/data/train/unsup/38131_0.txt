I traveled to Pittsburgh on business last week. Traveling from California is not easy. It was my first visit, so I asked a rental car agent if there is any restaurant serving a breakfast ( it was close to noon) or should I get a deli sandwich at a shop in the airport facility.  I was advised to go to Hyatts. He was right about it. Among all the Hyatts I have stayed, this restaurant is by far the best for the price! The space between tables is spacious enough to leave my suitcase. I got a cup of coffee immediately. It was really good. I decided to take a buffet.  Every item was fantastic.   Sausage, pancakes, eggs, Cheese casserole hash brown and bacon were cooked wonderfully. I believe $18 plus sales tax is reasonably priced, especially considering that this restaurant is located in the airport Hyatts.  \nThe service was super good.  My waitress came by many times to make sure everything is OK.  It is very rare to get a good service at restaurants located in the airport hotel.  Travelers at the airport are captive audience. \nI am very happy that I did not grab a cold deli sandwich at the airport convenience store.  After my presentation, my business partner in Pittsburg liked me and invited me to come back soon. I look forward to having a breakfast here again.
