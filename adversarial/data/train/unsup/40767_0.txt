I had dinner at Cantina last weekend. There was a good crowd of people there. We were seated immediately and ordered drinks. The food was awesome! We started off with some Cantina Nachos. For my entree on this visit, I ordered the Salmon al Pastor. Excellente!  I am a service person as well. My waitress was attentive, helpful and friendly. I have been here multiple times and always have the best experience. If you are looking good Mexican food in a great atmosphere, Cantina 1511 is the place.
