This is a tacky wings place. I bet you're excited. Well it's not Hooters. Sorry.\n\nWings are about a dollar each. They have many types of sauce and TVs to watch popular sporting events. \n\nThe wings tasted pretty good. About 40 minutes after consuming them though, it felt like there was a civil war going on inside my stomach. I think the technical term is \"Gut-Rot\". Anyways, it almost beats eating wings at home or at Hooters. \n\nNo great deals to be had. A few rowdy locals, though.
