Even though I've been eating burgers like it's my job lately, I stopped in Paradise Valley Burger Co. for lunch after a recommendation from a client. I was in their neck of the woods, so I took their word. \n\nWell, forget the diet! I'd eat a burger every day if I'd known about this place!\n\nA delicious, buttery burger bun, a juicy, seasoned burger with Havarti cheese and lots of ketchup! MMMMMmmmmm. It was so amazing. I also had a side of sweet potato tots, which quickly disappeared into my belly! I've heard ALL of their burgers are amazing, so I'll have to pay them another visit very soon! Also if you are nearby, check out the local scuba shop, Academy of Scuba!
