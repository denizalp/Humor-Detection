This is a very hard review to do because I like this doctor. To me he is very knowledgeable and always ends with \"do you have any questions?\" which I appreciate. BUT this place over books so badly that the three times we have been there we have waited over an hour JUST to get into the room to wait for the doctor. The wait time is just terrible. The dr. is good, the staff is nice but the wait time is a deal breaker. There is nothing in this office that makes that wait time worthwhile. If you are just starting out with a GI dr. you might want to find one that at least gives your time some respect because this one does not at all. Plan to spend at least two and one half hours here waiting for your turn, seeing the doctor, and finishing. To the scheduler and\/or dr. PLEASE don't over book, please lighten the load. Value OUR time.
