This store doesn't have a super welcoming feeling, and the employees aren't very helpful, but I'm always able to find what I came for - so A-OK in my book.\n\nI usually have a coupon (via my awesome coupon phone app) so that helps with the marked up prices. One thing to note for. Jo-Ann newbs - when you're getting fabric cut, TAKE A NUMBER.  There's a little number thing next to the cutting desk, but no one will direct you there. They'll just let you stand there, stuck on stupid, as numbers come and go without you. I've learned this the hard way, twice. \n\nI'll keep going here, for specific needs only though. It's not a place that I would like to browse around and take my time, but when a tutu needs to be made - I know where to go.
