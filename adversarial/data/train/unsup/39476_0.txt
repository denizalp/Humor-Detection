My children both went here from ages 1 and 2 through the school age program. They were both more than ready socially, emotionally, and academically for kindergarten and continued to excel with homework help after school. Our family was with this school for over 5 years and we were overall happy the entire time. Did we have issues at times? Yes. But they were resolved. \nTo address some other concerns: to be a lead teacher, an associates degree AND a certain number of hours PER YEAR is required in addition to a minimum amount of experience in the field. \nPotty training: per state licensing requirements, a child needs to be fully potty trained to be in the 3+ classroom. That is a state law. I know this school does strongly encourage parents to potty train by age 2 and a half because the child cannot move to the preschool classroom at age 3 if they are not fully potty trained. \nOverall, this is a great preschool. It is MUCH better than the corporate preschools with canned curriculum that teaches children nothing. I am constantly recommending them to friends in the area.
