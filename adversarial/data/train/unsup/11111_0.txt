There are literally thousands of reviews extolling Earl of Sandwich as the finest (and most affordable!) place to have a sandwich on the Strip.\n\nWhile all those reviews are indeed awesome, I'm going to talk about something else entirely: tomato soup.\n\nYes, tomato soup.\n\n(I've said it before and I'll say it again... The easiest way to make a snap judgement about a restaurant is by looking at the quality of its soup.)\n\nThe tomato soup at Earl's is orgasmic.  In fact, it's the best damn tomato soup I've ever had.  It's rich, it's creamy, and it's packed with an incredible depth of tomato flavor.  It's topped with the most perfectly crisped croutons I've ever encountered (not too soft, not too hard).  One spoonful of this tomato soup and I was in foodie heaven ...\n\n... at 8:30am.\n\nYeah, I went to Earl's for breakfast.  Weird, I know -- but please don't hate.  It's actually a great place to go for breakfast.  There are no lines in the morning, and there's plenty of seating to go around.  In fact, it was only like 5 minutes between when I placed my order at the counter and when the little electronic plastic thingy started blinking and vibrating to let me know my food was ready.\n\nWhat to have with tomato soup at 8:30am?  Grilled cheese wasn't on the menu, so I had the next-best thing: the tuna melt.  And, oh my God, this tuna melt was just as orgasmic as the tomato soup.  It was a fresh, delicious roll with piping hot tuna and a layer of beautifully melted cheese.  Is there such thing as tuna bliss?  I think there is, and it's served up at Earl's.\n\nDid I mention that all this food cost less than 10 bucks?\n\nHave I convinced you of Earl's amazingness yet?  If so, get off your butt and walk -- no, RUN -- to the Planet Hollywood hotel as fast as you possibly can and start noshing on some of the best cheap eats in Las Vegas.
