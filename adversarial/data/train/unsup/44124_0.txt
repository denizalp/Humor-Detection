Very very good meal!  You would never expect such an amazing meal at this little place in an older shopping strip.  Everything about it was perfect!  Great service, great atmosphere, and most importantly great food!  I had the pear salad to start.  I am a vegetarian and they didn't have anything for me on the menu and the chef made me a delicious meal of quinoa and cous cous with veggies and pepitas.  I loved every bite of the whole meal.\nMy husband got the scallops and said they were perfect.\nWe shared the fried brownie desert and ....what's better than a brownie sundae??  A FRIED brownie sundae!  great dinner, worth every penny!  We will be back here for sure.
