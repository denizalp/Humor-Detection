We enjoyed eating the seafood crepe and the toulouse crepe. I was afraid that perhaps it would not be enough to eat for dinner before going across the street to see the O show. The portion size on the crepes were more than enough. They were packed with lots of flavor and quite yummy! \n\nI'd definitely come again to grab a crepe the next time I visit Paris!
