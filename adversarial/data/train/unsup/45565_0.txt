I like the frozen cherry limeade, its a good family spot.  They have games while you are waiting. The kids love coming here, its a little pricey but as long as the goons enjoy it I guess we can come in at least once a month.  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  The dtaff seems to move pretty quick so that we are not waiting too long.
