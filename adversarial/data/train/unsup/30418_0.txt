I decided to try this place even thought I had read so many reviews which mostly are not really positive. \nLucky me after shopping at Smith grocery store next door on Friday night. I just want something quick and easy and fortunately on Friday-Saturday night during 5pm-1am Kobe is having their Happy Hours 50% menu.\nI ordered Shrimp fried rice, Bento box with Salmon Teriyaki and 2 nigiri sushi (Salmon and Squid)\nThe portion in each one was decent and I almost want to say \"large\". \n\nAnyone who reviewed this place and said they are overpriced for $20 Bento box must be on something. I would pay for $20 Bento but I was lucky to paid $10 during happy hours. \nMy Shrimp fried rice was tasty and about 2 big bowls of rice. Shrimps were cut up in small pieces but I didn't mind for the price that I paid. I'm not so good at math... So I couldn't tell how many shrimps were in there. Carrot, mushroom, green onions and zucchini were fresh! \n\nMy 2 nigiri were nice size, salmon piece was \"fat\" and squid piece was cut up \"pretty\" like they had made an effort. \n\nThe music not too loud and over all I feel like it was a good value. \n\nTry out for quick and easy meal, specially on Friday and Saturday night
