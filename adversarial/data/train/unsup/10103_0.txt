How often do you feel the need to put something on a t-shirt?  Normally, if the urge hits you, you can do it yourself at home with a Sharpie.  However, if you're looking for something a little more professionally done, and want your message to be more than \"Will Work For Food\", Artik can help you out.\n\nI found out about these guys through one of the members of my Glasgow Rangers-watching organization (Toronto Central Rangers Supporters Club) when we decided we needed to get some t-shirts done up for our organization.  Since I was clueless as to where to start looking and was about to grab a marker and a stack of shirts to take on the task myself, my buddy stepped in and suggested Artik.  Not only do they turn over their orders fairly quickly, they take you through the entire process ensuring that you're good with the quality right the way along.\n\nNot only do they provide T-shirts, but also a wide range of other promotional materials.  Like really wide.  If you've ever found yourself asking the question, \"You know, I need to get the word out about my business, and I think the best way to do that is to have our name on a tape measure, but how would I go about doing that?\", you should give these guys a call.
