Update -\n\nTheir Playstation \"fix\" worked for TWO uses. TWO. I only use the Playstation for a bluray player so it took me beyond their 30 day window to find out. The first DVD played throughout but turned off at the end (was already beyond the 30 days), second played for about half an hour then shut off again. I called and they gave me the \"we cover for 30 days\" bit. I send these guys customer after customer after customer at work and that is their answer. I understand rules, but rules are made to be flexed around a bit, they would have only been out bench time to look at it. It obviously wasn't done right the first time. I should have just bought a new Playstation the first time and saved my money on a worthless bandaid of a fix. After the problems with never receiving a phone call when it was done and being told that my 30 day guarantee started the day they finished the device even though I picked it up over a week after, I will not be back.
