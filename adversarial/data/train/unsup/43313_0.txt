This store is a combo restaurant with KFC. I purchased a $5.00 meal deal and they charged $5.99 for that meal, when I brought it to their attention they said that is the price. I took the meal and went home and went to the KFC survey site and checked to see if they changed the cost of the $5.00 meal deal and found they were still advertising it to be $5.00, I filled out the survey form and complained about the service and cost. I left my phone number and email address so they could talk to me about the problem and after more than 3 weeks I haven't heard a thing from them.\n\n       I  WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS RESTAURANT                       \n                                         AGAIN !!!
