I was hoping to find a little local coffee shop in Old Montreal, but kept getting distracted by the great shops.  While walking towards the Chinatown area we spotted Presse Café with lots of seating and wi-fi and decided to stop for a break.\n\nThere's a great variety of drinks on their menu, including orange iced tea and a mint iced tea.  I almost ordered something interesting, but my eyes wandered to the pastry case and I realized I needed a coffee to go with my dessert.  I tried one of the flavoured coffees (which I usually steer away from) and was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  \n\nI was speechless when I tasted their apple brick - a mile-high soft and spongy cake filled with lots of goodies (apples, caramel, brown sugar, carrots, raisins) and served with whipped cream.  I could go a second helping right now.\n\nOther customers ordered sandwiches, wraps and crepes and they all looked delicious.\n\nClean, very plain décor.  No complaints about the service.  Great patio.
