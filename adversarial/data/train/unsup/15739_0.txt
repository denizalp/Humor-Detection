I've been to this location a few times and it's been a solid 4 stars in my 'fast food sandwich' category. Compared to other sandwich places, this one gets a 4. For a small location, they do have a few tables for people to eat in, if needed. This has helped me on a rainy day before and I'm appreciative. The fun names for the sandwiches and the back stories is a fun twist. I do wish that they would branch out a bit on their flavors. Get a little creative with the sandwich flavors (veggie and non veggie), and not just creative names. Most of the sandwiches here are also available at other places. My last sandwich was full of fresh crunchy vegetables and was pretty darn good. Switch up your sauces and toppings for some 'promotional' sandwiches. It's fun for the customer to mix it up a bit.
