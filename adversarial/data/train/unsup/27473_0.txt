I've gone to this Kal Tire after another shop messed up my install and now I've gone back again to them for Summer Tires. I had my studded tires on and wanted to desperately get some summers put on ... It's June! Ben and his team at Kal Tire were and have always been awesome. I live 30 KM away from this Kal Tire but I will def drive out this way for the service they offer. In the waiting area they have popcorn and magazines that I liked. I called in the morning and though they were swamped they fit me in.  Anyways 5 stars for this Kal Tire!  \n\nTip: This is the shop next to Fitz Flooring close to Southland not the one next to Chinook Centre.
