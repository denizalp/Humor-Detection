Great line from a friend.....\"ROK is like high school. You have the cool kids (XS, TAO) then you have the kids who just like a good time (ROK)\" I'm bias since every time I go, its better and better. Just give it a try, ask for CHAD SOLIS or CRAIG KEENAN, they will make it all right. \n\nPeople judge this place before even walking in, small yes, bottle service yes, packed, yes, good music, yes...will cost you $300-$400 less to go there YES. Will you have a hangover, sore throat, bloodshot eyes........yeah, same thing you will have anywhere you go on the strip
