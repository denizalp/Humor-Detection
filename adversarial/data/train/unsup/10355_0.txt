Where do I start. If I could give zero stars I would. A sales rep from this store literally turned to my brother and said \"You're a nobody, get out of here.\".....let me provide some context. Before going into this sad excuse for a luxury retail locale we went to Versace- excellent service, wonderful products, 6k well spent. Louis Vuitton followed- again, excellent service and wonderful products, another 6k well spent. High on the glorious exhilaration spurred by our shopping excursion we decided to continue into Tom Ford. Having a huge amount of budget left we hoped to load up on many pieces we had been scoping over the past few months, and what better place to spend extravagantly on luxurious clothes and accessories than Vegas? I really pushed for going into Tom Ford as I wanted my brothers to check it out, and was hoping for some goodies myself. What a mistake I made. \n\nUpon entering we were instantly greeted with hostility by an ill educated, incompetent, trashy associate. He began berating my younger brother, saying he didn't have money to be in there. Really buddy? Is that how you were trained? Is that how Tom Ford trains its employees? Pathetic. \n\nI am disgusted and appalled, and can only hope that piece of scum got fired. My family and I go to Vegas every season to shop and sadly Tom Ford will NOT be getting our business. I honestly feel bad for the other employees of the store, who were clearly embarrassed and tried to silence the idiot. But alas, damage done.
