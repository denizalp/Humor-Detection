I loved this bar.\n\nWe hit up Scottsdale for a little anniversary get-away and made a plan to stop in here because of all the great reviews.\n\nI was completely floored to find my absolute favorite wine - ever - listed on the menu, and on happy hour to boot! A hard to find vino, Domaine Saint Vincent - if you like sparkling, and this is on the menu, GET IT.\n\nWe ended up being pretty alone at the bar for a while and really enjoyed chatting with Roger, the bartender on duty. Since we settled in at the bar for a bit, we also enjoyed the homemade Cracker Jax corn, which was sweet, salty, and way better than the stuff in the box.\n\nCool vibe, nice people, quality selection.
