We go to this park often, sometimes with an org we love which provides mobile food, drinks, snacks, clothing, hygiene products, and pet supplies to the less fortunate. Since the org only hits the park every month or so - they vary stationary and mobile distributions around the Valley bi-weekly - Scott and I have been stopping by during the scorching hot days with supplies we can gather. \n\nSince we've been going for about a year now, we know a lot of our regulars, and they come to us when they see us rolling coolers and suitcases into the park. The entrance is close to the light rail, and Mill Avenue. There's a playground, splash pad, the \"lake\" and paved paths to walk\/run. \n\nThroughout the year many festivals and events are held here (Aloha, food fests, musical jams, Ironman Triathlon swimmers use the lake) and you can rent equipment to play on the lake if you choose. \n\nHonestly, we really only come here to serve and lend a hand and a cold drink to our neighbors in need. We've circumnavigated the park & Mill Avenue with supplies enough to like this place, and will continue to help as long as we are able.\n\n* heed Joyce W's tip & bring the bug spray *
