Overall not a bad experience but there are better AYCE places in Vegas. Dinner is 25 per person and includes everything (despite the menu saying there are limitations). \n\nStaff is very friendly and was quick to make sure we always had good ordered. It wasn't very busy though so I don't know what a busy weekend night would be like. \n\nThe options were pretty great, more appetizer and dessert options than any other AYCE place I've been to.  Sadly the major exception to this is of course the rolls. More than 75% of the rolls had imitation crab (many had crab in and on them). A large number of rolls had the same garlic ponzu sauce. The overall diversity was pretty lacking. \n\nThe quality of the rolls and fish were good however, even if they were pretty similar. I was really excited to see that they had honey toast for dessert but was really disappointed when the bread was actually nothing more than a cheap dinner roll that had been toasted. Fortunately it was still tasty (I'm not sure how you could mess up honey toast...). \n\nThe inside was very clean and nicely decorated. I'm not sure id go back, but not because it isn't good, we just have another few spots in town we prefer.
