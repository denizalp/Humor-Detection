I am not the type of person to give a bad review but we are NOT happy with our doctor's service or communication and will be switching to another pediatric dentist.\n\nIn a nutshell, 4 months ago we brought our 3 1\/2 yr old girl to get some cavities filled.  Yes, we brush her teeth 2 times a day, no soda, little candy, etc... Anyway, naturally, she was a little frightened and was crying. The doctor was really short with us and was really pushing for sedation; we declined and then he suggested rescheduling when she was older as not to 'traumatize her'. We were concerned that her cavities would get worse and he said, 'don't worry about it, she can go another 6 months and still be ok'... in other words, move along... or so it felt. Well, we waited 4 months then rescheduled.\n\nThis time around, he coaxed us into sedation by stating, 'she now needs a partial root canal in her back tooth' and asked us if we wanted a filling or a cap? \"What?!?!?\" We asked what the difference was between the two and BTW - getting information from this particular doctor is literally like pulling teeth (pun intended)  - anyway, he sparsely explained, 'caps last longer and fillings fall out after 4 years' (which is about how long she'd need that tooth anyway). So, uncertain and put on the spot, we approve the cap, then our daughter receives a partial root canal, her tooth shaved down, and a nice big stainless steel cap that she'll have till 8 or 9 years of age. Huh? Thanks a lot.\n\nWe left the office confused, angry, and feeling like just another number in Anthem's system. Maybe this doctor should consider doing dentistry for the prison system, his patients would be less affected by his apathetic demeanor. In all fairness, perhaps it's not Anthem's fault entirely, but more this particular doctor... I won't say his name but it does rhyme with rocks.
