I'm generally not one to frequent amusement parks, but I figured I ought to throw in my two cents about one of the largest in Canada.\n\nPros:\n\n- Ride quality and variety is excellent - despite being there from open until close, we barely scratched the surface of what Wonderland offers.\n- Lots of signage on each ride, which includes \"Thrill Level\" and any related warnings.\n- A good way to get over fears (heights, being upside-down, etc.).\n\nCons:\n\n- \"Expensive\" doesn't even scratch the surface; perhaps \"exorbitant\" is more fitting. From admission to locker rentals to food and drink, be prepared to spent a few hundred dollars for a day's worth of fun. I have no idea how families of 3 or more manage to afford admission outside of season passes.\n- Agonizingly long lineups for the vast majority of rides, especially in the blazing hot sun, are not particularly enjoyable.\n- Filthy washrooms. I visited a number of them throughout the day, and not once did I see them in any acceptable state of cleanliness. I also did not see any cleaning staff the entire time. I realize that this place sees thousands of people on a regular basis, but this is not an excuse for the stinking cesspools that they call washrooms.\n\nTips:\n\n- If you don't live nearby, I would advise planning your entire day around a visit to Wonderland - from open to close. Get in about 30 minutes before it opens to get a decent parking spot and to avoid massive lineups.\n- If you do live nearby, definitely opt for the season pass (duh).\n- Wear comfortable clothing and footwear - it's a big park, so be prepared to do a fair amount of walking.\n- Smuggle in food and water (be cautious; they do check bags at the entrance).\n- Re-hydrate at least every hour, and reapply sunblock throughout the day. We saw a disproportionate number of dried-out and sunburned folks in pure misery.\n- For the love of god, please leave toddlers\/infants\/children too young (or scared) to go on rides at home. I lost count of the number of screaming\/tantrum-throwing spawn after an hour, and they did not make a positive contribution to anyone's day.
