ME: (down on one knee)\nBackyard Taco.......I want you inside of me, and I want to be inside of you. I have never fell in love so deeply with a taco place. I don't want you to see any other people and I want to be exclusive. I will marry you right now on the spot if you let me.  I won't care what other people say about our love, we can make this work. \nAs I sat and gazed into my carne asada taco's, loving every bite that went into my mouth, I looked up at the menu. \"I wonder if I could put that family pack away myself?\"  \nI may have to wait until our 2-3rd date. I don't want to seem like a pig.\nI swear as of this day, Backyard Taco......I pledge my love and 100% devotion to you. I will not stray EVER from the love I have for you.  No more Joyride, no more LuLu's and I swear I will never see Los Fav's ever again. It's just you and me.......forever.    One more thing........can I get a part time job here? You can pay me in taco's.
