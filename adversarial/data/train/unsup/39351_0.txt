Came by on a weekday for a late lunch for 2 around 2pm and surprisingly there was still a 1 hr wait. As we came close to our 1 hr mark we came by the restaurant again to check on our wait in line and saw 5 empty tables. I'm not sure if this is a marketing strategy or not but that's besides the point. We ordered the Buffalo blast to start and it was actually pretty good. Deep fried chicken skin with shredded chicken stuffing. I feel as though the stuffing could have been better if marinated differently or somehow changed because it felt like mush. The skin however was deep fried well and crispy. As an entree I ordered the Cajun jambalaya and I didn't finish it. My first taste of the pasta gave me a sense of disgust as it had the texture as if it melted in you mouth or it could have possibly been undercooked fresh pasta which tasted really 'dough-y'. I won't be coming here a second time.
