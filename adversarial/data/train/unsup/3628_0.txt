Eating my complimentary garlic black pepper edamame and waiting for Sesame Snow Ice to arrive on a hot summer day.\n\nWelcome Cha Me Cha new Markham location! \n\nSpacious with simple decorations. A great place to hang out with friends and enjoy some Taiwanese drinks, snacks and dessert!\n\nFlavor snow ice The Ugly Duckling ($6.99) is huge. I should have asked my Yelp friend to join me. Great for sharing! And I love Sesame!!!\n\nWhile I tried to finish my dessert all by myself, I secretly pray that it is zero calories... and some dessert is meant to be share...\n\nService though a little awkward! Hard to get any attention until you really waved them down when it was not even too busy. And I put down a $20 for my $7.90 bill, the waitress asked me if I need any change?!
