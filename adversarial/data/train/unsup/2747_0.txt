Today's extravaganza for my boss's vehicle involved having two keys reprogrammed.  After my last experience at Audi of Charlotte on Independence Blvd., I was determined to begin a working relationship with the new Hendrick Audi of Northlake, so I called them.\n  \nI will say that my initial telephone conversation didn't leave me feeling like today's experience was going to be any different than what I've come to expect from Audi of Charlotte, but once I arrived and met Gary Burke (the Service Manager) my visit began to take a serious upswing.  \n\nThey walk you all around their very nice dealership and show you where the refreshments and restrooms are.  They show you the three separate waiting areas (on three different floors) which are all comfortable, spacious and clean with free wi-fi so getting your work done while waiting at their dealership seems plausible.  I personally liked that there's a separate children's area with a door as I'm not a fan of kids and I don't want to be forced to sit with them while I wait for my services to be completed. \n \nGary went on to tell me that he'd been in the auto service industry for over 20 years and that they hired 7 \"Master\" mechanics when they filled their mechanic positions; that there aren't any \"newbie\" mechanics even working there, which I appreciate.  My thoughts are to let the \"newbie mechanics\" go learn over at Ford or Chevy  :-)\n\nWhen they came to tell me the vehicle was finished, they said \"it's being washed right now...\" which delighted me!  I think that all high end dealerships should have an onsite car wash and wash your vehicle every single time it leaves their lot.  It's always such a perk to me to have the mechanics' fingerprints washed off of the vehicle before they hand it back to me :-)  This certainly isn't the experience you have at Audi of Charlotte and for that I am SO Grateful  :-)  I was actually able to leave today feeling confident and like we'd started what I think could be a long term, happy working relationship!\n\nIn conclusion:  I really feel like I've made a smart decision in moving my bosses Audi services to Audi of Northlake.  Sure it's further out of my way, but it's so very worth the drive to exit 19A  :-)
