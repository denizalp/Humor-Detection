Very cool spot. I mean who doesn't like sitting by the pool, listening to great music, sipping on some drinks with some fabulous friends? Plus the people watching alone was worth it. Oh and don't let me forget about the $10 unlimited mimosa special they have on Saturdays from either 10-2 or 11-2. Either way it is worth. However, if you want the best damn pina colada ever, get one from here. They coat the rim of the glass with honey and roasted coconut and they are strong! Wow! Momma likes!!! This will be a definite go to spot throughout the summer.\n\nA few tips -\nFirst the bathrooms are really dark so ladies be careful if going in alone.\nSecond - get there early or you will be SOL. It cost a nice penny to sit on the chairs that have an umbrella. ( I believe someone told me it was $300 for the Cabana and like $150 for the chairs with the umbrella. Are you kidding me?)\nThird- Do not bring your drink in the pool unless you are sitting poolside. They frown upon that as they don't want pina colada and beer floating in the water ( I can see that)\n\nOtherwise its a good spot!
