Visited on Saturday 8-27-16 around 6PM.  This restaurant is located in the same building as Bachi Burger on Windmill.  \n\nI ordered tokotsu shio ramen and added corn and the total was about $12.  This is more than I normally like to pay for ramen.  Also it took about 25 minutes to arrive, which is longer than I normally like to wait.  GOOD LORD I am just UN-PLEASE-ABLE aren't I?\n\nThe noodles were absolutely perfect and the broth was delicious. My problem with this ramen is the chasu.  \n\nPerhaps I have been spoiled by Sora's thick and tender chasu....or by Monta's huge chasu...or Fukumimi's velvety chasu.  But this place's chasu was bad.  It was paper-thin and looked like they threw it on the grill right before they served it.   It was oddly sweet and was more fat than meat.  I did not enjoy it.  \n\nThis place will cure your ramen cravings but if you're a chasu snob like me you might not like theirs.
