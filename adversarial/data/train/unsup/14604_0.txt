This was my second time visiting OMB. The first time, my coworkers birthday. Second, my fianc√© and I met with friends. I'm so happy this place is dog friendly. \n\nWarming!!! Do not bring your animal inside!!! The staff will get super nasty!!! They snapped at my former boss and she was super embarrassed!!! \n\nPlease note. Everyone is nice--just keep your fur friends outside lol. I enjoyed my visits here. Great for large groups, wine lovers, beer connoisseurs, engagement parties, Yoga and more. I brought my  7month old German Shepard and he got plenty of attention\n\nSide note: it's ok to bring you, children.\n\nGreat place to meet after work, or a Sunday evening. I wish they had cider beer (grr) still love this place!
