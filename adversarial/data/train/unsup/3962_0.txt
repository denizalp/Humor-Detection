Best view of the lake of dreams.\n\nThis is a little hard to find.. you have to go to the main registration area at the Wynn, and go through the doors to the patio. Basically the show runs every 30 minutes at night. On off days the bar closes around 10:30pm. They have an incredibly limited drink menu. As far as I know there is no food here, just libations. After the bar closed, they didn't really kick anyone out. Maybe they just wait until you kick yourself out. \n\n3 stars because the show isn't really worth seeing, and waiting 30 minute for something that is about 2 minutes long is a waste of time, even though it is technically free.
