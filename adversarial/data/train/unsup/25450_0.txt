We went here for a date night.  It was disappointing how crowded the tables were. When we are going to be spending a lot of money on dinner, we would expect to be a little farther away from other people. \nThe bread they give you before your meal is a big onion roll.  It has dehydrated onion pieces browned on top. They serve it with a pretty piped ruffle of whipped butter.\nThe steak was nothing special. The portions are far to big for me so I did not order a steak. My boyfriend got the new york strip and I just had a few bites of his ( we didn't finish the steak between the two of us).  It was ok, I was hoping that it would be similar to Mastro's since they are both part of Landry's, it was not nearly as good though.  \nI got the truffle mashed cauliflower and the Bacon onion mac and cheese.  I was disappointed in the mac. ( For one the server told us they use powered onion in it- How gross and cheap of them.) It also just tasted like bar food. The sauce was gritty and very orange and not a lot of flavor. The bacon pieces were very crisp though, so that was good. \nThe mashed truffle cauliflower was alright, other than the crusted Parmesan pieces on top it didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  Truffle is usually pretty overpowering.   It was good when mixed with all of the juices from the steak though. \nThey had a classic dessert menu,  souffles, chocolate cake, cheese cake, berries and cream etc. \nI do not like chocolate or cheesecake though so we opted to go elsewhere for dessert. \nWe probably will not go back here, it definitely was not worth the money or the drive. There are several other places that offer much better food and experience.
