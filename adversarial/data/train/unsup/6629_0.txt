Ok where shall I start? It's 1135. There is no audible music, absolutely no ambiance, and there is a dog (possibly a puppy) running around. I do like dogs but they are a lot like babies... I cannot think of a situation in which it is proper for them to be in a bar (and this is not the first time I have encountered a dog in here) Also the place just kinda looks unfinished. Maybe it's just not my thing.  Pseudo hipster vibe with a good selection of beer. Meh
