Very lacklustre food. I remember coming here a few years ago and was wowed by the spices that literally danced off your palate. No more.\nOur party of four was seated promptly. Unlike other reviewers, we received our food rather quickly. We ordered the Vegetarian Platter and the Bahlen Platter. Food was cold. The veggies lacked spice and spices. The meats were stale and uninspiring. Everything was overly salted - but still lacked flavour. \nThe washroom was really dirty and there were scraps of food on the floor of the dining room. \nI will not be back.
