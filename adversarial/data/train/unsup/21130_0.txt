I came here very excited to order my favorite vietnamese soup called Hu Tieu..  I asked them to include meatballs and the server told me \"No, does not come with meatball\" .. Ok.. not the end of the world. The soup came, it was delicious and I was almost done when suddenly I saw a very bright blue, thin, rubber band swimming in my noodles!  YUM! :-(  My husband got the waiters attention and we showed him the rubber band. He did not apologize, but reacted upset and immediately started speaking loudly to the other staff and then looked to my husband and asked if I wanted a new bowl. I did NOT want a new bowl.. I had immediately lost my appetite. But to my surprise when we went to check out, they did not give us the soup for a discount or even offer a slight apology! Later, when I told the story to my friends.. I was informed a similar situation had happened to them also, except I should be glad It was only a rubber band, because they found a cigarette in their soup!
