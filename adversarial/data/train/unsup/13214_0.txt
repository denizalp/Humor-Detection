These guys saved my life!!!\nI was staying at a friends place in Vegas and had gotten locked out of the place. Like a normal person I was going to wait for someone to bring a spare key, but my drunk idiot friend decided he couldn't wait and kicked in the front door!!! \nI was freaking out because it was 5 am, I'm not from Vegas so I wouldn't know who to call, and the place was not even mine. Luckily I came here on Yelp and came across Iconic Construction. I was going to leave a message and would hopefully hear back later at a reasonable hour, but I was surprised when someone actually answered the phone. I think they could hear the stress in my voice, because someone was at my door in 30 mins!!! \nJaime was the one that came out, and he assured me that he could fix the door and the owners wouldn't be able to tell that anything happened. And he was right!!! He fixed the lock, the door frame, sanded and repainted everything all before any of my friends woke up. The best part was he gave me such a great deal for it, and as a college student there was no way I could afford to pay an arm and a leg. \nWhen he was all done, I couldn't even tell there was any damage, he really did a great job!!! If you live in Vegas and need something fixed for a great price and excellent quality I would recommend Iconic Construction. I created this Yelp account just so I could comment on what a great job they did!!!
