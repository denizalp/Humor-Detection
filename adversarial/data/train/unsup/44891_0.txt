Came here with excitement to try this new bingsu place in Scarborough because of the hype. Honestly, not worth the hype at all. Ambience of the place is cute and cozy. Love their marble finish table top and the decorations. Staff is friendly and welcoming. You have to place your order with the cashier and then find your own seat. \n\nOrdered the Injeolmi bingsu because I loved it at CUPS. I was very disappointed with the flavouring of this one compared to cups because of the lack of condensed milk and flavour in general. However, I do like the fact that you can really taste the milk in the bingsu. I felt like they should of layered their toppings to distribute the flavour evenly through every bite. The bowl is an awkward size as it is quite big for a single person but too small to share ($8.55 one size only). \n\nDidn't have to wait to get seated but had to wait over 20 minutes to get our bingsu. The place became busier closer to 9:30pm. Overall, it was just mediocre.
