When I think of Downtown Las Vegas, I think of art and music. Location is ghetto but walking through the graffiti art gallery made me realize how underrated the art culture is in Vegas. \n\nJust walk around and look at all the artwork, it's free! You can find artwork in every corner. Be mindful that there are some weirdos walking around. Luckily I have a pepper spray with me at all times plus was fully aware of my surroundings. Parking is kind of tricky in the area but you will find free parking here and there.\n\nToo dope. Go around 2-4PM, you get the perfect lighting!
