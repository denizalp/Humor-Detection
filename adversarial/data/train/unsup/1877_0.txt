I work at the Capitol so this place is not too far.  Co-worker and I came to this place to give them a try.  \n\nThe location was small but clean.  Very well decorated.  The workers were fast, friendly, and kind.  \n\nI ordered a half of a chicken salad sub, and a strawberry watermelon fruit cut.  Both was amazing and delicious.  Decent quality and decent price.  \n\nOverall excellent experience, will definitely be back someday!
