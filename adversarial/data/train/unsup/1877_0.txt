The Foundation Room?  What is this enigmatic place??\n\nThe question shouldn't be what is this place rather, why haven't I Yelped about this place earlier.\n\nRadiant in character in a dim, intimate setting is how I can best describe the Foundation Room.  This mystical lounge is perched high atop the Mandalay Bay hotel.  \n\nThere's more to the Mandalay Bay than Rum Jungle (gag!) you ask?  \nYes, there is and it's called the Foundation Room.  And once you've experienced it you'll find yourself setting the bar high for any other lounge in comparison.\n\nWe love taking our out of town guests here to experience all that is mysterious and exotic about the seven secluded rooms and main lounge area.  The carpeted interior make it easy on the feet when you want to get up and dance, the plush furniture will make you feel like you are truly somewhere exclusive and the alluring decor will have you forget you are in Vegas and feel as if you're in some other worldy place.\n\nVIP service here is nothing short than exemplary and so is the music.  See Dimitri, he is the most outstanding head host in all of Vegas.
