Route 51 is like war. It's hell. \n\nI can tell you that being brave, patient and STAYING IN YOUR LANE YOU IDIOT...is worth it to get to this fantastic oasis of BBQ bliss. \n\nIt's an adventure that I hype myself up for quite a few times a year. Does this adventure end in the slaying of a dragon or saving a princess? Of course not! It ends in pulled pork and chicken, cheese steaks topped with jalape√±os, chili cheese fresh cut French fries and sides a plenty. \n\nEnjoy and get two sandwiches, because NOT eating one on the drive home is just self inflicted torture. You deserve better.
