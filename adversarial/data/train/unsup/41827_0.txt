This was my girlfriend and I first time trying  place. The waitress was nice and friendly but the food was not as good as we were hoping for we ordered the pot roast which wasn't half bad and the the chicken fried chicken was nothing special and as for the baked potato it was terrible sent it back once because it was burnt and dry and and the second was just as bad.maybe they were just having a off day might try it again sometime
