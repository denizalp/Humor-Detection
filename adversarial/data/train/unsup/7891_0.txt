1 star for the room which was stylish, comfy and clean. However, this was the worst hotel as far as service that I have ever stayed in! None of the employees are willing to provide assistance. It seemed like they just wanted to do the very minimum to get by and complete their shift. Also, the pool was freezing (even in the 90 degree weather) and closes too early. \n\nWe were going to take the shuttle to the strip on the first day but noticed a sign that read \"7 passenger maximum\"; there were already more than 7 people in line, so we walked over to the Taxi line. A member of the bell staff told us the shuttle actually could hold 20 people, so we left our spot in the taxi line only to find out from the shuttle driver that the car indeed only holds 7 passengers. \n\nLater on that day, we were at the pool trying to rent a day bed. We asked a guy that was in the pool staff uniform and he told us we had to ask another guy. When we asked that employee about it he said he would help us in a few min. We waited 15 min for him while he was chatting with some other guests and eventually just took a vacant day bed where we hung out for 20 min for a waiter to come by to get our drink order..... no one ever came by. \n\nThe next evening, I called \"In Room Dining\". The person that answered the phone, put me on hold for 5 min upon answering without asking permission first. When she got back on the phone, she abruptly told me that the food would take over an hour to arrive to my room. She came across as irritated when I was asking her about cheese options for the burger. The food arrived in 15 min while I was in the shower. \n\nWhen I checked in a few days prior, I asked the employee at the front desk how I would go about printing, scanning, and emailing some documents for work. He said the only way to do this was to use the \"Business Center\". In the morning, just before checkout, we paid $20 to use the center for just enough time to print, scan and email 4 pieces of paper. The cost was $22. Upon checking out, the lady told my boyfriend that the front desk could have taken care of any computer services for free. We walk out to get the bell staff to hold our luggage while we eat brunch and gamble before our flight. A member of the bell staff asks us \" how are you doing today\". We answer \"Not good at all\" his reply is \"Oh\". We end up taking our bags and spending the rest of our time in Vegas at another hotel. I was not about to give this establishment one more dollar. \n\nThis is supposed to be \"rock star\" service???  Everyone is better off staying somewhere where they are thankful for your business and treat every guest with a little kindness.
