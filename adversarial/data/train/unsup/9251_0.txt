When I first walked into Stoney's North Forty, I thought I walked into a hamster cage, not a restaurant. While I could have done without the wood chips scattered throughout the floor of North Forty, the food and service was actually quite good! This came as a surprise to me because this place was completely empty! \n\nEven though I don't dance (I'm as white as they come) and I hate country music (okay; maybe I'm NOT as white as they come), I felt comfortable eating inside of North Forty. With the big dance floor in the middle of the restaurant, I envisioned how rednecks must be having the time of their lives on Friday and Saturday nights. With FREE dance lessons and occasional FREE live events (American Idol's Bo Bice, baby!), Stoney's North Forty is a white people paradise.\n\nThe food itself at North Forty was pretty good. From the smell emanating from the restaurant you could tell they use a BBQ smoker. The portions that you receive for the price are about what you would expect. I didn't really care for the coleslaw (made with horseradish and slimy), but the philly cheese steak was big, tasty, and made me hot in the pants. Don't expect extraordinary eats at North Forty, but there is a little something for everyone. Did I mention they have their own homemade barbecue sauces? YEE HAW, PARDNER!\n\nIf you take away the poop sprayed all over one of the ladies room toilets and the wood chips on the floor (sorry to repeat myself; the wood chips aren't only tacky but how do you sweep around them? If they sweep...), Stoney's North Forty would have earned a four star rating. For lack of a more creative finish; go to Stoney's, cowboy.
