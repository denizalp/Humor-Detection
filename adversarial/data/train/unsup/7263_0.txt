Came here for a work lunch.. I usually try to eat really healthy during the week so I can pig out during the weekend so I ordered the salad with chicken with dressing on the side. To my surprise the chicken was cooked amazingly week; Flavourful and really juicy. So the salad was really good for an all day breakfast place. \n\nHowever, for a rush time like lunch hour on a weekday the dishes took about 40 mins to come and we were only a group of 3. I guess the servers knew we were a little annoyed as we were crunched for time they offered to discount the bill as they took forever. \n\nThe service was nice and the decor was very nice and clean as it was newly opened but don't think this would be my top choice of restaurants for lunch.
