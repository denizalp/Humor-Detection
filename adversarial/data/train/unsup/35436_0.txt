I just visited there tonight and waited 9 minutes in the drive thru before someone took my order and another 5 before I received it. There were only two other cars in front of me too. On top of that, I received the wrong cookie that I ordered. Total disappointment. The drink tasted yummy, but 5 stars is more than just a good drink. Hopefully next time I go, I'll have a better experience.
