Not my favorite Chipotle.  Line out the door consistently and the run out of basic ingredients daily.  I got maybe 8 pieces of chopped lettuce on top of my tacos because it was the last in the container, even though I could spot a fresh one behind them.  My tacos are always pretty soggy, too, from the beans.  However, food tastes as good as any Chipotle and I haven't had any problems with the employees... they've never been rude. I just wish they did a better job keeping things stocked!
