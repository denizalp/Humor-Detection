My husband and I stopped by last night during a rainy Sat night. We live in the West Valley and came down town for a date night. The ice cream was really good, very elevated flavors, even though some were a bit off the wall. I appreciated the funny names, but it was hard to tell what they were without asking about almost every one. (Maleficent = vanilla ice cream colored blue\/green with white chocolate chips, Arizona Sunrise = orange creamciscle, Hopeless Romantic = red velvet ice cream with cream cheese swirl). This wouldn't have been a problem, except the guy working the counter was SUPER rude. He berated the poor woman on front of me, not once but twice, because he said she was talking too low, even though the freezer case was humming super loud and he had music playing from a radio behind him. When it was my turn, I asked for two samples because I had pretty much figured out the other flavors based on questions the other customers had asked.  He told me he would have to \"cut me off\" at two samples. I told him that was fine because that's all I asked for. The honey lavender was good, lots of lavender, which I thought was just a bit much. I didn't care for the Funky Monkey - it had a weird tasting banana flavor to it. I practically shouted my order at him so he could hear me. It was all super awkward and uncomfortable. I won't be going back any time soon, even though the flavors we chose were super tasty (Cookie Monster, mint and Cocoa Puffs). Sometimes you can't make up for customer service.
