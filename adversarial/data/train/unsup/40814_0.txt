I really like the vibe of this place, the instructors are super fun and the ambiance is welcoming. They have a great selection of classes and some really unique ideas, HOWEVER...for somebody who's in fairly decent shape I would not call these classes a hard workout.  First they need to be an hour not 45 min since almost 20 full minutes are spent stretching and warming up at the beginning and end of each class.  If they could extend the class times and find a way to really amp up the workout I would spend more time there.  If you're looking for something fun and low impact this place is great, for the hard core I think you'll be disappointed.
