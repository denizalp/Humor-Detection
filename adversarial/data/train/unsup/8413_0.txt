Diabetes and cholesterol in one bite. They don't exaggerate on the bacon they serve. Not as good as everyone says it is. The man candy that everyone reviews about isn't amazing. It gets tiring fast after two bites. And the bacon drinks are horrible. I love bacon, but damn for the first time there are things that bacon doesn't go with.
