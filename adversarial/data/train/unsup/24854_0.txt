So I just finished with first month, courtesy of Groupon for $19. First three weeks I was going there every night and tried to get myself to love it. Well, I don't hate it, but I think bikram yoga is not for me. I can't get over the idea of a guy who made billions on something spiritual, over 400o years old. But that is whole another story.\n\nThe studio is nice looking. I also noticed the carpet and wondered why the hell is there a carpet!!! So I bought the largest towel possible and at least never had to touch it. Smell in the room is also pretty nasty. And with the time it just started to bug me more and more. \n\nI loved most of the teachers I had, Kevin, Julie, Stella and Steve. They were guiding us through postures all in nice subtle voice and pace. Only one I didn't like was Robert. Pace was ok, but he has such hard annoying voice, talks 100mph, and walks like a solider through the room. Easy man, it's yoga, not a boot camp!!! \n\nSo overall I had a good experience there. But it is not really close to me so probably I won't be coming back there. But if you're bikram fan and it's close by, go for it. Good luck!
