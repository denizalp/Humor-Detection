My mom and saw that pulled noodles were offered here and couldn't resist trying it out. The place is pretty small so come early or be prepared to wait for a table. \n\nWhen you first walk in, here's usually a guy creating pulled noodles, slapping the dough on the table and pulling and pulling until he has tons of strands of individual noodles. If you're waiting for a table, at least you have some entertainment. \n\nI ordered the beef brisket pulled noodle. Lots of soft, tender pieces of beef brisket in a flavourful broth. The noodles were pretty ok - thin with a slightly chewy texture. My mom ordered the fried chicken pulled noodle. The chicken is fried and sliced on a separate plate so that it doesn't get soggy in the soup. Her broth wasn't flavourful at all - just bland. The chicken was alright - two thin thighs that are pounded flat and breaded. It's served with sweet chili sauce on the side. \n\nWe also ordered their \"secret spare ribs\". I don't know what \"secret\" there is but it was extremely underwhelming. The ribs itself had no flavour to them and the breading was slightly sweet. I couldn't figure out if that's how it's supposed to taste or not. I was expecting a more salty profile or some white pepper for a kick or flavour. \n\nAll in all, I probably won't be back. I prefer the pulled noodles from Sun's Kitchen in Pacific Mall.
