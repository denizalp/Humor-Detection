I came across Tres Leches Cafe while scrolling through my Instagram. This morning I was able to stop by for the first time and ordered the Tres Aztecas. It was delicious! The customer service was great! The staff were super friendly and always kept a smile. The place brought back childhood memories growing up in the Garfield area\/Downtown Phoenix. Great environment:)
