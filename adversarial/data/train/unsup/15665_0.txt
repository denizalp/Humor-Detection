Hi Yelpers!\n\nGlamorgan Bakery has a large variety of cookies, buns, breads and everything in between. All the pastries look very tempting, for years it was the delicious shortbread dipped in dark chocolate that kept me coming back.... The con: the place is a oven, they really need to invest in a air condition system, seriously!\n\nSadly sometime in January I was diagnosed with Celiac's Disease which was devastating because I LOVE Wheat products, life without cheese buns, pasta and cookies just wasn't going to work. So I approached the bakery on a slow time, to see if they'd accommodation GF pastries in their bakery or by special request?! \n\nTo my Shock they informed me 100% of all their goods have Gluten and the management was not about to change their ways. I might add the lady behind the counter was in a tank-top and short-shorts (during December), she left me feeling like I was a nusense.
