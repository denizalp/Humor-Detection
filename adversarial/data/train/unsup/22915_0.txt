This place has a very enticing website, which is not very true to reality. I had a very short visit there during the happy hour, but enough to decide to never go back. They call themselves a 'martini bar' and so I decided to order a martini instead of my usual, a glass of wine. I was informed only 1 martini was on the HH menu, and that was a Cosmopolitan. I do not drink that stuff and I asked to have just a basic martini - vodka with a little splash of dry vermouth and a lemon twist. The accommodated, and that's why I am giving them 2 stars and not 1. The martini came out of the shaker with little icicles in it and was served with a LEMON SLICE on the side of the glass, sort of the way water is usually served. Well, I've had many martinis in my life at many different bars in many different cities, but never had I been presented with a lemon slice in my martini. A martini bar? I don't think so. When I asked the bartender to replace the lemon slice with a lemon twist, he went searching under the counter and took quite some time before he could locate one. They use some very cheap vodka, and so it tastes accordingly. But I will never forget the lemon slice. \n\nI got there shortly before 6:00 and so they told me I had about 3 minutes to make my food selection. I opted for Thai spring rolls since I didn't have a chance to study the menu. Those consisted of absolutely tasteless raw veggies in a tasteless wrap, served with a very spicy dipping sauce. Well, sauce or not, food has to have some taste. The spring rolls definitely did not. I was trying to picture myself being a rabbit... The place claims to serve Asian fusion cuisine, East meets West. In the case of the spring rolls, East missed West. There are probably better selections on their menu, but that doesn't justify the disgusting spring rolls. \n\nWhat else can I add? The bartenders were not particularly friendly or helpful, and they do not know how to make martinis.
