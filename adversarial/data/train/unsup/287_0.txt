It's 11 o'clock... do you know where your moisturizer is? No really... do you know where it is because I just ran out of mine! \n\nOff to Shoppers I go to get some Vichy Normaderm. Sadly they don't have any either. I scanned through the face creams looking for something comparable with no luck. I realized that I had been in the cosmetic section for over 20 minutes and hadn't seen any cosmeticians. I walked over to the counter to get some help and well... they were all busy.\n\nThree cashiers were standing around the makeup counter talking and one of them was crying. I am sure I sound like a total bitch when I say this but maybe crying while on the floor and distracting your fellow co-workers isn't the best thing to do. We've all had shitty days or bad news while at work, but if it were me I would have taken 5 minutes (or 30 minutes) to go off the floor, grab a coffee and vent to someone in PRIVATE!\n\nIn any case it was awkward for me to walk over and say \"Hey can you suck it up and help me find some skin cream?!\" So instead I went back to the shelf, played eni meeni mini mo, grabbed my stuff and check out at the regular cash. (I am so passive aggressive it's not even funny)\n\nI still love this shoppers but I think they need to be knocked down a few pegs... they didn't have my product and the service was non-existant.
