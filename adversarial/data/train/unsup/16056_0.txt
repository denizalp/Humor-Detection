If a clean, inexpensive room right on the centre of the strip sounds like long odds, then check out the Casino Royale.  Just four floors tall, this very basic hotel and casino is a gem.  No wait for elevators.  No need to walk a quarter mile to get outdoors  You can leave your room and be at the craps table -- or walking on the strip -- in about 90 seconds.  \n\nThe rooms are spartan all right.  But they all have hot and cold running water, a shower, a fridge, a bed or two, coffee maker, and a retro TV.  Rates are typically well south of $100 per night.  Did I tell you that there's free parking?  Did I mention that you can lay down a $2 bet on the craps table and back it up with huge odds? \n\nWell OK, the Casino Royale is a bit tattered and tired, but that's the charm.  And if you go through a nit-picky check list -- item by item -- you'll probably come up with an A-OK three star rating.  But factor in the value, the location and the convenience and it just begs for that four-star payoff.\n\nSome day in the not-too-distant future, the Fine Casino Royale will be imploded and a mega-casino-hotel will rise from the dust.  But until it becomes a Vegas memory, the odds are in favour of my staying at the Casino Royale...next time and every time.
