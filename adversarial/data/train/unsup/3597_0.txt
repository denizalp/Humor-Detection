Sometimes you just gotta veg out.  Instead of moo-ing out of course!\n\nI scanned the burgers and was excited to see that all burg options can substitute a portobello mushroom or chicken.  Since I'm a huge fan of the bello I decided to go the meatless route and choose the Adventureland Burgher.  Included is slaw, a mysteriously sauce dubbed untouchable, pickles and onion crisps.  I ventured into this burger like I was on the run from some wild bears.  I was as ravenous as those creatures are!\n\nI felt as if I would have done a disservice by not getting a beer (dah, Bocktown BEER).  The first option on the list screamed my name, the Lancaster Milk Stout infused with coconut.  Yinz guyz know I love coconut!  It was thick yet refreshing with a hint of coconut.  Hit.the.spot!\n\nMy friend started staring beyond me and then said, \"holy crap, it's big in here!\"  It sure is!  Great space for groups and events!  Best of all, there's a nice patio outside!  The only thing lost on restaurants placed in shopping centers is the patio view isn't the best.  Unless your idea of a view is Target (which I've been caught dreamily staring at from time to time anyway).\n\nI will most definitely come back to try way more beer and inhale way more delish food!  I just wish it was closer to the city.  Mr. Owner, will you please open a location downtown...I'll bring you biznas, I promise!
