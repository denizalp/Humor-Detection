Had dinner here.  Great pasta, good service.  \n\nOrdered the Chicken Marsala.  Very good.  Came with three well-sized pieces of chicken with mushrooms over the marsala sauce.   However, what surprised me was how freaking good the noodles on the side were.  I don't know what made them so addicting and delicious but they were.   Our server stated it was just simply seasoned with olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.   It tasted really good and I wish I asked for more.\n\nHaving kids also has its perks.  From the kid's menu, we ordered the lasagna.   The portion was enough to feed a family.   Lots of meat.  Very filling and we liked it alot.\n\nDidn't care much for the soup I added to our meal.  Tuscan-something, I forget the name right now.  But it had beans in it.   Won't order it next time.\n\nI think you have to ask for the complimentary bread though before they bring it out.  My server didn't mention it until I mentioned bread.  Maybe it's so you can possibly order other appetizers.  Great for lunch or dinner whenever you're around Fashion Show Mall.
