While the variety is some what limited, the quality of what they do have more than makes up for it.  If you want huge variety in your buffet, go elsewhere. If you want all you can eat lobster tails, crab claws that are already cracked for you, rack of lamb, and unlimited bottles of good champagne, it doesn't get any better than this place. \n\nService was great. Our champagne flutes were always full. When I was at the meat cutting station asking for some lamb, the guy was like \"how many pieces do you want\". I don't recall ever being asked how much I want at any other buffet. They usually just give you some pathetically small serving and send you on your unmerry way. So I asked the dude for FIVE lamb chops, just to see his reaction.  Unfazed, he delivered and it was delicious. \n\nAt around $100 per person, this place ain't exactly a screaming value.  But after an entire rack of lamb, 5 lobster tails and an immeasurable number of crab claws, I gotta say, screw value.  Best brunch ever.
