As I walked in I was greeted by Aerial. Hope I spelt her name right. She greeted me friendly and asked what I could be helped with. I told her my situation about recovering some text messages that were very important me and that I accidentally deleted the thread. She informed what to do and restore the phone to the last backup. I did so, and I was saved. It worked. She was a great help and totally  made my day. Thank you so much.
