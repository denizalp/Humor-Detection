We went on Saturday night and this place was packed. Luckily I had made reservations beforehand. The bar area is pretty cool, but it and the dining area were so loud. We sat on the patio, which is covered and has fans and misters so we could actually hear each other talk. \n\nWe tried the date night special. It included 1 appetizer, 2 salads, 2 entrees and a dessert to share for $58. The AZ rolls were a pretty tasty appetizer, even though I had to pick the corn out of it. I enjoyed my WCG Bacon Blue Cheese salad. It would have been a lot better had they used spinach instead of mixed greens. The Caesar came with some nice big shavings of parm. Yummy. We both decided on the Parmesan Fillet for our main. The parm was a little overwhelming. We both pushed most of it aside, but the meat was very tender. My mashed potatoes started off yummy, but got pretty hard toward the end of the meal. We split the White Chocolate Brownie for dessert and it was pretty good, but we were so full we didn't finish. \n\nService was slow. We were here for almost 2 hours, but our waiter was very friendly. Everyone I know really likes this place so I think we may come back and give it another chance.
