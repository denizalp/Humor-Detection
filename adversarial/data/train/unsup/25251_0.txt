After my not so good experience @ Yuppie puppies I decided to bring my baby Max here. He is 3 years old Shih tzu Pekingese Maltese 4lbs. I let the groomer know that I tried taking him to another place & she said he tried to bite her which was weird to me because he is always good when I take him to get groomed. Anyways she took him from me just fine I literally left in tears of joy I was so happy. She was real patient with him. They did such an amazing job I'm so happy when I pick him up he look so good. I'm happy I found our new permanent groomer. Thank you!!!
