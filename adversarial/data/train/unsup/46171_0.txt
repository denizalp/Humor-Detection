I like the food. The atmosphere is... non existent. It's just a dinky place whose management must figure that college kids don't care about the environment they eat in.  The staff are always friendly and service has always been decent enough  (just slow to clean the tables sometimes is all), so my main complaint is I don't particularly like the design of the place.  And it's not even a major complaint since it hasn't stopped me from going back for a solo meal from time to time.
