James Electronics was superb. I used their service last year to install by television, sound bars, and surround sound stereo system for my media room and they did an excellent job. He even ran cable into all the rooms of the house for other TVs. I called them again this year for another project, this time installing a TV with sound bar in the kitchen\/dining area. Again, I was very impressed with their workmanship. Larry is professional and friendly and will not rest until the job is done to perfection. I would recommend James Electronics to anyone and would use them again.
