What finer lunch is there than hotdogs al fresco on a bee-yoo-tee-full October day?  Considering that cold weather might be just around the corner, I figured I didn't have much time left in order to enjoy fine encased meats in one of Pittsburgh's many great plazas!   Wiener World's dogs have always had a certain snap to 'em and my beef hotdog was just perfect with all the trimmings (no ketchup of course--I learned that from  my Chicago friends) and topped off with a small order of fries and a diet pop.\n\nSo, a tasty dog and great weather.  Worthy of a 6th review, wouldn't you say?
