I went to get ear wax candles and they didn't have any. But my other experiences here good. This place is wonderful to get fresh ingredients from meat to vegan friendly. You can find great substitutions here if you are vegan. The prices are usually pretty expensive which steers me away a lot of the time. The girl who works for the nacho bar is awesome though. A person who really knows how to make nachos by putting chips cheese then another layer of chips and cheese. The staff is very friendly and the place is kept clean. Sometimes the lines are crazy busy but understandable.
