Love this place! Awesome lunch spot for at or under 10$. Jade red burro is bomb, if you're a newbie have them give you samples of the meat you're interested in and that way you can try before making a commitment. \n\nThe only time people give me negative reviews is when they've never been there and take a shot at what to order. It's Chinese and Mexican; done right is great, done wrong is just weird..\n\nSide note, if management sees this and could relay it to the cooks, last time I was there  I had over half of my white rice harder than a rock. I'm assuming they scooped the edge on an old pan but come on.. No one wants hard rice in with their food. I get saving where you can but that's not acceptable.
