I have never eaten inside the place but I may go for the AYCE thing on a Saturday. \n\nI've ordered take out on a few occasions and really liked it. I am a very judgmental sushi eater! I love unagi and the flavor has to be just right! So the dragon rolls to have impressed me is a big deal. I also ordered the tuna tataki that just wasn't seasoned as well as other places but overall enjoyable. The chicken katsu is very tasty, panko breading makes anything good though, and comes with asian slaw that isn't overly tart  and the brown rice was cooked well. My son loves those desert rolls, the little fatty! \n\nI've ordered by phone and gone in to order and either way the staff has been friendly and helpful. \n\nI like this place and even though I have moved farther from this place than other sushi restaurants I will continue to go there until I am thoroughly disappointed.
