Up front, I'll say that Craft Burger isn't  bad. If you're in the mood for a burger, this will hit the spot. I only gave it three stars because it was a bit disappointing.\n\nI guess I was just a bit underwhelmed. The patty had a great taste - meaty and obviously fresh. But I just don't get how so-called 'gourmet burger' joints don't teach their cooks not to press down on the patty when on it's on the grill, which dries the burger out by squeezing out both the juices and fat. While the topping and spicy mayo were great, and the burger itself tasted good, it was just a touch too dry, which to me, takes away some of the sinful, decadent pleasure of a fat-filled lunch.\n\nThe fries were pretty good, covered in what seemed like a cajun seasoning, but were too salty. Hopefully, I just got some from a bad batch. \n\nOverall, a decent burger place with an emphasis on a quality patty that is let down by a slightly dry burger. Still - have a couple of beers first and this place will seem like heaven on earth.
