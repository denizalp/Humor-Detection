The thunderstorms should've been a foretelling of what was to come.....\n\nWe have been to the location in Downtown Disney (and everything Disney is always uber-organized), so we figured why not, and came here with our nieces that we were watching for the day\/night and little one while staying at the Signature. \n\nYou'd think that since this place is supposed to be about the experience and appeal to children that the kids would've had a blast. \n\nI should start off by saying that I called down to make a reservation from our Suite, and was hung up on twice within the phone actually picking up on the 7th ring!! Finally called down to our Concierge and mentioned we were unsuccessful for the last 10 minutes (I waited to call twice more hoping it was an \"accident\" - I know glutton for punishment, but those who know me know I am a huge pushover and ALWAYS think that there are such things as 5th chances....). \n\nAfter confirming a reservation with the concierge, they called back to say that the Cafe said we would have to wait 2 hours for a reservation, but if we wanted to head down now that we'd be able to get seated right away...????? \n\nSo we headed down 2 hours later, just because the girls we're just too into the Lazy River. :)\n\nWhen we got there - the condescending hostess asked me, and OVER enunciated every syllable:\n\" I AM SORRY - DO YOU KNOW IF YOU ACTUALLY MADE THE RES-ER-VA-TION FOR TODAY? OR A DIFFERENT DAY? DO YOU UNDERSTAND?\" \n\nI blinked back in disbelief considering at 2 pm, half the restaurant was empty, and there wasn't even a line in the walk in area. \n\nSo I fired back with:\n\n\"Yes, Indeed I understand what you are saying. The reservation is at 2, I called your line from our OWNERS suite in the Signature and was hung up on...\n\n\"interrupted with - oh we're very busy - so that tends to happen\"\n\n\"NOT that that is acceptable, but I had our personal concierge call down for a reservation from the Signature - does that perhaps refresh your memory?\"\n\n\"She said, well, I'll see what I can do\"\n\nWTF ? Who the F treats people that way? You're not freaking Craftsteak or any of the fine dining establishments in the building, and we're not random idiots who wandered off the street.\n\nSo back with the person who thinks that I don't understand her English vernacular, or that I am said random Idiot - we will find something for you but how many children do you have. \n\n4, plus 2 adults, and one of the children needs a highchair. \n\nOK I didn't ask about the high chair, I want to know how many children - can you tell me that?\n\nOK - 4 children, 2 adults I said through a gritted teeth and a smile. After all, the kids are the ones who said they wanted to come here because their friends thought this was such a cool place. \n\nThe entire process to get to our table was like this. \n\nThe only consolation was that the guy who actually seated is was an older gentleman, very pleasant, and when he saw that within a few minutes of us being seated that we were going to have to encounter the wild Elephants bellowing in our faces within less than a foot, he volunteered to move us elsewhere - we gladly obliged. \n\nOur almost 2 year old, and the 7 and 10 year old nieces literally jumped every time the storm started because the elephants trunk would \"toot\" in their direction and shriek whenever a thunderstorm came. Not amusing. \n\nIt took that long for the same cocky hostess to find us a table in a near  half empty restaurant. I think that is her way of trying to f with people with her \"perceived power\".\n\nGood thing it usually takes us about that long to get the kittens in a box and figure out who wants what off the menu. \n\nThe server was nice enough at first.\n\nThen we had to remind him to bring 2 of our drinks, and oyster crackers for the 2 bowls of Clam Chowder. He brought them eventually, after the soup was half way finished. \n\nThe food is TGIF with a twist on the name of the entrees. Like the Rumble in The Jungle Turkey Wrap. Wild Turkey in a Jungle? That should only come in a bottle.... VERY unexciting food really - except for my coconut shrimp = I only had one. Everyone else at the table had one off my plate. Should say something about the quality of the other food. \np.s. WHO THE F charges 10 bucks for a kids Macaroni and small portion of bread? \n\nAt the end of the meal, he did end up bringing our bill to us once he saw the kiddies were done eating. \n\nAfter telling him to charge it to our suite - he proceeded to give me the bill to sign, and mention that if we wanted to leave him a tip that we could do so at the bottom. \n\nGood thing I looked at all the receipts included and noticed the only one that listed the 17% service charge that was already added, was on the receipt he was going to keep for himself.\n\nToo bad, no half stars - that would've gone to the older gentleman who really tried to be accommodating. \n\nThough we like the Restaurant Row available at the MGM\/Signature - this place really takes the fun and convenience out of it.
