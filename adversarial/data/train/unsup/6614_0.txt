I don't hand out 5-star reviews often, but I simply could not find fault with Taki's. This is not your typical mom-and-pop Greek joint. The chef has spent time in some jaw-droppingly good kitchens, like La Maisonette in Cincinnati. It shows in the exquisite food, right down to the cut and treatment of the vegetables that graced my monkfish entree. The flavors were balanced, sophisticated, and very memorable. At the same time, it's homey comfort food. I watched my half-Greek brother-in-law practically melt into his seat as he tasted the flavors of his childhood. I should also mention that they easily accommodated his vegan diet. This is very elegant Greek food. Just go.
