Le Pho is the sister of Le Thai.\n\nLocated on the corner of Bonneville at the Juhl, le Pho is an amazing little spot with fresh quality yummy Pho.\n\nClose to our house we come here quite often. \n\nWe always order either jasmine or pomegranate rooibos hot tea. \n\nOur app is always the vegan roll a soft hand roll filled with shiitake, radish, asparagus and other yummy veggies, including Thai basil. They come with a large dish of hoisin\/peanut sauce. \n\nMy better half always orders vegan Pho. Amazing broth full of flavor and A TON of noodles. Exactly how we love it. It has red onion, scallion, fresh zucchini, and sprouts on the side.\nI always take all the Thai basil, lime slices and fresh jalapeño off the side topping plate. :D Hubs likes it without. \n\nSometimes instead of Pho I order the vermicelli bowl and ask for it vegan. They pile it high with tons of fresh veggies and if I like they add crispy tofu or sautéed tofu. Its fine without it! \n\nPlease check out the photos I have posted, their beautiful food will fill you up and keep you happy and healthy! \n\nThey have tricking operating hours, check before you decide to come!
