My husband and I stopped in on our way from Charlotte to Brevard.  What an amazing find!  The food was excellent (so much so that I'm writing this review a month after our meal!) and the service was friendly, knowledgable and quick.  You cannot go wrong here and you can certainly trust the staff to steer you in the right direction.  The fried pickles and marinated seared flatiron steak are to die for!  Make this a destination - you won't regret it!!!  PS - I don't drink beer but my husband loved the selection.
