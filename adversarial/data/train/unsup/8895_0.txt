Fried pickles? Seriously??\n\n \"Yep...we're sharing an order...you're going to love them.\"\n\nThis from my co-workers in our Las Vegas office.\nCommuting to Las Vegas three times a week for eight years was a grind. Memphis made it tolerable. \nI reluctantly ate the fried pickles, dipping them into some kind of weird pink sauce. Fuck it, when in Rome, right?\n\nI ate everything on the menu in those eight years. I even ate things not on the menu. \nLike my own tongue, biting into the sneaky little fucker as it pretended it was the pulled pork. A regular occurrence here.\n\nI hate using clches, so I'll simply say the brisket isn't to die for, but is worth sustaining a serious life-threatening injury...like maybe a gunshot wound or something. \n\nIt's just that good.
