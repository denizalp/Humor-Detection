Thought this place was just called \"Halal Guys\", sans the article. I digress already. Came with a friend of mine who was also excited about their opening; she tried them in NYC and it was my first time. I arrived around noon and it was busy with a short line outside to regulate traffic inside the restaurant. Lots of employees working, making food preparation quick and efficient. I got the small falafel platter ($7.95) with white sauce and tahini and a packet of hot sauce on the side. \n\nI snagged a table outside for us to sit and waited a few minutes as my friend got her food. The platter has your choice of protein and rice, lettuce, tomatoes and pita bread. My portion was a good size for me as I finished it in one sitting. After all the hype, it's hard not to get my expectations up but there they were, hanging out with the clouds. After trying them out, they were humbly lowered back down to earth. I didn't find my food to be anything spectacular; it was lacking sauce and the hot sauce was pure heat, no flavor. I'm glad I got tipped off to get it on the side. The bowl seemed like something I could easily replicate at home. \n\nFood wasn't bad, but wasn't amazing either. I wouldn't not go again, but it isn't at the top of my list to go back soon. Good effort guys, and nice customer service!
