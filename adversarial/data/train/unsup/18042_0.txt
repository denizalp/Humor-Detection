Do I give it 3 stars? Do I give it 4? Usually if I can't decide I go with the lesser until they have proven me wrong. I think eventually I will up this review a star. But based on my first experience we will start with average. \nAll of my yelp friends always talk about this place, check in, post pics, and its so close to me house! Finally after work one night I had a sweet tooth and stopped in. \nOff top, 5 stars for d√©cor and customer service. I love the old school classy barber shop, winery, ladies saloon style all in one. I was instantly greeted with a smile and a hello. Lighting was dim, but appropriate. \nI was instantly drawn to the berry mascarpone cake. 2 of my favorites in one. $7 for a small piece, I was disappointed. Not enough mascarpone and it was like a berry gelatin. Not bad, but not what I expected. \nI took home, chocolate covered strawberries (3 for $6, decent), cookies, macaroons, and a couple other randoms. Prices were ok. \nI could imagine myself loving this place and enjoying a glass of wine n cupcake after work entirely to often. Who's my first yelp date down for drinks and desserts?! Jessie B? Shirley B?
