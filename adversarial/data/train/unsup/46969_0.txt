Not the place for fast service. Took a while to get our order in. Seemed like take-out was faster than dining in. Service was terribly slow as there was only one person. Ordered a chicken salad, fresh rolls and vermicelli. When the food finally arrived after 30 mins, the salad looked pretty sad for $9 and there was a long piece of black hair in the vermicelli. Obviously can't comment on the food here.
