Courtyard Marriott is fantastic choice in terms of location & convenience \n\nTraveling for work brings me to Charlotte & this Marriott is literally right across the street from my office \n\nComfy bed w\/ good pillows - score! \nQuiet!! Couldn't hear neighbors \nBathroom was big & shower rocked! \nFREE Wifi! \n\nLOTS of restaurants close by to take care of any & all cravings \n\nNo fridge.... :-(( \n\nAnd through no fault of their own, it doesn't directly connect to the overground tunnels that connect all the other buildings in Uptown \n... you gotta go all the way downstairs & then over to the Parking Garage to gain access \n\nBut with the office right across the street, I *guess* I can make the sacrifice & walk outdoors. Lots of love for Courtyard!
