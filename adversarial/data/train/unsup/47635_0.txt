Come for the scotch eggs, stay for the whiskey flight!\n\nThe Caledonian is probably one of the top bars in Toronto. Seating can get difficult during peak times, but if you manage to nab a spot, expect great food with a stellar selection of whiskey.\n\nThe scotch eggs are the star of the show. I could eat these without stopping for so much as a breath, but if you must try other foods, the fish and chips and pie were both hits. The haggis fritters where interesting. I don't regret trying them, but I'm not sure whether I'd ever order them again. Especially in the face of such scotch egg greatness.\n\nCheers!
