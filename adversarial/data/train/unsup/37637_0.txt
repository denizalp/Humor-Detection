Went to this Buffet the evening before Mother's Day. There was no line. Amazing!!\nWe were a parry of five and got there at 5:30. We stayed at the hotel, so we received a dining credit and used it there.\n\nThe service was only average.  We haven't eaten here in a while and were pleasantly surprised that most of the food was quite good with a wide variety.  Skip the sushi.\nWhat stood out was some very tender and flavorful slices of Prime Rib. My nephew  Aaron and I went back for seconds.  \n\nA good assortment of regular and some sugar-free desserts.  My mother walked out with a soft serve vanilla cone.\n\nOverall a good value buffet.
