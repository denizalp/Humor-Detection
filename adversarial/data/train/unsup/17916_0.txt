This is a brand new location, so they're still ironing out the kinks... learning the computer system and whatnot. They were having the DirectTV set up when I was there. Since it was new, there was no waiting. Everyone was also super friendly to me... happy to see me. It was odd, but nice I guess. \n\nThe nurse\/technician that took my vitals and whatnot did a good job... it was quick and painless. He simply asked me for my height and weight instead of making me hop on a scale and such. \n\nThe doctor seemed to know his shit. He was very ear-nose-throat family doc-esque, but I was surprised when he spent a good 30 minutes chatting with me about different medical questions. Normally, you visit a doctor and they spend 5 seconds with you and ditch you. I suspect if they were busy, this would've been the case. \n\nI had to wait for quite a bit afterwards to get my prescription filled on site - and it came in a pre-filled sealed container, so I don't know what the hold-up was. Plus, they took forever trying to figure out my paperwork and setting me up as a patient. Perhaps they could've been doing that while I was being seen. Isn't that why I filled out the chart? It's not like they had anything else to do.\n\nOverall, I was very pleased with my visit at Nextcare - I reserve a 4 star rating for perfection... there's no such thing as a 5 star medical visit as far as I'm aware... I mean, if I went in feeling like ass and came out feeling like a million bucks 5 minutes later, then they charge me nothing - that would be a 5 star visit.
