I have had Windstream for a long time and though it has always been 'okay' it is now horrible.  For the past few weeks and since an outage after a severe thunderstorm, the internet has been up and down all the time.  Like clockwork I can count on the fact that my service will be down intermittently on the hour.  I have been rebooting my router and modem as necessary but this absolutely is not permanently fixing my problem.  I can see by looking at my neighborhood network that others are having the same problem.  Thank goodness I am not relying on Windstream to work from home or I would be losing money.
