I've heard and read the hype over the place and finally got a chance to give it a try.  I consider myself an experienced pizza eater and attended with my resident pizza expert.\n\nWe were both in agreement that this pizza was did not live up to the hype. All the toppings were bland.  I don't know how you can rob bacon of its flavor but they managed to achieve this task here.  A large pepperoni, mushroom, bacon and half Italian sausage pizza was ordered and was just largely disappointing.\n\nThe artisan crust on a New York style pizza just doesn't work for me.  \n\nNow any red blooded American knows that ranch is mandatory with pizza.  Not hidden valley bottled ranch but a creamy delicious fresh made ranch more than complements a slice... It completes it.  So as we dined on America's birthday we requested ranch and were denied!  They do not have ranch because the executive chef does not approve of low brow ranch.  After this statement was made the server proceeded to bring out a shaker of, fresh out of the powdered bottle, of Parmesan cheese.  Ranch isn't acceptable but this is?  \n\nI will not be returning.
