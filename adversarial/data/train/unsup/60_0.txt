They have an awesome selection of craft beer and local wine here. It's becoming harder and harder to return though. I'm treated like a criminal every time I come here. \n\nThe last time I went, I wasn't greeted at all. I walked past 3 employees and none of them even acknowledged me. Which surprised me because they didn't seem very busy.  Then I continued on to the beer section where I walked past another employee that didn't ask if I needed help. As I'm trying to decide what to buy, one of the employees started to follow me and act like he was looking for something. He continued to do this until I made my selection. \n\nWhen I go to buy, and they do this every time I'm here, they won't even touch what you put on the conveyor belt until you produce your ID and they give you a once over JUST to be sure it's really yours. I've even had some of the cashier brats grille me and ask me how old I am while they're holding my ID. \n\nGreat selection, non-existent customer service, but if you appear to be under the age of dirt, be prepared to be treated like you're about to do a beer run.
