I come in here fairly often, but coming in earlier was a different story. Usually staff is pretty friendly, even though they are a little rushy towards customers when you walk in. I came in during a little bit of a rush for my lunch break from my school nearby, and waited in line until I got to the front where you order salads or sandwiches. I ordered my sandwich and wanted soup that day, so I waited in line until I got to soups. \n\nThe first person in the ordering line with a green shirt whose name tag I caught said Taryn, was showing absolute poor professionalism to one of her co-workers in a black shirt whose name I didn't catch. The way she was speaking to her co-worker in front of customers and their other co-workers was like she was humiliating her. It was as if she was showing her or telling her to do something but in a satirical, mocking way. It was completely unprofessional. The smug look on her face showed that she knew what she was doing. The poor girl looked like it was really bothering her, but still continued to smile and ask how I was. I wanted to say something for her to the bully in the green! \n\nI am a student nurse and I have compassion for others. Yes they have good food and good service to customers, but treating your staff poorly is enough for me to stop going to this location. And if I see it at another, I would happily stop going here altogether. Looking back at it now, I wish I would have spoken to a manager. Or if that woman was the manager, spoken to someone higher. You can't even tip the kids cleaning up trash and checking on you - that's sad and is a poor reflection on the culture. Terrible.\n\nTreat your employees with respect, we can see and hear you and my classmates (who eat here as much as I do), agree with me. We will be returning to another location!
