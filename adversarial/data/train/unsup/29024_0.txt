My friends and I are Mad Mex regulars and I've been meaning to check out another restaurant in the Big Burrito family, so I was glad when an opportunity to have lunch at Kaya presented itself a few days ago. Overall I had a great experience and I'm already looking forward to returning.\n\nThe space itself is small but comfortable. Even at lunch time it was pretty dark and cozy. We waited only a few minutes before being seated, and everyone we interacted with was friendly. Our waitress was also knowledgable and answered all of our questions. \n\nI had the Crispy Fish Tacos. For only $12, it came with two large soft-shell tacos that were packed with cabbage slaw, avocado, flaky fish, and a slightly spicy cream sauce. This was, believe it or not, my first fish taco experience and I absolutely loved them! There was also a pre-dressed side salad; I need to find out what the dressing was because it was delicious. \n\nThere were so many other options on the menu that sounded good. I'm looking forward to returning to try out the dinner menu and maybe also happy hour.
