We had a layover in Charlotte so my bf wanted to try their chicken. We got an order of their biscuit steak sandwich and their chicken sandwich. Both were just okay, but I wish we got the fried chicken instead.  However, my bf said it looked like it's been sitting there for a while. My favorite part of the meal were the fries which had Cajun seasoning on it.
