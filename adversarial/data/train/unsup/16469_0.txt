Love that they have online ordering and a great selection. We chose them because they have boneless ribs which my son loves. Their crab rangoon was excellent. Egg rolls were average. I've never had kung pao where the chicken was fried and I didn't care for it that way. The lo mein was good. The fried rice was average at best. My son enjoyed the General Tso's chicken and the boneless ribs. \nThe part that really disappointed me was picking up my food and someone was smoking inside or blowing smoke into the restaurant. When I first tasted the bonless ribs, you could taste the cigarettes which grossed me out. Smoking is NOT allowed inside establishments for a reason--especially so close to where the food is being prepared.
