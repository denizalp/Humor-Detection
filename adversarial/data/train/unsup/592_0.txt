Save your money and do not go see the worse magic show ever.  The tricks are so stupid it was hilarious as I knew how every one of them were performed.  On top of that, he probably waste half the show talking about himself and his success.  You are better off seeing the show on TV so it doesn't ruin your opinion of his stupid fake illusions.  Horribly disgusted.
