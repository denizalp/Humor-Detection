Man, these things are EVERYWHERE now. WHY?!? Oh right, its the huge crowds of people who are apparently in love with movie-to-restaurant spin-offs. What the hell is going on in this city? Are these things this popular everywhere?\n\nPretty much everything I've ever had is about the blandest Greek food I've ever had at prices that make me sad. The only exception is the Greek fries which you can get as a side to a pita sandwich and will get you through a lunch here if you are coerced into going.\n\nThis location probably though should have a 3 star rating or so because of its great spot and huge patio by the waterfall action in Arizona Center which draws in large lunching business groups like I am all too frequently in. However, the below average\/average Greek food you get here just makes me angry that a better, more unique restaurant isn't taking advantage of this space.
