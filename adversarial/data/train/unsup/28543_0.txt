I've been to Unwined twice; once with my husband and once with a girlfriend. My husband and I had a Groupon, so we started with the cheese plate and 2 wine flights. Our server helped us with wine selections for our wine flights and brought us our cheese plate. The plate was your average cheese plate. Nothing to write home about, but it had some tasty snacks on it. We also tried the pepperoni flatbread, which was delicious, and the poutine. The poutine has queso fresco instead of cheese curds (which is an OK sub), and not enough gravy. The gravy could also taste a bit richer. \n\nThe second time we tried 2 of the bruschetta and the poutine - this time we ordered it with extra gravy. Better!!! For wine, My friend and I both tried \"The Pundit\" and really enjoyed it. We ordered a dessert that, as it turned out, was no longer available, so one of the owners came out to personally apologize and bring us a substitute dessert, free of charge. Nice!\n\nOn both visits, we were warmly greeted and received attentive service from our servers. I love the bar area, which is actually more like 2 bars and offers plenty of space. In addition to an impressive wine list, they have 13 or so beers on tap, and 10 of them are microbrews. Fantastic!!! I've already purchased another Groupon, so we'll be back soon! Looking forward to trying the smoked salmon cakes!
