OH MY GOD! People got crazy, whats going on.\nFirst of all don't come here on weekdays, there are no free parking places and you'll have to wait forever to get your car parked. Second there are min. one mile lines in each store. Lol. Third you can't eat something as there are no available seats in cafes. APOCALYPSES.\nI was here long time ago and had problems with parking, so this time I came here on taxi. I decided to buy a pair of sport shoes, a couple t-Â­shirts for my gym and have lunch as well. It was Saturday and it was more than overcrowded. My choice was Nike, you can't even imagine how many people were there, so I decided to have lunch and buy what I need later. Couldn't find any free place in cafes and went to struggle with crowd for a pair of sport shoes. Decided not to come here on weekends anymore.
