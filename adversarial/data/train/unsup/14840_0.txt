Awesome food and beer here!\nOtto's Bierhalle was on my top list.  I wanted to try their PORK HOCK (SCHWEINSHAXE) for a long time. It was good as it claimed to be.  This is the Must-Try! I would recommend it to everyone. \n\nFood (4.75\/5)\n\nEverything was almost perfect. We love everything.  What did we order? Here..\n\n- SCHWEINSHAXE or Roasted Crispy Skin Pork Hock ($26) (5\/5).  The meat itself was very juicy, tender and tasty.  The skin was very crunchy and only little salty.  You can eat the pork by itself without any dipping sauce or have a dap of HOT MUSTARD.  I'm not sure how many types of mustards the restaurant provides but our server brought us a Triple-Hot Mustard.  They came in three small bowls and had slightly different tastes.  They might be called Hot Raddish, Sweet Russian and Sour Crunch!? Lol, I'm not sure about their names though. They were good!  They can make you eat more meat ^^.  This pork hock was huge!  I think it can feed at least 3-4 people.  We were only two people.  We couldn't finish it, so we got the leftover packed home.  Aww~ Pork hock sandwiches for tomorrow Yum!\n\n- ROAST PORK BELLY W\/ APPLE COMPOTE  ($9) (4\/5).  The pork belly was 24-hours sous vided.  It came with apple compote.  It was juicy and good with the apple compote.  However, it wasn't as crispy as I expected.  They came in two small pieces.  I would feel much better if their portion was more generous than the ones they served.  \n\n- ROASTED BRUSSEL SPROUTS ($6) (5\/5).  I love roasted Brussel sprouts as long as I don't cook them by myself lol. I'm not good at cooking that was why I prefer to eat out.  Anyway, roasting is always the best way to cook brussel sprout, isn't it?  Sauteed is good too.  They both are a good pair with meat and beer. \n\n- SAUERKRAUT FRITTERS ($6) (4\/5)  It wasn't hot when it came.  I know that they have to prepare everything ahead of time and everything seem to take lots of time to be prepared.  I'm not saying that the fritters were not good. They were good.  I like the breadcrumbs and the sauerkraut inside, but I just prefer the hot version ;)\n\n- SAUERKRAUT or pickled chopped cabbage ($4) (4\/5).  One word...\"sour!\" lol We need it right? Because of all the greasy stuff, you consume, you will need something sour like sauerkraut or assorted pickles to tone it down a bit. \n\n- OTTO'S HAND-CUT FRIES W\/ REMOULADE  ($6) (4\/5). Fries were small and skinny lol. They were perfectly cooked, crunchy and tasted good; only they weren't hot. \n\nDRINK (4\/5)\n\n- 20 oz HOFBRAU DUNKEL ($8.95).  My husband preferred this beer than Muddy York beer.  \n- 20oz MUDDY YORK ($7.95).  \n- 14 oz FUNF HACKER ($5 during Happy Hours). I love this beer.  It tasted like cider to me  :)\n\nSERVICE (3.75\/5)\n\nNothing was wrong with the service, but nothing was special either. I didn't want to blame our server.  He was busy and ran around the restaurant all the time.  However, it was a little frustrating when we needed someone to help us out.  We had to wait for a long time to catch his eyes.  I actually didn't know how the service works in this restaurant.  It seemed no one else came to check on us or even looked at us.  If other staff looked at us sometimes, they might be able to call our server for us.  Do they have bussers or any server assistants?  By the way, our server did everything when we asked for it promptly.  He even changed a new beer for my husband because my husband might not mention the full name of the beer or the server didn't catch it.  He got him Hofbrau ORIGINAL instead of Hofbrau DUNKEL at first. Normally, we don't ask to change it back.  We just take it.  However, he didn't like the taste of the Hofbrau ORIGINAL.  Thanks to our server again.\n\nAMBIANCE (4.5\/5)\n\n- I love the ambience.  It was very cozy and not too loud. They have tall chairs and regular chairs for customers. We got the tall chairs though.  I found out that it wasn't for me lol.  I will ask for normal setas next time.  I'm kind of not tall lol so I felt a bit strange to sit in the tall chair. Please don't judge!\n- Washrooms.
