Vapeco is an upscale local vaping shop with the utmost helpful employees that truly know their craft. I urged my hardcore vaping husband to try out Vapeco after seeing the 5 star reviews on Yelp. Vapeco certainly lives up to its 5 star reputation! \n\nATMOSPHERE: Clean and minimalist. I was getting tired of visiting vape shops that looked like disheveled male college dorm rooms with outdated second hand furniture. Vapeco feels classy! They have a Keurig available for customer use and mostly EDM playing on Pandora in the background.    \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: Refreshingly awesome. Most vape shops I've been to employ a cast of shady-looking and overly casual individuals. Vapeco emphasizes customer service and employs professional staff who are eager to help out. You are greeted immediately when you walk in and helped by smiling employees who quickly set you up with juices to try based on your taste preferences.\n\nPRO TIPS: 1) Builds are free with a purchase! \n2) And they even let you drip if you'd like instead of using the usual pens! \n3) 10% Discount with Yelp check-in! Military gets 10% off too :-)\n\nReturn Visit?\nI've already made multiple trips to Vapeco. And especially since they're going to be opening a second store closer to home, Vapeco will most likely become me and my husband's vape shop of choice.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #32
