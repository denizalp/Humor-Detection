Their tofu-fa is kept at a low price and has remained the same quality over the years.  However, the other food they offer (noodles, friend cakes...etc.) are either too oily or burnt.  Not the healthiest option.  I agree with many of the comments below, the ladies who work there are downright rude to all customers, regardless of the language you speak.  Just like some other customers, I was \"reminded\" to tip them...  for what I do not know.
