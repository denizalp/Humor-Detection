Have never been to a Culver's but I know it's a national chain and I've seen them in Illinois and Wisconsin before. In any case, decided to give them a try today.\n\nWalked in and was immediately impressed with the size of the menu board. Very extensive with  something for everyone.  \n\nAfter some thought, I went with the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Fries on the side and a fountain drink.  You place your order and pay and they give you a little number to put on your table.  You get your own drink and take a seat and shortly your meal will be delivered to you.\n\nService was fast and friendly and I was impressed by the finger wipes they brought with my lunch. Nice touch.\n\nThe Pork Tenderloin unfortunately did not measure up.  A bit overcooked and with a greasy taste did not cut it. Fries on the other hand were very good.\n\nRestaurant is very clean and well organized and apparently well managed.\n\nNext time I'll try something a little different and maybe I can find something a bit more appealing.
