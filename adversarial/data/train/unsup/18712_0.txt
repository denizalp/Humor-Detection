Had the worst service here...the server kept almost like a countdown of how many minutes we had left, and kept forgetting our orders. He even rushed our desserts (melona bars) and left them all melting on our table when \"our time was almost up\". I ate my melona bar quickly and didn't even get to finish it. Very rude, and I did not feel relaxed eating here. I did enjoy the food, just not the service. This was in the summer time. Some of my friends went again and told me the service has changed now. So I will probably go back once more since I love Japanese BBQ. Hopefully no one rushes us again
