I wish I could give this place zero stars. \n\nIt all began when we pulled up to the place. I could immediately tell it was a trashy-trying-to-be-classy situation. We walked in anyways. My friends and I are from the states and only two of us had exchanged our money. When we went to pay the 20 CAD cover, they gave the girl $20 USD expecting change (usually in Canada this happens with US money- I've never had an experience where it hasn't) instead, the girl said \"20 for 20\" and gave my friends no change, even though they owed them about $5.\n\nWhen we walked in, I noticed that, despite the all white furniture, the place was so dirty. Uninhabited tables were left uncleaned. We tried to order a drink and we were told we needed a table to do that. So we sat down, waited about 25 minutes, and a waiter never came. So we went to order drinks again and they were literally miniature. And so overpriced with almost no alcohol added. I couldn't even taste it. We hung out for a little while longer and then realized that doing anything else was better than spending time at Cabana. \n\nDon't go unless you're looking for a trashy crowd and shitty everything else.
