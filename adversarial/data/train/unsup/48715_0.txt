Hidden little gem in the food court of the Grand Canal Shoppes. Perfect place to eat a good flavorful spicy bite after roaming around and after some good drinks ! It claims to be open 24X7 , however beware - they were closed for 30 mins between 5 - 5:30 am (luckily we got there at 4:45 am). The food does not come out that fast - so thats a negative, but it was probably 5-6 mins longer wait than rest of the places in the food courts. Then why the 4 stars? : for 4 main things:\n\n- good Indian food right on the Vegas strip \n- serving Thumbs Up \n- Yummy salted lassi \nAND THE BEST OF ALL -  amazing PAV BHAJI... the taste was so authentic. It was low on salt - so all the flavors did not shine through, but once that was fixed - which is an easy fix - it was superb.\n\nWe also tried the paid chat and the chana masala - and they were strictly ok. \n\nGo for the PAV BHAJI - you will not be disappointed !
