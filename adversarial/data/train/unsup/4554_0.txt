I hope the chips were good, Mr. Manager. I hope they were delicious. Because I certainly left with a bitter taste in my mouth. \n\nIt was 1:30am. Our flight had been delayed over 8 hrs due to the truly freak monsoon that ravaged the city this past weekend. As a result, every flight that had been trying to get into Vegas arrived within a 30 minute window. Now, most hotels would have logically prepared for the onslaught of checkins. They would have called in extra staff or ensured all capable of checking in guests were ready and waiting at the front desk. \n\nI'm sure many other hotels DID abide by this industry must. Did Harrahs? No. It took an appalling hour and fifteen minutes to check in a line of 20 people with 3 agents on deck. \n\nThe icing on the cake was when we finally made it to the counter and I noticed 2 suit-clad folks having a snacky snack and chatting it up in the back office.... with the door wide open. Now, I'm assuming that if you're in a suit and you're hangin out by the front desk, you're a manager. In which case you should be out at the counter helping you're terribly overwhelmed agents. If I am wrong in that assumption, the door should have been closed to the office. Because the angry mob of guests and I staring down the line only saw 2 people with authority essentially ignoring the massive problem that was the excruciating snail's pace of a checkin. \n\n15 minutes? Normal. \n30 minutes? Agitated. \n45 minutes? Borderline ridiculous.\n1 hour? Unacceptable. \n1hr 15 minutes...????\n\nNo one in that line will be staying at Harrah's again.
