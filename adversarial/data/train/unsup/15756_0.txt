Another AYCE sushi buffet in Las Vegas.  Once you try a handful of them, you start seeing the qualities that are different from the rest.  \n\nFirst of all, the location of the restaurant is very convenient and it's in a good area, near the Palms Casino on Flamingo only a 10 minute drive from the Strip.\n\nSecondly, the service is very fast and efficient.  The Manager is constantly walking around to make sure that all of your orders are completed.  He even followed up on a few orders that was missed and heard him in the radio to his staff to hurry up the order (in Korean, watching Korean soap operas are paying off).\n\nThird of all, the restaurant is spacious and has feels even bigger with very high ceilings.  The tables are quite large, enough to hold all of the food you will soon order. \n\nThe sushi is not bad, nothing really stands out from other AYCE sushi places and are pretty much on par in terms of quality and selection.\n\nDefinitely one of the AYCE sushi places to try.
