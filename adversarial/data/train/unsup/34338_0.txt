If I could give 0 stars, I would.  It's been awhile since I have been to Lenero because the last time it took awhile to get our food.  I decided to try it again since a friend of mine always has good experiences there.  I went there on a Thursday night.  I'll let it be noted that we did  notice they were understaffed right away.  HOWEVER this place is small - there were less than ten tables.  So understaffed or not, it's manageable.  Twenty minutes pass.  We finally get an order in and waters brought to our table.  We ordered a couple of margaritas as well, although I was concerned after overhearing another table say their drink was syrup and soda water.  Forty minutes pass with only one person coming back to our table to say \"sorry the drinks are taking awhile, the bar is really busy.\"  I laughed.  The bar is busy?  There are two people sitting at the bar.  I actually took a picture it was so ridiculous.  We have now been in this place an hour with nothing to show but water.  The last straw was a party of ten who entered after us receiving their food.  I went up to the waitresses and said it has been an hour, we don't even have our drinks, and there are several tables that entered after us that have their food and drink.  Her response?  Well that table had a reservation.  Apparently having a reservations automatically puts you ahead of any other already seated and ordered tables at this place.  We finally threw in the towel and walked out.  Never again.  Please don't waste your time here.
