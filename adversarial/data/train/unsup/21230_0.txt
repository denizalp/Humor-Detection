An interesting museum of Native American art and artifacts and history. Lots to see, read and experience. And while I enjoyed it thoroughly, I don't know that I'd pay $18 to see it again.\n\nI liked the paintings that were on an upper mezzanine the most. I've uploaded two of those here. Artworks and art museums are my thing when I travel and this was what I really wanted to see.\n\nYes, there's a tragic history between the United States and it's indigenous people. It is a story that should be recorded, told and shared often. Let's never let this happen again.
