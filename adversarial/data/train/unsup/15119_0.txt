Mallyna has team of very talented professional lash and brow artists! \n\nI found out about them initially through their instagram page (@mallyna702) and have gone here twice for eyelash extensions. Both experiences have been excellent and I plan to come back the next time I need a lash fill!\n\n- There are two locations, one in Spring Valley on Forte Apache the other in Henderson on Eastern\n- You can text to inquire about services and book appointments which is very convenient at (702) 417-1640\n- Volume set sessions take 2+ hours \n- They use mink for their lashes\n- Lashes averages a 2-3 week life span where they still look full! \n- Can be pricey depending on the volume\/set you want (my fills average $99+) however, it's definitely worth it because of the quality\n- I've had Vika and Anjela as my lash artists and they are extremely patient and detailed in their work! Loved my lashes both times\n- Make sure to bring cash - there is a 3% or so service fee if you decide to pay with a debit or credit card\n\nHighly recommend Mallyna Lash & Brow Lounge if you want beautiful full volume lashes!
