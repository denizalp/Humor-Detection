First problem is that it's an impossibly long walk from the garage to the Deli in which you have to cross the entire casino floor. I'm pretty sure TI did ok with me paying 22 bucks for sandwich, measly coleslaw, and Odwalla OJ despite my lack of gambling. Speaking of OJ, serving Odwalla is definitely taking a loose interpretation of \"fresh-squeezed\". The actual \"Viva Las Vegas\" sandwich was great, nice, moist pastrami and corned beef, just as large as the sign off Spring Mountain suggests. However, the \"Nosh Vegas\" slogan, made me reminisce of great meals past at Jerry's Famous Deli in Orange County and Westwood and I was definitely put off by the fact I could not even sit in a restaurant on the Strip at midnight. If I can do it in Westwood, I should certainly be able to do it in this \"24\" city with great service and less the snobiness in West LA.
