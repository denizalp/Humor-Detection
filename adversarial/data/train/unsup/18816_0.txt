The fact that I found myself here while on vacation was not the fault of Yelpers. I was away from my computer and could not access reviews, instead trusting the bartender at the Phoenician on his word alone when he said Los Olivos would be a must. So, off we went!\n\nAfter getting what could quite possibly have been the worst customer service from a couple of 16 year old girls my fiance thought \"psh, weren't even Mexican\", I later sat munching on my mediocre tacos with my head down and my ego bruised.\n\nDid the bartender hate us?\n\nWas this a joke that they play on unsuspecting tourists?\n\nMaybe he grew up in some form of religious cult in Maine that didn't allow him to have Mexican food EVER, and now he ESCAPED to Scottsdale where he found a safe hiding place, discovered Los Olivos, and has made it his mission to inspire all of us to eat the #5 as much as possible.\n\nI didn't get sick, but my heart...my heart...it hurts.
