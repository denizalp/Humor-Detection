Hello and welcome to Ricos Tacos El Tio. This is a little taco joint that recently opened up where the Jack In The Box used to be. As we entered we went to the counter to order and check out menu. It took a few minutes for staff to realize we and another guest had arrived. The menu is fairly simple Tacos, Burritos and platters with combos. I ordered the Asada Burrito and added Avocado and sour cream. Josie had the fish taco. This Burrito was huge, sufficiantly filled with well seasoned asada, beans, and the above mentioned items. Fish tacos were really good. Light Flakey coating in a tortilla with slaw we added avocado as well. Everything here was fresh and filling.  \nThank you for visiting Ricos Tacos El Tio. We will go here again. It;s filling, fresh and convenient. If in Henderson and need a quick fresh meal check this spot out.
