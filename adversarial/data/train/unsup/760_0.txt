I've just joined Cora's Enthusiast's Club, and boy do I feel great. No really. It's an actual thing. A club for people who love Cora's. Who doesn't love fan clubs? Exclusive sneak peeks that involve brunchy foods AND a fun newsletter to keep me entertained, hell yes!\n\nWent back to Cora's this weekend and nearly committed the cardinal sin of Showing Up For Toronto Brunch After 11amâ„¢ - trust me when I say you do not want to do this. Also, it's generally a good idea to avoid Cora's when the Jays are playing the Yankees or the Red Sox as there will be scads of hungry Americans lining up out the door, and they will fight you for a fruit platter.\n\nMy second favourite server, Flip (her actual name - ask her the story behind it. It's a good one!) was bubbly and smiling as always. She is just always in a good mood, even if she's pumping out brunch orders at a feverish pace and zipping around the restaurant like a steroid-sated athlete. \n\nThis particular visit gave me the best of both worlds in terms of service - because not only did we have Flip as our server, but Jason (aka Dutch\/Guyanese dreamboat) was also serving our section, and let me tell you how pleased I was to get more than an adequate glimpse of him while mowing down on my brunch.
