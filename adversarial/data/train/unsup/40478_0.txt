I am so grateful my friend introduced this coffee shop to me! I've been here twice in less than 24 hours to get coffee for myself and also for my friends. \n\nTo begin with, I love the look and feel of Stone Creek Coffee. The way that they laid out the tables and counter tops make the room look 10 times bigger than it is. I also admire how many windows they have in there so you can watch cars whip by on East Washington. In addition, the staff is impeccable, friendly, and amazing. \n\nAnother thing I really enjoy about this coffee shop is the fact the prices include tax! It's one of the few places in Madison I go to on a regular basis that does it like that. I also love the fact they have a variety of coffee and tea selections people can choose from. To continue, they have coffee beans and other merchandise people can purchase!\n\nI love this place as well because there is always a table or counter space for someone to sit at and do some work!
