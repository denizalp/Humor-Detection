Bleh.\n\nFought a stampede and had dinner here with typical American fare - roast beef, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, vegetables, etc. Entree items were a hair above school cafeteria food, but everything at the dessert bar was fashioned from plastic and completely inedible. That huge beverage dispenser room was pretty cool though.
