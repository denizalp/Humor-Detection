We brought our truck in Oct. 2011 for brakes they charged   $800.00 for brakes and rotors, now it is only august 2012 and we brought it back because of pulsating of brakes and they said the rotors were warped and needed to be turned already, apparently they are not using factory recommended parts just cheap ones!!! Very disappointed.... our last brake service before combs lasted 7 years and none of our driving habits have changed.
