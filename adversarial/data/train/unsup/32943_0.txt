Tried this place last night and there was a musician playing too so that was nice. We got there about 5:30pm so in time for the tail-end of Happy Hour. \nThe Happy Hour menu is $2 off pizzas, 1\/2 off some appetizers and some discounted drinks. I would have liked to see some 1\/2 off bottles of wine as the bottle prices are kind of high.  \nI enjoyed all the food we had; the wood fired pizza was very tasty. \nThe service was okay; our bartender wasn't the most friendly (didn't smile much) but he did his job well and was attentive to the group. The bar area is pretty big and a section of it includes some sofa's to relax on as well. \nMy husband and I had 4 beers, 2 appetizers and a pizza to share and it cost us $38 including tip (the apps. and pizza were on happy hour)...not bad, plus we had some good entertainment. We'll be back.
