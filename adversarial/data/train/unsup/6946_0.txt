$10.50 for a \"Slut?\" The yoke's on you! Fool me once, shame on me for buying a jar of runny mashed potatoes with one rawish egg in it. I was directed to stir these ingredients into something like a spread, and to use it on the 3 small slices of baguette that made the dish edible.\n\nI can only guess this is some import from France where it might be a hangover cure. As such, I admit it was easy on the stomach, and effective. As breakfast? Never.
