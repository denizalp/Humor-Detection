I went here after my sister recommended it. I only had to wait for about 3 minutes, and the lady who did my nails was very nice. She didn't talk a lot, which was nice (I'm not into chatty pedicures). I was in and out in less than an hour, and my pedicure lasted about a week and a half. I will definitely go back.
