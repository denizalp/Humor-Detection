Now this is what I call a meal. After eating lunch at the disappointment that was Pho at TI, I was definitely ready for some real food. The Bellagio buffet has been known to be one of the best buffets in Vegas. I don't think I've been here for dinner so I was pretty excited. My first surprise was actually the price. $45 for dinner is pretty hefty, even for a buffet, but I just thought of that as a challenge to eat my worth of king crab legs and meat for the price of entrance. \n\nAfter we were seated, I went straight for the king crab legs, which always seems to be in season here. They were good as always and I probably polished off a dozen or so. Moving on, I skipped all the other food sections and went straight for the carving station. Tonight, they had rack of lamb, ostrich, and roasted duck breast. The rack of lamb lollipops were definitely the highlight of the meal. They were cooked perfectly and the taste was fancy restaurant quality. I think I finished half a dozen of those before trying some ostrich and the duck breast. The duck breast was also very flavorful, but the meat was actually a little bit on the tough side. \n\nThere were also a ton of other dishes that were quite impressive. I had an affinity for the mushroom ravioli with truffle essence, which was a winner over the lobster ravioli. The cocktail shrimp and smoked salmon were also my winners. I think the other only thing I remember that was good was the tiny ramekin with mac and cheese. \n\nThe one thing that I was disappointed by was dessert. The offerings were just not that impressive and they didn't even have real ice cream. Soft serve isn't acceptable at a buffet as nice as Bellagio's. I will say that I did enjoy the sour cream cheesecake, which was probably my favorite out of the group. My impression for dinner was that it was good for a buffet, but it could have been a bit better.
