This is our first stay here.  Its off season so we were given a free upgrade and some other niceties for booking directly through the hotel. This is a boutique hotel... not a full blown resort some the amenities are limited.  Its fairly quiet here...except for the the airplanes flying overhead, constantly.  Had I known it was so close to the take off strip we may have considered another place. Everyone has been very nice. If you have really high expectations (especially for the price) then stay somewhere else. The previous comments obviously came from someone with high expectations and a beer budget. Our room is lovely and is perfect for our little 2 night stay.
