Go to Madison if u want to experience real customer service at a Superstore. Where there are more than 2 cash registers open at a time. This ghetto piece of $hit with Beyonc√© blasting in my ear from the automotive\/electronic department with lines longer than a 90 year old lady's DD titties with people behind me complaining for 30 minutes like stfu, NO ONE GIVES A F^CK. Going online to complain is the way to go in this day in age, clearly. Oh and they just closed a register so make that 1 cash register and a super long line for the self checkout. F!#K THIS PLACE!!
