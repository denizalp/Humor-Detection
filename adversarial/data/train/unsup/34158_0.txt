Our wedding was last weekend and hiring Sapphire Sky was one of the best decisions we made. One thing that was great is they ran the ceremony, played acoustical during cocktail hour, excellent deejay, and rocked the house with their live band. They truly can do it all. Ashley and her husband met with us before the wedding and offered helpful suggestions and really paid attention to all of our requests. Their execution on the big day was awesome! Our guests had such a great time. They are so talented and great to work with. My wife and I highly recommend them and thank them for playing such a big part on our special day!
