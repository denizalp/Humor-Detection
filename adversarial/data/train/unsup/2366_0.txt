say whaaaaaa 50 bucks for unlimited buffets at 7 different buffets in Las Vegas???? Why did I not know about this earlier!!!! My Boothing and I went to vegas for the hell of it. And we were tryna figure out what we should eat... I told him I didnt really want to go to a buffet every meal because its like 40+(tax and tip) to eat a meal.... CRAZYYYY. lol. and he gave me that look like uhhhhhhhhhh HELLO. he said \"what are u talking about, just do that wristband thing where u have 24 hours to eat at the paris buffet.\" I was like say WHATTTTT. lol. so i googled it, partially because I didnt believe him. lol. and came to the buffet of buffets site. 47.99 plus tax for a 24 hour access pass to 7 buffets! ohhhhh snaps, its going down! so we ran over to paris and got our Total Rewards card (cause u gotta make the best deal ever BETTER). I think we recieved 5 dollars off the pass. Then we were off. I think we got our monies worth. We went to the buffet 3 times! hehehe. and I didnt have to overstuff myself to get my monies worth, hehehe. We only went to Paris(2 times) and Rio (long ass lines for no reason, seperate review for this) since according to my fellow Yelpers, those were the ones that were worth trying. Didn't go to the Ceasars one cause I didnt feel like paying 15 more since we're on a tight budget. . I was very very very happy with my purchase. Thank you BF for telling me about this...hehehe. now theres ANOTHER reason for me to go to vegas.. woot woot!!!  =]
