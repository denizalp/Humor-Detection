We were so hungry and we wanted to try something we haven't had before, so we decided to check this place out. The crowd was fairly a mix of locals and tourist. We were seated promptly at a booth. The restaurant decor was a little dated, as my son described it it was kinda \"old school\". The service was fast to begin with. The menu was extensive. It was well organized in sections which anyone will find very helpful because it was categorized. \n\nI ordered the Philly cheesesteak omelette. It was a little disappointing because it was bland. He eggs were overcooked which made the whole meal tough to dig in. The meat was rubbery. I didn't finish my plate. \n\nHubby ordered Tennessee steak and eggs. According to him, it was okay. Nothing special. He said it was cooked the way he liked it  but not something he would order again. \n\nThe kids ordered pancakes. 'Twas alright. They liked how they were shaped liked happy faces with chocolate chips. Amused them the whole time. \n\nOverall, I'd still come to try the other things they have in the menu. Then maybe I could give an updated review. Until then, I'd give it a 3 star.
