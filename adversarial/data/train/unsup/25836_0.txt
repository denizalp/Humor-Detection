Hmm.. mixed emotions about this one. I was looking forward to a nice chewy gooey yummy mess of lasagna. If you just love spinach so much that you want the entire dish to be permeated with spinach flavor, then get the lasagna. Service was great and prices were reasonable - $9 per plate. The small ceasar salad had amazing dressing and was big enough to feed 3. Will return to try something else.
