Absolute horrible company who lies about when they will ship your car.  They charge you full price before anything happens and the week my car is supposed to be delivered I find out that my car has not even been picked up.  That was 3 weeks my car sat in a tow lot waiting to be shipped when it should have already been delivered. Then you call and you can't get a hold of anyone and when you do finally reach someone they say it should be assigned a driver soon...3 weeks later still nothing.  I cancelled with them and they charge me $150 for cancelling when they haven't even shipped my car which sat for 3 weeks.  Go elsewhere this company is an absolute joke.  Have talked with others who had the same experience.  Try Mercury auto shippers who picked my car up the next day and delivered it to California a week later.  That was car shipping companies are supposed to do.
