First time coming to a Jimmy John's since moving to Phoenix from NC six months ago. When I lived in NC, I'd go to a Jimmy John's often and always enjoyed it. So, was anxious to try this place out. This location is small compared to other locations I've been to, but not a big deal for me since I wanted to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather. \n\nThere was only one other couple in the place when I got there so I was able to order immediately. Got my favorite sub, the #6 veggie with extra tomatoes and added sprouts. Before I could even take 5 photos for Yelp, my sub was ready!! If nothing else, I love how this place is so fast. Definitely, a good spot to eat at or get your food if you're in a rush. \n\nMy sub was fresh and was very delicious. One thing I'd change about Jimmy John's is the size of their bread. I always feel like all my veggies are falling out of the sub every time I get one. The bread is really skinny. Other than that, I love the taste of their bread. It was fresh and soft. My sub did seem smaller than other locations I've been to, but that's okay I guess. Another thing I really liked about this location was that they asked me if I wanted my sub cut in half or not. I've never been asked that before and always forget to ask for them to cut it, so it was nice for them to ask. \n\nThe two ladies that were making the food weren't particularly friendly, but not mean or rude either. I just kinda like when you go into a place to buy something, that the people working there actually act like they want to be there. The inside of the place was clean and organized as well. \n\nWill be back.
