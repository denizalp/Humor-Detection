i love seafood, therefore I loved this buffet.  \nit's a whopping $38\/person though -_-\ni was surprised how much I ate at this place.  the raw oysters, the lobster tails, the sashimi. it was mMmMM MmMmm good. \nI absolutely loved the dessert bar and their gelato wheel.  The strawberry cheesecake gelato was definitely mMmm MmMm good!!\n\nI eventually did get food poisoning, barfed and had diarrhea like crazy.  My bf didn't.  So I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt and still say I'm a fan and will visit upon my next return to vegas.
