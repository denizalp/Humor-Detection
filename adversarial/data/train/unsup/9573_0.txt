I was really excited to play here since I know it's an old school course and there aren't too many courses in Vegas that aren't desert style. I went to check in and the guy at the pro shop asked if my girlfriend would be riding along. I said yes, and he told me there would be a $25 ride along fee. I thought that was ridiculous...it's not like we were getting another cart and wasting their resources. We have been to at least 10 courses and not one has ever charged for her to ride along. It was a terrible way to start the day.\n\nOn to the course...it's nice to have trees all around, but overall it's a very flat course. That's not a bad thing but it's just not super exciting to play on. Greens were fantastic though. The real downfall was the disgusting \"creek\" that ran through some of the holes. It was littered with clothing and bedding and all kinds of trash. We dubbed it Hobo Creek because it looked like a homeless refuge. Not exactly something that makes the course look good.\n\nWould I play there again? Probably not since the rider fee almost doubled my cost of playing. It would have been nice if they mentioned that when I booked, because it was a very unpleasant surprise. On a side note, the restaurant has good food at great prices, and the waitress we had was very friendly and attentive.
