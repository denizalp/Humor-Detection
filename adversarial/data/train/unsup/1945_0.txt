I would give this company -5 stars. I quit working for this company within 6 weeks and a week of it was training. The CEO Mike Malone is so arrogant he didn't stop in our training class to say hello and  wouldn't introduce himself to new comers. The pay is insulting! They have a dual pay scale, they say they will pay at the higher wage, not true! I would have more self pride dumpster diving to pay my bills than to work for this company. McDonalds, Starbucks, and other such venues pay better than g4s
