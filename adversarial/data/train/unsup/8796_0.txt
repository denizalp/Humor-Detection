Called in and ordered food at 20:16 today, got my food at about 21:00. The food was 20$ plus 5$ delivery fee. When I opened the package, there was no chopsticks or forks, nothing. I called them at about 21:16, and told them what happened. The girl who picked up the phone told me she would ask somebody to send me chopsticks. I went downstairs and waited for about 30min. The last call I made at 21:46, the girl who picked up the phone told me they can't send anything to me because there is no driver. I was not mad until she asked me to look for a store to buy forks. I just got to Canada for business this afternoon, and stayed in hotel. I don't know anything about where I am. It is almost 10pm and she asked me to walk out to buy forks which I should not worry about when I order food. I told her that I've been tried to ask the hotel to give me, but their restaurant was closed. And I don't really want to go out to look for store!! She said, then you'll have to wait until somebody working in the restaurant gets off work at 22:00, and walk to my hotel to give me chopsticks. I never had any experience like this even when I was in China. If I can find a way to solve this, I wouldn't even make the call. I'm very disappointed about what they did and how they solved this problem.
