I've been to GadZooks a few times. I go here when I want an enchilada that's got a little extra something. I love being able to customize. And they have an overwhelming number of options so I recommend going with someone who can suggest something to get you started. (I need a lot of time to take in all the options which doesn't work if you're eating with other people.) anyway I had the cornbread in my enchilada. (It sounds a little weird but it's really really good!) I've tried both the red mesquite sauce and the green sauce.  I thought the mesquite was too hot for me but it was really good if you like that.  I haven't had any issues with service.
