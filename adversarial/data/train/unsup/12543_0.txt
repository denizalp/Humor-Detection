ooooh YUM! super delicous food here - I love the rustic atmosphere that is not expected from a strip mall restaurant!\n\nThe restaurant is cozy and quaint with FRESH food - I feel like I'm eating at a little restaurant in Tuscany!\n\nPerfect for romantic or special occasions - wouldn't recommend for big groups, but great for dinner out with a few friends on the north side.\n\nConvenient parking makes it attractive too!
