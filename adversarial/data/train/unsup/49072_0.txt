I've been to various Press Coffee locations and this has made my list of favorites. The quality coffee that is provided is exquisite. The surrounds are quaint, yet, energetic seeing as how there are different salons, beauty parlors, massage therapy and small business within the building. The atmosphere is brilliant and vibrant. The employees know their coffee and love it even more. They do their best to provide their customers with the very best choice.
