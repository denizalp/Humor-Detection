AVOID THIS PLACE!!!  I was here at Happy Feet on monday 2\/1 at approximately 1pm and this place got raided by the cops for \"illegal operation\/activity\".  I was literally 2 minutes into my massage when all of a sudden all the employees including the lady massaging me started to run towards a back room.  At first I didn't realize what was happening but then shortly after the cops\/detectives stormed in and went straight for that back room and demanded all those employees to go towards the front room.  The cops\/detectives then instructed myself and the other customers to get our personal belongings and wait to be escorted out to ensure that we would not get mixed in with the group of employees.  When i asked the detective what type of illegal activity he stated that he could not get into detail but that this place was hit before and suggested we no longer return to this so called \"business\".  As we were finally escorted out the lady at the reception desk started to say sorry to us and said this was only an \"inspection\".  Really lady do you think I'm that stupid!!!  It's a raid not no inspection!
