'Scuse me.  Excuse me.  This place is the staple of Wexford life.  You either have it delivered to your door or you come here, you get a crappy iceberg lettuce salad and then you gorge yourself with their perfect pizza.  If you're me then Dad orders a beer or two and Mom drives home.  You chortle in the backseat with your sister.  End of story.
