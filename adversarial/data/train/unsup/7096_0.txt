Yikes! I'm not sure what this place was like back in it's hay-day but I had higher expectations for a Crowne Plaza that for sure.\n\nIf I had one word to describe this \"resort\" I believe an accurate description would be *dated*. From it's late 70's outside appearance, to the 20\" tube TV, to the janky elevator, almost everything I experienced at this Crowne Plaza seemed dated. We stayed for 2 nights. 2 very disappointing nights. Not only did the ice machine on our floor not work (and with no \"out of order sign\" on it, and with no fridge which made things even worse), the toilet in our room barely flushed. Not to gross anyone out but the toilet couldn't even flush a #1. Thus I was frightened to even take a #2 in fear of the dire consequences that would likely occur.\n\nThe only semi saving graces to this Crowne Plaza are the friendly staff at the front desk and the location near downtown. Unfortunately those 2 perks cannot save this Yelper's review of this dated golf resort. I'd rather stay at a Best Western next time I'm in Chandler.
