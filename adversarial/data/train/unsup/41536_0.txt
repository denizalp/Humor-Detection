Perhaps the reason you seem to be unable to find me is that my showing was booked and confirmed for 1:40. I see no point in continuing to try to explain to you as it seems you are just trying to avoid looking bad. I confirmed my appointment multiple times but no one showed up for it. I am greatful that we found another home and that we avoided doing business with such an unprofessional company. I hope you will all learn from this experience and treat future customers with more respect. Good Luck.
