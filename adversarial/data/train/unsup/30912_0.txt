Great food but service was a bit slow 2nd time we went. (And it wasn't busy.) Decor was African bush themed, upscale & interesting. Unfortunately the BBQ pulled pork sandwich was taken off the menu... During my first visit in ordered this with house coleslaw (which was the BEST I've ever had anywhere) & wanted it again. Wish chef would have made it upon request, but he didn't. This visit I ordered the chicken breast sandwich with Fry's & their amazing coleslaw; which was tasty. My mom ordered a cheeseburger that she enjoyed. Was nothing special about it but tasty nonetheless. I'd definitely come back for the slaw if nothing else. It's worth a look see & enjoy! Bon Apatite'.
