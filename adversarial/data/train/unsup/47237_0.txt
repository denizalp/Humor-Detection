The solution, I have discovered, to inconsistent table service is to sit at the wood. Bartenders are right there and they do a good job of looking after there immediate patrons. This isn't great for more than 4, but if you get a corner then it works perfectly for visiting (bar vet tip - you're welcome!).\n\nThe food seems to be more consistent than a while ago, so I have no complaints there. Wings are good and a good deal during Flames games.Pretzel and spud skins are also good appies.\n\nBrewster's is known for their own brews: some awesome and some not so much. Usually a new seasonal flavour to try as well. There is a selection of bottle beers if the Brewster brew is not your taste at all.However, they have made a decision to make Flying Frog (my fave) a seasonal brew to which I say \"Boooooooo!\" Hammerhead ale is good. Couple of my Swill-Mates  love the peach and raspberry topped with same fruit.\n\nThe patio is awesome when it is open.
