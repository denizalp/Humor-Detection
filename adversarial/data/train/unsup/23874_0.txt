Gabi coffee just doesn't quite cut it for me.\nThe interior is beautifully done with an awesome open space where you really have that sense of free mobility.\n\nI enjoy their incorporation of air plants and trees that make it feel like you're walking right into a giant green house. Lighting inside is nice and bright and doesn't rob you of feeling any sort of overheating since they keep it pleasantly cool and comfortably air conditioned.\n\nEach seating spot has its own personality as well where you can choose either a more intimate table, lazy couch spot, long wooden table, or the cool book shelf looking stair case thing in the rear of the place.\n\nThe desserts and drinks are where the place falls short for me though, I tried the ginger and lychee tea, tiramisu, green tea red bean cake, matcha latte, rainbow cake, charcoal bun, and tofu cheese cake. In all honesty I didn't like any of it.\n\nBoth the ginger tea and lychee tea had a very artificial sweetened flavor that I just didn't enjoy at all, the charcoal bun was very plain, the matcha red bean cake was dry and a little lacking to me, the rainbow cake was very dry and plain, and the tofu cheese cake was interesting but a little more funk or cheesy tasting imo. \n\nThe tofu cake was the most interesting of the bunch since the tofu added a bit more of this enjoyable creamy\/silk texture but I didn't really like the stronger taste it seemed to have. The matcha latte was not really to my preference since it's more of a bitter or stronger matcha taste, but I'm sure hardcore matcha lovers might appreciate it more than me.\n\nThe tiramisu was well, tiramisu; I didn't see anything negative nor special about this one. You can't really mess up tiramisu, or at least I don't think you can?\n\nI think over all between the desserts seeming a bit plain and dry to me and most of the teas having this strange sweetened taste I didn't really enjoy the food and drinks as much as I enjoyed snapping the inside of gabi and waiting for friends to ask me where this place was.\n\nI guess it felt more like a tinder date to me: everything looked good, but was lacking everywhere else where it mattered.
