Randy and Dominic. Get used to hearing these names because my prediction is that Christian Brothers will be voted Best Of Gilbert this time next year!\n\nGetting text messages about the status of your vehicle, courteously shuttle, complimentary air freshener, having your vehicle backed up to the front door when completed and a nice cold bottle of water waiting for you in your drink cup are the small gestures that make a customer fee like they are appreciated.\n\nIn addition, there are no high pressure sales tactics. Just communication so you can make an informed decision on your vehicle.\n\nWay to go CB!!!
