Previous visits I had sliders and salads, but lately I've been eating from the pizza portion of the menu exclusively. The rumors and ratings are right: this place has fantastic pizza. Multiple crusts to choose from, several specialty options, but almost everything I've tried has been great.\n\nThe Modesto is my favorite: roasted mushrooms, garlic, and roma tomatoes, with fresh basil. And you can add sausage for FREE. Who has ever heard of that?! So props for having legit vegetarian options, and for kicking them up another level with the carnivore customization option. The small is perfect for two, add on some wings or a salad and you won't do too much damage to your diet.\n\nThe stuffed pizzas are also a hit- I'm not a fan of carbs on carbs on carbs, but BF would consider selling one of his kidneys for a large Loop (sausage, pepperoni, roasted mushrooms). The marinara dipping sauce is robust and comforting, but the crust is a bit too thick for my personal liking. I will say that the large, 8 slices for $30, is a great deal if you have a large group: similar, smaller, thinner slices in town go for $5\/each elsewhere, and this averages out to under $4\/slice with much better quality and a larger portion.\n\nAnd service. It's always great. Phoning in my order is easy, it's always ready on time at pickup, and staff are friendly when I pop in. Bonus points for having the two takeout-pickup spaces in the parking lot!
