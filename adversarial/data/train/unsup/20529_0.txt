I HATE THIS PLACE...\n\nbecause I can't resist it. It's bad enough that I f-ing love coffee, they go and make it taste super good - wtf. Every single damn time I pull up to this place every one is smiling and happy and always asking you how you're doing...unheard of! Seriously though these kids are awesome and always make me leave in a happier mood (plus having the coffee in hand).\n\nI swear to you, one time they gave me the wrong drink (unbeknownst to me) and I got all the way to the stoplight to see one of the baristas full on running to my car like he was getting chased by a bear just to give me the correct drink. Ah-maz-ing. \n\nThey have a ton of specials, great customer service, fantastic drinks, and if you don't know what to get they'll be more than happy to find one you'll be sure to like. 5 stars hands down.
