On the one hand, I wish the Dixie Pig was a bit closer, but on the other hand, I'm rather glad that they aren't because I'd be there a whole lot more frequently. \n\nThis spot is a good size on the inside, and because of that it can be a bit loud due to the echo, but the staff does a great job of communicating despite that potential issue, the only thing to be aware of is that if you happen to hit it wrong, there could be a slight delay.\n\nNot sure exactly what happened, as things were going swimmingly, and our apps came out just about immediately after we ordered them (including some freshly-popping pork rinds), but it took a really long time for the main dishes to be delivered. It's certainly possible that some larger parties slipped in while we were eating on our apps, but whatever it is, this was about the only downside.\n\nThe meal itself was tasty and there was plenty of food to go around.
