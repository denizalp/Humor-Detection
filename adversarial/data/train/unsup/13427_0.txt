I love planet hollywood becuase this is Britney's home for now haha...\n\nJune 2011 - They've definitely upgraded and did a lot of remodeling from when i first came out to vegas at 15. I still have the photo with the big earth globe in front. \n\nAnyways my first time here was for my cousin's bachelorette. We stayed in a suite with 2 rooms, kitchen, living room, jacuzzi annnnd stripper! So much fun! perfect space for 10 females. I enjoyed the jazucci - their pool (outside) was nice a spacious enough to find a perfect spot to tan. \n\nWe were in the tower that didnt have the slots :( so we had to walk to the other tower... which is perfect it gave us a reason to walk around and get that exercise. \n\nThey have friendly staff, its very clean and refreshing to stay or just even come walk around planet hollywood.\n\nJanuary 2014 - Came back for my girl friend's flirty thirty! woot woot! we didnt stay here but we came to watch BRITNEY B!TCH! the amphitheatre \/ venue was huge - all the seatings were perfect! Britney's show was amazing. i'm a fan!\n\nMarch 2015 - Walked around the shops, reminds me a lot like Ceasars Palace or is it the Venetian?? idk.. We came here to eat at CABO WABO! Yummmmm!
