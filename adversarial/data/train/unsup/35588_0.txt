This was my first time at Futo Buta and I really wanted to love it! Such a cute place. Service was great!!! We started with the Rice Crispy squares which were the best part of our meal. They were excellent.  The ramen however was not as good as I had hoped it would be! We ordered the Tonkotsu and the Buta Bowl. The broths were extremely greasy for both dishes and lacked flavor and the noodles had a somewhat gummy texture. Everything seemed really crowded in the bowls. Usually I always take my leftovers home with me but I had absolutely no desire to eat that a second time. It's really a shame since Yama is not open for lunch!
