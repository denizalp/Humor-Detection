I have actually been putting off my Pura Vida review because it was so good I don't really even know where to begin. It was a bitterly cold valentine's day, so a lot could have gone wrong. The food was so delicious though we didn't even care that our skin almost fell off on the walk over.  \n\nSeriously though it's hard to review something so good. I'm realizing a lot of my reviews lately have only been super positive 4\/5 and 5\/5 reviews, and people may start to think I'm just lying to help the businesses. I can honesty say this one deserves every star it gets. The peanut stew was probably the most delectable thing I have ever put in my mouth.... But seriously. It was rich and creamy with just a hint of spice. A totally unexpected winner in my book. If you go, just bite the bullet and get some for an appetizer. I can assure you, you wont be disappointed (unless you have a peanut allergy, then you will be seriously disappointed that you can't have any).\n\nThe vegan pot pie was better than any meat-filled pie I've ever had. In all seriousness, my boyfriend ordered this and isn't even vegan. He said he would order it again over a meat dish any day. It's that good people!\n\nTheir wine selection was pretty spot on, and their beer menu wasn't bad either. Their blood orange cocktail is something I would seriously consider ordering agan. On top of that the ambiance of this place is just out of this world. Literally. Its futuristic modern at it's best.\n\nStarting to think Pura Vida needs to become a valentine's day tradition....
