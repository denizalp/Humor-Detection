I bought a Groupon Deal for this salon.  Service was fine, but there was a $20 bonus you could use for services.  Turned out this is virtually unusable, except as a $20 discount on regular priced services--which are expensive unless you join.  There was no pressure to join, but the $20 is pretty much lost because it's not worth the price for services unless they're on special--too high.  I find this a little misleading, and it was not so great a value with that in mind.
