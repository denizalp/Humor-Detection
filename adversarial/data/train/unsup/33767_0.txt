A lot of people complain about Wal-mart for one reason or another. I am guilty of this myself. I wanted to compliment them on great customer service I experienced just now.\n\nI ordered something via the website because of a special online only price. They called a short time later to tell me it was out of stock, but they had a similar one they were willing to substitute. The substitute was silver instead of black, programmable instead of manual, and $15 more. However, they would price match it I wanted it. I came down to pick it up. \nMelvin and Leona (? Cust Serv Manager) both helped because it wasn't a common (or easy) exchange. Both very friendly, Im really happy that this Wal-mart went out of their way to please a customer. Kudos.\n\nedited for spelling.
