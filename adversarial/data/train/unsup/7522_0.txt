You can't go wrong.\n\nIf you have an early meeting or other morning event, you can't go wrong if you bring donuts from LaMar's. The donuts at LaMar's  are delicious and practically melt in your mouth. LaMar's offers a large selection of donuts to choose from.\n\nThe cinnamon twists are huge, light and fluffy, as are the glazed donuts. LaMar's offers filled bismarks, cake donuts with all types of toppings and of course donut holes.\n\n\nThe focus at LaMar's is on flavor and quality ingredients of the donuts. Therefore, the price per donut is a little higher than other donut places, however, these donuts are worth the price.\nThe staff at LaMar's are great. The service is quick, and the staff are willing to accomdate whatever you want. I definitely recommend Lamars to everyone.
