I'm not a Vegan, Vegetarian, Pescetarian or Ovarian (Yes, I know I made the last one up) In fact, I'm just fine with my pro-carnivor status and I still love this place! The wife & I try to eat healthy and organic when we can and this restaurant is great. They have dishes with perfectly cooked chicken breast, great flavor combinations and I've even tried a few Vegan dishes and I can't speak highly enough with the service or the food. \n\nIf you're looking for a comfortable restaurant you may be a little dissapointed with the stools or the lack of square footage in the joint. There is something to be said for it being chill though. \n\nOverall, it's a great little cafe that won't kill your wallet...not to mention you'll be eating healthy. \n\nOH! and you have to try the Red Velvet Cake with a huge strawberry on top...the whole thing is 150 calories.
