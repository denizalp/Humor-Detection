Glad to have another taco option in the area.  I do have to shrug my shoulders in disbelief at the prospect of having to pay $10 for two tacos and some beans and rice.  Sorry guys, that price point is out of whack for what you are offering. \n\nOn par with a typical street taco you'd find on the West side but with a 200% premium for being located in North Scottsdale.
