This is only my fifth experience with a tanning salon, in about eleven years. So, obviously I do not go often, but I am familiar enough with how things work.  \n\nWell, the staff needs more training. Although nice enough, each visit has yet to be a smooth one. The beds are clean for the most part, although one of the beds that I have seen is showing it's age. \n\nIt is a better deal to buy a package at the store, rather than an online deal. Once you purchase an online deal, such as the '$50 value for $35', you are extremely limited as to which beds you can use. I wish that I had known this before purchasing. If I was to continue with more tanning, I will purchase at the shop as they offer decently priced packages for as little as two months. \n\nOne thing that I do not like at all is that they do not supply you with UV goggles. Every place that I have previously gone has offered these, and you just drop them into a sanitizing solution on your way out. They do offer them for purchase, around $8, or disposable 'wink ease' for 50Â¢. I don't like the disposable ones, as they leave a sticky residue on your eyelids, and they cause your lids to sweat. \n\nIf you don't mind a simple, no frills salon then this is it. They do offer tanning lotions, and best of all some are offered in smaller packets so that you can try them out before investing in a large bottle.
