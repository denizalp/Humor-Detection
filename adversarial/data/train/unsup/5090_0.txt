Truly an excellent establishment. Amongst all the strip clubs I've been to, this one ranks up pretty high and reminds me of the Vegas strip clubs, especially Rhino. \n\nPrices for drinks and lap dances pleasantly surprise after NYC. Women are beautiful and very friendly. I saw some total knock outs here and one of my poor sucker friends just about fell in love with a stunning 26 year old just \"earning her college tuition\" here.  All in all a great place. I only wish Canadians had the same culture of making it rain with singles as we do in States or had paper singles for that matter, as you can't exactly throw Canadian dollars on stage when someone is performing but I'm not enough of a baller to tip 5 or 10 bucks for every dance performed on stage.
