Here we are at day 2 of the Vegas extravaganza (aka \"let's kill some brain cells\") and I've already hurt my friend.  Broke her, actually.  While I bounded out of bed the morning after the Forty Deuce experience, she remained in bed moaning.  And not in a good way!\n\nI left her alone that morning to puke it out, sleep it off, or whatever would make her feel better.  I felt so bad about breaking her the night before, I thought that I would treat her to a nice relaxing lunch later at Sensi before our spa treatments.  I couldn't have her yacking on the spa table, now could I?\n\nSensi is a very relaxing place with a variety of cuisine.  Indian, Asian, and plain ole American food were all represented.  She was able to find something hangover friendly along with their home-made ginger ale.  I had something light, too, as I didn't want to feel heavy and gassy on the massage table.  I think they frown on that, in general.\n\nTheir signature drink is delightful!
