This has been our 4th time eating here. Each time has been a different experience and not all have been great. Overall, it's a nice place to eat. The decor looks like an old-style diner & soda fountain. Very appealing and family-friendly. \n\nThe menu is extensive. So many different types of sandwiches: hoagies, melts, burgers, dogs and fish\/shrimp baskets. \n\nUnfortunately, this menu seems to overwhelm the cooks. The past two times I ate there with two of my kids, it took over 30 minutes for us to get our food - way too long. \n\nTo sum it up: good food, good service, good ambiance. Long wait for food.
