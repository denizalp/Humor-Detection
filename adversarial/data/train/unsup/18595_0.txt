Where's the beef?  I am use to more meat in my pho.  I fished out 5 slices...pretty weak!  The price is on the high side considering the size of the bowl & the lack of meat.  Flavor was decent...  \n\nThe springrolls looked like an 8 year old rolled them.  I've made better tasting & more uniform springrolls at home.\n\nThe place is hit or miss on service depending on who's working.  It's actually very good for the most part...the younger kid isn't the one you want waiting on you.  It's a clean place...they just need to iron out the wrinkles.  It's close to me so I guess I will eventually give them yet another shot, but this time trying out their rice dishes & banh mi.
