Solid all around - I've had their carne asada smothered burrito as well as their tacos and breakfast burrito... all were authentic and tasty.  The service was good and so were the chips and salsa.  I don't have anything super clever or original to say about this joint, most of the time if I'm in the area I hit up Los Taquitos.  That said, this is a solid option and nothing I tasted wasn't good!
