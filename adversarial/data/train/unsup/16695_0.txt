When my friend and I felt like having seafood  one evening, a yelp search led us to this restaurant. We ordered popular staples and everything was very good - a shrimp cocktail with plump prawns and a zesty house cocktail sauce, lobster with the requisite butter dip, fisherman's platter featuring batter-fried scallops, shrimp, and fish. For dessert, we had a decadent creme brulee and an amazing flourless chocolate cake. Our vivacious server did a great job helping us make our choices by providing suggestions and detailed descriptions of various items. And seeing the tempting dishes the other servers were bringing to the other tables made me decide to do a return visit in the near future.
