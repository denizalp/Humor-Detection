UPDATE: I got a very thoughtful reply from a staff member on my review suggesting that my unfortunate interaction with a staffer was probably not representative of how things go down overall, even in the cases a bartender feels compelled to make a cautionary note on a requested substitution. AND SO! I am going to happily eat crow and update my review to reflect my experience suppressing memory of that negative interaction. See ya soon, B&T. Let's have Scotch next time.\n\nWhat's quick and dirty on Bitter & Twisted? The drinks are good and fairly priced, the liquor selection is great, and the barstools are above-average comfortable. I had three drinks, two off the menu, and then for the last one I just asked the bartender to make something he thought sounded good. They were all really good! You kinda get the vibe that the place takes itself a bit too seriously, but don't we all in our own way?\n\nI didn't have one, but the Long Island comes in a can, which is pretty cool imho. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSo like, I predicted that the reviews on this place would be largely positive with a few really negative reviews from people complaining about rude staff. Guess how I guessed that?\n\nLemme tell you what had happened...\n\nMy body hates rye. If I consume rye-based alcohols, I break out in hives, my body temperature increases a lot, I get far more intoxicated than I should for the amount consumed, and no one has a good time. Especially not me the morning after when my bowel decides to just murder me from the inside. That said, it seems pretty unique to rye. I can drink bourbon, whiskey, Scotch and have a great time. \n\nSo, I go here with my buddy after catching David Sedaris at the Orpheum, as one does. I naturally want to try the Sazerac, but I ask the bartender if he can make it with bourbon instead of rye whiskey because \"my body has a really weird reaction, and I break out in hives. It's suuuuuuuper lame.\" At this point, I'm jovial. Playful. Kittenish.\n\nThe look I got? Ew. And then in a mildly condescending tone, I got a wee sermon on \"the intention\" of the cocktail and how I shouldn't be disappointed if I mess with the recipe and don't like it. \n\nDudebro, I did NOT just ask you to make me a Vesper with Absolut Vanilla. Calm yourself down. But also, you think I'm just guessing I have a serious inflammatory reaction to rye? You think I'm just shooting in the dark on that? Did you listen to me when I said what I said to you?\n\nI get it. You worked really hard to come up with these recipes. You're not a bartender, you're a purveyor of fine cocktails, and you like your menu so much you put an ISBN on it. \n\nBut like, I just told you I have a negative physiological reaction to an ingredient, and more importantly you did not invent the Sazerac, and let's just talk about that for a second. The Sazerac is a cocktail that was originally made with (and named for) a brand of Cognac and is the official cocktail of New Orleans. Since that time, it has commonly been made with rye and bourbon whiskey as a base, and people have even played with swapping Absinthe for Herbsaint, which is also produced by the Sazerac Company. A bourbon-based Sazerac is not blasphemy. It's part of the drink's history. If you wanna claim purity, make the damn thing with cognac.\n\nI don't care if you acted the way you did because you weren't listening or if you are just that invested in your vision for these drinks (which I turn into pee, by the way). But as a matter of principle, don't tell a customer her health comes at the expense of your artistry.
