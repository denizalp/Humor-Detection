VIBE \nWith the proliferation of new restos and bars opening across the street, The Painted Lady is an older standby that doesn't have to try.  I think that's what works so well with them: they don't have to be dirty hipster to satisfy the Ossington of yesteryear; but they don't have to renovate or be shiny and new to beckon the youth of today. \n\nSo when you walk in, it's really nothing fancy. You've got the nice lounge chair in the front; a tiny patio outside and a bunch of tables and chairs along the side. There's a bunch of paintings and pictures of ahem, ladies so they have the tie-in to the theme.  There's one couch in the back as well, a DJ area and a stage with red, velvet curtains that hide a mural of a peep-show girl. Maybe if you're special and ask, you can see it. There's a mini dance floor if you get into the groove.\n\nThe best part of this place are the lacquered tables. They had a photo\/painting of the Beatles on ours. Tres hip! \n\nI was here on a Friday and the DJ played reggae (Hello, \"I'm in love with a man nearly twice as my age:). Not sure how this worked in with the almost-naked burlesque dancer performing on the bar but you just...go with it? \n\nIf you come here early enough (around 7) on a Friday, you can have a conversation. But the music gets louder around 9:30. \n\nWE DRANK\/ATE \nThis is the deal: cash only; no pitchers. \nI drank my usual Heineken. But they do have Beau's on tap. Beau's! \nThe menu was small but had some great options. I went with the honey and basil-laden grilled cheese. It's by far artisinal, but it hit the spot and was served with honey nuts. Mmmm! \n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nMaybe they can have a body painting theme night? \nOtherwise, it's a fun, unpretentious bar that is reasonably priced. Great first date place.
