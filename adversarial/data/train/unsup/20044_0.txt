The first time we ordered takeout here we were pleasantly surprised. The General Tso's Chicken was fried to perfection, the vegetarian rice noodles were tasty, and the portions were huge. Oh, and they gave us free almond cookies -- yay!\n\nThe second time was a disaster. The orange peel chicken had more batter than chicken, the pork in the pork with snow peas was barely recognizable as meat (too much tenderizer?), and the moo shu pancakes had the texture of a cereal box.\n\nAfter the second experience, we will not be ordering from here again.
