Goldspike is definitely the gem of downtown Las Vegas. With its great location (surrounded by parking and off the main path), awesome food (definitely try the nachos), and great premise, this is the place to be if you are in need of going back to your childhood, but mixing it with alcohol. \n\nBrought here by friends for my 28th birthday I was pleasantly surprised by how big the place was. We played the giant connect 4, giant jenga, and giant beer pong (noticing a theme?), and I even tried my hand at some darts (I sucked). Couldn't tell you how much food or drinks was since I didn't pay, but the waitress came to our table with refills whenever we began to run low.\n\nThe music was great, with the dj playing top 40 hits as well as some classics with a reggae twist.  The people here were super friendly and they had a live band that consisted of some guys from Canada who could sing\/play their hearts out.\n\nThe bathrooms were very clean and the food was piping hot. I thought the addition of girls going around the room hula hooping was dope.\n\nCan't wait to come back, best birthday ever!
