First time here on a whim for lunch with my friend and her daughter.\n\nCustomer service rocked. Loved that our waiter was honest and told us the girls could share one kids meal because the portion is so large. Guess what?! He was right. The girls couldn't even finish it with splitting it. They got Mac n cheese which was extremely cheesy goodness. Thick not runny and I made sure to steal a bite... Hey I had to make sure it wasn't poisoned right!? ;)\n\nUs moms decided upon something light and refreshing since everything on the menu looked heavy. Soup and salad it was. The salad was just okay, the dressing was good. Some type of vinaigrette. It was chopped into tiny pieces with feta cheese, tomatoes, black olives, cucumber an romaine lettuce. Very large. Then the soup was lobersterlicious!! Aka, lobster bisque. Oh my god, I cannot stop raving about it. Creamy, buttery, lobster goodness. It was rich, and delicious. Large portion again. I downed that sucker almost licking the bowl. I will come just for that, for sure!!
