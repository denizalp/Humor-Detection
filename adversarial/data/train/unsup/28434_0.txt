I have found this branch to be quite efficient in processing the teller lines, which are often quite long. \n\nMost of the staff here are friendly, although I have had a few tellers who are not but these have proved to be the exception. My main concern with this branch is there have been several instances where I have been told one thing by a teller (ie: they cannot help me with a certain task, I have to call the 800# for assistance) while when going to another branch immediately after, the tellers were easily able to assist. This has happened at least 2 or 3 times. \n\nAlthough this branch is adequate, I have found it difficult to establish a relationship with the staff due to its size, tendency to be misinformed and the rather \"cold\" vibe it gives off overall. I personally much prefer banking at 500 Yonge.
