Great place if you are looking for a to remodel a house on your own. They have lots of good looking cabinets, flooring options, kitchen tops, and doors.  We use them mainly for the cabinetry.  They have several difference option on the stains and designs.  \n\nThey mainly deal with contractors and condo renovators, so they do not delivery.  It is pick up for yourself only.  But there is a UHAUL rental right down the road, which rents trucks for about 25-30 a day. \n\nBottom line, you can get good quality cabinets cheaper than pretty much anywhere else around town, but it more of a do-it yourself-er place.
