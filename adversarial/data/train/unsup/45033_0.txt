Found this place by accident with my friends when we were trying to hunt down the speakeasy behind Park Road shopping center. We stopped in for a drink and decided to sit on the patio. The patio was super cute at night- music playing, Christmas lights in the trees and an array of different customers. \n\nInside of Sir Edmonds is a true Irish Bar. From to the decor to even the smell it reminded me of a little pub in London. The bartenders were nice and made sure to greet us upon entering the pub. \n\nI didn't try any food, but I would love to try it out and enjoy the patio. The inside was a little too muggy for me, but the patio area is nice and open with plenty of seating!
