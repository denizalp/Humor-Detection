Decent place, willing to work with you. Fighting is typical for any cheap place in town, but it's quieter than the trains. The people are friendly enough.\n\nSome things are sketch, like the 24-hour entry notice that they would be putting a magnet on my fridge, on the same day I pay my rent. I don't need a company magnet and you don't need to enter my home to give it to me.
