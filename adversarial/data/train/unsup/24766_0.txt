I LOVE Kiehls, always have.\nIt reminds me of my mom, the good old days as a teenager at home, having her buy me the products.\nNow I only buy their shampoo\/ conditioners every so often, but love to browse and get samples of new hair and face products.\nService is always exceptional, I'll be and off and on client for life!
