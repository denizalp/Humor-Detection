YELP helped me find this place and am I glad it did. I was welcomed immediately and made to feel like an old time friend.  I'm picky about coffee and like French vanilla creamer.  When I saw there was none.  I resigned myself to no coffee when my waiter gave me some of his private stash.  Thanks Bryan.  Went there twice for breakfast.  My toast came with 3 homemade jams, each better than the next.  The haystack was recommended and I'm so glad I listened; potatoes, biscuits, sausage gravy, eggs and bacon on the side.  Tastes a lot better than it sounds. I would definitely go back when in town.
