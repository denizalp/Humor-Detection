DO NOT BE LATE!!!\n\nI'm more of a musical\/play kinda girl...and i prefer a strong story line. With that being said, the blue man group is a very strange, unique and entertaining show.\n\nHonestly, i don't feel like the performers were particularly talented. they sure know how to keep a beat tho. the music was upbeat and stimulating. the notorious paint effects were pretty cool so don't wear your nicest outfit if you bought the expensive tickets! Also, LOTS OF STROBE LIGHTS! \n\nI still do prefer musicals after watching this. Yet, this was definitely the cheapest GOOD show on vegas. worth a watch. overall, there is very modern and quirky vibe throughout the show. Very entertaining- kept the audience on their feet the whole show and was very interactive. HOWEVER. if i had paid $100 for this...i don't think i would have been satisfied =X\n\n***\n\nTip: We did watch it on a Thursday 10pm showing and it was pretty packed. Student rush tickets, $45 for row k! but more on the side. just go to the box office the day of and ask for them. give them the code GB1 STURUSH and your student ID! No intermission. \n\nFavourites: uniqueness. one of them come out for pictures after the show!\n\nDo not want: tickets are expensive without discounts\n\nLast words: unique!
