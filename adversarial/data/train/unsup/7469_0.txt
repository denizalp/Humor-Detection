This is the Brand New Location in the Southwest Part of Las Vegas!\n\nIt is Across the Street from the Blue Diamond Crossing Mall ( where Kohl's, Target, Ross are, Etc.,) and is Situated with McDonalds right next to it, and the 99 Cent Store across the Parking Lot! \n\nI am a Newbie when it comes to Einstein Bagels...but, as soon as I entered, I was greeted with many HI's & Welcomes...When I wasn't sure of what I wanted,but the Counterperson Brent was more than Happy to Explain what my Questions were. Needless to say...I left Happy! \n\nSince this location is still Very New, Everything is still Very Brand New. There is a lot of seating both in and out on the Patio! And, Free Wifi! \n\nThe Parking lot is Shared with Mickey D's, and 99 Cent Store, It is a Very Good Location, Friendly, Attentive Staff, Clean Establishment....All Pluses in My book! =)
