I HATE going to the Dentist, always have. From the moment I stepped through their door the receptionist was so nice that I almost forgot about the massive amount of pain I was about to endure. Once we got the paperwork straightened out they took me back right away. Being a new patient here the doctor took time to introduce himself and put me at ease. They were kind, supportive, and gentle throughout the entire ordeal.\n\nAnyway, the long and the short of it is that I hate these guys less than any other Dentist I've used before, and I strongly suggest them if you are a fellow dentist-hater.
