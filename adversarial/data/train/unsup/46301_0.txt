Don't waste your money here. First off the staff is not very personable, which to me is something I expect in hospitality. When I was waiting to get a breakfast sandwich there was no one at the window and when they did show up they stood there silently waiting for me to tell them what I wanted.  The lobby furniture is stained, but there is plenty of seating.\n\nAlso, I booked a king bedroom and they said they didn't have any available and gave me a double queen room.  The hand towel on the sink wasn't even folded and there was hair in the washcloths.  The soap dish was not cleaned from the night before and the mirrors were dirty. Also, the curtains\/rollershades were broken and didn't work for one window, causing the lights from all the restaurants below to shine in.\n\nValet is $26 a night, self park available but no in and out. The valet staff was taking a phone call on speaker when I retrieved my car the first time and the second time the valet attendant continued to carry on a conversation with the other worker while taking my keys.\n\nVery surprised Marriott puts their name on this brand of hotel!
