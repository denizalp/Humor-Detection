This place never disappoints, from the ambiance, to the service and the food. We first came here during restaurant week and loved it. We came back tonight and ended up sitting in Emma's section (she was our server the first time also) she's awesome, knowledgable and very nice. Anytime we have asked for recommendations she's been able to give us one. The guacamole is DELICIOUS, fresh and made at the table. Bring your appetite because you get a lot and guarantee to take something home. Even the kids fries are good.
