First time here and will be my absolute last time. First of all the freestyle drink machine has very limited selections available. Them the customer service is very minimal, meaning there wasn't anything that stuck out. Took my order, no suggestions - I had to repeat myself a few times. And then they went on to talk about what ever drama they have going on amongst them. Sad waste of my time. I was going to stay and eat but decided to take it to go.
