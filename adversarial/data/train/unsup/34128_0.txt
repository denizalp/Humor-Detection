This place is seriously awesome! My husband made reservations for my birthday and completely surprised me! Every staff member was extremely nice and helpful and it was so fun!! The food was delicious and it was a little hilarious trying to figure out how to eat without seeing the silverware haha The food is plant based but my meat-eating, picky eater husband loved the food and wouldn't have guessed it was plant based if he didn't know before. Everyone should experience dinning at this gem of a restaurant:)
