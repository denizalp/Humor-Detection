I've only had the calzones, but I've liked them well enough to eat there twice in two weeks, so that says something. \n\nThe menu is extensive (I wonder if they're trying to do too much) and you can buy pizza by the slice, which makes this a viable option for lunch. They still seem to be having some growing pains, so service can be slow, but the folks who work there are very pleasant and friendly. \n\nThe only thing that's missing, IMO, is garlic knots--they are something that I always think of when I think \"east coast pizza,\" and I can't get them anywhere in Champaign.
