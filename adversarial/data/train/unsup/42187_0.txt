We stopped here on our way home.  Plenty of parking.  The neon lights were cool.  I had a burger is was great & cooked as I asked with plenty of onion rings to share. My husband had the club sandwich they use top quality turkey, the fries were a little soggy.  Our server was nice.  The photographer who took pictures was nice not to bother us as we were eating our lunch. We will definitely be back when in Vegas!
