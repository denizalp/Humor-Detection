There is a difference between \"cheap\" and \"inexpensive.\" Skyland is the \"inexpensive\" part with low cost meals that are good quality and good quantity. I love that they are open 24 hours and in this part of town, that's a good thing. Short walk - quarter mile - from the Woodlawn Lynx station as well.\n\nMy daughter and I both opted for breakfast and were quickly served large portions and as much coffee as we could drink. My cheese and mushroom omelet had plenty of both. The hash browns were plentiful though you might want yours a little more well done.\n\nTwo full meals for $20 with tip. Hard to go wrong there!
