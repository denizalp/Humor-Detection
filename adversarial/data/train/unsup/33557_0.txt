El Valle is one of two local Mexican restaurants that we frequent for a casual meal (the other being Salsa's at Sardis Rd. N).  \n\nIt is your typical Ameri-Mexican fare, but with affordable prices and an incredible staff.  They are very nice here - aside from one very interesting birthday celebration involving a napkin full of whipped cream in the birthday girl's face (?!?!?!) - which we'll just forget.  I like to pretend it was a cultural difference, or some sort of flirting. ;)\n\nThe food is solidly good and the margaritas are always perfect. The atmosphere is VERY casual. \n\nThanks to Hugo in particular who always makes our time there entertaining!
