OMG! This place makes the best Jjajjangmyun and Jjamppong! I'm in early pregnancy and crave for Korea Chinese food so bad, asked my husband to take home. My husband said the place was packed and no one asks him but seems like just dine in place. One Korean lady got a call through my husband, and I could tell her what I want and as well as take out option\n\nI'm impressed! They put noodles in separate box, as well as Jjajangmyun sauce and another separate Jjamppong sauce. And Danmujee, onion and Kimchee in separate mini box. All look great and so glad noodles was separately packaged- and were great after traffic jam home!\n\nI started having Jjajangmyun and already I am  too full with generous portion! \n\nI called to say thank you for great take out, but no one answered. I'll definitely try some others next time.\n\nLove their food! Wish this location is close to  where we live. Maybe next time I'll visit with a bigger belly! Thanks for making me feel great, eating great- I badly wanted great taste, even thought I wish I'm in Korea for those food. Glad to find this place!!!
