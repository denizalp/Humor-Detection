I just wanted to swing in and purchase a new apple tv. I approached 2 associates that were off to the side and told me they were not available to help me.  When I asked to see the manager, to my dismay one of the people I approached was the manager.  I told them I just wanted to BUY an apple tv they blew me off.  I will never buy from this location again .
