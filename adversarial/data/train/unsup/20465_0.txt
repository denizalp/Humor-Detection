Carly's is magnificent.  I love it there.  I've been there maybe five times at this point by now and I don't know why I haven't written a review earlier.\n\nI made my way back to Carly's for the first time in maybe two months or so.  For some reason, everything on the menu looked SO damn GOOD.  It took me longer to order than usual.  I'm quick at ordering.  I look at the menu, see something and BAM! it will be in my stomach, being dissolved by acid, very soon.  This time, though, my god.  I wanted to eat everything.  It all sounded so bomb.  I ended up getting a sandwich with salmon on it.  Can't remember what it's called.\n\nThe service isn't the friendliest, but it's certainly not rude or curt.  It's just sort of indifferent which is fine by me.  Hell, in some instances I downright prefer it.  The waitress took our order and gave us our check and filled up my ice tea.  I didn't feel ignored at any point.  That's all I want, man.  Sometimes I feel like service is insincere when a girl my age calls me \"hun.\"  You know what I mean?  I mean, sometimes a chit-chatty type of thing is okay, but for the most part, when I eat out, I'm just gonna chill out.\n\nThe price for what you get is really fantastic.  The sandwich you get isn't the size of a plate, but it tastes amazing and your salivary glands will have a bit of an orgasm.
