I was excited a new independent restaurant opened around the corner from my house. \n\nUpon being seated at Bootleggers, my arm stuck to the table. It was difficult to get anyone's attention to come wipe the table. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/bootleggers-food-and-drink-phoenix\n\nWe ordered the Crispy Rock Shrimp appetizer, which was very tasty, yet a very small portion for $10, for 10 marble sized shrimp. \n\nOur dinner was comprised of Beef Brisket, Turkey Leg and Cottage Fries.\nThe cottage fries were horrible. They tasted like they were a cheap brand, frozen from a bag. In fact, I buy frozen Ore-Ida fries that are far superior. These were below school lunch grade. I suggest the Crispy Ore-Ida Crinkle Cuts. They are fantastic. \n\nThe Beef Brisket was unlike any I've ever eaten before, and I would never eat this one again. It was cut horizontally, against the grain of the top of brisket. It was one 1\/2 inch slice. It looked more like an elongated piece of liver. It was very dry and barely tasted like brisket due to the cut and thickness. The turkey leg was very small, maybe 7\" long and was also quite dry.  I'm no chef, but I can make far superior turkey, brisket and Ore-Ida fries at home. \n\nIt seemed that the kitchen was very backed up. All the tables were full and everyone was waiting for their food, as well as the servers were waiting and starring into the kitchen.  It seemed that the kitchen was struggling with preparing food for the bar buffet, and dinner service.  After the bar buffet was replenished, table service began to flow. \n\nOur server was friendly, yet very inattentive. I had to wave my drink several times to get the servers attention for a refill, and then when it came it wasn't what I was drinking.  I gave up on trying to have it corrected. The servers passed quickly through the tables without looking or acknowledging their tables. \n\nThe table next to us had issues with their service and getting their full order served as we exchanged exasperated glances. It wasn't until after they were ready to leave that the last dish was finally brought to their table. \n\nI couldn't wait to get out of there. If only I could get the servers attention to bring my check.  Finally the server had brought out about five checks, picked them all up and rang them all out slowly at the same time. \n\nI wish Bootleggers all the luck in the world and hope they can make it, and then make it better.
