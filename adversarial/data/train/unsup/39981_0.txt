WAY DISAPPOINTED!\n\nThis used to be one of the best Buffets on the strip. Pricey yes, but good.\n\nAs of 2013, same price but this is what you should expect for your quality dinner:\n- Taco Station\n- Pizza Station\n- Chinese Food Station\n- Soggy Salad Bar\n- Kobe Beef that you cannot chew nor cut\n- Mediocre dry desserts\n- Fruit (whole), tiny - 1in pears, 2in apples\n\nIt wasn't all bad.\n- Limited Sushi Great\n- Roasted Bone Marrow, Yum\n- Prime Rib, good as ever\n- Lamb Chops, fav of the night!\n\nAll in all, I feel although some foods were great, the fact that there were \"fast food\" stations (which did not taste good) was a major turn off. Even the old \"sliders\" they had would have been better. Those were delicious.
