i agree with the other reviews about bailey nelson.  a good range of frames for everyone and this includes sunglasses with or without polarization.  i do wish they had more brighter colours like white, they have a few but not too many.  they had a few off cream ones but they were more for women rather than men.  \n\ni was shocked that i could get a pair of amazing looking frames with prescription, transition and prorgressive for about $350 canadian and remember folks, there is no tax on eye wear.  \n\nthe staff said that the frames are made of acetate and that they were hand made in italy or hand finished.  the staff were indeed not pushy at all.  the inside looked amazing.  very minimal, a few nice looking plants.  i will be back for sure.  this is good value for your money.  \n\nyou cannot request lenses by let's say nikon or essilor etc...they do their own lenses and their own coating.  this is how they save on money i guess.  i guess for the eye wear nerds this won't do.
