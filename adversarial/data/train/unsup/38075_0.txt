1:30pm, no line. We were in and out in 15mins...boom! \n\nOrdered the 12 piece mixed fried and grilled family meal with 3 sides(black beans, campero rice and coleslaw), a medium horchata and a chicken verde empanada to go. For all that we paid $35 and change. The fried chicken was good, not greasy. The grilled chicken was good too, a little too tangy for my taste. The pieces were small especially the teeny tiny wings. As for  the sides, I liked the campero rice the most. It went well with the chicken. The two other sides weren't as successful. The black beans was watery and salty. The coleslaw was too tangy and had too much mayo. The chicken verrde empanada had barely any meat in it, a greasy, flat disappointment. The horchata was resfreshing though. The sauces were ok too. \n\nAll in all, I don't think they lived up to the hype although the chicken was good. I don't think you get your money's worth for what you get either. I'm glad I got to try it but don't think I will be going back for more soon.
