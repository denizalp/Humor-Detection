Ok,  now do not judge.  Normally we do not going to chain restaurants, but we decided to try out the wings at Applebee's.  They have there wings for $.25 per wing after 11pm everyday.  \n\nSo,  the wings were not all that bad for the price.  We ordered them hot and they came out a little spicy.  Also when you order the wings you have to buy 10 to get them at $.25 per wing.  \n\nSince we were at Applebee's the server was really good he did a great job taking care of us.  \n\nIf you decided to go to Applebee's for a late night snack.  You should try out the wings.
