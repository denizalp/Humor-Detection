The Docs and the Team at Hillcrest Dental are exceedingly good at what they do. \"Tactically and technically proficient\", to be sure. But proficiency alone is not what keeps me going back. I am a dental phobic, meaning I would rather walk through fire wearing a jockstrap made of matches than sit in a Dentist's chair. The Hillcrest Team knows this about me, and they are consistently patient and supportive. The business model of a Dental practice is built on a formula of \"X dollars \/ operatory\/ hour\". Even knowing this formula, I have not ever felt rushed or hurried at Hillcrest. To the contrary, they take their time with every patient. And finally, this is a Team of just genuinely nice people. Kind human beingsâ€‹. They not only act as though they care - they really care. If you are looking for a dental practice, go to Hillcrest Dental. You will be glad you did.
