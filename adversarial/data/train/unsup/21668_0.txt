2 ** for the food but I'll bump it up because of those dang biscuits\n5 ***** for the service\n\nI've never been to a Red Lobster before. NYC doesn't have many of these big chain restaurants and I'd been feeling a bit deprived, what with everyone talking about how awesome the biscuits are here. (Funny how nobody raves about the amazing lobster at Red Lobster.)\n\nStephanie C., Kat T. and I went here for lunch just to try the biscuits. And, yes! They are indeed delicious. They're served warm and have a mild cheesy crust with a fluffy interior that pulls apart like cashmere yarn. Be careful, though; the grease on the biscuits is uncontainable and will ooze all over your hands and soak through your napkins.\n\nToo bad the rest of the food that I actually paid for didn't measure up to the complimentary biscuits. The New England clam chowder was gloppy and most likely thickened by flour instead of real cream. The shrimp garden salad was sad, almost like what you'd find in an unreplenished salad bar at 4 p.m. Overall, not a bad deal at $9.99 for the two at lunch but I wouldn't eat it again.\n\nOne thing Red Lobster does right is in training its staff. Every point of contact from the hostess to our server, Joe, was friendly, professional and engaging. Joe is the nicest waiter I've come across in a long time but, more importantly, he does his job well. \n\nHe even gave each of us a bag of warmed biscuits to take home and for that I gave him my eternal gratitude and a 30% tip.
