Ive given them three chances and each time ive left in pain, with a jacked up, cracked up pedi and nails that have broken in less than 24 hours. \nMy pedi right now is shittier than one i could give myself except i paid $40 for it. Forget this place, it's dumpster trash.\nRude women working there too.\nAfter tgeir second strike, I didn't get my nails or any mani\/pedi work anywhere for a year. Tonight's service was the final straw.
