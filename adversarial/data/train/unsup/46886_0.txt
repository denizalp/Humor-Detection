On 4\/10\/17 I went in after two years of membership to cancel my membership. I had been trying to cancel beforehand but uou have to physically go into yhe location to cancel. I go in and they say you have to give a 30 day written notice and sincw your annual fees are coming up l, you will be charged. Here is this paper sign it fill it out and you still have to email it yourself or it will not be cancelled. Tell me how this is convenient for the customer. I went down to this gym which is located in west Phoenix while I live in central Phoenix, and they can't even email or fax over their own cancellation form signes by the manager on duty and myself. Plus let me charge you an annual fee membership that you no longer belong to. On top of thar I call their customer support and all they say is we cant over write policies. Are you serious. All I can say is you're welcome I kept the lights on for you.
