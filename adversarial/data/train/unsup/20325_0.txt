My date and I agreed to meet at King Putt's, their easy-access location just off the 215 & Eastern lay in between her home in Henderson and mine in the Southwest.  The price was right, as couples get in 2-for-1 on Thursdays, one of several deals I found on their website. I grabbed the clubs, she grabbed the balls, and it was through the doors to the course.  Vegas does not have nearly enough mini golf options - especially considering the wealth of local adult courses - and while it would've been more fun to play outside the ancient Egypt theme and black-light features still make this a unique experience for players of any age.\n\nTo keep it interesting she suggests a friendly wager.  \"If you win, you're buying In N Out Burger next,\" referring to the location sharing King Putt's parking lot.  \"I was buying anyway,\" I said, \"and I know what I want if I win.\" I laugh as I shoot over a coy but obvious wink, taking the moment to enjoy the revealing nature of my date's golf attire.  Course playing time is about 30 minutes, not long enough for a full date, but the Eastern Avenue area has plenty of restaurants and bars to fill the rest of the night.  Depending on how fast the family moves in front of you (or how cooperative their kids are being,) you can usually play through if you ask nicely.  While I kept it close to josh her about the bet, there was no way I was losing with the rest of the evening at stake.  Maybe I'll throw the match next time at the jungle-themed Northwest location.
