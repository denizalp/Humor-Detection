As soon as we walk in, someone asks if this is our first time.. I said yes, so they showed me around, they explained the flavors at 39 cents an ounce.\n\nHe said it would be the cheapest yogurt around since they charge the entire weight of the cup of yogurt and toppings together, instead of each topping a la carte like other places. (Which I know that's how they do it at other places, but I don't think at 39 cents an ounce is cheaper). \n\nI got vanilla and chocolate yogurt with hershey kiss and marshmellow toppings. The smallest cup was a 16 oz. cup, I filled it maybe a third up, and it was $3. I'm not a huge yogurt fan, and I don't know how yogurt joints charge, but it seemed like average pricing. Yummy, but average pricing. The kiid loved the u-swirl costume that was being cleaned in the front of the store.
