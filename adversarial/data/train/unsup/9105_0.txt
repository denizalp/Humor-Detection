My gf and I decided to see Phantom since I have not seen it before and wanted to check it out before it closes in September.\n\nThe show was great with all the songs I have heard from Phantom of the Opera before I ever saw the show. They had terrific actors playing the parts of the Phantom and Christine.\n\nThe theater was beautiful with the extra figurine artwork on the side that added extra elegance to the show. You can tell that this theater was built specifically for the Phantom production. Plus there was this huge chandelier just right in the ceiling that was a big part of the show.\n\nTheir were a couple hiccup's as they twice had technical difficulties in which they had to stop the show for a few minutes, but it was still great with the added fireworks. I think that was what caused the difficulties. Also, do wear a long sleeve shirt or sweater as we were advised when we bought the tickets that it can get a little chilly during the production.\n\nMy gf said it was not exactly the same story line as the one she saw in Seattle, but a little more condensed version with better production value added.\n\nOverall I really loved the music and the romance, but it was just great that I got to see it with my gf in a great setting.
