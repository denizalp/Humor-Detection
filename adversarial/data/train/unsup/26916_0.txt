If you've never heard of the keg (aka you're American) it's nothing like outback's steakhouse. it's a classy joint. This location is pretty busy but on a cold friday night, the wait was probably 20 min which isn't bad at all! Not to mention the hostesses wore hot little black dresses and come around with free h'or douvres for people in the waiting area. (Thats right FREE!)\n\nI forgot what our table ordered but I had the bacon wrapped scallops and the baseball top sirloin.\n\nThe bacon wrapped scallops were smaller than I thought but still pretty good. (small as in they were served in escargot pods)\n\nthe baseball top sirloin was fantastic! It's a steak so thick med-rare is as far as they can cook it! SO GOOD!!! YUM!
