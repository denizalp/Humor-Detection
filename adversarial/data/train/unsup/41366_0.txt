If you haven't been to this restaurant in Charlotte, YOU MUST! Huge menu and tapas style, and I have never gotten anything I didn't like! It is a great dinner place for Friday nights before a night out on the town! Up stairs bar get rowdy late at night, so I wouldn't plan a romantic late night dinner here on a weekend, but evening would be perfect!
