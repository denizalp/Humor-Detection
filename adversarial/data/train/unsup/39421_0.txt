We went to Sonoma Grill for brunch.   Service was incredible from a friendly, expert waiter.  He was fun and knowledgeable.  He even brought a coffee to may son at exactly the right time without being asked when he said he would order one later.  You can't get better than that.  The good was very good for brunch.  My son and I had steak and eggs, nicely done. My wife had a layered mound of avocado and crab, very California and really excellent.  The room was uncrowded.  They have a long and excellent wine list, with some of our favorite from trips to Napa and Sonoma valleys.  We had checked out of the hotel and just wanted to linger for some time on the sidewalk cafe.  It was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.
