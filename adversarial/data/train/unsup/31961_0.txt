Delicious and HUGE portions. Atmosphere is great but the customer service is beyond wonderful. Not only was our server, Maha just fantastic by constantly checking on us, great conversation, but so did the managers. All of the food was seriously so scrumptious that we are coming back tomorrow for lunch. This is now on our must eat places when we come to Vegas.
