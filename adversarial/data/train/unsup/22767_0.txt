Horrible. We attend this dump on the 30th.  We came here because it was a bit closer to home than Wonderland's Halloween Haunt and boy was that a mistake. This place is a total joke. I've never seen such lazy and poorly designed 'attractions'. The scarers are not even in costume, literally just wearing tshirts and face paint that looks like it was applied by a toddler. \n\nThe various trailers you walk through look like they were decorated with props bought at a dollar store. This place is so low budget its laughable. We paid nearly 50 dollars for two people, I think they put this place together with half of that as a budget. On more than one occasion we walked into a room and the scarers where just standing there chatting with each other and genuinely looked surprised to see us. I know these kids are paid shit all, but for what we paid to attend this train wreck they could of hired some people that give a shit. \n\nThe Darkness. This was probably the only fun attraction. It really is pitch black. You need to feel along the walls to make your way through. 3\/5 on this attraction. \n\nHouse of Cards. This '3D' attraction was kind interesting. It's sort of like a black light room but the glasses you wear make the poorly spray painted walls slightly pop out. Speaking of the glasses, they are cheap paper ones that are reused over and over. The first pair they gave me was torn to shit and SWEATY. Actually soggy wet with some else's sweat and they expect you to put this on your face. Absolutely disgusting. I returned the glasses for a slightly less used pair. 0\/5 on this attraction \n\nSlasher Wax Museum. Completely crap. Not a single wax figure. This was the new attraction advertised on their website that made us want to go to this dive in the first place. A wax museum haunted house? Sounds awesome we thought. 50 cent plastic masks stuck on poorly made scarecrows. 0\/5 \n\nField of screams. Take about 20 rented metal fences, cover 1\/3 of them with bed sheets and arrange in a sorry excuse for a maze in a open field and you have this attraction. For a bonus, you get to surprise the scarers while they are having a smoke and chatting while standing in the maze. 0\/5, what a joke. \n\nHaunted house. This attractions was clearly the oldest. Moderate props and decor though clearly they have been around for a while. No creativity. Not in the slightest bit scary. 1\/5 \n\nAsylum. There is a bit where you need to push through a inflated tube thing. It was odd... Not scary in the slightest. Added bonus, one of the scarers girl friends was standing in the corner texting on her phone and chatting with the scarer. 0\/5\n\nDon't go here. This is a complete and total waste of money. I cannot believe how shitty this place is. We were hoping for a scare and to see some cool haunted houses\/mazes. All we got was a serious let down.
