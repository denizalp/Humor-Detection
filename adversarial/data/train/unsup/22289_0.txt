Gone downhill over the past several years.  \n\nThe ventilation is terrible.  Nonsmoking rooms smell of smoke. A coworker mentioned the \"scent\" they spray in the casino to cover any odors there reminds her of the lady's room. I realize for some that could, perhaps, be a bonus and I'll try not to judge. \n\nI've tried several restaurants and they are mediocre at best. \n\nThe last straw was after paying hundreds per night plus an additional Resort Fee I get internet service that is useless.
