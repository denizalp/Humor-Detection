Seriously, there should be no debate about this.  If you live in Tempe\/Chandler, this is likely your favorite Italian restaurant.  I've moved away from the area, yet it's still my favorite, and I try to make the trip back whenever my wife and I are craving Italian.\n\nAt risk of sounding like a broken record here, the complimentary bruscetta at the beginning of the meal is a tasty and classy offering.  Otherwise, just sit down and enjoy the wonderful casual Southern Italian fare.  Also, as previously noted, feel free to ask for something prepared a little differently than on the menu.  For instance, one of my favorite orders is the bowtie prima vera in a red sauce, fra diavaola. Not sure if that's the proper name for the dish, but again, this place is casual enough that I don't need to sweat it.  Great food in a great setting!
