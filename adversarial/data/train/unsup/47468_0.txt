Stopped in for lunch today and three of us sat down to enjoy Thai food.  An order of Suki Hang  came with a well cooked, well seasoned whole napkin in the middle of the food.  No idea if the napkin had been used by the cook to wipe his nose or wipe his brow, etc.  The waitress apologized and went to the kitchen to have another order prepared.  The waitress returned in a few minutes to let us know the owner was contacted and allowed for no charge on that one order.  The manager on duty and the owner never came to the table to offer an apology, instead they allowed the waitress to handle the situation.  The incident caused all of us to lose our appetite when we considered what the napkin had been used for and how it made it into the food.  A totally disgusting situation and we have eaten at this restaurant previously and had one other incident of food not being prepared properly.  Look before you eat your meal at this restaurant!
