Such a good, small, cozy place.  Took my mom on a whim she got Pad Thai and and ordered off my normal type of Thai  (massaman) and instead ordered Kao Soy noodle bowl with seafood.  pad Thai was very good but the noodle bowl was really good. The seven was just spicy enough to make you sweat in a good way.  So much flavor, veggies and seafood.  Fantastic service, portion and price.  With wine from nearby Edgewood Town, this was a great place on a cold Monday night.
