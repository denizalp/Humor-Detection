Modern Lighting is like a drag queen's jewelry box.  It's jam-packed with an overwhelming mix of tacky with a few hidden gems thrown in.  The trick spying the fabulous examples of period lighting in the jumble.  \n\nThe styles range from Art Deco to Mid-century Modern.  This is the kind of place I have to avoid because I have a real soft spot for fantastic period lighting and it's an expensive habit, honey.  I end up falling in love with fabulous lighting and then trying to work it in my home.  If only I had a place for the gorgeous Murano Mid-century Modern baby blue and chrome ceiling fixture, it would have gone home with my on my last visit.\n\nDon't expect bargain basement prices because you won't find them here.  The lighting examples here are the real deal and the prices are fair.\n\nMy only complaint is that the shopkeeper can be a bit brusque.  His people skills are lacking a bit, but the range of his inventory and the standout items more than make up for it.
