Good rooms. Amazing breakfast! Cooked to order eggs. Very friendly staff. Rooms look newly updated. Full kitchen and living room. Two room suite. \n\nDownsides: SLOW WIFI and green gross pool. Because of the slow wifi I just can't give this establishment 4 or 5 stars. Wifi is so important these days. I would strongly urge the hotel to upgrade their wifi. Otherwise, enjoyed my stay.
