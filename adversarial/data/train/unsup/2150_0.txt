This place is a pretty good establishment and the atmosphere was pretty nice especially with the Live Singer singing in different languages, it was pretty cool!  The salads they bring were really good and we also had an appetizer of Pickled Mixed Vegetables which definitely lived up to their name. The main Entree that me and my guest both had was the Chicken Kabob, she had it with rice and I had it with french fries. The meat was served with seasoned tortillas with red sauce, a whole baby tomato, and a whole jalapeno pepper to really spice things up! The service was Excellent from the hostess and the waitress. They did regular checks on us to make sure all was OK and they even had good suggestions on the menu items. They even had chicken fingers and chicken wings for those that aren't to into Mediterranean foods or kids. We finished up with some dessert so we chose the Baklava that was served with Turkish Tea and that was Delicious!!! Everything was great, the presentation of all the food was Excellent and I would recommend this great eating establishment to anyone, especially if you like Mediterranean foods.
