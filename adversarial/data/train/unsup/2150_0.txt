Absolutely amazing experience! Took my daughter and 11 of her closest friends here for her 13th birthday party. They did The Collector (serial killer) room. My friend and I were able to watch from the control room. Seriously the most entertaining hour of my life. The employee even told me to bang on the wall and door to scare the heck out of the girls. We will definitely be back!
