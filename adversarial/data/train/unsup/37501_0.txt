I used to come here quite often on my trips to Las Vegas, but this recent time has made be rethink this place as a normal destination. This service has become rather lacking even when the restaurant is empty. Then there's the issue that they seated us in the only spot in the restaurant next to a bucket of dirty dishes when there were so many other seats available. This place has gone down hill and I wouldn't not recommend anyone come here for any reason.
