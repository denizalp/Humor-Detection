Currently my favorite night club in Las Vegas.  The pyrotechnics can't be topped.  Amazing DJ set as well as ceiling panels that go along with the music.  When you finally get to the center of the dance floor, it feels amazing.  Crowd is good and energetic.  Club opened at 10:30PM and took us about 20 minutes to get through guest list. I totally love their re entry because it's very fast, easy, and painless.  And best, its literally 10 feet away from table games so you can take a break from the club to play and drink without having it be a long endeavor.
