Celebrated my 21st birthday at Bottiglia. I am still in shock at how special they made my day! Our server was Raul and he was very attentive to our needs, always making sure our drinks were filled and table was cleared for the next round of apps\/entrees. Raul was very knowledgeable about the menu and was very helpful in helping me to pick out some yummy drinks like the Bellini (one of my favs). We started with several appetizers that were sent out ((Thanks Mary & Chef Josh))!! The calamari was sooo good & crisp I am going to order every time! For entrees I split the bucatini (I recommend adding shrimp!) with one of my friends and it was perfect size for us since we filled up on the apps. My friends bought a nothing bundt cake for me & Raul had it cut & brought it out to me with candles and sang! Thank you Bottiglia for celebrating with me!!! Can't wait to do it again!
