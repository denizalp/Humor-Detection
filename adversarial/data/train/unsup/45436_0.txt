The best vacuum store in Phoenix HANDS DOWN!! They sold me a reconditioned vacuum and it was as good as new. I get my bags there too. Appreciate their environmental views (reuse instead of throw it away) and that they are a family owned business. If you need your vacuum serviced, to buy parts\/vacuums, or accessories this is the place to go!!
