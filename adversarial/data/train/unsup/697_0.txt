This was an average car wash.   I got the basic wash inside and out for $16.  That's a pretty standard cost in and around Phoenix.  I also had them do a wax for $40.  This is where I felt a little irritated. For $40 additional and about 30 mins of their time, I felt like my car looked no better than it does when I get a regular wash.  I wouldn't come back because of this. \n\nThe facility looked clean on the inside, but smelled weird.  They have wifi.  However, there was no internet access.  Albeit, It just occurred to me that maybe there was a warning and consent page where I needed to consent to using the internet.\n\nI could do the same wash in the same amount of time.  So for me this is a no go again.\n\nReturn Factor:15%
