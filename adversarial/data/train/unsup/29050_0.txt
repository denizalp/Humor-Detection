Not sure who owns this location but i only can assume they are a total monster to work for.\n\nThe two girls at the counter suggested something with every transaction, something i definitely am not accustomed to at Subway.\n\nLiterally everything to the point they are almost arguing with you, and they did this with every customer that walked in.\n\nLarge size, extra cheese, extra bacon. Little much.
