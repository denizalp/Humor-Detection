I put off going here for the longest time because I'm the biggest glutton for classic frozen desserts: the Western is basically my childhood in a cup, with a cherry. Then again, most of middle America can probably say that as the combination of flavors are basically every great sundae you've ever had.\n\nMenu is a variety of sundaes (Western and Sprinkles varieties are faves), cones or cups with their current flavors (they never seem to have Blue Moon!), and various beverages- I will say that most sundaes have some sort of nut on them, so be clear to order accordingly if you have an allergy! And give me your extras. ;)\n\nService is polite but somewhat less than stellar- if theres' a line 12-deep and 3 people in the building, perhaps they should have more than one person making each order one at a time. Just a thought.\n\nPrices are a slight bit higher than I expected: the regular sundaes come to just over $6 with tax, but it's a size you can share. Those saying this is in a seedy area need to get a grip, it's  literally one building off the actual LV Blvd. Keep your wits about you.
