An event well run, so you can run well.\nThis is one that I would highly recommend to anyone, whether you walk or run the course.  Not only is there a half marathon (13.1 miles) and a marathon (26.2 miles) offered, but also a 5k (3.1 miles) and 10k (6.2 miles).  These options mean that you can enjoy the great outdoors of Lake Mead according to your fitness level.  \nThis year was my first time doing the event and I'd gladly do it again.  Why?  The course begins at Boulder Beach, then participants follow the paved trail to the Historic Railroad Trail with those cool tunnels.  Beautiful views of Lake Mead can be seen along the way.  We were blessed with fantastic running weather:  no wind, no rain, and not a cloud in the sky.  We continued on to a parking lot that overlooks the Hoover Dam and this is the turn-around for the half-marathoners back to the finish line at Boulder Beach.  The full marathoners do this loop twice!  \nA great race for locals that's not crowded.  The volunteers were great and there's a nice little spread of recovery food at the end: pizza tastes really good after running 13.1 miles!
