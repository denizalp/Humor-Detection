I just expected so much more and was kinda disappointed. We were seated next to the kitchen and it was noisy and chaotic. \n\nWe ordered family style and had the fried chicken and waffles which was just okay for being their specialty. I have had much better fried chicken and waffles. We also had the fries, Brussels sprouts, and mac and cheese. Nothing wowed me and wasn't much above average. After all the good reviews, I expected so much more!\n\nI will say that the service was very good. The server took our order but that was about it besides to bring the check. Our waters were refilled and dishes were removed from the table from the server assistances and they were excellent.\n\nI don't know that I would go back given all the options in Vegas.
