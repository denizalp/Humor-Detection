I can only comment on eating here at about 1:30 am, but I think it is a solid 4 stars, maybe 4.5.  My friend and I arrived in Vegas pretty late and were looking for a meal, not just a crappy fast-food snack. We trekked from the Luxor to NY NY to find it, and I'm glad we did.  I ordered a choose your own omelet, prepared as scrambled eggs, with spinach, shallots and cheese. It came with cheesy potatoes and toast. The portion was huge, 4 eggs!, but it was tasty.  My friend ordered the Chicago dog, and she enjoyed it too. Our server was friendly, and all in all, a great dinery type place to try.
