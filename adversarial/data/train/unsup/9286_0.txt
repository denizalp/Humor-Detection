I volunteered at the AZ Humane Society this past Sunday and it was an unforgettable experience.  \n\nFirst, I was surprised with the facility itself, which was incredibly new and clean... and huge.  They shelter dogs, cats, rabbits, and even horses.  The dog kennels were particularly impressive, as every dog has a decent-sized personal \"home\" with indoor\/outdoor access, a bed, and a water fountain.  There is a large playground out back, where volunteers can take the dogs out to play and give them some exercise.\n\nThe staff was incredibly devoted to these animals and seem to do everything in their power to give them second chances and find them new homes.  \n\nI look forward to volunteering again, and am thankful for all of the work that these people do.
