If there was 0 stars, that would be too many for this scam company! DO NOT USE THEM!!!! They work with home warranty companies, and have either figured out a way to snow them, or they are in cahoots with them to ensure they keep their relationship. Either way, they are totally without shame. They intentionally wrote up my repair order to be sure our repair would not be covered by the warranty company, and rudely scolded my husband for not properly cleaning and maintaining it every 6 mo. Like everyone empties their huge frig, drags it out, takes it apart, gets a special brush and cleans the compressor, and if you do not, then anything that goes wrong with it is essentially your fault! All refrig. has problems, some more than others, but compressors do burn out, especially in a 15 yr. appliance. So why specify that we were responsible? Obviously to please the warranty co. and not to be concerned with the customer's needs. Realizing we were in need, as we threw out hundreds of dollars in spoiled food,  They offered to fix it for almost $700 though...thanks a lot:(\n\nAfter paying for a 2nd opinion, we find out we have a \"No Clean\" compressor (common knowledge to other repairman) and that what they stated about lack of care was definitely not true and they did so knowingly, was proof that Dave's was most definitely pulling a fast one! Additionally they were way overcharging for the repair, as I was quoted $450 for the job. \n\nThere were so many red flags here-they show up in a beat up old pick up (so the review about the maniac driver holds true as there are huge dents) , the repair woman (1\/2 owner) is rude and flat out lies about the repair, and then never returns any phone calls. So to be perfectly clear....DO NOT USE DAVE'S AC REPAIR FOR GODSAKE, THEY ARE A MAJOR RIP OFF!
