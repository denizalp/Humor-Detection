Though the chips and salsa are not complimentary, they are only about $3 and are pretty tasty. It is served with a red and a green salsa; the green is a bit milder than the red and they were both fresh tasting. The tacos themselves were good. I had the carne asada and the carnitas. The carnitas were good, but the meat itself was a bit bland. It was topped with a crumble of chicharones, which was a good offset to the tender meat. The carne asada had very tender and flavorful beef and it was tasty. Between the two tacos, I preferred the carne asada. \n\nWhat I did like about the tacos here was that they were medium sized tacos and not your tiny, street taco size. Overall their tacos were good.
