Love this property and Catherine was AMAZING the entire stay.  WAS AMAZED at how good the food was at their restaurant downstairs, Palette ?. The wing and steak sliders were great. \nThe only downside is its a little too close to the bad part of town. I was not worried nor have I ever had any issues BUT I would not want my wife to stay there on business alone.
