I love the Wynn though I actually slightly prefer the Bellagio (I know, shocking, right?!)...\n\nLOCATION: Conveniently located across from a great shopping mall but not central enough on the Strip in my opinion\n\nPRICE: (same as Bellagio) good if your uncle can get you the gambler's casino rates\n\nCLUBS: Tryst is amazing!!! I love the huge waterfall, outdoor tables, multiple bars, good dj's, etc\n\nRESTAURANTS: Fabulous! Both Asian restaurants are superb, the pool cafe is amazing (especially the huge Chinese chicken salad), the little casino cafe has pretty good sandwiches and salads, and I'm sure everything else is great too\n\nSHOWS: Cirque de Soleil show is awesome!\n\nCASINO: Love it! Usually the minimums are pretty high but I found a $5 craps table because a high roller had reserved it and requested the minimum be $5 to keep it busy... tend to be lucky at the Wynn too and the drinks come out fast!\n\nPOOLS: Main pool gets very busy but it's fun to swim 1\/4 mile (or longer) extreme laps! The VIP pool is small but much less busy\n\nGYM: Expensive (about $25\/day) but nice, very clean gym with good equipment and TV's!\n\nVIP SUITE: Amazing! Great mini cookies, wine, beer, truffles, coffee, tea, pears, etc at most hours of the day. They didn't say anything about us being there most frequent visitors...\n\nDECORATIONS: Beautiful flowers!
