I don't normally write reviews, but recently I was at ONCU and was really impressed with the customer service. I was helped by Marco Wibowo. I was looking for auto loan information and he jumped to help me and answered all my questions. I walked away knowing more than when I walked in. I'll be back for sure. The interest rates were good, but the customer service was stellar.
