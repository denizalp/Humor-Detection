I only stopped in for a smoothie, but what the heck. It was a damn good smoothie. The fruit mix was brought to life by just the right amount of ginger, and it was quite refreshing and filling.\n\nIf I had the chance (unlikely), I'd stop back. It was accessible off of the local light rail, and quite large and new-age-y. Not a cheap place by any stretch, but if you're up for indulging in all-vegetarian health food I'd check it out. If you just want a quick smoothie, I'd definitely check it out.
