Getting a platinum blonde with my naturally dark hair color is difficult to say the least. I scheduled a partial highlight with Erin and she did a terrific job. She knew how to handle a hair color as dark as mine and in a way that didn't take all day to boot! I was definitely impressed! To top it off, once my hair color was complete I had two people blow dry my hair at once. Totally dreamy! Thank you for the great experience.
