Really amazing place. My friends and I went there for lunch randomly (I wanted to watch a world cup game) and we were pleasantly surprised. Friendly service, reasonable prices, and the food was fresh and delicious. I got the brazilian feijoada dish (basically black beans, meat, and rice) and it was filling and tasty. We liked it so much we returned for dinner the same evening! Highly recommend.
