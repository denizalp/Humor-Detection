I love Cirque, and I was excited that I was able to get seats to Zumanity, especially the seats I was able to get!\n\nThe theater is draped in red velvet, a sumptuous feast for the eyes, an invitation to seduction, and that is just what you're going to get with this show. Sensuality reins supreme from the opening moments when the acts parade in, one at a time or in twos, the sound of latex echoing in your ears as they amble past. \n\nTwo bawdy babes - sisters offering up delights tease and tempt with their ample curves, their laughter a playful caress on the senses. The giggalo embraces a Milf and invites her to a seat on his face... much to her blushing surprise and our chagrin. The Swingers tease the audience with their audacity, and offer up bananas to a gentleman in the audience, will he accept?  There are just some things that you have to see to believe. \n\nFrom a chain trapeze, to a caged high heeled tango, to the self inflicted bondage suspension, each act is more delicious and arousing than the next, even if it's not your particular cup of tea. Eddie is the mistress of the evening, paired with a great band and 2 delightful singers that set the tone. This is a show not to be missed. \n\nYou'll want to see this show with someone you're attracted to, because the blood will be pumping and pheremones too. If you're easily offended, a prude or just not that interested in sex and sensuality, this is not for you, go see some one else. Maybe Carrot Top.
