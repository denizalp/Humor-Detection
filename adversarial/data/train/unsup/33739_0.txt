Customer service very bad. Food very very slow. 40 minutes to get one out of 12 food to come out. Another 30 minutes before most of what we ordered came. Asking for the check took 15 minutes. Friend ordered beer and they forgot about it. Waiters need to retake training and kitchen staff needs to chop chop. Food was good and thats it. If you need good service dont cone here.\n\nTL;DR horrible horrible service. Only reason i gave 2 stars is because the food was good.
