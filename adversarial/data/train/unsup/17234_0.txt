Spa life gets pricey. I completely agree that a bit of self-indulgence is good. However, I found a great experience via Groupon! One hour Swedish body for $80 ($125). Update, no Groupon available. \n\nMade the outcall appointment to my hotel with Angela. Showed right on time with her massage table in tow on a cart. We chatted a bit about my wellness and areas I would like therapy on. Angela moved some furniture around and set up shop. \n\nAngela is a small woman, yet uses her body weight and physics to produce deep pressure where needed. She found many pressure points that needed a work. Pain yes, but a burst of relief as well. Angela could even tell hot spots by touching muscles from old sports injuries. \n\nWe talked more about wellness and my emerging experiences. She offered some advice and reference materials to read or website. \n\nA pleasant time! I was sure to tip her on the full price of service and her hotel parking.
