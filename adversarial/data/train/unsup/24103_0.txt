Food: 4\/5\nDonuts: 5\/5\n\nSo why the 1 star? \n\nWhite Lily diner is a fairly newcomer in Riverside; their donuts and buttermilk pancakes are delicious. Overall, the food, vibe, and donuts make it a good brunch destination.\n\nThis negative review is in response to how management handled the following situation. \nMy friend and I were having a great time until it quickly went very sour upon finding a very cute DEAD LADYBUG in her hashbrown. \n\nWhen this was addressed with our server, she deferred it to the diner manager who only responded with a blank stare. Instead of being apologetic and immediately removing the plate, she responded with, \"Well ,what would you like me to do about it?\" \n\nWell, I don't know. You're in the service industry, allegedly, and perhaps this kitchen might clearly need a health inspection, so this means you should either, 1. Immediately remove the plate & bring us food that's not contaminated with dead bugs and, at minimum 2. Not charge us for this item.\n\nThe manager acted as though she did us a favor by replacing the dish. When the bill came, we noticed that we were still charged for the item and decided to bring it up with her again to simply express that, while we would gladly pay for the dish, from a CUSTOMER SERVICE standpoint and good business practice, the situation was not handled properly at all.\n\nThe manager gave us the most horrendous attitude and acted defensively. She even had the audacity to tell us that this was a \"family run\" business and them giving us a new dish was costing them money.
