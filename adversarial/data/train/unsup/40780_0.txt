I lived in the apartments right next door to Scramble and went there every morning for coffee.  Not only is their coffee delicious, but their food is AWESOME.  The staff is young and hipster-ish, but very nice.  Never had any problems with service or food.  The coffee is a little pricey IMO ($2.61 for a cup) but other than that, this is one of the best breakfast places around!
