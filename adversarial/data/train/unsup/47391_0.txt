We love Morris Ramen. We've been here a few times for date night and it's perfect. My boyfriend loves the Morris Ramen bowl. The spicy ramen was my favorite, it had the perfect amount of heat and the flavor was to die for. Perfect with a shot of soju! The atmosphere here is awesome, relaxed with good vibes and cool customers.
