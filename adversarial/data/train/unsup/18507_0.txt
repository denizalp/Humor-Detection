Worst strip club ever! Over priced drinks! Man-faced and fat strippers! We were there 1.5 hours and not one stripper approached our table or any table in out vicinity! Not that I would have wanted to get a lap dance from a man faced cow, but I did have a pocket full of cash and a drinks in me, so I probably would have. Too bad for them. I am also an Uber driver and I can tell you I will NOT be suggesting this place to ANY of my customers! Sonny's in Chandler is a better place and Sonny's is skank city!
