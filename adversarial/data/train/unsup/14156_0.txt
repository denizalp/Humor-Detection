Ugh. \n\nCame here with a date who said Thai One On was his usual lunch spot (Why??). It was Thursday night and the restaurant was mostly empty.  I ordered Pad Thai, and was presented with a generous lump of orange mush. The dish was comprised of dry noodles that broke when I tried to pick them up. \n\nAs my date talked, I noticed movement behind his head. Upon closer inspection, I saw it was a shiny brown insect creeping up the wall. I paid and got out of there.  \n\nMy date asked in the parking lot how I would rate the evening. I can't say much about him, but the restaurant gets a big fat F!
