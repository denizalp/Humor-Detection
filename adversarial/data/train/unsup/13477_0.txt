(Lyrics - Alison Kraus - Baby, Now That I Found You)\n\nGladly\nnow that I've found you\nI won't let you go\nI'll order food around you\nand I Yelp you so\nGladly even though\nI think I'll try you now....\n\nGladly\nnow that I've found you\nI won't let you go\nI'll order food around you\nand I Yelp you so\nGladly even though\nI think I'll try you now\nI think I'll try you now oh, yeah\n\nThe owners of Citizen Public House presents; The Gladly, located in the Biltmore area just west of the shopping complex. The Gladly is a modern American restaurant with an urbanized feel. I came with my foodie gang, and yes like the cheesy Broadway gang we sing and dance....when you're a foodie, you're a foodie you're a foodie - wink! (See Westside Story)\n\nWe started with their signature Chopped Salad; I mean com'on it's the best in town and well known at that and if you don't know; know it now! Our appetizers concluded with the Lamb Ribs and Vietnamese Pepper Shrimp. I didn't really cared for the ribs since it was tad bit chewy and overcooked and there was nothing Vietnamese about the peppered shrimp. I miss my Chopped Salad....\n\nMoving on to Entrees, I ordered their Pork Chops, which was tasty and nicely cooked to perfection. I like anything with a raisin compote! My friends around ordered their Duck Meatloaf and thought it was phenomenal! I tasted it and thought it somewhat gamey. Not my cup of tea. Overall, the experience of The Gladly was fun and the service was tops. I wasn't too blown away by the food, but it's not to say it's not worth the visit. - Enjoy!
