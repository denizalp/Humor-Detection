I went in here to get some takeaway. I had a very basic pasta that was not really worth the effort to me. I was really hoping it would be good, as my co-worker had recommended it to me. But I just found the pasta to be bland and not really flavourful. I've been to Italy now and had some really authentic pasta so perhaps it's tainted my palette. Because I'm sure a few years ago this would have been fine to me. \n\nThis just tasted really bland and boring. Nice atmosphere inside and decent customer service. You can also buy some ingredients here to make your own Italian food at home.
