If you want to watch more than 8 people in any given night make total asses of themselves, indulge in stiff, cheap drinks, compete in a mess of bar athletics, or stand in a corner alone being judgemental, Patty's is the place for you!  \n\nI love this bar.  Sure, I'm a tad weirded out by it almost every time I cautiously enter but whatever, adventures in bar hopping never hurt anyone.  And usually, once I hop into Patty's I'm there for the long haul.  \n\nTheres a whole slew of randoms here--some \"Scottsdale\" types, some biker types, frat boy types, your grandfather, a homeless pregnant woman...a melting pot of boozers, all out to have a good time.  \n\nIts an outdoor-but-indoor establishment so those of you who are out to destroy your lungs and my evening by puffing on Newports all night, youre free to do so here, without my complaining.  Drinks wont break the bank and you can dance your little heart out to a wide range of tunes.  \n\nLeave your snot attitude at the door (or dont, most patrons here are too drunk to care about your Choos getting stained by their spilling red headed slut), Pattys isnt the cleanest or most trendy spot in Old Town. Which makes it one you simply cant pass up.
