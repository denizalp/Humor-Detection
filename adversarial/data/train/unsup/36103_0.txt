I was here about a month ago with some vegetarian and lactose intolerant friends. The food was surprisingly good. I'd typically go without meat than eat imitation meat because seriously, what good could possibly be in something that fake? However, this time, I went with a thai peanutty veggie (non)chicken bowl with noodles.\nI was impressed! But I should have gotten brown rice instead of the noodles.\nAfter that, we shared a tsoynami (cute- it's their vegan milkshake thing) and the (vegan!) cookie dough in it was amazing. I'll be back eventually!
