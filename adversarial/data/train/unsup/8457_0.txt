I stopped in for a casual lunch last weekend with my mom and my son.  Immediately upon being seated, I noticed that the salsa dish was dirty.  Then my mom noticed her water glass was dirty and her fork.  My fork was also dirty.  And I'm no clean freak either, there were visible food remnants on these items.  If my son hadn't been so hungry we likely would've left.\n\nThe waiter was very apologetic and nice, so the 2nd star is for him.  The food was not terrible, just unmemorable.  The best part of the experience was the warm chips, decent salsa, and my cold Corona.
