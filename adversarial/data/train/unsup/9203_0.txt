Thank God for Kuhn's. Seriously, after having to survive on Foodland, the only \"neighborhood\" grocery store in Mt. Washington, this is a welcome change. I actually was excited to move to Dormont knowing we'd potentially have a better place to grocery shop locally.\n\nKuhn's has absolutely surpassed Foodland. It's clean, has most everything I need and it's at the right price. I'm actually surprised how much variety they offer in such a \"small\" space. Small being the operative word, considering most Giant Eagle's are ginormous. \n\nI've even discovered new products here, like my delicious Lara Fiber Bars. I'm surprised at the nice gourmet cheese selection, the big deli area and even a counter for fresh seafood. So now I can just run down the block if I need to pick up something quick or do my whole week's shopping here. It's glorious! \n\nThe only thing I wish for is a better parking lot. Since I'm coming off Dwight Ave it's nice to sneak right in. But coming out is another issue. There's only one way traffic around the parking lot. So you're usually stuck waiting behind cars trying to park and pull out. This is very minor though... just an impatient person talking here.\n\nThe main point.. it's WAY cheaper than Giant Eagle! Neighbors rejoice!
