Blueberry Pecan flapjacks, that is all!\n\nOf course it wasn't named Hash House for its flapjacks, so I guess I'm gonna recommend trying the hash as well. Portions are huge, enough to share. Service was good. Our server, Mark, was very attentive although I didn't like how he brought the bill over when we weren't even halfway through our meal.\n\nGo right after it opens at 8am, it gets pretty busy even for a weekday.\nYou can get Total Rewards points for eating here.
