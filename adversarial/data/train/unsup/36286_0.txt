Awful.  Do not do business with this company, there is nothing \"Dependable\" about them.   Not only did they not meet the estimated arrival date of 14 days, but when we finally reached a customer service person (as no one returned messages left), we found out the car had never even left our drop off point, and we have no assurance of when it will be shipped at all.  We have no idea when we will get our car, and there seems to be no sense of urgency on the part of this company to tell us when and how they are going to make it happen. \n\nThis company was referred to me by a professional moving company, and I am sorry I did not check the Yelp reviews first.
