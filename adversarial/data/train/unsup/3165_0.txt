Wanted to see what all the hoopla was about at Singing Pandas.  The place is newish -looking with nice booths and tables.  Looks really clean too.  \n\nWe had two lunch specials, Shrimp with lobster sauce and Orange chicken.  We asked that the orange chicken not have breading on it.  Each special came with chicken egg drop soup which was delicate and flavorful, a vegetarian egg roll and plain fried rice (no meat).  The shrimp with lobster sauce was made with black bean sauce, fresh medium size shrimp and onions and peppers. Unfortunately it was so salty that it is now 9PM and I am still drinking water.  The chef has to lay off the salt since black bean sauce is a naturally salty product.  \n\nThe orange chicken was indeed made without the breading as requested, but the sauce had a \"ketchup-y\" flavor to it and was not enjoyed.  The fried rice was freshly made but not very flavorful while the vegetable roll had lots of veggies and a nice ginger flavor.  \n\nThe prices are very fair and the staff was really attentive, friendly and polite which is one of the reasons  they will do very well.
