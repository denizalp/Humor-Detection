This is how I like to party. Loud dancey music, crazy cheap drinks, good vibes and a good time. I recently visited this place on my last trip to Montreal and was very impressed. Got there around 11:30 ish and we were able to sit at the bar, but soon after it got packed. It seems like groups of people come and go in waves so it's really crowded and 5 minutes later it isn't so bad. I'll be back next summer to party like a rockstar.
