Food is great! If you get there early enough you don't have to wait 45 plus minutes for a seat.. what I don't understand is why the patio is closed? My husband and I went out for lunch yesterday hoping to sit outside in this gorgeous 70 degree weather and they have the patio closed for no reason.. makes absolutely no sense.  Open your patio!! The weather is gorgeous people don't want to be stuck inside.\n\nThe owner responded to my post about the patio and cleared things up. Very professional! We will be back soon.
