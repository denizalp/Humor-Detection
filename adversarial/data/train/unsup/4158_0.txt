\"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.\" - Hippocrates\n\nSince the discovery of fire by distant Homo Erectus circa 600,000 BC, we have been striving to satisfy our tongues with great food. It is no coincidence that one of the first evidence of fire was utilized for cooking food. Of course, we have come far from our perilous exodus from the caves and since perfected the preference of our tongues. Joeys defines the pinnacle of our endeavor for excellent food that draws a sharp contrast to our infancy of cooking wild rabbit back in that distant cave.\n\nHippocrates is often coined as the first medical doctor, he conducted primitive research and developed ethical philosophy of medicine. Although many of his hypotheses are now long proven false, he did get one thing right: \"let food be thy medicine\". If you require a dose of good food as your medicine, Joey's can certainly be your pharmacist. Their flatbread pizza is colourful and flavourful. Their mushroom pasta is bold, earthy and filling. Their Paella is crispy and full of flavour. The apple pie dessert melts on your tongue. Their staff are attentive and friendly, they treat you like you are one of their friends. Great atmosphere with lively crowd. The only small change I would like to see is less saltier food.\n\nLet food be thy medicine and let Joey's supply thy medicine.
