I'm not one to purposely buy anything overly spicy ( as in hot) but the bibimbap was liberally doused with hot sauce. Needless to say, I powered through it because it didn't take away from all the deliciousness happening in my bowl. Fried sunnyside up egg, mushrooms, fluffy white rice ect. . . It was very filling.  My bf loved his thick dandan noodles, which surpassed my meal in the heat catagory. He also sweat it out and finished his bowl clean because the food of Eats of Asia is just that good.
