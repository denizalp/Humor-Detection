I love Vinny B., our salesman! He's been our go-to guy since moving to Las Vegas 3 years ago. Vinny always takes care of us, and gives us his full attention. Vinny is great with answering our questions, and always calls me back whenever leave him a voicemail. 5-Stars for Vinny! \n4-Stars because sometimes the selection at RC Willey seems outdated... sometimes when I call Customer Service, they are rude as hell! and sometimes... other sales people judge a book by it's cover and treat us differently or don't offer help because we look like we don't have money. EH! It doesn't bother me much, because we only buy from Vinny.
