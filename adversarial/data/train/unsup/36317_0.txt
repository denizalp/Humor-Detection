sorry to say but the super-caffeinated coffee I came here for (Starbucks generally has twice the caffeine of other outlets) tasted extremely harsh.  I get milk and sugar  with it to take the edge off but  still I had a taste  in my mouth that seemed like pipe scrapings mixed with bug spray.  I know that's not nice to say but this was my second attempt at getting something tasty.  Consumer Reports said it rated at the bottom of their test because of the harsh taste but I did not believe CR.  Now I think they may be right.  \n\nThe wait time was also very long but I don't mind that -- I just want a good tasting coffee that won't taste like s***.
