Believe the hype, friends!  Dukes of Air is everything you want in an air conditioning company -- espcially in AZ where it's practically a matter of life or death. Honest, reliable, friendly, competitively priced, clean, professional, highly trained and knowledgeable... and with the added bonus of actually CARING about the customer!  Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, from the office ladies to the owner (who also happened to be the technician who quickly responded to our initial call) to the installation techs who spent two full days in our home -- they were ALL genuinely concerned with our comfort and making sure we understood all of our options and every step of the process.  In fact, we can't thank our installation techs, Adam and Rene, enough!  They were patient with our questions and literally left the place cleaner than they found it. Seriously. We even ran into a few snags along the way (expected, as this was a BIG job) but these guys were calm, cool and collected and handled everything seamlessly. They were kind, polite and hustled everywhere despite working outside and in our attic for most of the 114 degree days. I really felt bad for them...but they somehow smiled the entire time. Everything that John (the owner) had initially promised was fulfilled... and then some. Our new system works better than we ever imagined possible!  Honestly, we couldn't be more thrilled with having hired Dukes of Air.  They are a fantastic team and they are the ONLY ones we will call from here on out!
