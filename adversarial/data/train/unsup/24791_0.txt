I'm glad to see a shop pop up just next door to My Sister's Closet dedicated just to men. They used to have a few racks inside of MSC, but now have expanded their men's collection into the spot where their furniture shop once was. I guess furniture didn't sell quite so well.\n\nLet's face it, I never could find anything in the one rack of stuff in my size, and I'm not real sure I wanted to ever admit shopping for myself at a place called My Sister's Closet anyway. Now that I can check into \"Well Suited\" I don't have to hide my check-in's anymore. ;-). \n\nFind nice to new quality (not actually new, but new like) men's apparel here for a fraction of the original cost. Shoes, Suits, Shirts, Wallets, Watches, and Pants, you'll have a difficult time NOT finding something that piques your interest.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix, time to suit up!
