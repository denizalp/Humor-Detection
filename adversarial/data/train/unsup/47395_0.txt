One of my favorite Sephora's in town. I've had a wonderful experience every time. Aside from it being pretty nicely sized, the staff has always been really kind and genuinely helpful! There's this one super sweet and beautiful asian woman whose name escapes me now (sadness), that made one of my visits so memorable just for being a freaking ray of sunshine. And it was real because I had my dog with me, who was sweet to her immediately. She's only like that right away to people with that kind of energy. This store also has a large selection and is usually well stocked!
