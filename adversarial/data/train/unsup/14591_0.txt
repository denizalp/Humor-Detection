One of my favorite places in town for breakfast. \nIt's quick (once you're seated).\nIt's greasy (like breakfast from a skillet should be).\nIt's no-nonsense (hash, taters, eggs).\nIt's served with a smile (and usually some awesome conversation).\nIs it super local? Super sustainable?\nNo.\nIt's a diner. \nBut a delicious one.\nAnd there are planes!
