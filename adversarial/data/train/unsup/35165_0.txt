I guess I'll start off by saying we didn't even eat here... but my yelp is mainly for their reservations coordinator!!  The way you make reservations here is so weird.  You submit a request and I guess you are supposed to wait for someone to get back to you.  I submitted it at the beginning of the week and didn't hear back from them at all... so I called the reservations line towards the end of the week to see if I could make it there... and it's not a direct line to the restaurant... it's to a place that makes reservations for you to a lot of different restaurants in vegas and even clubs.  The person who was making my reservations was really rude and arrogant.  He told me I already had a reservation for that same day... but how was I to know?  I never heard back... I only got an email the day I requested saying that they would get back to me but they never did. My friend had also submitted a reservation request for the same allotted time and she never heard back from them either.    We were running late and decided not to eat there that day, and I didn't call back to cancel (karma) because they did not even call to confirm my reservations or hers.
