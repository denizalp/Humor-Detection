So many Cirque shows in Vegas, I chose this one due to being familiar with Beatles songs. I didn't want to be forced watching Cirque Du So Gay with half naked men prancing around balancing on each other's crotches, I wanted to see Beatles Songs playing in the background of  half naked men prancing around balancing on each other's crotches.\n\nAt $360 for two tickets, I was glad I chose this show for spending so much. The segues from song to song, and circus act to circus act is amazing. I am still trying to get over how fast they change stage sets.\n\nEveryone knows Beatles songs, so I figure if you are going to spend this much on a show, go have your mind blown by this sensory overload.\n\nOh, and skip on the Big Gulp sized cocktail or beer. You'll be holding your pee for at least an hour and forty-five minutes.
