I think they do so well w\/ the kids. My daughter has shown such an improvement over the last month, but is it too much to ask that the therapists acknowledge the parents? They are so rude, they just walk on by, not even a \"hello\" or maybe a smile. Three stars for doing what they're paid to do, but for their lack of courtesy....this is a business after all.
