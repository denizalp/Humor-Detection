Searching Yelp for something new, I came across The Cutting Board. I was looking for something vegan or vegetarian, as I am limited on carbs, dairy and sugars. This is going to sound repetitive to those who know my reviews, but CB has ONLINE ORDERING!!!\n\nI opted for the protein bowl and a Mr. Marley smoothie. As I checked in, I also scored a free iced tea or lemonade - I chose the lemonade...pink lemonade! \n\nThe restaurant was in a very busy strip mall. On a Friday night, parking was very, very sparse. The actual entrance faced north into a breezeway between businesses. In this space, CB had a bunch of cute tables. The west wall of the restaurant opened up toward the parking lot. There was bar-style seating along this wall, so it was a great spot in our fantastic weather. There were a few tables inside as well. There was a small specials board on the service counter...man, they had a horchata smoothie on there! There were decadent desserts displayed, and an easy to read chalkboard menu. The restaurant was also very clean, and the staff friendly. So friendly and qelcoming6, that an employee came out to bus a table, looked eight in my face, smiled a said hi. Almost like he knew me. It was cool.\n\nOk. Food.\nThe protein bowl was salad greens, walnut meat, avocado, tomato, black beans and quinoa. It came with salsa and hot sauce, so you really don't need a dressing. I opted out of it. This was really tasty and filling. The quinoa really soaked in the flavors, and when mixed with the nut meat, it really brought out a sweet, savory and spicy mix.\nThe Mr. Marley smoothie was coconut water, pineapple, banana and hemp seed. It didn't taste like there was banana. Maybe it's just me. But it was refreshing, and I really liked it.\nThe pink lemonade was not too sweet, and just tart enough to shock you upon first sip. I also loved this.\nMy dinner experience was great here, and I will be back to try other items!
