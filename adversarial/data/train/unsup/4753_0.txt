Tiesto didn't come on until way later than I showed up.\n\nMy friends and I have a lot of energy and are pretty much ready to take on the town whenever, however, this mofo took three hours to get on the mic.\n\nMeanwhile waiting in the desperately illegal fire hazard of compacted bodies waiting for the performance, I felt like I was being tested to see how long I could last in a anchovy can without being able to move while simultaneously going deaf.
