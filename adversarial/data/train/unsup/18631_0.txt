Ancora coffee is greater than ANY OTHER COFFEE. I'm serious. If you're in Madison and want a delectable, well-made latte, go here. The newest location (University Ave) is aesthetically pleasing and the baristas know what they are doing! Try a White Zombie if you need an extra-extra pep in your step - It is a beverage that uses lightly roasted coffee beans (white in color) and pack a little more punch (hi CAFFEINE) than your typical drink. I would go to Ancora more frequently if it were on my way to work, but I still make it a weekly stop.
