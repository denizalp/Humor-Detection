Ok, over the course of the last few months my love affair with Sushi Twister has intensified. Like any relationship, we have had our ups and down, but managed to beat the odds and continue our romance. The food is consistently delicious and the fish is fresh. Their rice to fish ratio still bothers me a bit, but I'll let it slide. There are times when the services is spotty (an older female server will leave you hanging for quite some time), but there are times when the service is pretty flawless. This weekend we had a young gentleman as our server as he was on top of his game. \n\nTheir selection of nigiri is great and choices of baked and regular rolls vast. My favorites are Friday the 13th, Cowgirl, Oh My God, Ecstasy, and Rum Jungle. I also really enjoyed their baked mussels. I am two stamps away from a free AYCE meal...oooooh yeah!
