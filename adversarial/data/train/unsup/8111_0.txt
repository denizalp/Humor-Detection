This is a small friendly pizza joint in Leslieville.\nI've been here 3 times since I moved to the beaches.\nI highly recommend the Sopressata dipped in a bit of garlic honey.. It is the best pizza I've ever had.\n\nWarning: it will be hard to ever go back to eating regular pizza after you try this.
