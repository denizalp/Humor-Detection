Wow! What an experience! We went on Friday, which just happens to be all you can eat Fish Fry night. I had a meatball sandwich with BBQ chips. It was good. No complaints with the food. My buddy had the fish and I sampled and it exceeded expectations. \n\nNow the strange part. The \"sports grill\" was filled with a 60 and older crowd of all regulars.  We weren't greeted when we walked in so we seated ourselves. A regular told us there were \"rules\" about who sat where. A drunk regular, \"Wally\" told my buddy he was supposed to tip $5 for a beer in a very awkward exchange at the bar. Wally then stumbled out of the bar hanging on to walls and rails before pulling out with his car lights off. \n\nThere were a few drunk men over 60 who were hitting on and inappropriately touching the younger (40's) women at the bar. One in particular kept offering elbows to a man's chest to fend him off as he tried to cop a feel. He made multiple visits while his wife sat across the room. \n\nThe waiter apologized for neglecting us. My buddy did wait 20 minutes for his second day plate of fish. Service was spotty but I give them a pass as the regulars were a handful.\n\nThere were 20 TV'S and yet many were turned to the same games so there were only 4-5 games viewable. Although this crowd didn't seem all that interested in sports.\n\nThe visit was surreal, and yet awkwardly entertaining. We didn't feel welcome as we were \"outsiders\".\n\n I don't think I'd ever return, but then again....no...I won't return.
