The first time I went in, I expected it to be the Wal-Mart of book stores.  But it's actually nice.  No, there isn't a cafe, but I like that.  It's a pet peeve of mine to see people camped out in the store reading a book or magazine they haven't paid for, nor have any intention of buying.  Go to a damn library people.  If I am paying for a new book, I want it to be...I don't know, NEW maybe.\n\nStaff is always friendly.  I called looking for a particular book, and the gal who answered the phone not only checked the stock on their computer, but OFFERED to make sure it was actually on the shelf and held it for me.\n\nThey accept Barnes & Noble gift cards and membership cards as well.
