This place has so much potential but they have totally dropped the ball. I've been here a few times and usually there is only 1 person working so you always have to wait a long time. But regardless of that, even if there are 2 people working, it's slow. The games are fun and the food is decent but while there today, it took 30 minutes for them to turn on the Vikings game after being asked about 10 times by multiple people so we missed kick off, then one of the arcade games ran out of tickets and the bartender was rude and just said that he didn't have time to add more tickets, also a friend ordered food and they messed up the order. Now they're saying that something \"blew up\" in the kitchen so they can't make any food so we asked if we could get pizza across the street but they said no outside food or drinks. They're just a mess and it shows.
