I have walked past this location several times during every First Friday. Today I finally decided I wanted to eat something different. The menu is small and simple. There is also a lot of different varieties of food choices, all of which are made with a type of noodle. This establishment has gone above and beyond with what they can do with a noodle. The interior is decorated with records along the side of the wall. The staff members are all passionate about the food they create and how they serve it. I ended up trying the \"One Night in Bangkok\" noodle dish. The flavor was outstanding. The explosion of flavors and the sweet chili they use just completed the dish. Definitely a must try spot
