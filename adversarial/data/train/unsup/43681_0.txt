Terrible hospital. Very disorganized. If you can choose a different hospital I would.\n\nMy wife took our baby into the hospital because she had a cold. Our paediatrician convinced her she should take her to emerg to have her blood tested in case it was infected. Despite the fact she didn't have a fever.\n\nThe hospital then went about doing the tests, even though they said they wouldn't have even done the tests if the paediatrician didn't ask for it because she looked great. They also told my wife she would be able to go home after the urine test was taken, and they would call with the results. They then do a 180 on her and say because the baby is so young (her age was still before her due date because she was born early) that you have to stay for 24 hours of observation and until the blood culture and urine culture gets back.\n\nFast forward over 24 hours later. Still waiting and haven't heard back about the cultures. The only thing we do know is that the urine culture was submitted the next morning so it will probably take another half day or longer for them to release them from the hospital. All of this for sniffles and no fever. If you get this kind of care for some sniffles, I dare to think what kind of care you would get if your life was actually threatened.\n\nEven though we live near this hospital, we had our baby at Sunnybrook for good reason. If only Sunnybrook had a paediatrics wing!
