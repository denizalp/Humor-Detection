A little outdated, but then again so am I.  After driving by Salt Cellar for 3 years, we finally ventured in or maybe I should say we ventured \"under.\"  It's quite small inside.  Maybe space underground is at a premium?  \n\nWe had requested a booth after a suggestion in another review, and were accommodated after a short wait in the bar.  Good decision as seating is somewhat tight, but those booths are huge!\n\nSeafood is obviously their specialty, but there are beef and chicken options on the menu as well.  We started with Shrimp San Remo as recommended by our server, and it was definitely recommendation worthy.  I could have skipped the shrimp and just had the bowl of sauce and a basket of bread and been completely happy.\n\nI ordered scallops, sauteed in butter and sherry with fresh mushrooms.  How can you go wrong there?  Only if the scallops are gritty or overcooked, and they were neither.  Perfect.  My husband ordered another recommended dish, baked stuffed lobster.  A whole lobster stuffed with shrimp and crab.  Tell me that isn't an ingenious idea!\n\nBut here's one of my favorite things about Salt Cellar.  I like crab, but never order it because it's just too much work to eat it.  Not here.  They do the dirty work for you at the table.  Now that's a reason for me to go back, even if I have to look at gold picture frames!
