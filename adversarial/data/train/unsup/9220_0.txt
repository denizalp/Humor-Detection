I went there for five times and realized that there was only one practitioner that can be considered professional. The last visit made me really unhappy. I feel like the practitioner didn't pay attention to what I said(even if we were both speaking mandarin) and did not understand what I meant by \"upper back pain\". She was not focusing enough on that area. She hurt my upper spine when massaging my shoulder muscles. When I mentioned that to her, she said \"it'll be fine in a moment.\" Besides, she tried to get rid of an acne on my back with her nails... I don't understand.
