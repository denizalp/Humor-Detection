There are multiple occasions where I drive by this place without thinking anything of it.  Jaime, Christine and I had a late girls night and it was time to head home.   On the way, I was really wanting to stop by somewhere but didn't say anything when mind reader Christine mentioned she was hungry for a snack.  Immediately I smiled and told her I was thinking the exact same thing.  We yelped a bit and pondered what we wanted to eat when she mentioned Sun's.  She said they had late hours and decent Chinese food for late dining.  SURE, I said.\n\nSun's BBQ is just off Centre street, they have their own parking lot but boy at this late hour it was pretty packed.  Walking towards the door I noticed little kids coming out with their parents.  It reminded me of late night eats in Hong Kong, LOUD, fast paced, chaotic but cool....doesn't matter what time in the AM it is, there's always people having some good eats and laughing.\n\nWe were quickly greeted and offered tea.  Christine and I decided to go for some sweet 'n' sour pork with pineapple and mayonnaise and we ordered a large order of rice because who doesn't like smothering the rice in the sweet and sour sauce?!  Anyway, it didn't take long for the order to come and it was just what we wanted.  Crispy, greasy, fatty....perfect!   I enjoyed the diced onions and peppers, it gave the dish nice crunch.  The sweet and sour pork also had a drizzle of mayo on top which we both agreed was unnecessary and could do without.  The portion of rice was large (as ordered), and it was nice and fluffy. \n\nOverall, this place is definitely the place to be if you are craving some decent late night Chinese food whether it's one of those drunken nights or that late tummy growling night....they offer a whole ton of food!  Give them a try!!
