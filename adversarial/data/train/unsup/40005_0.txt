My husband and I ate at Fu restaurant inside HardRock Hotel and Casino on Valentine's day. We received excellent service, it seemed everyone was working together. We had several servers check up on us during dinner. I ordered the Korean bbq beef, it was delicious! My husband got the chicken and green beans. He enjoyed it. My daughter ordered the garlic noodles, they were very garlicky. We love garlic! We were all very pleased with the service and food at Fu!
