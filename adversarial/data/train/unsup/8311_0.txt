I had the Reuben and a bottled drink which I want to say was about $12. The Reuben   was warm and delicious and looked a heck of a lot more appetizing than my dining companions' Chinese food.\n\nThe place is clean and the employees were great. I picked Towers because the food in the Food Court looked old and tired sitting in the pans at 10pm. So I opted for a freshly made sandwich at Towers.
