Delicious tacos, great service, and open late on weekdays!\n\nWe got a pitcher of the paloma margaritas, which have a great grapefruit flavor and a bit of bubbly!  Tacos were delicious, we went with the build your own, but the house choices looked great too. Get the stoner shell, you won't regret it!
