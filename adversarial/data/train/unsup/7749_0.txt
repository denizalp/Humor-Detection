It was a great experience and what an excellent job Nick has done! Nick is very professional and he knows exactly what you want. It took about an hour and he shot about 100 pics for me in different angles and poses. It was a professional studio with all the necessary equipments including lights and backgrounds. Five stars and good job Nick!
