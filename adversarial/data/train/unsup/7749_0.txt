Wow, who knew Asian food in a hotel could actually be good?? The prices were slightly higher than back in the Bay Area, but hey for Vegas, it was pretty reasonable and maybe even a good deal!\n\n- Shu Mai: comes in an order of 6 for $9. Yeah, pricey! And not as good as home, but they were sweet and hit the spot especially when you're hungover.\n\n- Won Ton Soup: $5 for a cup. Yeah, again pricey! A cup consisted of 3 wontons and a piece of baby bok choy LOL. But again, sweet, soupy, and hit the spot!\n\n- Beef Noodle Soup: My friend ordered this and loved it. I tasted her broth and it packed a punch! That satay flavor will creep up on your throat though! $13\n\n- Combination pan fried noodles: I was actually really impressed with this dish! The noodles were crispy, and the sauce\/gravy was really tasty. It also included lots of shrimp, chicken, and veggies. Good portion to do family style!\n\n- Combination fried rice: $15 nothing special or memorable. But it's a good choice if you're looking for carbs.\n\nOpen late and conveniently located inside the Venetian. Perfect spot for late night soup after clubbing or that morning soup to get you going again! \n\nEAT.SLEEP.RAVE.REPEAT.
