I couldn't help myself and followed the hype and my stomach. No longer do we have to drive 2 hours to Buffalo but instead wait 2-3 hours in a mall.\nIt's exactly what you expect, the food is the same, the friendliness of the wait staff, the menus, the cheesecake line up at the door. We always order the Chicken Jumbalaya and Thai Lettuce wraps which are very tasty. This time we ordered the Buffalo Blasts, Stuff Potato Tots, Avocado Egg Rolls And Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta. The Angel Hair was nothing to brag about but we enjoyed the Buffalo Blasts which was a huge portion. We were disappointed that the pastas were not the expected large portions we are use to seeing in the US. We also ordered the Black Out Chocolate Cake and Godiva Gluten Free cake. They were both very rich and delicious. If you are willing to brave the wait and walk around the mall for 2-3 hours, you get what you expect.
