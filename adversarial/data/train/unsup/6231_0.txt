Let me start off by saying that I'm not a big fan of hotdogs... at all. Dirt dog may have converted me though. Located in the same plaza as Annie pho, I think, and that pet resort. It's very tucked in this plaza & you'll probably miss it if you're not paying attention. \n\nAnyway, I've been here a couple of times & I've ordered the same thing lol. They apparently have a secret menu & obviously it's not written anywhere in the establishment. I usually order the mutt dog & I believe that's a mixture of the green & red dog, but I'm not completely sure. The flavor is amazingggg though. It has a little kick. Throw it in a lobster bun & order some dirty fries & im pretty sure that's what heaven tastes like. I was really excited about having elotes near my house, but unfortunately I didn't like theirs. When I got mine, it was burnt... & I waited over 15 mins for it. I guess I'll have to keep making them at home for now.
