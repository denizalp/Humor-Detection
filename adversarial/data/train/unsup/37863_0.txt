I had already made up my mind that I really didn't need to go to this place. Based on the attitude I had last time I attempted to shop here, I was ok to never enter this store again, but when you are shopping with friends there is always a give an take, so I went in.\n\nI really don't know how to describe the merchandise except to say it was a collection of Canadian kitsch. If Outer Layer {1} and those tourist places that sell authentic native dream catchers next to mass produced $20 bottles of maple syrup were to have a baby, it would be The Drake General store.\n\nIf you needed to find an offbeat gift or I guess if you were visiting Canada and wanted a cool keepsake this place would be good. Prices are steep. I feel in love with a knit cactus that promises never to die (we'll see about that) for $22 and an RCMP duffel bag for $130.\n\nService here is still a big fat Zero, since the hipster clerk never once bothered leaving her 20 sq area to say hi or offer help (as I struggled to grab the duffel bag!)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n{1} http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/outer-layer-toronto
