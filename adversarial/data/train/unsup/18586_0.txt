An impressive buffet with a wide variety of foods.  We arrived at about 2:30PM on a Thursday and there was long line.  Everyone was trying to get in on the lunch price of about $23 before the changeover (plus $11 more) for the dinner.  We only waited for about 20 minutes before being seated.  \n\nPeople that eat in buffet have a tendency to overindulge.  Our party of 6 were very good about selecting foods and making sure that we eat what we selected.  That way you do not gorge or waste food.  However, we saw some exceptions.  Two women (Marin County types) wanted a whole slab of ribs which they took to their table near us.  They also had huge helpings of other goodies, but at the end we observed that the food was wasted including 6 large pieces of of bbq ribs.  What pigs!  No wonder they were overweight.\n\nAlso were observed grabby people, particularly at the helping of snow crabs.  You can rest assured that they were also wasted.  Buffets also bring out the poorly mannered patrons on how they treat the staff.  One woman wanted a piece of prime rib and didn't want it cut from the end, but from the middle.  When the chef sliced her a piece, she rejected it and wanted a thicker slab.  Why didn't she take two smaller slices and not be such a jerk to chef.\n\nThe rest room accomodations had only two urinals in the mens room.  For a dining area this size, it was wholly lacking.  Luckily the Bellagio, outside the buffet had plenty of rest rooms. \n\nThe service was very good and they promptly clean our table of excessive plates.  The food was very well prepared and plenty of it.  The dining area was exceptionally clean.  We left a generous tip to our headwaiter, though I didn't see others leaving anything.\n\nIt is unlikely that we would eat here again - mainly because I do not really believe in buffets, but for those that do, the Bellagio is a great place to eat.
