After a long day patting down sweat soaked brows with Slurpee stained T-shirts,  pulling out wedgies, and listing off all of the reasons to a \"Roller coaster enthusiast\"  why I didn't want to ride the Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point.\n\nSwenson's was a welcome and tasty stop.\n\nOpen till late, you just pull into the parking lot and turn on your car lights. In a matter of seconds, an adorable clean-cut high-school guy dressed in white, strolls over to the car window and asks what you want. He's patient and listens carefully as you list off everything.\n\nIn a matter of minutes he's back.\n\nBig eyed, with a dashing grin, he delivers a bag full of - jalapeno poppers, a four dollar Cajun chicken burger, and a milkshake. You don't have to move a muscle...except for the paying part.  \n\nSwenson's is a beautiful part of Akron. It's not cheesy. It's authentic and all together charming.\n\n(I am listening to the American Graffiti Soundtrack as I write this review.)
