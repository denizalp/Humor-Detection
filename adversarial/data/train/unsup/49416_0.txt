This place is a hidden gem- really give it a try. I come here regularly and haven't had a less than stellar experience yet. The food is delicious. The service is so good, I've never met nicer management and servers. Bill has been running the place since April and he makes it feel so cozy, it's like a home away from home, with beer and burgers. I find there's a lot of business at Betty's nearby, but when you want a quieter night, bistro 243 is just down the street and is perfect.
