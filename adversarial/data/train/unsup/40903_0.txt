My husband and I traveled from the Bay Area to Boulder Boats to purchase a 23' Baja Open Bow, the boat of our dreams. The boat was serviced, detailed, water tested and ready for it's new owners.  I had forgotten the kind of service you get at Boulder Boats even existed anymore. The staff is knowledgeable,friendly and very helpful, they know you by name. From start to finish our experience was amazing. Lucas was our salesman and in working with him we made a friend.    We had some issues since we lived so far from Henderson, and decided to pick up the boat ourselves.  Boulder Boats went above and beyond what would be expected to support and help us. They stood behind there customer satisfaction statement.  We will be looking for an additional boat in the future, we will look to Boulder Boats for that purchase. Thank you to everyone at Boulder Boats for the good old fashioned customer service and really caring.  Carole K.
