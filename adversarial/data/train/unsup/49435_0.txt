Today was the first time I used Summerlin Maids and I was very pleased with the service.\nI've used other maid services in the past when I lived in a smaller home, but decided to cut out that expense when we moved into a larger house. So I admit that their reasonable pricing is what first drew me to this company, it's very reasonable and affordable for once a month for our household budget. \nThe 2 ladies they sent, Maria and Mirrna (M&M), were very delightful and hardworking. They explained that this is not a deep clean, just the basics....kitchen, bathrooms, floors and dusting and I was completely content with that. They started and they did not stop. Honestly, I'm a little ocd and think I keep my bathrooms and kitchen pretty clean on my own, but my daughter commented that my bathroom never looked so clean and I couldn't agree more! \nI didn't read any Yelp reviews until the ladies got here and started their job, so I was a little worried thinking that I won't be using this service again but that is not the case! I will continue to keep up with my own cleaning schedule and my kids will continue to do their cleaning chores, But I will definitely continue to use M&M on a monthly basis! And an extra service or two in between if I have any out of town guests coming to stay with us! \nNot sure about their complimentary landscaping as they will be coming on Monday, but as noted it's COMPLIMENTARY! A little trimming, weed pulling and leaf blowing FOR FREE, can't go wrong with that!
