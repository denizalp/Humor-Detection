My automatic go to for Indian food. The selection, quality, and preparation of our food was exceptional. The service put the experience over the top!\nI have been here now several times and they never fail to impress. The weekend buffet has a great selection and I have never seen it not stocked. Nothing worse than waiting for your favorite. This has never happened. \nThe buffet is really good but I enjoy even more trying different dishes from the menu. \nAlways greeted warmly when I arrive like meeting an old friend.\n\nGreat job! See you soon
