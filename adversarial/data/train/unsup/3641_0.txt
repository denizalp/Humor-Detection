If this wasn't RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE POLICE STATION, I'd give it the extra star. But with street parking and the police right there, it sort of discourages anyone who didn't walk there to go slow. Sometimes I don't want to go slow, if you know what I mean. But it is what it is. Just be warned. The space itself is nice! Small, cozy in fact. You walk down the stairs from street level and along a hallway to the bar. Nice clean and modern bathrooms too. I liked the feel of the place and even though it was packed, I felt like I could have stayed for a while (except I was driving - note the warning above!). The beer menu was enticing on all fronts and included about 6-7 beers and even some Apis Mead. I was able to order half pours (NICE!) and get a decent sample that way. The Stealing Hoppy Hours IPA was very tasty indeed. \n\nWe saw a lot of food come out while we sat there and man, those wings looked good and smelled heavenly. If we hadn't had that pizza at Spoonwood and that Jerky at Hitchhiker, I would have indulged! Maybe next time.
