Really as good as it gets. The sashimi was as good as I have had. Thick slices, great chefs selection served over a bed of ice. Also had a rainbow roll, which was equally good. \n\nFor the appetizers we had miso black cod. It was juicy, flavorful and cooked to perfection. The place was quiet and you could easily carry on a conversation.
