Terrible Management company! I put in a application for a property and was told that there was NO other Applications put in at the time, I get a call the next day from \"Marisol\" that my application was denied due to credit issues on my voice mail. So i call back about 45 min later and I ask the receptionist to speak to Marisol, and she asked me to hold on, about two min later she picks the phone up to tell me that Marisol had \"STEPPED AWAY FROM HER DESK,\" so i left my name and number to call me back, a couple of hours pass by and I still had NOT received a call back, so I decided to GO TO THE OFFICE. When I arrived at the office, the same receptionist told me \"Marisol\" was at lunch, and so was \"Lisa\" the so called property manager. I was livid! I demanded to get a explanation of why i was rejected on my application! since i had NO evictions, bankruptcies or foreclosures. SO after making a scene, \"Marisol\" finally comes out and asks what the issue was, so i explained to her that all i wanted was a explanation of why I was rejected for \"CREDIT\" and what exactly was she looking for, because if i had perfect credit, I sure wouldnt be renting, I would be BUYING! So she gives me the run around and that there had been THREE other applications turned in for the SAME PROPERTY, and that she had rejected all of them! THIS PLACE IS A SCAM TO COLLECT APPLICATIONS FEES $50.00 A POP!!\n\n*TERRIBLE PLACE!!! BEWARE OF MARISOL\/LISA!!! I THINK THEY ARE THE SAME PERSON!!!!
