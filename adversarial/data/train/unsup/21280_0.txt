Taco Tijuana is one of my favorite taco shops in town! You have to get the tacos de adobada AKA al pastor tacos! You'll know it's the right one if it's the reddish colored pork on the spit! It normally comes without pineapple, so ask if you want some. The other super tasty taco here is the tacos de tripa, which is deep fried pig intestines. The carne asada here is okay, I know a couple places that make it better.  All orders come with a side of peppers and grilled onions. The self serve bar has radishes and limes.  My only complaint was the horchata here is kind of weak. \n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge*****\n45\/100
