We came here because he reviews were high and they supposedly use Hatch green chile. We were disappointed. First of all the place is not the cleanest. When I asked the girl taking the ordering they use Hatch green chile she had no clue what I was talking about. Ordered green chile chicken enchiladas with a taco and tamale. The enchiladas were somewhat spicy but I can make better enchiladas than that. The taco was pretty good. The red beef tamale looked and tasted like it was made with canned Hormel Chili, not so good. Probably won't be back. On a mission to find a place in Phoenix that serves Hatch green chile.
