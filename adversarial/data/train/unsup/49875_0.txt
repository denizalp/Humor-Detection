The Spicy Tuna Bowl was the best I had ever had. The vegetable ramen was delicious too. Unfortunately, the waitress couldn't remember anything. She forgot our order, forgot my son's drink, forgot to get us to-go containers and after asking twice my son finally went to the counter and asked for a third time. Because of all the forgetfulness it was a long dinner. Just waiting for our check and to-go containers took 20 minutes. Despite all that I would totally go back though!
