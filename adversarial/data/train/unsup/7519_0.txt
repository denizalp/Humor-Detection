Viva Chamorro food! There's Guamanian food in Las Vegas! Now we all can enjoy the Hafa Adai spirit while grubbing on Chamorro food off of South Eastern Ave near Henderson.\n\nMy affinity towards Guamanian food began 25 years ago when my good friend and her family from Guam opened up a restaurant across the street from our high school in Chula Vista, CA. Red rice. Chicken bbq. Chicken kelaguen. Shrimp kelaguen. All drizzled with Finadene!! Yum!!\n\nRed Rice offers all of the above and more! I just wish I had more time in Vegas and a bigger stomach to enjoy it all, but I'll be back soon.\n\nMy niece and I went pretty simple and decided on Nene sized plates (similar to Keiki or kids size): Chicken and Rib plus our choice side of potato salad. The meats were tender and tasty to bbq perfection. The red rice was a nice shade of orange-red achoite seasoned with hints of onion and garlic. Now top it all off with some finadene sauce (soy sauce, lemon, vinegar, green onion, and hot chili peppers). Mmm. So good!\n\nWe had Shrimp Kelaguen on the side which is very similar to ceviche. It's fresh shrimp, diced and marinated in salted lemon juice. To calm the tartness, shredded coconut is usually mixed in, but I really didn't taste enough in this serving. I just love coconut and wish there was a little more. My eyes were squinting way too much! Lol.\n\nTo satisfy out sweet tooth, we finished our meal with some hot Chamorro Beignets. Yum! The coconut donuts topped off with powdered sugar and mango sauce. So good!\n\nAloha and mahalo, Red Rice!! Thank you for bringing Chamorro food to Vegas. Be back soon!!
