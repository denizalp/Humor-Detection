My husband, my parents and I went to dinner here on a Thursday night. There was a wait but we found a table at the bar. James was the best server ever. He made sure our drinks were always full and our picky food orders that we gave him came out perfect. The food was delicious!! I highly recommend Blue 32!! Great experience!
