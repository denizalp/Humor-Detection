Mozell, I do not know where you are getting your information, I have never cancelled an appointment with Juanita.  If she is telling you that she is not being truthful with you    To be truthful I was always on time for my appointments and was waiting on Juanita   She told me to come at 11 and she would squeeze me I do not think I am wrong for thinking I would be squeezed around 11 or within the hour!!! And if Juanita told you she went looking forme several times tht is also not true. In the 2 hours I sat there I went to the bathroom once in the 2 hour I sat there and she NEVER came to look for me!!! I cannot believe you would write these untruths!!!  I can promise you I NEVER cancelled any appointments and Juanita never came looking for unless she came after 2pm and I sent her a txt when I left   She knew I had to be some where because I told her I couldn't come at 3!   If she didn't want my business why does she txt me telling me when she's working.  Come on Mozell read between the lines something is rotten here!   I was punished because I had not had Juanita do my hair the past few months!!!!
