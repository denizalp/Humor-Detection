Fun place to go to party. Personally, I go on Wednesdays during the summer. That's when it's Industry night, and all the locals come out. So I get to see the regulars, and occasionally run into some friends. \n\nThe dance floor is very tight and small because it's surrounded by loads of tables inside. So if you expect to bust a move in there. Forget about it. You can probably do some light shimmying or lean side to side on the floor. \n\nI love the design of the place though, but I only love going during the summer when the nights are warm and you can dip your toes in the water at night. The pool is amazing, and talk about a cute little walkway that cuts through the pool! Walking through it makes it hard to resist doing a runway walk through it like it's a fashion show. Beware though! That walkway is narrow so you better focus on keeping balance with your sexy Christian Louboutin stilletos, or you're in for disaster! \n\nTwo floors of amazing cabanas with a nice flat screen, and sexy summer furniture. I'd definitely suggest to rent one out if your pocket can handle it (or if you've got enough women to get you one for free!). \n\nThe music usually consists of a mixture of top 40 and the usual trance, electro, and techno. Usually you'll hear 70% techno and 30% top 40 (it's a guestimate as far as estimate, but you get the idea!). So if you're one to get down with top 40 hits just expect to hear very little of it.\n\nIf you're one to mingle and walk around more than get down. It's the place to go, and you'll see a variety of people. So fellas, if you're looking for an assortment of options as far as potentials to mingle with. You can find it here. I also love that this place always has that ONE guy who's like 60 years old, getting down, with his crazy whimsical club attire (talking bright colored suites with gold pins whimsical). It's always a show.
