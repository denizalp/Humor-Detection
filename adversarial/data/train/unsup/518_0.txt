I came in because of the many positive Yelp reviews, and because I like the name.  Asian fusion, however, is a style that I'm not always a fan of.  It's often more like Asian confusion when the mashups don't go quite right, or you see the same old Asian chicken salad with fried wontons.  Buddha Belly is more Confucian than confusion, as there is something wise and interesting in their offerings.\n\nFried shrimp po' boy with Szechuan sauce and slaw, on a soft baguette is a good example.  It mixes a classic sandwich, with just a slight Asian twist.  Chips with furikake are just different enough to be interesting.  Char siu pork sandwich makes sense.  Dragon fries with some chili oil?  Okay.  Short rib red curry flatbread also sounds great.  I'm not sure about the Asian falafel, but next time I'll definitely want to try the Thai clam chowder and maybe the Pho dip sandwich. \n\nI got a little nervous when I walked in on a Tuesday night and I was the only person in the place.  The service was friendly and as you might expect fast, but I hope they get some people in there or Buddha belly might be belly up.  \n\nLove the Jones soda fountain with orange cream, green apple, and true cola flavors.  All that's missing is a vodka dispenser so you can do your own mashup with the drinks.
