I almost didn't go to this clinic a couple of weeks ago after reading all the reviews here about how horrible the staff was, but as it was the only walk-in reasonably close to me open in the evening, I decided to give it a try. I figured, if they're really awful, I can always leave.\n\nI'm not sure why my experience differed so drastically from so many other people's. I got in just after 5 p.m. on a weeknight and was seen by a doctor almost immediately. The reception staff were polite and efficient. I spoke with a very friendly doctor, received a diagnosis and a prescription and a promise of a followup call re some additional test results. That call came less than 48 hours later and the person I spoke to was professional and helpful.\n\nBased on these results, I would definitely go back if needed. The medical issue I was seeking help for was a fairly routine one, so my visit might have been a pretty straightforward case for everyone involved; I don't know if that makes a difference (although I know it really shouldn't). I also saw no incidents while I was there of unacceptable behaviour by the staff towards any other patients.
