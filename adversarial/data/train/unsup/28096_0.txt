This by far my FAVORITE Thai restaurant!! Whatever they put in that papaya salad is perfect flavoring.  I must eat here once a week and I am never dissatisfied.   I keep going back for more.  Tom kha Gai, chicken pad Thai and papaya salad are my favorites!!  Love how it's near my home and Service is good!! I will see you soon Gaati!
