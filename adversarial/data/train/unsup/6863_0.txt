I love Thrifty ice cream! It definitely brings back memories from my childhood. The square scoops are a definite staple as well. The ice cream itself is smooth and creamy, no ice crystals. And it's definitely packed with flavor. It doesn't taste artificial at all. The lady working the day we visited was friendly and helpful. When I didn't see my flavor in the display case, I asked if they were out and she gladly went to the back to grab a case of it. My favorites have always been coconut pineapple and chocolate chip. One day I'll try something else, but for now I'll just stick to the 2 flavors. That just gives me a reason to come back.
