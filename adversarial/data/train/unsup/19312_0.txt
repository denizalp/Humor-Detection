I adore Town Square! It has a more local feel to it compared to the Premium Outlets downtown and is way less congested than most malls in Vegas. The atmosphere is great and there's usually always events going on that the whole family can enjoy. Another plus - parking is generous and ample! I love that I don't have to fight for a parking spot.  \n\nMy favorite hang outs at Town Square are Yard House and Miller's Ale. Shopping wise, H&M and Sephora are great stand-bys. For nightlife, there's Stoney's and Blue Martini. Basically, there's something for everyone at Town Square! The only reason I'm not giving Town Square 5 stars is because I'm not a huge fan of their dining choices. There are chains and franchises galore and most are on the moderately expensive side, so I prefer to grub before heading out to Town Square (but that's just me). \n\nI always take my out-of-town visitors to Town Square, and so far, everyone has loved it! It's a great addition to anyone's itinerary for Las Vegas.
