Delicious burgers! \nI love how you can customize your own. It reminded me a lot of Burger Royal because you could choose the size and the burgers don't come with the fries. \n\nThe meat is juicy and tasty. I made my burger with avocado and it was so goooooooood. Fresh and well presented. I just wish they had a mac and cheese burger :P\n\nSeating is ample and comfortable. Service is fast and people are friendly. \nHonestly, a really great burger place.
