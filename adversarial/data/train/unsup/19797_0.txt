My boyfriend didn't feel like trying anything new while we were at Downtown Summerlin, so off to CPK we went. Service is hit and miss. We sat there for about 10 minutes before a server asked if we had ordered drinks. They were pretty friendly, but just seemed a little understaffed. Had to ask twice to get water refilled, and the second time took a while to get it. Food was ok, honestly, it's really not much better than the frozen CPK at the grocery store, and it seems kind of expensive for what it is. I suppose you're paying for ambience.. Especially considering that my favorite pizza place has bigger, more flavorful pies for less. I'll probably go back, but only if I'm shopping there. I wouldn't go out of my way.
