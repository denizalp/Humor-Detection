Dinner was here last night and I don't know what the heck is going on but if I have to sit in front of a garbage can while I eat one more time, I will scream and walk out.  Maybe I should just wear a t-shirt that says \"I'm a hobo\".\n  \nHaving said that...when you're with a big party, you don't want to complain about the seating too much,we already moved once, so I couldn't ask again  so I sat down and ordered a margarita on the rocks!  And wow, they're good and strong-so sip it or you'll tip it!  \n\nEnchiladas are yummy, \n\nTamales...the cheese are the best, rice and beans are the real deal here and kids menu always pleases the little ones.  We've ordered tamales to-go for parties we've had at home and the cheese tamales were always a hit.\n\nWaiters are awesome-5 stars for service-this is my go-to for good Mexican food!
