Horrible do not rent from we went to look at one of their homes and the house had not been shampooed the tile had not been cleaned. She lied to us and said it was shampooed and our real estate agent said no way shape or form they shampooed this home. They wanted all kinds of deposits and charges but didn't want to shampoo the carpets for a new tenant. Basic stuff people! Stains were all upstairs and downstairs.
