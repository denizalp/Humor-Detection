DONT BELIEVE THE REVIEWS. The technicians do poor quality work here. I paid more than usual for a very basic gel manicure... They mutilated the shape and ended up with one hand of nails shorter than the other hand of nails. No coming back from that... On top of it I asked for a simple design which they argued with me about & couldn't even accommodate. The salon is nice, the technicians suck! A basic gel mani 2 hours and didn't even include a hand massage. I had to repeatedly ask the technician to trim my cuticles back. She argued with me on that too. Overall a F experience. GO ANYWHERE BUT HERE!
