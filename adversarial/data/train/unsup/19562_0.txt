I'll happily add my name to the long list of people that love OHSO. I've been going to the location on Indian School for years. The vibe at all locations is fun and chill and the food is pretty stellar too! I also find that the service is consistent and always pleasant. This particular location took me a minute to find but once I was inside I felt at home! I sat up at the bar and ordered myself one of their giant, dangerous mimosas. I love going to eat alone, but it sucks that I have to make a choice and only order one item from their awesome menu. I went for the pastrami sandwich. This was the first thing I ever ordered all those years ago at my first visit and I wanted to see if it was as good as I remembered. Well folks, it did not disappoint! The pickle and pepper mix, mustard aioli, fontina, grilled onion, and Italian dressing was the perfect mix of flavor without being overpowering. I would happily order it again!
