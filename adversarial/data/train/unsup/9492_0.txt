Tiny Tots is pediatric clinic that has been around for many generations now. We particularly like using it as a weekend service when our daughter's pediatric clinic is closed. The offer emergency services. The lines open up around 8 and you hope to book an appointment in the morning.\n\nThe waits are acceptable and the care given is above satisfactory. All in all it suits its purpose all the while looking dated and cramped. They can do a re-haul of the place, I'm sure at some point the carpet were another color altogether.
