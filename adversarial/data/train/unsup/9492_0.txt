Had a pie delivered to our hotel. It was pseudo warm and very short on flavor. More than that, it smelled kind of stale.  If I didn't know any better I'd swear this pizza was made yesterday. And this frakking pizza wasn't cheap!!  I learned my lesson.  When in Vegas never order delivery pizza ever again.  Ever.  And, oh yeah, the garlic knots were just meh.
