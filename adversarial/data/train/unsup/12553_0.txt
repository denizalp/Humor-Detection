The illuminated lanterns were superbly crafted and well worth seeing.  A delightful sight!  But we didn't see a show because the few seats set out were reserved, and we didn't want to sit on the lawn or stand on a cold February Sunday night.  And my party of three chose to eat afterward at Tasty China rather than spend $9.00 for a few cooked noodles out of a small box that would soon turn cold, or Kettle Corn.  Merchandise and food vendors were few but the exquisitely crafted and decorated lanterns were many.\n\nParking was close and ample.  But one slightly galling circumstance was that by ordering online, we wound up paying $1.50 more per festival ticket for non-existent handling than we would have had we waited to buy entry tickets in person at the event ticket booth, since festival tickets were printed on my home computer, and there was no line to buy tickets when we arrived shortly before the 5:30 p.m. opening.\n\nStill, all considered, 4-1\/2 stars overall!
