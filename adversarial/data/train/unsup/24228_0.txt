Very displeased with the lack of professionalism from Goettl. After my unit was initially installed (which now in hindsight, I should have just gone through my home warranty company like my instinct told me to do), I had to wait weeks for a drywall company to contact me and come out and fix the butcher job that the install techs did to the attic access in my home. \nI received a new thermostat to be installed but was told that NV Energy would first have to uninstall my current thermostat before Goettl would install the new one. Fine. However, before I scheduled for NV Energy to come out to uninstall my current thermostat, Goettl called saying they had a tech who was licensed to do the uninstall of the NV Energy thermostat. Why I wasn't told this from the beginning? I have no idea. So a tech was scheduled to come out today (June 30) between 8-10am. By 10:30 am no one had come by nor had I received ANY communication regrading this appointment. When I called, they rescheduled the appointment for later tonight from 4-6 pm. When I called at 8:10 pm I was told \"someone\" from the office had rescheduled the appointment for July 6...What!? Just give me back my old A\/C unit Goettl. I'd rather deal with that then this mess.
