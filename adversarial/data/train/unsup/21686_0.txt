As my daughter was about to drink her glass of water - she noticed a bolt\/screw in the bottom of her water glass! What was the worst part of this --- our waiter, each time he showed up at our table, was blaming my daughter for putting a screw in her glass. He said, how many more bolts do you have in your pockets? I get it--I can see where you can find the humor in this situation -  but it got to the point where he was obnoxious on blaming her - which ruined our lunch. The final straw was when he removed her plate of food from the table, and even took her fork searching for more bolts - saying \"is there anymore in here?\" Wow--really??? WE DID NOT PUT A SCREW IN OUR WATER?! It was rude and uncalled for. \n\nWe loved our guacamole! We split a delicious steak burrito steak. The steak was cut into small pieces and was just not enough of it for the price. We had house marg and pineapple and couldn't tell the difference in flavor.\n\nWe ate here April 5 2017, for lunch on the patio, our waiter was male, had brown hair and glasses. \n\nYah - we got \"screwed\" .... !
