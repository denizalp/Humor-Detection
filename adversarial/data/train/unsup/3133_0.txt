Been fortunate to catch this farmer's market Saturday mornings in Madison which surrounds the capital square the past two times when coming from Chicago. The streets are blocked off surrounding the capital and you're free to circle the square as you like and check out all of the goods being sold. I believe it starts as early at 6am and people are usually all packed up and promptly headed out by 2pm. From the website, this farmer's market runs from April to early November, so take advantage while the weather is nice!\n\nThey sell just about everything from cheeses, fresh locally grown produce, cheesy breads, and even a bunch of pop up trailer\/food trucks line the block for business. Great spot to bring the family and enjoy the local vibes and lounge on the grassy areas surrounding the capital building. If hanging in Madison for a weekend, this farmer's market on Saturday mornings is a must!\n\nThat's about all I got for ya on this one. 'Til next time, cheers!\n\n185\/365
