Their gelato is good but the customer service suck! There's no line so you just go there expecting them to help you and all the other 15 people beside you trying all the flavors before they decide which one to get. There wasn't a system so the person taking your order doesn't know which customer to help next! It was chaotic there on peek hours! I saw people leave the shop without buying anything a couple of times already because they got tired of waiting and not being helped by the servers! I would've given more starts but the system and the service sucks!!
