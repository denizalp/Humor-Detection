A Thursday night, 15 mins before closing. I've had a beer or 12 since i came off the links that afternoon, and no food. I know i dont need to be eating so late, but dammit, i was hungry, and when i walked by Jimmy Johns on the way to the hotel, well . . . walked in, and was greeted w\/ a smile. Ordered a club sammie, and as i collected my change at the register, the gal on sammie duty was handing me my order, tightly wrapped for the walk back. Friendly team, clean place? Check. Tasty sammie? Hell yeah! That's an easy 4-stars.\n\nCheers!\nRS
