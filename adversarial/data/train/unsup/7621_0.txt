Probably the most affordable Chinese food you will find in Las Vegas. This place always does the trick. Everything is around $8 a piece. I usually get the Noodle soup or the Hainan Chicken. This place is perfect to go to if you:\n1- Lose too much money while gambling or \n2- Partied too hard and need some recovery food.\nPlenty of parking as this restaurant is in a plaza.
