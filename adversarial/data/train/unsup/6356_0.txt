Fashion Show Valet is awesome.  Also the Valet ticket is on your cell phone.  I headed up to the third floor in the elevator & the only seat available was between a super awesome Oregon couple & two drunks on my right.  Along w\/ the wonderful couple, bartenders Michael, Jimmy & GM Jason all came to my rescue from the sloppy drunk dudes.  Very responsible bartenders, they cut the two guys off from ordering anymore & kicked them out.  I totally applaud them cause it's very rare that you see the bartenders cut someone off in Vegas, then step into help mode like they did.  Thank you!  \n\nI also totally trust them to order for me & told Michael what I was in the mood for.. an appetizer & salad or something lite.  He ordered me these delish Lamb Lollipops, which were cooked to perfection & had a sweet balsamic type of glaze.  Also the Ahi Tuna w\/ avocado & mango, which was fresh & both equaled perfect portions for me.  \n\n'The Generous Pour' an eight-week summer wine event is until September 3rd so make sure to stop in!  With your entree you get to taste some of the country's most highly rated & acclaimed wines.  The service is impeccable & the pairing w\/ the seven different wines is a hell of a deal!  \nYou can download 'The Capital Grill Concierge app for more info.
