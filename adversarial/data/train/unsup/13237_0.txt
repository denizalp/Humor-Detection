Wow I don't like giving a bad review but this cant go on...what a waste of over 40 bucks... and for breakfast! The one breakfast wrap to a very hungry guy went in the trash after a few bites mine was a last cause after 1 bite. The fruit dish was dry like it sat uncovered in the fridge and my green smoothie was ultra thick. My palate just couldn't handle it... sad I had great expectations for this place. If I didn't take it to go for work, I would have asked for a complete refund. \n\nI guess steroids made them lose their flavor profile.
