This place is brand new with a nice comfortable atmosphere and I was told they are still working on the menu and it will be shortened because it's way too long. \n\nMy first choice was discontinued from the menu so I went with what they call Com Ga Nuong. It was described as marinated grilled chicken with Ginger, Lemongrass, Shallots, and Garlic. It sounds really good. I've had this similar dish at a few other Vietnamese Places so I was expecting a different presentation. But the number one thing that bothered me about the dish was the lack of the flavors mentioned in the description. This dish at Pho Viet only was garnished with 2 pieces of cucumber and two tomato slices and it did come with a large portion of rice and a very mild fish sauce with very finely shredded carrots in the fish sauce. \n\nI also did sample the beef and meatball Pho. To me it was less flavorful than others I've tried but not awful and just OK.\n\nBoth meals were hot and fresh served in a timely manner. \n\nIf you are in the area you should put them on your rotation and see what you think.\n\nThe owners are very welcoming to criticism as I did mention the lack of flavor to them in the chicken dish. \n\n2.5 rounded up for welcoming criticism.
