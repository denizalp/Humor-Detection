I'm writing this mainly to off set that BS 1 star review!  Butt Out is like a second home to me. I've been vaping for going on 2 years now and I've been going to Butt Out since day one. \nWhere to start? \n\nThe Staff\nevery employee at Butt Out knows what their talking about. I've personally benefited from this and also have seen them build coils for cloud chasers, trouble shoot egos for beginners and most importantly help every person who walks through the door quit smoking! \n\nTheir prices\nI've been to almost every vape shop in Phoenix and Tempe... Butt Out's prices are pretty much in line with the best of them.  if you find e liquid for $8 a 30ml it is from China and if you don't care were your juice comes from then order that cheap china crap online and save ALL TEH MONIES \nAll of Butt Out's Juices are made by them.... in a lab, in Arizona\nThat's how I shop local\n\nThe Owner\nThe only thing Matt is guilty of is playing too much metal! He's remembered me and my name since the first day I walked in to his shop... granted my name is also Matt so that might have been easy for him. \n\nalso I've never met that one star reviewer but there is no way in hell Matt or any of the Butt Out Employees I've met would ever make fun of a Vet.... or really anyone other than each other! \n\nBeginners, advanced vapers, cloud chasing 18 year olds, life long smokers trying to quit, young (18 year old young!), old, tall, short, fat, skinny, man or woman or anything else you might be!!!!!!!\n\nNo matter who you are Butt Out is the place for you!!!!!\n\nAlso what sort of idiot complains about paying for parking on Mill Ave? like that is somehow their fault!
