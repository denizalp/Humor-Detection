Love that they now have an on-campus location. The menu isn't as big as the one downtown BUT if you ask (and they have the resources) they will make you pretty much anything from the downtown menu. Still have a wide variety of things on their smaller menu and a great on-the-go sushi option for students on campus. This is my fave sushi place on campus :)
