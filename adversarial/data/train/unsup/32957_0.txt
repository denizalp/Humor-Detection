Los Olivos is an oldtown Scottsdale landmark that serves up consistently good nuevo Mexican fare.  Ever since my introduction to Phoenix, Los Olivos is one of the better spots for me to satisfy my Mexican cravings.\n\nEverything I've had here is great, particularly the cheese crisps and shredded beef tacos.  Everything else is relatively standard, although I was let down by their chile rellano before, it ended up being far to greasy and soggy.\n\nThe other thing to note is that there's not really any good reason to come for dinner, unless it's unavoidable.  Their lunch and dinner specials are nearly identical, yet lunch is about $3-5 cheaper per combination plate.... \n\nCome for lunch, eat some chips and salsa, and enjoy!
