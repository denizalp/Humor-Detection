Love this theater! Prices are cheaper & they do get newly released movies! The concessions aren't discounted but paying almost $4 less per person is worth it, overall total is still less than a casino theater with no clouds of smoke to walk through. This is where we look 1st to see what's playing when we decide on a movie night.
