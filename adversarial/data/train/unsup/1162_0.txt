Just got back from a fun filled day with my husband and seven 13 year old boys at Wet 'n' Wild.  Not sure what I expected, but I was completely wowed!  We had a blast. Arrived right before opening, rented a cabana, and started having a great day.  Before lunch we hit ALL of the slides several times with little or no lines.  Now, it was only a 78 degree Sunday in May (can you believe it!!!) but the crowds were not there.   After lunch we did start to see more people arrive as the lines grew longer, so we spent the next few hours hanging out in the wave pool. \n\nThe slides were FUN and FAST!  As a Mom, I was very impressed with their construction and the water cleanliness.  Lifeguard staff was very attentive and plentiful.  Security seemed to be well handled with several pairs of off duty Phoenix PD walking around.  Food choices were good.  Plenty of lounge chairs and lots of shade.  Landscaping was attractive and there are even a few mature trees.\n\nThe reasons i did not give Wet 'n' Wild the 5th star are:\n1.  $34.99 price is pretty steep  (but for a limited time can be applied toward a $60.00 season pass)\n2.  $6 parking is ridiculous\n3.  having to rent a tube for the wave pool is wrong, tubes should be included with the high entry fee\n4.  Tried to contact Wet 'n' Wild for several weeks through voice mail and email to arrange this birthday party and NO ONE EVER RETURNED A CALL OR EMAIL.\n\nNow having said all of that, why aren't there more water parks in the Phoenix area?  We live in hotter-that-hell summer... someone build more water parks and they will come! Especially good ones like Wet 'n' Wild.\n\nDid I buy season passes?  No, but I would if it were closer.  it is a 30 minute drive from my home in Scottsdale.  It was a great place to spend the day with my pack of boys!
