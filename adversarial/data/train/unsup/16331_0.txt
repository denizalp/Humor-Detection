Last minute addition: So I just found out that there's a UNCC football game tonight and I arrived 10min before half-time. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt with an extra star, but they should be used to this and staff up better.\n \n---\n\nThey're having a rough night...\n\nThis is an extremely busy location and unfortunately being right across the street from the college they don't very aparently don't have much dedicated talent to pick staff from.\n\nCame in 20 minutes after ordering Take-out, estimated time was 15. I'm up to 30 and while sitting at the waiting bench I watch 4 delivery drivers walk in and step over a dozen to-go menus that one of them knocked over; no one cares to pick up the trip hazard.\n\nAnother customer comes in with boxes and says her order is wrong and just wants a refund, I'm assuming she's been through this before. No one seems to want to give it to her. Glad I paid with an AMEX, if I had the same issue I wouldn't argue one bit for a refused refund, just take it up with my card issuer.\n\nTook another 10 minutes to write this review, 40 minutes so far and every so often a different person will ask what I'm waiting on then dissappear. I guess when you have the largest university campus in the Charlotte-metro next door you don't have to give any form of service ; your customer base will all be brand new in the fall anyway! Too bad I'm a long term local wanting a decent pizza place for my family. I'll look elsewhere.
