Bought a GE refrigerator online from this store, paid for it, 3\/3\/17. Was to be delivered today 3\/6\/17 between 12-4 pm. Found a voice mail on wife's phone (from 8AM?!) that said they had to re-schedule the delivery; and they changed it ON THEIR OWN (without speaking to us) to 3\/9 between 4-8 pm. Who gets up at 8AM? Why didn't they call until they SPOKE WITH US to arrange the shipment.\n\nWill never buy anything again like major appliances from Best Buy. They screwed up, on phone said it was a \"system error,\" whatever that means, and it appears to be getting it shipped on a truck from Southern California to store or here for delivery. I could have bought the refrigerator at other places than Best Buy in Las Vegas or Henderson, and had it by now.\n\nTerrible customer support for a major appliance purchase.
