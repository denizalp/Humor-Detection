Is it illegal to steal two cute Vietnamese women and take them home? I'm gonna go with yes. \n\nYummy Cafe is a little ma and pa spot tucked away in the bottom of a commercial building by my office in the NE. It's very small with about eight seats and a little service counter. Basic handmade signs are strewn about with the menu items and daily specials. It's really cute. It's what you would think it is-deep friend treats, burgers, sandwiches and a number of quick Asian dishes. All of that said, they are sooooo friendly you want to come back just to say hi. The food is pretty good (I love the Yummy Sub which is their Vietnamese sub), the burgers are yummy with fries and the grilled cheese is also a treat. They stocks lots of drinks, chips, bars and snacks for that 2:30 craving as well. Likely no one will ever be by this place unless you work within a one block radius and can walk on your lunch break-which thankfully I do.\n\nApril challenge 10\/30
