Ahhhh, Peter Mart. They offer classes here regularly so you can learn to get your freak on in a much better fashion than you are currently employing now. There is a wide selection of condoms, flavored lotions, scented lotions, tingly lotions, gels, ectoplasm, body butters, peter butter ect. Wait...Ectoplasm?!? OoO, yes it is the haunt of peters past for you ladies haunting you in the aisles. \n\nAnyway that's the one big section when you first come in and then we are onto the wiener section. There are nice bejeweled glass butt plugs, glass art dildos and other stuff I'm probably forgetting in the glass cases. They have nubby dildos, gigantic dildos, long dildos, pump up dildos, wide dildos, vibrating and rotating dildos. Are you getting the idea that they have many dildos?\n\nI won't leave out you gentlemen, they have a good selection of fleshlights, living dolls, the cheaper blow-up dolls, pocket vajayjay's, and cyberskin behinds. They have shower bars so you can get that correct pleasurable position. I didn't check out the porn dvd selection but it seemed pretty good, there is a lot of guys checking around them seemingly nervous to be caught looking at porn. It's okay dudes, we are all in the same store for the same reasons!\n\nThey also have a collection of shoes and trashy outfits for you ladies. I like the collection of Iron Fist shoes they have. There is a dungeon section where you can pick up ropes, handcuffs, collars, whips, feathers, sex swings ect. They have jewelry, games, gag gifts and the service is pretty friendly. And yes, they take their job very seriously.
