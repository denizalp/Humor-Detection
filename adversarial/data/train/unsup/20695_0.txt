I had the opportunity to try Kate's mini cupcakes at the Relief for Japan Bakesale (yelp sponsored event).\n\nI've never really had mini cupcakes from a cupcake place before because most shops in lv don't normally offer them. However, they are absolutely great because of multiple reasons. 1- if you are an indicisive person you can pick a few or even a dozen rather than buying 1 or 2 normal sized cupcakes. 2- if you are trying to watch what you eat you won't have to feel as guilty about eating a mini sized one. 3- the minis are can be consumed in 1 bite which is great for snaking compared to thinking of it as an actual dessert.\n\nchocolate cupcake- from what I tasted, it was a butter cream frosting and chocolate cake filled with chocolate ganache. I am normally not a fun of chocolate cupcakes, but this one had a good balance between the 3 elements. Normally chocolate cupcakes make me feel like it's chocolate overload, but since it was a mini sized it was perfect.   \n\nKate is super nice and as I was chatting wtih her we both share the same ideas of what goes into a prefect cupcake. To top it off, she sells her cupcakes for only $2, which is the cheapest I've found for gourmet cupcakes.
