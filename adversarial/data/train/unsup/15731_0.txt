What am I missing? I don't understand the 4.5 rating. Yelpers please tell me what's the \"right\" dish to order here!\n\nWe had \n\nEel cucumber roll - it's ok. Not a whole lot of eel to be found in the roll.\n\nBento box-steak - not bad, but the beef is more \"steak-y\" at Akira\n\nPad Thai -  it's ok. The authentic pad Thai should come out pale. Here it was served bright orange here. Even peppermint's has more dimension of flavors (among the Americanized ones). Map of Thailand is still the most authentic.\n\nThe audience sitting at the hibachi section seemed to have lots of fun! There were lots of happy noises coming out of the room. I suppose that's what drives the 4.5 stars?\n\nRandom facts:\n\n- this place is really new. We sat by the window and there was no air-conditioning. They still have equipments wrapped in plastic behind the counter.\n\n- Our server said the chef here is Chinese who's worked in Thai restaurant 20 years. \n\nPortion is big. I walked away full but unsatisfied.\n\nIn conclusion, \nIn this area, (Solon, beechwood, chagrin falls, pepper pike)\nIf you want sushi, I'd go Shinano. If closed, I'd go wasabi.\nIf you want Thai, I'd go peppermint's.\nIf you want bento with steak, I'd go Akira.
