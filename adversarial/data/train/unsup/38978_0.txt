Excellent, quick service. There was a line out the door when we arrived, but we waited no more than 10 minutes for a table. The food was incredible, everything we ordered was simply delicious. I are the French toast and eggs with their specialty breakfast potatoes and my husband ordered juice and the breakfast poutine. The poutine especially was our favorite. \n\nThe portions were decently sized, enough that we were both full after our meal, but not too large that we felt sick afterward. The price point is great too, for the quality and amount of food you get.
