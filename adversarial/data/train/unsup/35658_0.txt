If you go for just pizza or ribs they are great. I ordered some wings though and i can say honestly they were the smallest wings i have ever seen. The wing sauce was not the best either. I thought i was getting a good deal at 12 wings for the same price as others charge for 10 but after eating all 12 i was still left wanting. I have also found their side dishes with dinner are old tasting. Say no to cole slaw, potato salad, macaroni. Fries are ok though.
