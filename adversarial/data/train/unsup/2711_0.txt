Great Spanish tapas for a birthday family lunch. All ages OK in the restaurant. We had a party of 7 and were quickly seated about 1PM. Jesus was our server and was very attentive throughout the meal. The warm bread served with the honey butter is always a nice way to start the meal, of course we had another hot batch mid way ;-)\n\nWe started out with waters and a pitcher of sparkling sangria. Very good and dangerous as you can barely taste any alcohol 5\/5. We began with some stuffed dates which are... amaze balls 5\/5! We also had a couple orders of the Firefly fries 3\/5 and a tomato basil soup 2\/5. \n\nSince we arrived early in the day they had breakfast tapas available so we tried the Huevos Rancheros 4\/5 and the brunch potato bravas 4\/5. Camarones Al Ajillo were very good 5\/5. We also ordered some of my favorites: Scallop Escargots 4\/5, Tierra Mar Skewers 4\/5, Albondigas 5\/5 and another 2 orders of stuffed dates. To try something new we ordered the Petite Filet 4\/5, Pulpo Asado 4\/5 and fried calamari 4\/5.\n\nOverall a good lunch and everyone enjoyed the variety. For dessert they brought out a flan and sang Happy Birthday. The rest of us tried the Banana Beignet 4\/5 and the trio of Gelato 4\/5.\n\nThank you Firefly for making this a memorable birthday lunch! Will be back for Happy Hour as this is one of our faves!
