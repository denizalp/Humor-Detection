Went here on a recommendation of co-workers who live in Montreal.  I read the reviews and thought \"hey, it's a Thursday night and my last night of a long work week in Montreal, so why not?\".  I \"drug\" another out-of-town coworker from Stockholm here.\n\nI would have to say that we got here a bit early at 7:30.  We walked right in without reservations.  When we left at 9:30, it was packed (as most reviews indicate) and the bouncer was starting to size up guys trying to come in.\n\nYes, they do have a bevy (a Texas term) of beauties serving food.  I have been many a brestaurant, and the girls here are nice looking, but they know it.  I am pretty sure each of the male managers is trying too hard.\n\nThat aside, the food is good.  The menu is varied, with a concentration on \"Italian\" food.  The appetizers were heavy on (raw) seafood and a few salads.  I settled on a  ceviche, which was good, but not a typical ceviche - the chunks of shrimp, fish, octopus were pretty big and not marinated long enough.\n\nI had a pasta dish that was simple with truffle oil and mozzarella. It was very good and I would order it again.  \n\nOverall, I understand why this place gets the reviews it does - including from my Quebecois coworkers.  It is a bit over-priced, and I question some of the clientele.  If I were entertaining a client or taking a special-someone to a dinner in Montreal, this would not be a first-choice.
