This Food City and I have a strange relationship together.  I love it for a lot of reasons.\n\n1.  Because it's Food City, you can expect the prices to be low.\n2.  Legitimately good prices on fruit and vegetables.  They had a special in which you could get 5 avocados for $1.  Granted, they weren't ripe, but for once I successfully did the \"put the things in a paper bag in a dark place to ripen\" technique and they were all delicious.\n3.  They not only have fresh chorizo, they have soyrizo, which I actually prefer.\n4.  Cheap Mexican candles with religious figures on them looking holy and quite solemn.  Those things will last you a lifetime.\n\nBut, you also have to hate it because:\n\n1.  Because it's food city, almost everyone there, practically, is a mutant.  On any given day you'll see shirtless babies grabbing toys off of the shelf, dropping them to the ground, then screaming in hysterical tears.\n2.  One lady who works here is a complete bitch.  When I saw the above-mentioned avocado deal, it was limit 5 per customer, and I had 10.  No big deal, I can put 5 back, I can pay for 5 on a non-discounted rate or have my girlfriend buy the other 5.  I could do any number of things.  Instead, she ripped open the bag I had with my delicious fruit in there without even asking and I was thinking, \"What the fuck?  Shouldn't you ask before fucking decimating my bag of avocados?\"  One time, she also bumped into my squeezing by a shelf and never looked at me or apologized.\n3.  Almost every time I go here, someone outside will ask me for money or cigarettes.\n\nOverall, I guess if the prices are okay and I don't get a knife to the back, it gets a passing grade.
