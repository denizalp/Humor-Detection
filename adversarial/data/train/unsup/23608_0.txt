Sure, they have interesting stuf, most of it British, and some of it reasonably priced--at least by Toronto standards. But customer service sucks more often than not. On my last visit,  a lady who works there sneered at my jeans--I guess I should've worn a tuxedo. She was rude and condescending. I will probably not buy there again.\n\nUPDATED: I made the mistake of coming back. The manager, a short, older man who does not dress like he knows about clothing, had this to say when I pointed at a coat, \"Let's not kid ourselves. This is 5 grand.\"
