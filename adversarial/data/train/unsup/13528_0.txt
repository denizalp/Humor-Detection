Good NY style Chinese food! I recently tried this place and was very happy with the price, value, and taste. I ordered a dinner combo of the crispy scallion chicken - it was tasty, came with fried rice and an egg roll, and it was made to go relatively quickly! Based on the one visit, I would recommend! As of now, I do like NY restaurant more(in Cornelius), BUT I will take one for the team and keep trying this place again, and again, and again!
