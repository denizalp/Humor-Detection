This place is a gem if you are looking for food items from Eastern Europe.\nMy previous forays here were limited to picking up smoked Salmon, Caviar and some cheese from that region. However I would recommend them for their baked goods and some dessert offerings (more on that later) \nThe place is better accessed via car but one can venture out and take TTC here as well. Located in a strange location of the main drag this is one of those you blink you miss kind of place unless you know where you are going. To give you an idea this is a tad smaller version of Starsky's grocery stores. The variety is at par with Starsky's IMO so if you don't want to venture outside Toronto this is a safe bet.  Plenty of hard to find items and oh so impossible to find ingredients. \nI am kind of partial to less sweet and richer desserts so try and find places that sell them. However this place disappoints in this case as they carry stuff from Dufflet (meh) and Rahier (Thumbs up) which is just fine in my book. They do make some items in house which were decent (opera cake) though nothing special and worth the trek. \n4 Stars.
