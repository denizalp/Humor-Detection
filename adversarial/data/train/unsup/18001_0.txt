I stop by this Vons location often and it's clean inside and the employees are helpful. There is a guy who works in the produce department that makes a point to say hello and ask if I'm finding everything OK and I see that he does the same to other customers. I've asked him for help a couple of times and points me in the right direction and has great customer service. The cashiers are for the most part friendly and helpful. The produce usually looks better here than other places, but it's finding it at a reasonable price that can be tricky sometimes. I check their ad weekly and compare with the other competitors to see what I will purchase here that week and what I'll get elsewhere. I have been a Vons Club member for a long time and the \"just for u\" program is nice because it's tailored to a lot a your purchases and gives you digital and printable coupons based upon those purchases. Often they give me freebies like a dozen eggs, loaf of bread or this last week it was a package of pasta from the refrigerated section. You can also earn gas rewards with the club card. The bakery offers some tasty bagels and breads however the pastries such as the donuts haven't been very well liked by myself or hubby. The deli makes soups, sub sandwiches and different flavors of chicken throughout the day and the soups I've had are really good and convenient for an easy lunch or dinner. All in all a better than average shopping experience and I'll be back.
