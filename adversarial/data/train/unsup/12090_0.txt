I am in love with Criss Angel! I'm embarrassed to say that I had no idea who he was until I came to the show invited by my brother.  Mindfreak was incredibly dark, haunting, and Gothic​ which made it an entertaining  show. The magic was incredible and I was impressed by Criss Angel because he really loves his craft and I found it interesting that 20 years ago he was inspired by Lance Burton which was one of the first magic shows I saw at the Hacienda. Mindfreak was so different from other Illusionist's​ performances because  Angel is not only an entertainer but a very real person with deep passion, weaving his own stories such as being an awkward teenager to his acts. You also had some stooge performances in between acts with Maestro, mini Latin Danny DeVito version of Criss Angel...very funny.\n\nCriss has turned classic magical illusions to his Gothic rock metal style which made them more alluring. You should check out how he saws his assistant in half...she is gorgeous...hate her!  Most amazing part of his show was his own levitation at the end. I was speechless because he made it so visually real and impressive... How did he do it??? I don't know what else to say but please check out Mindfreak because Criss Angel is very hot and I'm sure it he's a very down-to-earth person when he's not performing... I really was touched by passion to support Children's Cancer victims. I think he had a very personal story and I think it's wonderful that he can try to help Society.
