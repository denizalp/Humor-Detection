This place is awesome. We go there regularly and the instructors are so loving and caring. My son has gained great confidence, strength and loves the activities. \n\nAdditionally, we had his 3rd birthday here and it was a hit. The party attendants did fantastic and the parents could sit back and socialize. The kids left exhausted and sweaty and everyone commented on what a great time the kids had. \n\nThe only drawback of the little gym is that it is a bit pricey and the classes are limited depending on your child's age group.
