Robots, mash-ups, funny bathroom signs, and oh yeah - good food and service!\n\nMy lunch buddy Myke and I decided to go here after a long time absent from lunching near campus.  We used to go to Sushi Boy Desu so we had to finally check out the new spot.  We noticed the same uncomfortable chairs were kept and repainted, but that place had a black and white vibe and the oddly light wood sushi bar remained as a counter spot.\n\nI ordered Thai iced tea and Myke had a coke.  The \"amuse\" was a spicy gingery brown sugar tea in little glasses served via dipping sauce dish.  It was interesting - I have never had an amuse drink!\n\nI had the gogi stuffed waffles with eggs over easy and Myke got the shoyu ribs ramen.  I liked the idea of mine (eggs cooked perfectly, and it had scallions!) but I don't usually eat waffles or even pancakes with syrup and butter, but they were poured all over the top of my waffles rather than served on the side (not mentioned on menu).  I think this would have been better just plain with the bulgogi inside and then condiments on the side (there was a side of sweet and sour sauce too but I didn't use it or know what it was for).  I ended up breaking the yolks up, pouring the syrup off my waffles and then dipping them in the eggs.\n\nOne of the servers brought us togarashi and wasabi lime salt so I sprinkled it on my waffles (I think it was for Myke's ramen).  He was happy with the ramen (served at 165 degrees) but said it was too much food! :)\n\nIt was definitely a unique experience and we got a punch card for our next visits.  \"Hapi\" hour is 9-11AM Monday through Thursday, and you can get 20% off your entire check.  The menu is more extensive than the web site indicated so I am intrigued by some of the tapas dishes and will try them eventually!
