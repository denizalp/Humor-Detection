Suggested to my (adult) son that he try another barbershop close to his home (or at least use as a back up) rather than drive across town, especially since he is job hunting.  He left with the worst haircut I've seen since the one he got the day before my daughter's wedding.  He texted us his picture, and I simply cannot explain it.  A \"just clean it up\" for a job interview consisted of shaved sides and back, very short back of the head, and very long on top...even his wife laughed when she saw the picture!  He made a beeline across town to his favorite barber, who said, \"Wow!  Someone really f***d with your hair!\"  It now looks presentable but way shorter than he would like.  At least no one will laugh at him for the job interview now that he paid a second barber.\np.s.  I am not posting the name of the barbershop that fixed it because I do not want someone thinking that this is a planted review.  It's not.  Likely, this was one barber not familiar with this hair type or maybe new...everyone makes mistakes.  However, if you find a barber you like, stay true (as my son learned).  This piece of advice works for wives, too.
