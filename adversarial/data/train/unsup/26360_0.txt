Broken-hearted that Rosewood Grille is closed. Almost 20 years ago, I met a group of friends for a super-lush dinner when in Vegas and we went for the lobster. The restaurant was beautiful, the staff was SO friendly - totally made a huge impression on me and always wanted to go back to visit the Rosewood. I waited too long and now they're closed. Total bummer. It was an outstanding fabulous restaurant.
