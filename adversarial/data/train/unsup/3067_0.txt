The ice cream challenge was very difficult to successfully complete due to a time constraint of only 10 minutes, however with the entire restaurant coming together & cheering me on, I had no choice but to turn on the afterburners and the rest is history. I highly doubt there will be many successful winners of this challenge with the exception of seasoned competitive eaters. A fun time to enjoy a heavy dose of sugar, win or lose, I say try this sweet challenge for the hell of it, you only live once, right. =)
