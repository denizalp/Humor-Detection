Came here for lunch, when we first arrived it was somewhat busy but quickly emptied out. The waitress was good at first but once we ordered, never saw her again. It took an hour to get sliders (?!) unacceptable service. The only good thing is sitting outside and people watching. After we got our food, we had to track down our waitress for a refill on our drinks.
