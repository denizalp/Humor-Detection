I wanted to love this place, I really did!\n\nThe good: The food and drinks were amazing, and a great value. I had a BLT on rye, and added an egg. They didnt skimp on the bacon, and the bread was great.  My boyfriend and friends all got crepes. I tried a bite of the 'cordon blue'-it was so savoury! \nTheir freshly squeezed lemonade is light (not too sour), and they have a huge selection of flavoured coffee. \nGreat atmosphere is great, and the patio is cute.\n\nThe bad: The service! This has more to do with a staffing problem then with the people who served us. They were wonderful-we were a party of 4 but payed separately and they still brought all our food out together. They also appologized about the wait. But, it took about 15 mins to just order at the counter and another 20 ontop of that for the food. 2 people working at 11 on a Sunday morning doesn't seem right. So, I had to bump this rating down to a 3 (would have been a 4).
