Friendly staff. I had my apointment on Friday Jan 20, 2017. The doctor finished my eye exam in a timely manor and didn't add on the dilation when it wasn't needed which is nice. They let me look at frames while I waited for the doctor which saved time at the end after the exam. The staff members were very helpful when it came to picking my frames and answered all my questions about the different coatings and options for the lenses. It took less than an hour from my apointment time to get everything done although I showed up about 10 minutes early. It would have been faster but I had trouble deciding which frames I wanted. I would recommend this place to friends and family.
