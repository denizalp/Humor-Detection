Detoured through Charlotte to visit Alchemy, and it was totally worth it! It was my first time ever at a salon, and they made me feel very comfortable. I came in not knowing what I wanted, and my stylist, Jess, went above my expectations! Everyone here is friendly and the environment is unique. Overall, fantastic first visit.
