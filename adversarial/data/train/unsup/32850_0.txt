This is literally the ULTIMATE training facility. They provide top of the line equipment that most gyms in Vegas don't have. They accommodate all members requests from adding equipment to even providing vending machines. The owners J & Carlo are the most friendliest, outgoing, passionate people I know. J is my coach and he is completely dedicated to making each of his clients reach their full potential, correctly. He understands the importance of technique to prevent injury and he always makes your goals attainable. Nick is the head coach at Smash and he is also extremely knowledgeable in all aspects of health and fitness, Dr. Nick. haha. Also, Yordan is a coach that is always willing to help you strive and keep going when you want to stop. Overall, I salute each individual that is a part of SMASH IRON. The environment here is always comforting, welcoming, and clean. I love Smash Iron Fitness!
