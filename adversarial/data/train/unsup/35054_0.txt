I'm not even sure how to possibly describe the incredible dining experience I had here. I was speechless when I finished, which is why it took me so long to write this review.\n\nThere were four of us for dinner, and we ordered 5 entrees, and a few appetizers, all to share. There wasn't a single thing that we wouldn't order again. The soups were outstanding the goat cheese appetizer was mouth watering, and the salmon was out of this world! There was a vegetarian entree that was also quite delicious, and the pasta dish was filling without being heavy. Dessert was a whole new level of mind blowing. The passion fruit squares LITERALLY brought tears to my eyes. The coconut chia parfait was good, but couldn't compete with the passion fruit dessert that I tried first. The cream puffs were also quite tasty but again, the passion fruit dessert won my heart and nothing could compare. \n\nI WILL fly to Las Vegas just to eat dinner at Eatt. It is a hidden gem, off the strip, and not pretentious at all. What an incredible restaurant, with staff and owners that truly care about the food they are serving their customers. You will not be disappointed by choosing to dine here over any of the fancy fine dining spots on the strip. Do yourself a favor, and pay the extra uber fare to go to Eatt!
