Just as an update, I ended up having to TOW my car away from Arizona Dyno Chip, and I took it to Gene's Auto Worx (the highest rated auto shop in the area on Yelp). Gene tackled the issues with my car, and called me back a day later to say that my car wasn't running because the Mass Air Flow sensor wasn't plugged in. I'm working with some consumer reporting agencies to try and get at least the cost of the tow back from Arizona Dyno Chip, since it wasn't operational due to Arizona Dyno Chip not even bothering to put it back together. These guys are jerks and scam artists; Arizona Dyno Chip will scam you and Arizona Dyno Chip will rip you off. Look for a high rated, trustworthy auto shop on Yelp!
