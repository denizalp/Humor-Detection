BRGR wishes it were Burgatory, but it's not.  And since they're basically at the same price point, why not just go to Burgatory instead?\n\nThe burgers, the toppings, the specials, the suggested combinations, and even the milkshakes (alcoholic and otherwise) are just slightly worse takes on an existing theme.  The food is just generally bland and unmemorable.  And one time everyone in my group got a stomach ache afterwards.
