We stopped in here for breakfast one morning and it wasn't bad; although I do have a couple of complaints.  First off, the staff wasn't too friendly.  When we walked in, we weren't greeted.  We walked up to the counter and started looking at the menu and were finally asked, \"Are you ready to order?\", which came from a voice at the other end of the counter.  My daughter and I decided to try the breakfast burrito and the hubby went with the breakfast pizza, all of which were very good and the portions were huge.  They are pretty pricey but we definitely could've split a meal.  We also ordered iced coffee with almond milk.  Unfortunately, it was mostly milk and we couldn't taste the coffee.  Also, my daughter ordered her burrito without some of the veggies.  When it was delivered, the server pointed out the one without the veggies and my daughter took it.  It wasn't until halfway through our meal that I noticed my daughter's plate was full of the veggies she had picked out of the burrito...what a waste! I ended up with the one with only beans and potatoes.  Also, they have an open air window, which is very cool, but not when there's a dairy farm nearby and you can smell the cows.  So my overpriced breakfast turned out to be a mixture of the smell of cow manure, almond milk, and no veggies, which I love.  Pretty disappointing.  Three stars though for the huge portions and the fact that the food is pretty tasty.
