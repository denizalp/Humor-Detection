There is nothing \"traditional\" with my Noodle in Traditional Sauce 傳統炸醬麵 ($5.99).\n\nJust imagine using the Hong Kong Style Cafe Bolognese meat sauce and add preserved pickled veggie topped on noodle and served with a side of corn?!! One of the most nasty lo mein I ate in a restaurant.\n\nLuckily the complimentary Hong Kong Style milk tea was decent.\n\nMaybe Food Kingdom menu is just too big. Maybe trimming down their menu will help? If some items are not good enough to serve or just caught the kitchen by surprise because some one really ordered that, please just take that off the menu.\n\nI don't know if I would be brave enough to come back to try out other items. But with so many other options in Scarborough, Food Kingdom would be a pass for me.
