Khoury's is a fabulous neighborhood wine, beer, and spirits store where it feels like a friend's place.  They take the time to get to know you and make great suggestions.  I find the prices very competitive for tequila, vodka, and wine.  We can experiment with tequila, vodka, beer, and my favorite - wine!  Even more fun are the free wine tastings on Thursdays!  It's a great crowd and some great wines are poured.  If you're looking for a more intimate experience, this is the place.  Stems up!
