Maybe the greasiest breakfast I've had in the city. Rivals Vesta lunch on Dupont for atmosphere. \n\nLong row of diner stools against the bar, and maybe 8 tables \/ booths in the place.\n\nFor about $8 you can have a really weighted breakfast - pancake, sausages, bacon, homefries, egg, and coffee.  The food isn't amazing or even that good - but no denying the charm of this place. The avg staff age is aprx 72. \n\nRight across from Sneaky Dee's (and open 24hrs on the weekend) - it's a good spot to grab weekend brunch when you're hungover and don't want to wait in line...because there won't be one.\n\nI guess that means I'll be back.
