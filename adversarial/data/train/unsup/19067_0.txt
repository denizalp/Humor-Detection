Came here last night (3\/26). Rude rude rude bouncers outside. My friends were already there and came out to meet me and they wouldn't let me in because they were \"at capacity.\" In the mean time they were letting groups of guys in. Finally 20 minutes later I got in. Apparently one of my friends asked the DJ about a song and he didn't say a word just rudely pointed to a sign that says no requests. Then, coming back from the bathroom, it was so crowded my friend and I stopped near (not IN) the opening to the bar, and the bouncer with the long goatee literally pushed me and yelled at me to not stand there. \n\nI will never come back here. The bartenders were a little nicer but overall the staff were rude and totally ruined the experience. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
