Bought my charger here last year and I'm in still in love with it! the guys there were super cool and I didn't feel any pressure when buying. They were upfront about what i qualified for vs what I wanted. But most of all the service dept. first of all I hate car repairs as every other single woman but the great part this place is that u get a discount on labor! and not no nickle n dime either even with an expired warranty! Mike and Angie (I think sorry if I'm wrong) are honest on what's priority along with cost management in mind for their customers!
