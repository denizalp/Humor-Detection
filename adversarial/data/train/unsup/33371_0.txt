I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The bread was stale and not edible. When I mentioned it to the server she said they were thinking about changing bread vendors because of complaints they were receiving. That did not help me. The barbecue itself was fine, nothing spectacular. The potato salad was very good. My husband ordered the Cuban sandwich and was disappointed by the size of the sandwich for $10.00 it was very small 2 small pieces of ham and a small amount of pork. His bun was also stale and dry. All in all very disappointing, I was going to try the bakery but felt I had given them enough of my money and did not want to be disappointed again
