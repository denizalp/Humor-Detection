Went again, and it was even better! The music volume had decreased, service was friendlier, and every bite of the food was spectacular. \n\nThe atmosphere here is like a seedy hole-in the wall dive bar in the best kind of way. \n\nDid I mentioned how entertaining watching the hustle and bustle in the kitchen is?  (Flaming woks!)\n\n\nWe had some Mackeral, torched table side (fun to watch), and a tasty and satisfying dish. We also had the beef short rib rice bowl, all the elements and flavors  really pop and go together perfectly, and we shared it and  the Mackeral and it was more than enough for two people. \n\nOverall another really great experience here!
