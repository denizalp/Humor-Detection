Grabbed takeout after a long 48 hrs of moving and we were famished. It was the first place I caught off the freeway near several other fast food stops and gas stations. Received fast and prompt, friendly takeout in their 24 hr drive-thru. Anyone driving through here for takeout I'd advise to make a wide turn up to their window since the corner is a little sharp once u drive past the menu window where you order. \n\nBest item we odered on the menu was the oreo churros and the oreo icing.  As for the shredded chicken chimichanga and the enchiladas, they were flavorful but far too salty for my taste. Their portions are very generous. Easily could have shared between 2-3 people per entree. Overall, our experience was okay, but not for me to return.
