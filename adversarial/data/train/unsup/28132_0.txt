I got my hair done by Kittim, and it was perfection!!! I know this sounds very narcissistic, but my hair just looks SO GOOD!! I got the living social deal for cut, color, and highlight, which is a super bargain for what I got in return. He put a lot of effort into making sure my hair color comes out the way I want, and the end result is just amazing. I will definitely come back!
