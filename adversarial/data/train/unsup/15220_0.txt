IKEA is a glorious place with everything you can dream of for your home. They even have food to keep you powered through your journey like Swedish meatballs and cinnamon rolls. \n\nHOWEVER\n\nIf you're interested in buying any large items be prepared to bring your weight belt to guard your back on the journey of pulling things off massive shelves alone. \n\nI was there with my mother and baby. First off- the cart machine wasn't pushing out carts to put heavy items on. Two strangers tried to help me and the machine was stuck. I stood there maybe 5-10 min while one person went to get an employee and no one came - isn't this place on camera? Is anyone watching the customers struggle on this stupid machine? Nobody cares.\n\nFinally after a janitor brought over a cart, and I was on my way to find what I needed for a twin bed. There were three pieces in three separate spaces. This is like trying to solve a riddle folks - if you lack problem solving skills, don't even try to buy any large items. \n\nOnce I found what I needed, I spend ten minutes trying to find help. Oh I forgot to mention this was during the week- so floor employees didn't seem really busy helping others. Finally I found a guy that shuffled over to help with one item but didn't help with the mattress - I guess because it was semi heavy? \n\nFinally I make it to the register and all is well...and a man pushing carts helped load the bed frame into our car. Thank god! \n\nSo my advice is don't plan on buying any large pieces unless you've brought a weight lifting champion or giant with you. If you're just browsing accessories - it'll be fun. IKEA needs to step up customer service though. That was crazy.
