Very disappointed with the service I received at Findlay Kia.  It all started out fine, but I wish I could say the same with how it ended.  When I went to pick up my car after getting it serviced I noticed a large gash on one of my rims that wasn't there when I dropped it off.  I understand that the service employees work hard and that mistakes happen, but after I brought it to the attention of my service advisor, who later brought it to the attention of the service manager, they just tried to explain it away.  I never asked for anything or requested that they pay for the damage.  All I wanted was for them to acknowledge that they messed up and apologize.  This is a business that doesn't own up to their mistakes, and I won't be bringing my business to them anymore.
