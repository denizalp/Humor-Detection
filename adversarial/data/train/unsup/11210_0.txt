This is for the buffet only: I came here a few years ago because I loved this hotel as a child. After getting a big plate at the buffet, I noticed nats in my food! Not just one or two, but 100s mixed it with the ambrosia type jello salad. I immediately asked to speak to the manager. She told me \"bugs are part of vegas\" WTF not in my food!  After walking through the buffet with her, we noticed bugs throughout the entire buffet. made me utterly sick. My 2 friends and I demanded a refund and she said she would give us coupons to eat here again for free. I was outraged, like is ever return! She finally have us our money back, and for some reason needed our email. Since then I got nothing but a flood of emails asking us to stay at this hotel. Needless to say, I changed my email.\n\nThe casino was ok, waitress was rude and NEVER brought my drink.
