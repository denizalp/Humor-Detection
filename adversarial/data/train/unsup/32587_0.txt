Tire center: I came in due to a screw in a tire. 3 ladies behind the counter and after about 10 mins one acknowledged me. She told me I needed to move my car and then someone will be with me. So i did.. another 10 mins went by. She came out and asked me some information. Asked if i had any protection on my tires? I said I didnt know and that I had bought them from walmart a year ago. She huffed and walked away. When she came back she had me sign something without explaining it. She said K and went to walk away. I asked her how long will it take to fix.. maybe an hour or two. Not sure we' call you when we are done. Not impressed.. if I hadn't bought them here I would come back here for any service at all.
