Don't go to buy anything there if you have no cash. The guy at the counter was very rude. I have been to the square a few times always said that i will try the food. So the day I decided to go and try it i did not have any cash on me. To use your debit card you have to spend a minimum of twenty dollars. I am sorry but not going to spend that much when it is the first time you are going to try something.
