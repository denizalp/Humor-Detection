Brought my  friend and fellow yelper Michael P. here yesterday for lunch. We ordered yang zhou fried rice (excellent, as always) and beef and broccoli. I never bothered to order beef and broccoli here before because I see it as probably the most common take-out order in \"Americanized Chinese\" fast food places, and I try to order dishes that are normally not found in most Chinese restaurants. But Michael wanted to try their version of beef and broccoli here. It turned out to be fantastic - very tender thin-sliced beef in a scrumptious oyster-garlic sauce as only A.C.E. can make it, with choy sum (sometimes referred to as Chinese broccoli) instead of regular broccoli. I might have known that my fave Asian restaurant can transform even a common dish like this into something truly extraordinary. Oh, why couldn't this restaurant be closer to where I live??
