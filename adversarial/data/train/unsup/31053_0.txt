Downtown Phoenix bar.  Old Town Scottsdale prices.  I guess that's Gypsy Bar's way of making up for not charging a cover but still validating parking.\n\nIt's half dance club, half arcade.  There are hot girls dancing on little stages and people randomly drawing artwork, but somehow this place has no personality.  If you're looking for a spot with a nightclub feel that's in the middle of a part of town that has a weak nightlife, you'll probably have a better time than I did.
