Let me say first that the service was outstanding! There was a mix up with my reservation two years ago. Had a reservation booked but then was called that they were closed. Two years ago.  So, Ryan, General Manager, had a note of this and was gracious enough to comp us some delicious sides to go with our outstanding dinner. He came over to our table and apologized about what happened two years ago. Service from Bartendar, waitress,hostess and GM was fantastic. Patio is absolutely beautiful there and the food is delicious. Will always go to El Chorro every time we are in AZ. \nPS. Still dreaming of the sticky buns from there
