The atmosphere and look of this place is very nice! It's comforting and relaxing to go into and have a late meal after walking on the strip for miles.\n\nI am only giving this place three stars because our waitress didn't ask what drinks we would like, and never sent the cocktail waitress over to get prices on drinks.\nThey also don't allow you to split the check, as we went in a group, so this caused a hindrance at our table until we could move money around to one another to cover our costs. \n\nThe food was good, big portions. The feel of the restaurant with the food is just a nice place to go late at night, but I don't know if i'll ever return if I come back to Las Vegas because of the split check situation. So please be advised if you plan to go with multiple people!
