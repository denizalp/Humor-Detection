We've started shopping at this location, as its a bit cleaner than the Tropicana and Jones location.\n\nThis week, they had no frozen Tilapia, which bummed me out, but what can you do...go to another location another day.\n\nThis store is consistently clean, and employees are polite.  \nIts a little further away from home, but worth it, for a better selection, and a cleaner store.
