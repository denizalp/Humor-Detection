If I had a dollar for every time I was greeted by a server in Toronto, and told \"our plates are meant for sharing\" I'd be a rich man. And if, in turn, l  was granted a wish for each time I left a \"tapas-style\" restaurant disappointed, I'd be both rich, and happy.\n\nMy first wish, of course, would be to forever banish every cook, chef, and hipster waiter who took part in serving me food that was in fact impossible to share, meagrely portioned, and designed to fit the appetizer\/entree\/side framework. \n\nBut perhaps a method of cooking and serving food designed for sharing isn't quite as apparent as I imagine it to be. Perhaps I'm a fool, and in fact a single croquette, roughly the size of my pinky finger, served atop a miniscule salad of baby spinach and garnished with 3 slices of cured trout is perfect for \"sharing, tapas-style\" in some alternate universe filled with ironic sweatshirt-wearing bearded twenty somethings who think nothing of butchering entire sides of beef on the kitchen pass.\n\nSeriously Marben, give me a break. And go away. Visit Spain, and Greece. Eat cicchetti in Venice. Learn how to count, to add, and subtract. \n\nWhen you come back, if you still insist on a \"sharing\" menu that bears a closer resemblance to a typical 3 course dining experience than it does one of the world's great small plate\/shared eating traditions, please design your menu thusly:\n\nAppetizers\n1. app 1\n2. app 2\n3. app 3\n\nPrice for 1 persons=x\nPrice for 2 persons=x\nPrice for 3 persons=x\nPrice for 4 persons=x\n\nEntrees\n1. entree 1\n2. entree 2\n3. entree 3\n\nPrice for 1 persons=x\n\nEtc, etc.\n\nGet my drift Marben? \n\nEven better still however, would be that you come back with the resolve to entirely redesign your plates so that they can in fact be shared by tables of two, six, ten, whatever. Of course this would mean that you might need to serve multiples of some things on a single plate, or that you put your knife skills to good use and divide whatever is on the plate into bite-sized portions, or even expand your cooking repertoire to include things that are already, in all of their natural glory, bite-sized.\n\nYou'll have to put an end to your self-congratulatory navel-gazing too. I kind of expect, given the price-point,  that your provisions are of quality, and that your meat comes from farms. \n\nDo all of this and you can keep the bearded waiter and the girls in the vintage granny dresses. They at least were kind of cute.
