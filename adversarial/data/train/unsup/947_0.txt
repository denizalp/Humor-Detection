Back to Pizzeria Napoletana, and I brought my dad to celebrate my Birthday lunch with my fiancé.\n\n  Picked out a bottle of vino at the SAQ on St-Laurent just around the corner. Make sure you have Cash here. They do have an ATM in the back if you forget.\n\nThe waiters were friendlier this time, dont expect friendly.  I know they have a reputation for not caring, just busy working. They brought out menus, opened the wine bottle , and brought out Euro-Style Small glasses for the wine, great so you don't knock it over, and so the waiters can Stack the Glasses Sky-high like the Tower of Pisa when they clear the tables, amazing to watch.\n\nWe ordered the Antipasto della casa :  its prosciutto crudo, Bocconcini, roasted red peppers.  Really delicious the Bocconcini cheese (similar to buffalo mozzarella) was so fresh, it needed seasoning like salt or pepper or balsamic glaze, but it worked with the Prosciutto and roasted Red peppers (they tasted like sundried tomatoes dehydrated and salty), they combined into a delicious party in your mouth. \nThis Antipasto was designed for 1, not so much to share.\n\nChoose from 34 pizzas and 31 varieties of pasta dishes. \nWe chose the no.9 Arrabbiata Pizza : mozzarella,  tomato sauce, olives, anchovies, Hot Peppers.  I love the thin crispy crust it just works with anything. I found the pizza to be salty, but that's what anchovies are. My dad really enjoyed this pizza, he also ate it with the bread rolls they complimentary brought out .\n\nAlso ordered the no.25 Genovese : its Pesto,  Smoked Turkey, marinated hot peppers, mozzarella, parmesan, sliced tomates .  Wow! My Favourite I'm loving this pizza soo much I wish we ordered two!    Again crispy thin perfection crust, smokey Turkey flav,  delicious mozzarella, tasty Parmesan, a little bite with the pepper rings and delicate tomato slices to finish it off.  Yumm.  *see pics*\n\nMy dad ordered an espresso Alongé and was happy.\n\nI stared at the Pastry Display case as we made our way out of the Restaurant, Tiramisu, Cannolis,  Millefeuilles, Profiteroles, wiped the drool away and left happy cause I had an awesome Pizza.\n\n\"Try something from \"You Gotta Eat Here!\" The Donatella, O'Sole Mio, Mafaldine Casarecce, or Polpette di Angelina\" **
