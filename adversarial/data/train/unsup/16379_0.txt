Needed a last minute late night dinner on a Friday night - Briscola had an opening. Lucky me.\n\nSpace was long and narrow - very \"cool\". Mirrors along the wall with sketched on blueprints. Dark. Packed with attractive people. Not the usual College street crowd. I thought it maybe was King West douchers or Yorkville kids coming to out West to show their babes they know \"cool\" places. \n\n\"Babe, I know this great little place - way out West. Yeah, West of Spadina. West of Bathurst. We could probably ZipCar there. Yeah \"\n\nAnyways, our server was outstanding. I normally hate man servers. Some sort of weird sexist complex I've got. But this guy was a pro. While we were looking at the menu he suggest some pan-fried olives with herbs, breadcrumbs, and orange zest to help us decide. I agreed without really thinking about it - and sort of worried about what would come out. \n\nThese things were excellent. It reminded me of little pop-corn chickens. But olives. And I wasn't at KFC. He did sort of look like the Colonel, though.\n\nThere were at least 4 veal options. Osso Buco, ragout in pappardelle, I think some cheeks in there, too.\n\nI had the pappardelle. It was heavy and perfectly portioned. Pasta cooked al dente, just the way I like. A side of garlic sauteed rapini came as well. Awesome. \n\nHad your typical selection of Italian beers, Peronni, Moretti, etc. Didn't have dessert....but they looked fancy and rich.\n\nTwo meals, a salad, a side, and two drinks = ~90$. Could've been worse.
