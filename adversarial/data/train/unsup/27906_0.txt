What a great experience purchasing our appliances for our own home here. Randy was amazing to work with and patient. He is very knowledgeable and I appreciate his honesty on all the different appliances. Picking these appliances for our home was a difficult choice and Randy was great with helping us put everything together. The installer Steve that was sent out, was wonderful as well and had excellent communication with us about install. We could not be happier with the service they provided. It is nice to be able to go to a place that has people working there that really care about the customer and are willing to go out of their way to help you! Thank you Randy!
