How does MetroPark inventory work?\n\nWhen we came in, we saw a sign that announced that the store was closing for good in two days. Is it then reasonable for one to expect really, really cheap prices? Perhaps if this was a \"normal\" store.\n\nI saw a cute dress that I really wanted up until I saw the $70 tag. Pass!
