Just want to update on Patty L review on Wonton Time.. the veggie with oyster sauce is no long at $1.50, made that $3. I would have give Wonton Time at least 4 stars if not for the veggie I ordered.\n\nThe wonton and fish ball rice noodle I ordered tasted pretty good. 3.5 stars... The shrimp in the wonton is freah and have a great bite too it. \n\nHowever the veggie I ordered it was full of sand!! crunch crunch crunch! I just could not make myself to eat that and that little plate for $3 and has sand all over it? BTW, if you want to have veggie go for lettuce since at least there won't be sand in between the stems.\n\nThey were really nice when I told them about what's wrong with my veggie.. and they apologized and took that off my bill.\n\n** My boyfriend after hearing my story went there and order the same veggie again and have the same problem the next day!! (gee now I know he never listens when I am talking!!)\n\nSo please stay away from that and it will make it an excellent wonton noodle experience!\n\nThey accepts Cash only!
