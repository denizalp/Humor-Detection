My experience with Dodge Electric was fantastic! Upon calling the number, an electrician answered and scheduled with me right away. A gentleman named Preston came on time (bit early even!) and deciphered the problem instantly.\n\nThe power in half the house had blown from using a space heater and switching the breakers on and off immediately after the outage had not helped. After contacting the power company, they advised us that we may need an electrician's help. Preston informed us that the breakers need to cool down and if you try resetting them right after an outage, it might not bring the power back. But if you try again later, it will work. Wish we had known this, and avoided wasting his time! But he was very courteous and let us know to contact them again if any other problem should arise. I wish we could have paid him for his time! \n\nA++++ for Dodge Electric, definitely our go-to electricians in the future.
