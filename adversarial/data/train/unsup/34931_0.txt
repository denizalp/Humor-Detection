We were in Sun Prairie for a wedding and stopped at Glass Nickel to grab a bite to eat after the ceremony.  The restaurant itself was underwhelming (service wasn't particularly friendly right off the bat), but it was clean and featured ample seating and copies of The Onion.  We ordered two sandwiches and attempted to order the pub chips, but were informed that they were \"out of those.\"  Really?  It was 2 pm on a Saturday and the only other customers were an elderly quartet who had ordered a pizza.  Whatever.\n\nThe sandwiches were ok, nothing special.  I was intrigued by the specialty pizza menu and was thisclose to asking if they could deliver the Couch Potato (pizza topped with broccoli, cheese, bacon, and french fries...served with sour cream on the side for dipping) to our hotel room around 1 am.  I regretfully refrained.\n\nAll in all, food was acceptable, service left something to be desired.  And we could have used the Couch Potato following the reception.  Especially considering that we tried to look up \"Grilled Cheese\" in the phone book when we got back to our hotel room.  Next time...
