The reason I don't bother going to casino buffets in Vegas anymore, I first came to Texas de Brazil about 7 years ago. I've been to other Brazilian BBQ restaurants like Fogo & they all come up short in comparison to Texas. I've even been to the one in Miami beach & they have the same quality as this Las Vegas location.\n\nWhenever I'm in town I always bring friends that have never been here, and they always love this place. It's a must try, if you plan on going for dinner during the weekend make sure you call a few days in advance for a reservation to get the time you actually want, this place gets packed on the weekends.
