I've lived in the Bay Area for the last six years and when I moved to Arizona, I had my doubts on the food here. \n\nJoe's Farm Grill exceeded my expectations of breakfast and lunch food items. \n\nWhat I got: \nFontina Burger. Rating:  4\/5 \nBBQ Chicken Pizza. Rating:  4\/5\nFarm Burger. Rating:  3\/5\nSweet Potato Fries. Rating 4\/5\nTraditional Eggs. Rating 4\/5\n\nThe Traditional Eggs are unlike anything I've ever ate. Its light, fresh, and has doesn't leave you with that heavy breakfast feeling. Unlike IHOP or Denny's, its feels very healthy and the feeling where you've got all the protein in your diet to start the day. \n\nThe BBQ Chicken Pizza was also great - It's huge enough to share for two people. It's a flat bread pizza that I'm also a huge fan of! \n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite breakfast places in the Phoenix area. It has also been in featured on the Food Network and a place where I take visitors.
