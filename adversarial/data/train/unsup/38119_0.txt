Only go here if you want hard stale bread and sandwiches so small you'll need 5 to make a complete meal. My chicken walnut sandwich literally had one bite of chicken salad and the rest was wilted lettuce and tomato.  I won't even get into how the cashier screwed up our order so we had to order twice and it ended up being more money than it would have been if they'd gotten it right the first time. Total fail and will not be back. Wish Paradise Bakery was still here. Much better quality and product.
