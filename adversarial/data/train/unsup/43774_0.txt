El Tizon 2 is a pretty decent place. The staff is helpful and can guide you through the ordering process at the register. If you want to wing it, there are pictures of many of the foods on the menu board. I have never had anything bad here. The portions are large and flavorful. \n\nSeating is a little limited, so you may have to stalk tables at lunch time. This time our group had several different plates. The Carne Asada plate was a little over cooked. It was a little burnt and dried out. The burrito is a safe bet, you can get it wet (sauce over it) or dry. The sopes are always a good bet as are the tacos and enchiladas. You can get Coke from the fountain or in cans, but I prefer the bottles, it adds that special something to the flavor.\n\nListen carefully for your number to be called, it can be a little hard to hear sometimes. Check out the condiment bar at the end of the ordering area. Watch for the roasted peppers to come out, they bring the HEAT! \n\nOverall the meals are filling and a decent value. Check it out.
