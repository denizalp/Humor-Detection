Just had Joe Filter out to service\/replace our RO Filters. The experience was better than even I expected. Words to best describe the experience were: \nPrompt, Professional, Clean, Convenient, Efficient and Reasonably Priced. Not to mention- it's just a great concept in Home Services. Thomas and his Team will be getting more referrals from me.
