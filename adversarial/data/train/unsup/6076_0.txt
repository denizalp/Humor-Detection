Bulldoze this place!  It's filthy...don't sit on anything.  Terrible service.  Actually no service.  We left after 20 minutes without so much as a glance from the staff.  It was nearly empty...easy to see why.\n\n1. Dead\n2. Over priced drinks\n3. Disgusting bathrooms\n4. The pool table is devoid of basic pool etiquette\n5. Disappointing deals considering Madison is a college town\n6. Bartenders are rude\n7. This place is just dirty. \n\nTheir so called \"Wing\" night....what a joke for .25 you get small wings that look like the chicken were diseased and on their death bed or they might just be baby rats.
