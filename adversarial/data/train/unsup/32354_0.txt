This is the hub where all of the rental car companies are housed.  It is a short  shuttle ride from the airport to the rental car facility.  There are restrooms, slot machines, and convenience stores. The place can get busy with long queue lines so plan accordingly. The best experience to escape the lines is to side up for loyalty plans with the car rental companies which allow quick check in and drop off for loyalty members. The shuttle service back to the airport is a longer ride than coming from the airport.  There can also be a bit of a wait to get on a shuttle during peak times.  I suggest getting to the airport 3 hours before scheduled departure when leaving vegas to be on the safe side.  \nI do appreciate all the rental car companies being housed in one building it makes it much easier to return the vehicle at the end of your stay.
