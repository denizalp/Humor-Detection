Waitress: \"Hello. Have you eaten here before? Yes. You need to know we reduced the size of our portions, and we recommend 3-4 items off the menu per person\". Did she just say what I think she said, to my face? We're serving even smaller portions than before and charging you  Vegas prices. My family wanted to eat there not me, but I wanted to make them happy while on vacation. My Cuban Sandwich (ham and cheese on toast) was 1\"x3\". My wife selected a nice Spanish glass of wine (filled half way) for $12. It was really good, so I looked it up online and the retail price for the bottle is $9. Seriously! I have never been to a place where half a glass of wine cost more than RETAIL price of a bottle! While my coke never got a refill, the waitress was happy enough to refill my water. 2 stars = one for the nice presentation, one for the reduced portions tasting good. Went straight to a slot machine after eating and won $20 on first spin at the Aria. So maybe a higher power tried to make me feel a little better, as if $20 was taken off the bill.
