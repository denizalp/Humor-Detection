My nephew and I wanted to get some ramen so we turned to where else?  Yup Yelp it was.  We read the reviews and decided to try this place out as it was close to where we were.  We both decided on the Char Siu Ramen ($11.95) and got the Pork Bun ($3.00). \n\nThe break down:\n\nThe pork bun was nice and tasty and yes I would definitely get it again. \n\nRamen:\nBroth:  Nice, light and refreshing pork bone broth. It's not thick and heavy like some other places \n\nNoodles: traditional Japanese ramen noodles. To me it was a little on the thinner side but good. \n\nChar Siu:. On the thin side. Maybe because of that it is cooked more than the soft falling apart ones that I'm used to. It is tasty though. \n\nThe service here is really good then again we came in between lunch and dinner so it wasn't full to capacity. \n\nI wanted to give it 3.5 stars but decided to round up until I found out that they charge for chili oil and house sauce. Who does that???  I'm sorry, I guess it's either my Chinese side coming out or I've never experienced a place charging me for the oil and sauce so I had to down grade to three stars. \n\nIf you are in the area and in the mood for ramen, then come and give this place a try especially if you don't like thick rich broth.  If your not, it isn't one of those places you go out of your way for.
