The show itself was good. This negative review is for the poor service & hospitality. I was excited to check out this show; however, the moment I walked inside the small venue it all went down hill. At the bar I cheerfully asked the bartender for a cranberry vodka. She asked bluntly, \"Do you want a double shot?\" I shook my head and said \"No thanks.\"  The big busted bimbo smirked and it was when the show started that I realized she served me \"cranberry & water.\" There was no trace of vodka in my drink at all. What a pleasant way to treat a paying customer. I even tipped her too!\n\nBefore the show started I found a seat in the back and was seated among some excited fans. Next thing I know, the hostess was moving everyone around me towards the front of the stage in an attempt to fill the empty seats. She hardly glanced my way as she started asking people if they would like to move. Mind you all these people were decent white folks. I guess she didn't mind leaving a little Asian gal all the way in back. Rather than feel the thrill of excitement from the live performance, I left with a feeling of disgust how people can treat others so unfairly. \n\nI add this negative review in hopes that management will read this and make changes to improve hospitality to extend to ALL people.
