Pita Jungle is easily my favorite go-to restaurant for casual dinner, take-out, etc.  This location has the cutest atmosphere - big patio, nice layout, great art.\n\nPita Jungle serves the most delicious, healthy food for a great price.  I've tried most things on the menu, and everything I've ordered has been incredibly flavorful and never heavy.  I could eat here every day (my husband limits it to once a week, for the sake of budget and sanity).  \n\nThe humus is the best in town, in my opinion.  The felafel is excellent, the pita and lavosh sandwiches are generous portions bursting with flavor, the pizzas are wonderful, and the ahi tuna is prepared perfectly.  The side vegetables and potatoes are both amazing, and you can get the veggies steamed, so you can even come here on a diet.  Order anything - I dare you!  \n\nThe service is generally really good.  Having come here for years, I have had spotty service a few times, generally when the restaurant was really busy or when the server was clearly new.  Just FYI, it's not the norm.
