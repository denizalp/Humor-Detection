Well let me just say that we searched far and wide when it came to finding the perfect school for our daughter when we moved to Arizona.  We mainly checked out charter schools, were possibly interested in private schools but did not look forward to the price tag, and definitely were not interested in public schools.  We were looking for a school that first and foremost would provide a supportive environment and that was rooted in a strong academic base.  Great Hearts was it.  Small class sizes, excellent teachers, beautiful campus, and it has been basically a high end private school education without costing an arm and a leg.  So glad we found this place.
