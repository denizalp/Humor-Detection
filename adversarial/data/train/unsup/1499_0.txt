After hearing about this place for a while, I finally got a chance to check it out.  That was Wednesday.  This is Friday and I've been back twice since!! \n\nJapanese owned and run, great service - very friendly - but what I care about most is the food.  Here are some highlights from my last three days:\n\n- The sushi rice is delicious and very well done.  And the ratio of fish to rice on the nigiri is ideal as many places use too much rice.\n\n- Giant clam, still MOVING slightly and topped with a very thin slice of lemon with peel.  Perfect way to start the meal.\n\n- I am a devout O-Toro worshipper and they served me the best O-Toro (blue fin tuna belly) I've eaten east of Hawaii.  Melts in your mouth, no need to chew.\n\n- Ankimo (monkfish liver) was new for me and is now a new fav.  It's the foie gras of the sea.  Be sure to take a superbite by putting this in your mouth with some of the scallion, pickled daikon and kale at the same time.  Heavenly.\n\n- Halibut Fin, OMG, wow.  I've never had the fin before this is incredible.  \n\n- Aji (Spanish Mackarel) was delicious and not even slightly fishy.\n\n- The hamachi is excellent, top quality fresh fish.  And I appreciated the knife cuts used on top to further tenderize the already very tender fish.  Melts.\n\n- I loved, loved, loved the GT-R Roll (Tiger shrimp tempuraand spicy tuna topped with seared albacore, Jalapenos and a spicy aioli.  Garnished with spicy garlic ponzu.)   I don't usually go in for the gimmicky rolls but this spicy one was out of this world.  They finish it off with a BLOW TORCH giving the whole thing a slightly grilled taste.\n\n- The Ika ten (squid tempura) was perfectly cooked.  You can dip it in classic tempura sauce or even better: salt and squeeze of fresh lemon.\n\n- I saw them butcher the salmon that had just arrived and then they cut me off some of the fatty belly.  Wow.  As good as the best I've had.\n\n\nGood not great:  \n\n- I love uni (sea urchin) and this was quite above average but Sen of Japan is still the best I've had anywhere in the world.\n\n- Occasionally I've had ikura that doesn't even have the slightest hint of fishiness.  This was not one of them.  But it was good.\n\n- I thought the anago (sea water eel) was very good and the friend I was with was raving about it.  \n\n- I ordered the Chicken Gizzard (kind of teriyaki-ish) because one of the chefs was telling me that's what he gets when he comes here to drink.  It was awesome, but quite heavy and a bit oily.  Would be perfect while drinking but not as a dish in the middle of a meal of fresh fish!\n\nAbalone - Up there with the best I've had east of Hawaii.\n\n\nThe miso soup is very good and they serve iced green tea which not all places do.  The prices are quite reasonable considering the high quality.  Also, if you have a special request to eat a certain fish they don't normally carry, just let them know in advance and they will order it if is available.  \n\nThis is my new go-to sushi joint.  There are a couple other secrets on and off the menu that I'd rather not disclose so they can save them all for me!!!!!  \n\nThis is 5 stars and I'm not a slut with my 5-star ratings.
