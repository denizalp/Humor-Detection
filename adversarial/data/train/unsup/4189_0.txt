Indian restaurant masquerading as the capital of Nepal.  No worries though, because the food is delicious and plentiful.  Our friends were served 10 minutes after ordering, though inexplicably our order took much longer.  The food is just spicy enough, and the naans expansive and crispy.  The service could be better, and it's a bit pricey, but I'll be going back regardless.\n\nObligatory Title Pun:  KathmanDU yourself a favour and come here.\n\nMenu Readability:  Long.  But they have everything divided and described adequately.\n\nNeed to mention:  They seem to close kind of early.  The place was a ghost town by 9pm on Friday night.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself:  I hate Kingfisher beer.  I really have to remember this.
