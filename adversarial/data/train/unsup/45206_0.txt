Yummy cookies baked to perfection. What can be better? A little bummed that when you order hot box cookies you can only choose limited flavors. We ordered two separate boxes (12 cookies) so we could choose four varieties. One 12 count only gets 3 options. Other than that the cookies were warm and gooey. They totally hit the spot!
