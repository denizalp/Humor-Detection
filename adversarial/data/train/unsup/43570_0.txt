I consider this my last resort place to grab food. It's overpriced for what you get. \n\nThe owner (usually the person who answers the phone) has been rude to me on more than one occasion. \n\nI once ordered an item and requested extra rice, as I had an upset stomach at the time. It was an additional $4.00 for a cup of rice.\n\nI will say though, that their breakfast menu is ok, and the delivery guys are really nice.
