3 of my girlfriends and I were in Vegas for the weekend and wanted to do a nice dinner on our last night. In comes Bradley Ogden. We had a little bit of trouble finding it in the massive Caesars Palace, but once we did we were impressed with the decor. Beautiful restaurant and an intimate and cozy feel to it. I ordered a glass of the house white (the wine list was RIDICULOU$$) and the oysters to start. I love oysters and these were very, very good. No big, fat, gross ones which was a relief. My friend got the Foie Gras which was divine. For my main I ordered the Rib Eye, which I regretted because although it was tasty, the cut was a bit too fatty for my liking and the red wine sauce was virtually non-existent. My friends got the Scallops (really good), the Salmon (a little undercooked), and the Risotto (weird texture). Our dishes were presented beautifully. We did feel that the servers were a little abrupt, if not rude, but perhaps that's because we were 4 young ladies and maybe they didn't think we were their ideal clientele. However, they brought out the complimentary butterscotch pudding shots after the meal and we felt bad about criticizing them. After receiving the bill ($18 for a glass of house wine?!?! GET OUTTA HERE) I paid my $120 share, a bit too steep in my opinion. Afterwards, we stood out front and took some pictures, and the Executive Chef for Caesars came out to speak with us. He asked how our meal was and gave us his card for future trips to Vegas, which was really nice. All in all, it was a good meal, but not worth the price in my opinion.
