This place was a rip off \n1. This place doesn't have agua  frescas . Come on it's a Mexican restaurant. No, let me take that back its not a Mexican restaurant it\nJust looks like one . \nWe had the chimichanga. For 18.95 this should have been 6.00 for bad taste and and size .\nAnd the price I was like I'm at Mexican restaurant . \nService was terrible . I should of checked Yelp before going  here. \nNever coming here again
