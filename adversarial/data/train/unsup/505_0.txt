At the Bellagio, you can see the beautiful water fountains dancing outside, and the chocolate fountain of Jean Philippe inside. Dark, milk, and white chocolate flows from top to bottom. It a good thing it's covered, otherwise there would be too many happy drownings or baptisms!\n\nJean Philippe Patisserie is primarily a French Cafe. All of their delicious looking pastries, cakes, tarts, cookies, cupcakes, gelato and sandwiches are also on display for all to see. For what I enjoyed, it tastes at least as good as it looks and there's a good reason why so many people are in line.
