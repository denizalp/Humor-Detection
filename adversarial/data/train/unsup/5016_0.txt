Hidden gem !\n\nThis place has for me the best pasta in Las Vegas so far. Home made pasta, ravioli and gnocchi. \n\nWe had the gnocchi alla Vodka. The sauce is smooth and so delicious. Little creamy but not too much, with just the perfect seasoning. We tried also the spinach and cheese raviolis, so delicate and tasty. The dish of the day was squash ravioli with amaretto cookie crumbled on top of it. If you like to combine sweet and salty that's worth a try. \n\nI was too full to order dessert especially because to start your dinner they bring you homemade garlic bread and focaccia that you can't help eating even though you know you're having pasta after. But my friends ordered Crème brûlée and Tiramisu and loved it too. \n\nSo if you're craving for some authentic real Italian food this is the place you have to rush to.
