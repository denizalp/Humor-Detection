Nice place, not too far from the strip.\n\nLooks like your regular strip mall local Vegas AYCE Sushi joint. Nothing really stands out. Seems like a favorite local hangout. \n\nThe one thing I like about this place are the daily specials. IMHO it's the Goyemon daily specials that set it apart form other AYCE sushi places. Goyemon has specials that are unique or unusual...a type of fish or delicacy you never heard off. Some of the specials are limited to one order, while the others are part of the AYCE experience. \n\nNo complaints at all about the food. The waiter did bring us wrong items...stuff we did not order, but no complaints really, we were game...totally willing to give it a shot. While the food was good, the service was a bit spotty. When it got busy, the staff started forgetting some of our orders, brought out doubles of stuff we already ate and also stuff we did not order. \n\nI would say for the best experience, try to come here during off peak hours, when its not so busy.
