Wow, cool spot with some good vibes going on here. I really can't believe I've passed up this place so many times. My bestie and I met up here for a late night bite and a drink. So, what I ordered may not be the best combo but, it's what I wanted.\n\nWhy 3 stars? Well, when we walked in we weren't sure if we should seat ourselves or wait for someone. A worker walked past but didn't say anything so we found a table and popped a squat. No one noticed us so after about 10 minutes I walked up to the bar and asked for menus. The bartender handed them over then asked where we were sitting. After I told him we were in a booth, he assured us someone would be over. At the time it wasn't a huge deal but once we noticed the time, we realized how long we had been sitting there. That's my only negative but now that I know, I'll just order at the bar from now on when I visit. \n\nWe ordered tacos and mac n cheese. Crazy combo, I know but they both were good.  While not authentic tacos were yummy. The mac n cheese...good Lord was it good. It looked a little charred when it got to the table but one bite ruled out all of that foolishness. It was comforting, cheesy and just downright good! I had a cosmopolitan to wash it all down and that was perfect!!!\n\nI am looking forward to visiting again and will update my review at that time, if needed.
