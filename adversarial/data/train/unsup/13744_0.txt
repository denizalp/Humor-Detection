I know people love to go to Vegas to go gambling, get wasted, bump and grind at the clubs, and throw a dollar at a stripper.\n\nMe?  I actually like going to Vegas so that I can see shows (and stuff myself like a pig at the buffet).\n\nPhantom of the Opera is a must-see.  The stage was designed specifically for the show and the theatre is so intimate, you can't really get a bad seat (although I personally loved being underneath the chandelier!!!).  The costumes, the singing, the music, the effects...*swoons*\n\nI'm still debating whether or not this or the Lion King is my favorite show.  But it doesn't matter, because both are so good, and both require your attendance.
