God, I am so irritated it's not even worth the energy and time to get all pissed off again telling you why I will probably never come back here.  Maybe if I was younger again and coudl deal with it - or if i was from somewhere where what they offer at Tao is \"new\" or \"interesting\".  \n\nThe waiter was an A-HOLE big time.  Before we ordered he YELLED AT US that he REFUSED TO DELIVER ANY FOOD UNTIL THE MENUS WERE ALL REMOVED FROM THE TABLE - basiclaly that means we can't get appetizers and order more later...Jerk?  Seriously?\n\nSecond of all, the food tastes like either Panda F**king Express (all noodle dishes) or it's completely covered in Sesame Oil.  Don't get me wrong - I LOVES me some sesame oil - but not when you can't taste what is is cooked with?\n\nFinally, I think our bill was like $700, probably because we had 8 heavy drinkers there.  But it really felt like a rip - I paid $70 for drinks, one egg roll, and a bite of some Mall court noodles. \n\nno thanks!  Denny's is across the street and at least there you know what you're going to get.
