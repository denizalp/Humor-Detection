This newly built movie theatre is beautiful! The first time i came here i parked underground and the artwork was a really nice touch! The facility has security underground and on the main floor with surveillance everywhere. Dont be worried about parking your car anywhere :) \nIve been in the VIP section twice now and its defiantly worth a try. \nThe food is way over priced and i would rate the taste a 3\/5. I ordered the California burger with poutine. Wasnt a big fan of the root beer float either. The only reason i got the food was because of the hump date promo. (2 tickets and 2 entrees for $60)\nThe servers and customer service were great 4\/5 \nAnd the washrooms are individual which is also really nice and private. \nI would come back to see a movie with s better experience but i would hold off on the food and stick to the popcorn (even though tickets are like $25 each!)
