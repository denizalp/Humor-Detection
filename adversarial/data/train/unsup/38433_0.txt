Best shooting range so far. I've been to many indoor shooting ranging both in NV & CA, and Gun Garage is by far the best. They have the best selection of sub and fully automatic machine guns. For those of you who know: they carry an mp7 (extremely rare), UMP, SCAR-H, KRISS Vector, & an AR-50. All which I highly recommend!  Compared to several other ranges near the Las Vegas strip, they are competitively priced. Your money will go further. The staff is extremely professional and friendly. They make your experience that much more memorable, and increase the likelihood of returning again. They also offer free shuttle service which is a plus. I can't wait to go back and take all of my friends and family. They have earned my business for life. Whether it's your first time or 100th time, look no further for a better indoor shooting range in Vegas!
