I waited 25 min for a polish boy after being quoted 10. I walked up to register to ask for a refund as my polish boy was ready. I wanted to write a bad review...but then I tasted the polish boy. The skies broke open and the angels sang and I seriously considered going back in and waiting another \"ten\" (read: 25-30) minutes of my life for another polish boy. \n\nCall ahead. Don't order and go in to wait. It's a hole in the wall and a little seedy, but the quality is good.  I feel like if they can get their timing together, they'll be on the same path as the Fix\/Black Box Fix. However, since I'm inpatient I won't return for a few months so they have some time to get it together and I can update the review.
