It was hard to choose what meal to take but I ended up asking for the Cowboy Tacos with a side of Pad Tai fries.\nAll was good and well later that day because that meal was delicious, filling and interesting. I always love it when places love to \"experiment\" with new flavors for diffrent foods and these guys did it well
