Let me explain my 1 star. My order took over an hour and a half to be delivered... My food was cold. I asked to speak to the manager. They said they were busy. That's fine I understand that...I called back and they were still busy. ( I gave them my number and she never called me back). I paid over 45 dollars worth of food. It was sub par at best. When the manager never called me back I decided to write this review. If you truly care about your customers not only their well being for food safety violations... You must not care for your customers at all. I really think this restaurant needs to reevaluate a few things, before someone gets really sick and reports you for food code violations. The Turkey burger I had was a cold gelatinous hockey puck with old onions and drenched in their \"secret sauce\" (thousand island dressing). I know what a fresh onion tastes like... This onion was flimsy like it sat out for DAYS. My fries were ok. That's all I ended up eating. Last chance for the Manager to redeem herself... However I still don't expect a response. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
