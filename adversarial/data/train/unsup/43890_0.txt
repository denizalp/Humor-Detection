While traveling, I accidentally left my beloved Onitsuka Tigers in a Banff hotel and realized that I looked completely ridiculous traipsing about Calgary in moosehide mukluks. So I spent many hours wandering around Stephen Avenue in search of some inexpensive, yet presentable kicks. What a terrible experience that was, and I was about to throw up my hands in desperation when the wind whispered in my ear to head towards 17th Avenue.\n\nGravity Pope is a sleek little store that corrals many beautiful, hard-to-find shoes in one place. I had seen advertisements for Camper Twins in magazines, but didn't realize how drool-inducing they actually were until seeing them firsthand here. But, at over $200, I had to wipe the spittle from my chin and move on. \n\nNot everything is overpriced, though. I found a perfectly nice pair of Tretorns on sale for $35. So while, yes, there are a lot of expensive shoes, they do have an extensive enough inventory that you'll probably find something for a moderate price.
