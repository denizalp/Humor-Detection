This place is overrated! How can you say it's fresh when the salads were stored?  Cashiers are not knowledgable in taking orders! She missed one order apparently it's too busy for them because there's only 2! While there's 7 people waiting for their food.  An hour wait for your to go is NOT ACCEPTABLE.
