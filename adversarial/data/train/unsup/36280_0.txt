The food is OK. Nothing to write home to mom about. After the server realized that part of my friends order hadn't been served we had to remind once again, while the food was getting cold, to bring the rest of the order. I ordered the country skillet. It was pretty bland. The sausage gravy should be renamed to milk gravy due to the lack of sausage. Another of our party ordered the \"special\", steak and eggs with the steak order rare. His meal was served with well done steak so it was sent back. he received his meal once again but the rest of our party was pretty much finished with their meal. The coffee cups were refilled regularly. Our party of 12 was taken for breakfast without reservation and within the half hour of our phone call. Breakfast pricing was under $10.00. I can't speak for the lunch or dinner menu but breakfast is just OK.
