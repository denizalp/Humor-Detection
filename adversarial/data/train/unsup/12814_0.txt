I started going to Goodlife Fitness at this location for a couple of weeks now. Located right outside of Markville Mall.\n\nThe Good:\n- Definitely a clean facility, both the change rooms and work out areas.\n- Great selection of classes, available during mornings or after work hours.\n- The instructors are really awesome and motivated. It really makes the class feel fun, instead of repetitive.\n- I rarely have to wait for a treadmill or machine, as there is enough equipments to go around. I find that this location doesn't get crowded often, even during peak hours.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Make sure to sign up for classes 15-20 mins beforehand as they fill up fast. Even with the cap, the studio can get quite crowded. \n- Over-population of men. \n- This Goodlife Fitness is right outside the Markville Mall food court. When you come out from a hard workout, you have to exercise all resistance from walking towards that intoxicating smell of fried foods.
