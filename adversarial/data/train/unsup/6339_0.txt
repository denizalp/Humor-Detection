I don't know if I can add anything new that hasn't already been said, but basically all you need to know about Romados is that you're going to get delicious, rotisserie chicken seasoned to perfection with a side of equally tasty salt & pepper fries and you're gonna walk out the door with a feeling of both glee and guilt - wait, did they undercharge me? How did I get so much food for less than $10? But those worries will quickly melt away as you take your first bite of chicken.\n\nNeedless to say I'll be returning, and if I'm in a rush I'll take advantage of the shorter line up for those who have called their orders in ahead. And yes, go for the spicy sauce. Yummmmm.
