I'm glad to have a locally-owned pet store in the neighborhood.  We went in here looking for something for our new kitty to scratch, and received great service.  As other people have said, they have a great selection of natural and organic pet food, toys, etc.  It is a little pricy but I'm sure all of it is worth the money.
