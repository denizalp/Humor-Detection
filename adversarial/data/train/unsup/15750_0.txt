Overpriced and extremely mediocre food. I've had better sushi rolls at a $20 all-you-can-eat joint in the Midwest suburbs. $20 here gets you two dinky, flavorless and stale maki-mono rolls. We also ordered the Chilean sea bass which was admittedly good, but for $28 it was literally the half the size of my palm with no real side! It was basically just fish with a garnish of pickled veggies and a foam on top. SERIOUSLY?\n\nAnd I get this is supposed to be a \"rock and roll\" kind of place but the music was SOOOO loud. Like, loud enough to cause some real damage to your ears. I don't mind loud music if I'm at a concert or show, but this was TOO much for a restaurant. My husband and I couldn't even hear a single word we said to each other. In addition, the service was really slooow and hard to track down.\n\nOn our trip to Vegas, this was single-handedly the WORST meal of our trip and the biggest regret of us spending as much money as we did at this place. Never again will we get sushi on the Strip, just trek a mile or two on Spring Mountain if you want your sushi fix for a fraction of the price that actually tastes delicious.
