I love pacific mall to find a variety of great cat items, and shoes in small sizes and great hair do dads. \n\nWe like to shop at ONE and we usually have dim sum at the Golden Regency although we were dissapointed in the choices on the carts the last time we visited. \n\nParking can be a real challenge if you arrive late during the weekend.
