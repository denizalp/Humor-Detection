Three stars is what I've settled on giving this business... simply because I'm still blank on my feelings about it.\n\nOne day I saw I had a voice mail on my phone. When you're out of work and looking, that's like a kid opening a Christmas present. The message was from one of their representatives. Curiously, I haven't looked for work in metro Phoenix since April 2010, choosing instead to go where the wind takes me... and by wind I do mean wherever I get offered a job first. \n\nIn any case, the recruiter said (s)he found my resume online and had a job (s)he thought I would be a good fit. By the time I saw the message it was the end of the business day. Deep inside I thought it was a magnanimous gesture. I called the next day, but the person who called me was at lunch. I left my name and number and asked that my original recruiter call me back, nothing more, nothing less. It's been three business days and I haven't heard back.\n\nI'm not too interested in living in Phoenix, but I do appreciate the job prospect. Unfortunately, that would require him\/her returning my call. \n\nI wish to seek greener pastures elsewhere, so part of me is thankful to hear nothing back, which is probably why I ranked this place higher than I normally would have otherwise. However, my story is really all I have to offer with my experience with this Randstad. If you're desperately on the hunt for a job, I do empathize with you... and I hope my story helps your consideration should you consider an employment agency.
