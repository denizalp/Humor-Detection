Rating a place on breakfast is always challenging.  I mean, let's face it, there aren't too any variations.  This little place inside a Holiday Inn was exactly what I expected it to be.  A diner.  Long counter, a few tables and a cook who is stereotypical of diner cooks...grumpy (I mean that in a good way).  I had an omelet.  It was cooked on a flat top, came with hash browns and it was delicious.  It came with the typical diner stale bread toast with margarine lightly patted on it.  The food is good and it's cheap.  You can tell the cook enjoys making up his specials menu for the day and enjoys cooking.  Dinging one star because....like most diners, everything not used the night before, or who knows how many days ago, is reused today (beware soup and chili fans).  More than likely it is tonight's special.  If it is something fried, count on it being something from a freezer bag fried in oil that should have been changed back at Xmas time.  If that's your thing....then go for it.  Cheap quick breakfast..absolutely stop here.  Not into a fancy sandwich shop for lunch, here again.  Enjoy!
