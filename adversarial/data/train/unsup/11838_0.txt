Had some donuts and they were very fresh and fluffy. They were on the more sweeter side which I know sounds silly for donuts, but they are. The donut base was sweet, the glaze was also sweet so it made the whole thing too sweet. I like how fresh it was though because it was so soft the other donuts looked like it was crushing the others in the box. I tried the apple filled donut and it was ok. Tasty, but a tad too sugary for me. Would like to have more apple filling. The place is open 24\/7 and has free WiFi so that's good to know if you're working late or odd hours.
