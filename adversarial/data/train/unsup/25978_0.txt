Actually more a 2.5 star review. \n\n\nService: way too slow. We got seated at a table, and it took over 10 mins to even get any type of service. Server didn't come by table, until we flagged down hostess to ask who our server was. Didn't get any water or anything till almost 20 mins after seating. This was an early Sunday evening. They weren't fully packed or anything. Service did get better after that. When our food was taking too long, server did come by to explain and offer us discount. \n\nKitchen: was super super slow that days took almost 45mins before we got served any type of food. We ordered apps and mains, and they just came out all together. \nWe had ordered 2 burgers, my brothers came out first, I had to wait almost 10 mins for mine. So the rest of my table was eating before I even got anything. \n\nTheIr explanation was their kitchen staff was new and training. I completely understand that, but they should have told us at beginning of meal, and not after\nWe're super annoyed already. You could tell other tables in restaurant were annoyed too. The servers were all hoovering by kitchen waiting for food, instead of going explaining to their customers. \n\n\nFood: certain dishes are better than others. The Korean wings were delicious. Nice and crispy with a good spice and kick to the wings. \nFries at good and crispy. Nicely seasoned: \nHouse burger was bit too greasy for my liking. It tasted great, but there was oil dripping out every time I picked it up. \n\n\nDrinks: dill pickle Caesar was amazing. Salty and sweet. Would defiantly get that again. Want to try their ciders too: \n\n\nOverall: MEH. I'd like to try it again later on once they've figure out their service staff and kitchen staff problems. I feel that they have potential to be a great restaurant, just not there yet. Lots of improvements to be made first.
