Spin is a decent cafe that serves savory and dessert crepes\/waffles. I've been here a couple of times and everytime I come I would get a \"One Sweet Day\" waffle and substitute the ice cream for vanilla or white chocolate. Waffles here are decent but some flavours aren't as great.\nIt was obvious that the restaurant was short staffed as there were only two servers but the entire restaurant was full. My friend ordered a waffle originally but they said they ran out which was fine and when she changed her order they gave her the wrong order. Their excuse was that it was the kitchen staffs first day. All was fine after her waffle got switched. They were also very nice about us sitting there talking for a while even though our food was done. \nOverall, spin is a good place to go if you want to hang out with friends. I still prefer demetres over spin but spin has a slower wait time.
