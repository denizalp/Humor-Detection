This review is for the Walmart of Steelyard Commons.  The other stores in the Steelyard aren't so bad.  \nWithout question or exaggeration this is the worst retail store on earth.  \nThe employees are either indifferent or scared for their lives.  \nYou can have a moderately-less-sucky experience there if you go between 6am-8am, but other than that, game-on, buddy.  \nNo kidding.  \nThis place is like a prison being run by the inmates.  \nThere is open food-merchandise strewn throughout every aisle where the people have grabbed something from the grocery side, eaten half of it, then discarded it in toys\/hardware, whatever.  There are roving gangs of thugs.  The merchandise is on the floor, in the wrong racks, in the wrong departments, you name it... anywhere but in the correct place.  \nIf you MUST go to this god-forsaken pit of hell, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES do you go on the first of the month, or on the weekend subsequent.  \nFolks, I lived in southern California and spent time in Los Angeles; never have I been as afraid for my safety than I have been in the Steelyard Commons Walmart.
