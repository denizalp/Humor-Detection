Went here Friday night as part of a bachelorette weekend and it was GREAT! This show was so much fun, everyone in our group had a great time. If you're a fan of the Magic Mike films, you won't be disappointed. We opted for general admission seating instead of VIP and still had a great view of the stage (the theater itself is pretty small, so you're never far from the action). I think some of the bachelorettes who were in VIP seats were interacted with\/touched a bit more by the guys, but our bride still had a blast. Definitely recommend this for any kind of girls weekend trip in Vegas.
