My husband and I ate there last night and everything from the service, to the ambiance to the food was amazing! We opted to sit in a booth in the bar area because they had music playing and was a bit more fun. Our server was Josie and she was extremely knowledgeable about the food and the menu and very prompt and attentive. We ended up ordering a variety of raw bar food (oysters, shrimp and ceviche) as well as sashimi and some sushi rolls and it was all fresh and delicious.  My favorite roll was the snap, crackle and pop roll and I loved the variety of oysters they had...yum! Overall.. excellent experience and we will be going back!
