Just stopped in on their grand opening day.  Since we got the food fast and it was tasty I am giving them 4 stars off the bat. This is truly Vietnamese cuisine so if you are looking for Chinese American fare this is not the place. I am thrilled we have a pho (pronounced \"fah\") house nearby once more. Friendly staff and very clean.The huge jade Buddha fountain is a nice touch, We will be back. I hope if you are up for Vietnamese you will give them a try,.\n\nI did mention the pho I got could have used about 1\/4 again more noodles and they were very glad to hear the feedback. \n\n(Note: This replaces the Lee Asian Bistro. But you can still find the friendly previous owner running the excellent Viet Hoa Foods right next door.) So pho, so good.
