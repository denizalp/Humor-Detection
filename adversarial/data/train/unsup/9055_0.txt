I'm fairly new to Greek food, and don't venture too far away from the gyros, but i was with my ex so she showed me the ropes.  I've been coming here before the expansion just for the gyros alone and they never ever disappoint.  Make it a combo with either pilaf rice or french fries and a drink for like 2-3bucks more.  \n\nJust across the street is The Greek American Grille, but their fries and rice does not even compare to The Fat Greek. Not to mention TFG is more of a restaurant while GAG is more of fast food type.\n\nI let my ex do all the ordering because I'm a man.. of my words lol\n\nChicken soulvaki.  Chicken skewers with a tzatziki sauce on side with a bed of pilaf rice.\n\nSpanakopita spinach:  Nice flaky pastry filled spinach and a hint of butter or even cream. Definet Yes!\n\nBabagounash:  Holy mother 'effer.  This eggplant dip was amazing and severed with warm pita bread.  \n\nGreek burger:  Never in my life and of all place would I thought the burger here be this good.  It was my ex's meal and yet i ate most of it.  A little too much bread for my liking, but the light thin cheese sauce, tirokafteri, was out of this world. Chopped red onions, lettuce, tomato, and a side of slice dill pickle to top if off. Winner!\n\nEvery time I dine here or pick up I received friendly service.  The place is always clean because the white and blue really stood out.\n\n\n\nThe week before I came here with a friend and had the Combination Plate For Two which is a variation of dish to try: (description from their website because i'd still no clue which is which)\nMoussaka - Casserole of Roasted Eggplants, Potatoes, and Ground Beef Baked with Greek Bechamel Sauce and Kefalotiri Cheese. Good stuff\nPasticcio - Traditional Greek Baked Pasta with Rich Meat Sauce and Greek Bechamel with Kefalotiri Cheese. Like a lasagna with a layer of cheese.\nGyro - Shaved lambs. Perfect as usual.\nDolmades - Grape Leaves Stuffed with Seasoned Ground Beef and Herbs.  Ehhh something about eating the grape leaves.  It's not bad, but i can do without.\nAlso come with roasted potatoes, pita breads, and soup or salad.\n\nFor 30bucks you can try different items, but if i had a chance to pick again i would have picked something else.  Its good, but right now carbs are my enemies.\n\nLove this place!
