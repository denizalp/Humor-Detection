K, so dis status goin be all da kine cuz apparently das da only way dis place going listen to you.  Da firs time I came hea I was all stoked cuz da peepo on da bento\/poke side when sound like me and was brown like me!  Since I when leave da 8o8 I been real homesick.  Brah, I was so happy I when find dis place!  Dey when rep aloha and I couldn't wait for go back.\nAnd deeen I went back.  Except dis time we went da sushi side.  Aye lawd, these chicks lucky my potagee maddah nevah come wit me cuz she woulda had one field day wit da pilau customer service.  We did da all you can eat sushi, but first da wahine when embarrass us, announcing to da whole place dat we when order choke food.  Den da rest of our visit, she when fly da plates at us and  den grab da empty ones off our table without sayin one word!  She nevah ask us if we like order more, she never ask us if we like more watah, nevah ask us if we like napkin, nothin!  She when drop\/grab da plates den run away!  Da two wahines workin dat night only when cater to da peepo reppin da 808 shirts or all moked out.  Real unreal, i trip.\nAs fo da grindz, was okay.  Get fat pieces in da rolls, and da soups is winnahz.  But if you like drink watah, bettah wear your aloha shirt or else nevah mine!\n\n\nIN OTHER WORDS:  The customer service on the sushi side sucked.  If you want good customer service, you better wear an HI\/AlohaArmy or a tribal print shirt.  Where the food lacked in quality, they made up for it in quantity (the rolls are pretty large).  I recommend the the miso and udon, they're pretty good.  Their desserts are cute and tasty, wish I got to try the malasadas!
