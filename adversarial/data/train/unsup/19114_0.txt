This was a nice hotel. This is also known as a timeshare hotel. We had a 1 bedroom King suite, with a queen sofa bed in the living room, separate hot tub, bathroom with a standing shower, full kitchen with full sized fridge, stove, microwave oven, dishwasher, coffeemaker, toaster, dishes, pots and pans, utensils, washer and dryer, 2 large flat screen tvs. They also have a very long and large spacious pool, with excellent poolside waitstaff. Our watier, Gytis? Or Gytil? Unsure of the spelling, was absolutely wonderful! He was very attentive and a provided wonderful customer service. We also had great service from the bell hop, Joseph, when we checked in late at night, close to midnight. I would have given them 5 stars but our living room carpet was very wet when we arrived in the room. They must have shampooed the rug earlier in the day. We were too tired to bother switching rooms, as it was already past midnight, even though they offered us the Princess Suite. By the time they did that, we had already unpacked and gotten ourselves settled in. We decided to keep the room since we figured the carpet will dry the next day, and at least we knew this room had been thoroughly cleaned. The carpet did not fully dry until 2 days later. They need to keep better records and not give out rooms that aren't ready. Besides this hiccup, all in all, we did have a very nice stay. They also offer free self-parking, but if you prefer to use the valet service, that is $18\/day. We had a nice and relaxing stay here and would recommend this place to our friends.
