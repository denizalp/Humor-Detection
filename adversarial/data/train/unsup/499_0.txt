I went here after a hot, sweaty workout wearing my KD VI's and yoga pants to meet up with a friend who was wearing a suit looking cute as a button. I was definitely under-dressed but I was too hungry to care. We sat at the bar while waiting on our other friend.\n\nWe got a booth. The seats were big, nice and comfy. The table has a marble top. The chandelier was so pretty and I love how they have flowers spell out \"The Sparklings\" in front. \n\nWe shared a bunch of appetizers and a bottle of sparkling wine. Our bartender\/server with wild hair seemed abrasive at first but he loosened up quick when my friend called him out and gave him a hard time the whole night. It was pretty hilarious.\n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries:\nComes with ketchup and lemon garlic sauce. The lemon garlic sauce tasted like it had dill in it. The fries were crisp and were a cross between skinny fries and steak fries in terms of thickness and texture. \n \nBacon and Dates Wrapped Meatball:\nI like bacon-wrapped dates. I like good meatballs. But together smothered in marinara, it was a bit strange. I wish the bacon was a bit more crisp. 3\/5\n\nTuna Tartare:\nFresh tuna with avocado and mango cubes.  It comes with crostini. This was alright. 3.5\/5\n\nGorgonzola Flatbread with Honey:\nJust like what the name implies - nothing complicated. It's simple yet tasty. Who doesn't like cheese and honey? 3\/5\n\nGrapes, Arugula and Ricotta Flatbread:\nWith candied walnuts and balsamic vinaigrette. This was good. Sweetness and juiciness from the grapes, peppery arugula, mild taste of ricotta and crunch from the walnuts. 4\/5\n\nRoasted Beet and Apple Salad:\nWith arugula, candied walnuts and balsamic vinaigrette. I don't like beets but this was pretty amazing. It looked pretty and the textures were wonderful. Soft beets, crisp apples and walnuts. 4\/5\n\nCrispy Gnocchi:\nGnocchi in pesto with Italian sausage, peas and candied walnuts. I love pesto and the sauce was spot on. The gnocchi was not as crispy as I expected. 4\/5\n\nGrilled Octopus:\nBaby octopus marinated in soy sauce. It has a nice char to it. A different server put our plate of octopus on our table and said \"here's your octopuses\" which started a short-lived debate. He told us \"octopi is actually wrong...I looked it up\". Well, octopuses and octopi are both correct, actually      \/endtangent. 4.5\/5\n\nI didn't feel too under-dressed when I saw some lady wearing booty shorts and sneakers. It would be nice to come back here and next time, I'll wear a dress and my favorite Gucci heels - yes, it's worth seeing my tomboy self die a little.
