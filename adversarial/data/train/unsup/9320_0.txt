Well, I guess from all of the negative comments, there is nothing that I can add. It truly is atrocious. I have some pics should anyone care. About the only good thing I could say is that the girl who checked me in was nice, but even she was frustrated because the computer she was working at kept freezing up on her.\n\nThe room I am in is roomy and spacious but considering that it hasn't been remodeled since the 50's (basing that comment on the style not the actual date) but I am going to check when it was built. The beds are old, the carpets are old, the bathrooms are old, the decor is old. I found a shard of metal in the carpet the hard way. The shower\/bath won't turn off all the way so I heard that all night. The walls must not be insulated or thin but I could hear the neighbors all the time except when they were sleeping.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot escape because Expedia won't help. As soon as I can figure out how to slam Expedia they are next, the customer service people in Asia can't figure out how to help except for regurgitating the pre-printed responses they are given to read back to the customer AND they cannot or will not transfer me to someone in the US.\n\nBoth LVH and Expedia are going to be uninstalled from my iPhone and iPad and I am going to try to find out how to complain about their bait and switch policies. The Federal Trade Commision, Federal Communication Commission and Better Business Bureau are next on my list!
