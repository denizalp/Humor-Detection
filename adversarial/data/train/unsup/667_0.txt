I finally made it in this place. It was filthy but I was expecting that. \n\nThe place was packed because it was .49 cents a pound day. I was a little overwhelmed but I think anyone would be. \n\nThey have tons of garbage. Tons. when they wheel out new bins people go crazy. The employees literally scream at customers to not touch until they say go. \n\nI actually purchased 20 pounds of stuff. I found some kids clothes and things for diy one thing I found was this sea shell chandelier thing that's going to be amazing with some spray paint.\n\nI can't really say if I will or won't come back.
