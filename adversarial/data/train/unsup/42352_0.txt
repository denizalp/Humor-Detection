Toilet ran snd gurgled constantly even though a repairman worked on it for an hour and never cam back. Carpet was so dirty after 1hr my granddaughters feet were black. Blood on master shower curtain was the disgusting top of our experience. We stopped and told front desk. No one cam up and replaced it. Pool was cloudy.\nReported this to front desk and they said oh were sorry. With no sincerity\nThis is why we did not take tour...even with the$125.00 cash offer
