Yeah, the same old story. An experienced ice cream treats eater (Ok, old guy) approaches the ice cream stand and asks for a chocolate soda.\n\nI really should know better but ordering a chocolate soda is how I test whether the owners of an ice cream stand actually care about what they're doing.\n\nDairy King failed the quiz. The reviews below are mostly dead on. They hire very young girls (never ever seen a male in there; it makes me wonder about the hiring practices) and they don't really do anything to manage quality of service. People love the place because you love your local ice cream stand; I still love it - it kind of completes the small towny feel Independence still has - but really, dropping some chocolate soft serve into a cup of soda water? Gross. Waste of $3. And I didn't go back to talk to the girl because I'm pretty sure it's not her fault.\n\nTrain your people and quiz them. They need to know how to make stuff. Or take the Soda off your menu (You offer sodas in like 10 different flavors, though...how??)
