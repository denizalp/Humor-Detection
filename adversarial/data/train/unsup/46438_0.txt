Wow.  Some of, if not the best, sushi in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  And when you throw in the reasonable prices, far and away the best value.  Be prepared, the portions are about 20-30% larger than you get at other sushi restaurants.  Have been there dozens of times.  The only problem is that it is a small restaurant, so there can be a wait during peak meal times, even during the week.
