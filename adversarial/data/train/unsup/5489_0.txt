Journeyed all the way here on a wet and stormy night. Had a great time. \n\nThere are a few things this place has going for it which are an improvement over LaserQuest. The vests\/guns are a lot newer, more modern, and lighter than the equipment at LaserQuest. There's a speaker on the vest which plays music (which you can change and control) and shouts things at you when you've been hit. There's also a \"rapidfire\" feature that kicks in which lets you shoot repeatedly and makes you feel pretty badass. You have the choice to play solo or in teams, which is a bit different and would be great for large groups or corporate events. There are some specific targets in the arena you are suppose to aim for, which makes it more mission-like as opposed to shooting people randomly. \n\nI will say, however, that the actual game area is small compared to what I'm used to from LaserQuest, which has two floors. This one is only a single floor, and with 10 people playing it already seemed small to me. I imagine with a much larger group you'd be running into each other a lot. \n\nOverall lots of fun, had a great time and made me feel young again :) Would recommend checking the place out if you are in the area!
