When I heard the lion king musical is out i was ecstatic as it was one of my favorite childhood movies ever and still is and couldnt wait to watch it. I actually thought it was pretty good but at the same time very kiddy and somewhat of a dissapointment. Maybe because I was so hyped up for it and I was expecting something so out of this world and the tickets were $150 each that it was just A-OK for me.\nI do have to say rafiki was hilariousssssssssss and that was my fave part and some of the singing because it did get really annoying after a while.
