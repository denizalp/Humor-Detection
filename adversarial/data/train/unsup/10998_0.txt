For a Las Vegas coffee shop this is as good as it gets. I do hate sharing my local secrets but its for the best right??? Makers and finders is right up there with Sambalatte battling for my coffee addiction. The location is in the arts district so unless you are staying downtown or near\/on main street you will probably need a car to easily get here. Once you are here though, the staff is friendly, the coffee is amazing and the ambiance is well, hipster-esque. Me personally I am not a hipster but I don't feel really turned off coming here at all.\n\nMy favorite things here are of course the lattes, specifically the lavender latte or Mexican spice latte, and a few of the random food items they serve. My favorite will have to be the chicken tingas, which are basically homemade chicken enchiladas that come in an order of 2 and cut in half with sauce ON them. If you want them plain you better say something when you order. As for my second favorite thing here I would have to suggest the tomato bisque soup. Tastes delicious and looks homemade. As for the 'grill cheese' croissant that comes with it, I could pass, but that still doesn't stop me from ordering it!\n\nI have been here many times, have tried about half of the menu and I must say I have never really been disappointed. My coffee is always amazing- keep in mind on weekends or when they are super busy, expect waits of up to 10 minutes for your lattes but it will be well worth it. I drive out of my way to come here. And will continue to do so unless they disappoint me!
