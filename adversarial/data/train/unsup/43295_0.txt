Made reservations months in advance and no car was available.\nScrewed up the whole first day, as it was dedicated to finding a replacement.\nHad to go to the Sky Harbor for a car but almost three times the cost.  They had many cars there and we had to rent one there, which leads me to believe that there was some type of bait-and-switch here.\nOne of the supervisors helped us out a lot in receiving a discount, but that was too late.\nThis place was unreliable and when you need to be at an important occasion, you can't rely on them here.  A man at the hotel the first night had reservations too.  The next morning, he missed his appointment after they told him he was set.\nNice, nice people, but the service left a lot to be desired.\nI gave them two stars only due to the girl behind the counter had tried her best.  It wasn't her fault.  The decisions were made above her.
