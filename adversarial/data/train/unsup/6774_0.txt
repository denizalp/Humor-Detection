DO NOT go to a store call \"Just In Case\" at Pacific Mall for any of your cell phone repairs!!! I'd recently went there for a screen replacement because of suppose water damage causing my screen to have permanent bright spots on screen, BIG MISTAKE!!!... \n\nFirst off, they told me I need a complete screen replacement (glass+LCD) and it will cost $180. I agree and they told me to come back in around 30 mins to pick up my phone. I went back multiple times after 30 mins and finally, someone brought back my phone from \"another location\" an hour and a half later. I was running late for work so I inspected it quickly just to see if the spots were there, the spots were not noticeable at that moment so I paid them and ask for a receipt. They said they don't give out receipts and just taken one of their business card.  \n\n24 hours later, my phone was in a parked car for 2 hours and I noticed my \"suppose professionally replaced new screen\" starts to peel off on its own at the bottom and the bottom left corner, I freaked out and looked at it and noticed a blob of glue had started to melt, leaked out to the edgr of my bezel and a piece of double sided tape covering my suppose button area (I own a One plus One and the bottom portion of my phone has 3 illuminate button area). So not only did they do a very unprofessional repair, they even have poor workmanship. \n\nDuring that night, I also noticed the white spot CAME BACK at the EXACT SAME SPOTS so I started to inspect my phone as if I'm doing an autopsy. Here's the best part, I'm using the EXACT SAME SCREEN as before!!! My original \"water damaged\" screen has a small chip mark on the outer edge of the glass at the top and this has it at the EXACT SAME SPOT!! \n\nMy conclusion is they heat gunned my phone, peeled the glass off straight without taking anything off, start blow drying my supposed irreparable screen from that open space, gave it back to me and scammed me. \n\nI went back this afternoon to talk to the exact same 2 people who took my phone in and the girl said they did replace my screen. She then proceed and pulled out a random screen and said that was mine. I told her of the situation and here are her responses : \n\n1. Any phones screen will start to peel if u leave it in a car for 2 hour. (Bull*****, this is the first time it EVER happened to me in 17 years) \n\n2. Why did u start and lift your screen up after that, u should have just pressed it back down. (Anyone will want to inspect what caused it and why it happened so yes, I lifted it little to see what happened to my phone!!) \n\n3. I showed her the chipped mark on my glass and told her I did that 6 months ago and is at the same spot. Her response was \"that's not part of the glass, is the bezel\". Mind u this WAS part of the glass and not the bezel, how do I know, cause the glass was peeling off on its own and u can tell clearly how the glass runs. \n\n4. I asked her to please repair it and replace my screen. Her response \"I already replaced it the first time, not going to do it again, I don't know how your white spots got on your brand new screen after 48 hrs of use, but I can't replace it\". She also refuse to give any help or refund my money so that's $180 down the drain!!!...  \n\nFellow citizens PLEASE help spread the words so there wouldn't be another victim such as myself in the future!!  \n\nSTAY AWAY from a store call \"Just in Case\" located at Pacific Mall unit A29!!! \n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/a29justincase
