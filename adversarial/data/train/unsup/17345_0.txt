Ah, Greek hospitality. Takis (the owner) greets you as though he's welcoming you into his home. To start, we ordered the saganaki cheese, fried in a skillet and flambeed as it makes its way to the table, and spanakopita. For our main dish we shared the Pikkillia platter, which included an assortment of moussaka, dolmades (stuffed grape leaves), prawns, salmon, keftethes (meatballs), and brizoles (pork cutlets), served with Greek salad and tzatziki. Everything tasted so good!
