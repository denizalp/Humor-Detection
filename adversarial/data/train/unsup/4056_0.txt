Small little Asian restaurant located on Park road in Pineville . Mostly take out orders.  \n\nI've had mixed feelings about this place but for the most part the food is good. Seems to be pretty consistent on the food .  Always very tasty and good portions. \n\nMost folks are calling in and picking up. \nThere is delivery available and that also seems popular. Rarely have I  seen anyone eating in the restaurant. \n\nThe rating is A 91.5 .  Barely an A but it is still nonetheless an A. \n\nAgain food is good ... So I will change my rating to 4 stars as this is a good restaurant. \nJust kinda minimal for a diner restaurant. Three tables and usually one table is full of employees stuff on it.
