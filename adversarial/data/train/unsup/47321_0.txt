It was ok, I pulled in and it took the guy about 3 minutes for him to get up and come over to see what kind of wash I wanted. I asked for the special that was out front on the HUGE sign that said $8.99 special. O thats right its only sunday- thursday the guy said, \"didnt you see the caption under it\". No I was too busy driving to read the small print. \n\nPretty much they place that out to get people in the wash line and trap them. Not a very good business model I would say. \n\nInside while you wait is pretty trashy, was a bit afraid to sit down on the chairs so i stood and watched them wash the cars. \nGood job in the hand car wash followed by the machine. Like the wash itself and the outside area is small but works for what your paying for. Car looked good and it was a basic wash for $12. \n\nJust not a fan of the false advertising for specials to people driving by.
