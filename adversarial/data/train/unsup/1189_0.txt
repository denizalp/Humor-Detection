This is the best sushi joint if you live east of Eastern or anywhere on the east side in Las Vegas.  I've ate here over 30 times, 3 stamp cards to prove it.  And every time I dine here it is fresh.  I almost always order all you can eat.  \n\nBut if I don't  then I'll order one of their lunch\/dinner teriyaki plates (chicken, beef, salmon, etc.)  I like ordering the dish with the teriyaki on the side and adding it to my protein in the amount I want.  The staff has expanded since this place has become really popular.  They are all nice and friendly.  The bar and tables are always clean and the sushi masstttaasss behind the counter always bid you farewell.  If they're not busy making bomb diggity bomb sushi!\n\nI love any type of nigiri, they do have special sushi rolls too.  Crunchy Roll is one of my fav but I really love me a lot of nigiri.  They have specials too, just look up on a wooden board on the wall.  They have a projection screen, a wide screen but not necessary.  \n\nI wish this place had not gotten popular so I can keep it to myself!
