Keeping this short because that seems to the the theme of in-n-out anyway...\n\nI'm not sure why everyone hypes this place up. The staff is great but the entire concept and menu just... sucks.\n\nYes, the point is to get in, get your burger and get out, but they do nothing better or more quick than McDonalds, Burger King, Jack in the Box or Wendy's and yet they have an infinitely smaller menu.\n\nWhat makes them so special? Yes the 4-item me unis intended to keep things quick, but again, it moves no faster than other fast food places so why not just go somewhere else where you have more options...?\n\nMy family and I were really disappointed by this place and hopefully at least the food was great or something, which would help to make it better than other burger joints, but that's not even the case. I'd eat a Whopper or a Big Mac before I'd eat a burger from in n out AND I don't even necessarily like those.
