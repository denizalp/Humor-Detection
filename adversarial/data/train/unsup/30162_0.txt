Yardbird is fabulous. The chicken, waffles, and watermelon meal is unbelievable. The chicken is tender and tasty with perfectly crisp skin. The cheddar waffles with bourbon syrup are great. The spiced watermelon - spicy and awesome. All the parts of the meal complement each other perfectly. It's one of the best meals I've had anywhere. The service was very good, and the decor is very nice. I can not recommend this more highly.
