Worst service ever!  I am giving it 2 stars because the bathroom toilet is my new lover.  But seriously worst service ever.  Our waitress was such a bitch she actually rolled her eyes and sighed while one of my dining companions asked her questions about the food.  Really?  She had no problem sitting with the 2 dudes at the table right next to us, being little miss flirty flirt.  Every single drink we ordered came without a garnish.  Dirty martini up with olives is not hard.  Vodka tonic always comes with a lime.  Twice we actually went to the bar ourselves to get the garnish.  Totally lame.  I wish I got our servers name so I could personally lambast her here on Yelp.  The manager tried to smooth things over, but when a situation sucks that bad just saying sorry isn't enough buddy.  This place can kiss my ass.
