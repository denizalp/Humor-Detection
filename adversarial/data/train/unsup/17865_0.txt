28 minutes in line just to get one drink is a bit much. What's even worse is when you wait for 17 minutes just so they can come and ask you what you ordered again and then tell you the price. A price which happens to be less than what you just paid. \n\nI'm not sure how one drink order got so messed up and took so long, but I won't be back.
