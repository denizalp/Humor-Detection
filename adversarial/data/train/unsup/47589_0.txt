As I travel for work, I have been to Hooters all over the country.  It is just one of those places where you know the menu and you always get what you pay for.  This location (Scottsdale) is numero uno!\n\nI have never had bad service here. From the Manager Tony to the best waitresses on the planet.  Lexi, Niya, and Alex have been nothing but AMAZING!!!!!\n\nThey have always paid attention to not only myself, but my wife so much that this is fast becoming her favorite Happy Hour Hangout!\n\nThe food has always been stellar, and cooked per our request. \n\nWill never stop coming here!\n\nRock on Hooters!
