DB Brasserie was the location of two very important events this December:\n\n#1 My friend's birthday.\n#2 My last meal before I had all four wisdom teeth extracted\n\nI ate at DB Brasserie 7 days ago. It was the last \"real meal\" I have had in a week. As I type this review I have been living off of chicken broth, extra blended smoothies, hydrocodone, ibuprofen, water, and lots and lots of sleep. \n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess who noted I was a local, which I thought was a nice touch. We were brought into the restaurant to a round 4-top table in the middle of the dining area. Our server arrived and quickly gave us our menus, and a wine catalog. I ordered a Chardonnay ($11), can't remember which region of France at this time. \n\nBefore our drinks came out the server dropped off some very light, airy, cheesy round breads, \"compliments of the chef\" - they were savory and light.\n\nNext came the bread and butter plate, a decent portion with warm, spreadable butter.\n\nAppetizers arrived in a timely fashion, we had:\n\nTerrine of Foie Gras that comes with fig mostrada, turnips, almonds, and a balsamic, and rustic bread to supplement. The foie is meat butter if you want to get down and be honest with yourself as you slather it on the bread, top with a bit of fig and devour. \n\nEscargot Spatzle, our second choice of app, was fantastic. An earthy dish with many complexities to include fried chicken \"oysters\", mushrooms, garlic, a parsley sauce, hazlenuts, and of course, the snail fricassee itself. Each bite is a different medley of flavors. Make sure to get a bit of everything.\n\nNext, both my friend and I took advantage of their Prix Fixe Menu, for $48.\n\nI started with the country pate - pork, with pickled vegetables, comes with rustic bread (more bread!), as well as a small dollop of grain mustard. I would have killed for some more of that mustard. The pate itself was pale in comparison to the foie and the escargot I had just consumed. Not to say it was bad, but just somewhat bland.\n\nAs for the main course, both my friend and I decided to go with the server's suggestion of trout, which comes with broccoli, cauliflower, golden raisins, capers, and a brown butter sauce. As I first ate the fish it was delightful with a pleasantly crispy skin and flaky fish inside. But as I continued to eat the dish got very, very salty. Unfortunately I believe my fish was over-salted. I actually could not finish the whole piece as it was just too much.\n\nLastly, I had the black and white fondant, which comes as a molten chocolate cake, topped with the fondant and accompanied with vanilla ice cream. I also paired my dessert with a cup of coffee. This was a fabulous way to end the meal, as the cake was baked to perfection, with gooey warm chocolate inside and topped with the perfectly placed presentation of black\/white fondant.\n\nOverall this was a fantastic dining experience. One I would recommend to anyone looking for a moderately priced French meal in Las Vegas. I will be back... you know, after I can eat solid foods again.
