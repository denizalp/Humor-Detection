Humble beginnings, and delicious food. \n\nWhat began as a simple Lebanese grocery store and butcher, is now turned into a big new store across the street, with an excellent kitchen, with hot fresh food cafeteria. The only piece missing to make it all the more nostalgic of the Middle East, is a fresh juice counter.  \n\nFollowing a similar path as how Paramount started (grocery store and butcher turned Lebanese cafeteria), Ghadir Meat Market has excellent grill items. To be clear, this is Lebanese street food. So what you'll find is grilled whole chickens, shawarma's, lambchops, skewered meats, etc.\n\nIn terms of what's good here, it's all about the grilled whole chickens served with garlic sauce, french fries and pickles, or the shawarma platters which offers a traditional (yet fresh) approach to the Toronto shawarma scene. In terms of skewers and chops, there's better options in other places. \n\nIn terms of the trading store side, most frozen items are old, but it's a great places to get spices, halloumi cheese, more garlic sauce to take home (especially since it's very hard to make) and bulk open pickles for the house.\n\n\nI'm a huge fan! \n\n\np.s it's a family run business, and they're all extremely nice.
