This place was absolutely horrible! I will NEVER go back. I showed Peggy (the hairdresser that I had) A picture of what I wanted and she turned my hair yellow with a tint of orange. It was so bad you could barely see my hair just my scalp. When I mentioned to Peggy it was NOT at all what I wanted she started arguing with me telling me it \"looked nice and was a nice color\"! 25 years of experience and she tells me my hair that was yellow looked \"nice\"? Not only was it yellow but it was nothing comparable to what I asked for!! Then once I spoke and brought it to the owners (Betty's) attention she agreed with me & said it didn't look right that it needed toner. I told them I did not want Peggy touching my hair again after she completely ruined my hair & gave me attitude and argued with me on how it looked. Then Betty the owner raised her voice with me and said I owed her $85 even thou I was completely unsatisfied and had to go somewhere else to spend more money to fix it. As I went to make a payment I requested for her business card & license number and at that time she told me to \"get the hell out of her salon and to find another cheap temporary hair dresser somewhere else\"!! \nI had to go to a different salon where they were definitely a lot more capable & professional!!!
