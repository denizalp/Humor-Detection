FUN FUN FUN for the entire Family.\n\nIn regards to Amanda D's review that may have been true at that time?  I have no idea but I only starting going there this past couple months and have always had fun.  \n\nIt's usually an even ratio of sausage to chicks; other times it does lean more towards dudes.  Music is always enjoyable with the popular alternative playlist.\n\nWhat's with the hanging bras and polaroids of flashers? Nice touch to enhance the 'scummyness' of the decor...\n\nWhy only 3 stars?  THE DOWNSTAIRS SUCKS BALLS.  One time it was too full upstairs and they confined people to the basement dungeon downstairs???
