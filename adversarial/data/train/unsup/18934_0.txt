\"The granola bowl that rocked our world.\"\n\nBy the time we visited Toronto, we'd already become jaded with Chicago brunch spots from Bongo Room, Jane's, Sweets & Savories to Orange, Overeasy, Jane's, Dodo, ad nausea. Hence when she wanted to order a simple bowl of granola bowl, I almost chewed her out for being not \"serious\" enough about our meals in Canada.\n\nCeres, god of grain, proved me so damn wrong here that I forever ate humble pie. To this day, we search aimlessly for that mythical bowl of heavenly granola. I'd also like to attribute a brilliant cup of granola yogurt parfait we had at Cafe Chloe in San Diego http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/cafe-chloe-san-diego#hrid:RuuXNOCQjmm0XO4Crxn8jw with allowing me to be with my \"honey\" today.\n\nOnto the granola: slight touch of sweetened Greek-style yogurt, house blend of granola with at least 3 different grains. Bits of coconut? (this is from memory), bits of flax seed? or was it sunflower seed? small chunks of pomegranade and .. passion fruit? \n\nahh SHIIIET . n'mind! i wrote about it here! \nhttp:\/\/www.goodspot.ca\/profile\/1055\/Bonjour_Brioche\n\"tonyc\" existed before yelp. yay for me!
