Stellar buffet. I hear it's only second to Bacchanal, but I honestly don't know where they could have improved. Line was relatively quick, price was the same as the Carnival buffet at the Rio (~$32 per person for dinner on a weeknight).\n\nStand out items here:\nPrime rib, as rare as they'll let you have it, freakin amazing!\n the pesto mashed potatoes\nKobe beef- but its difficult to cut with the butter knife you're provided with, as others have said\nThe caramelized onions, on absolutely anything or by themselves\nTuna and salmon sashimi with the seaweed salad\nCreamed spinach (definitely a surprise) \npotato soup- it's like delicious velvet!\nChocolate dome dessert\n\nThe only cuisine I did not see represented here was middle eastern\/persian- how hard would it be to put out some pita bread and hummus, kalamata olives, and maybe some kabobs or a schwarma dish? I'd love to see what they could do with that type of food.\n\nI saw foods mentioned in other reviews that I did not find during my visit, such as caviar and chilean sea bass, that I would be interested in trying. Buffets aren't really my thing, but with comp cards or local ID it's relatively affordable here, and definitely worthwhile. Don't pass it up if you get the opportunity!
