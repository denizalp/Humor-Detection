How does this place only have like a half dozen reviews? As a Sicilian, if I want Italian, I cook it. When my realtor insisted I try this place, I thought, \"well I am hungry, and the fridge is empty...\" and so off went the boyfriend and I. \n\nLouie, the owner, was there. He spied us immediately and wanted to know our story. Apparently this is a place for regulars. We fit right in. This guy is THE MAN. He was so nice, and so welcoming, as was his large and loud Italian family that were dining there that night. Hey, these are my people. We love to eat, we love to talk, and we love our wine and dessert. Moonlite has it all; atmosphere, food, family, and a full bar. The employees are good people. The bartenders know their stuff. I suspect close to everything is homemade down to the croutons in the salad (and if not it tastes the part) and the desserts are too (not there, they order them locally, which is also awesome!)\n\nI would never have found this place. It looks like nothing special from the outside, and nothing too fancy on the inside either, but who cares? It's delicious, and I love coming here. I have probably tried everything on the menu at this point and that's not an exaggeration. Everything is good, simple, and perfectly done. It's exactly what Italian should be. AUTHENTIC with HUGE portions. Suck it Olive Garden, I never liked you anyway. \n\nSeriously, check this place out.. It's a gem. Simplicity is key in good Italian cooking and they nail it. The veal is perfect every time, the zucchini mountain is spot on, and all the pasta dishes are great. Try the Sicilian dinners too; if you know the difference between Sicilian and Italian, you will definitely appreciate them.
