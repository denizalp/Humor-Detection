Probably the best group of barbers Ive seen in the heart of the GTA.  Its true,  it does not matter who cuts your hair... it always turns out great.  They specifixally cater to men and mainly the type that's on a drop by basis.  I miss having my hair cut by Hagen,  he may talk a lot but he does his job very very well.  Now my favorite hair dresser there's an asian lady I think she may be the owner but she really delivers what you ask for... and if you have no idea what you want she knows what looks good. \n\nDont come on busy nights (ie. Friday or Saturday nights before closing)  guys tend to have a bad habit of 'just making it before closing'  and they get swamped and your hair cut... good as it may be can be a bit sloppy.  Hence the 4 star rate.  The guy who did my hair forgot to clean my sideburns and blend the rest of my hair line altogether.  I was in too much a rush as well that I didnt notice till I got home. \n\nThen again I still will go back there and I will still recommend it.
