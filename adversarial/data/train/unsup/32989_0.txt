I don't usually leave bad reviews and I'm a big fan of Korean food but I hate everything about this place! I don't get the hype about this chain of 'Korean' restaurants that are actually run by Chinese! None of the dishes are worth raving about- and whenever I went there the servers were always rude and in a hurry. Avoid.
