How do you enjoy dinner outside in Arizona? Outdoor Air Conditioning! Yup for real!  This place earns 5 stars for; atmosphere, cuisine, environment, selection and service!\n\nThe setting is out of a movie set. Outdoors is shady, cool, and wonderfully landscaped.\n\nWe enjoyed the trout, short rib and pork tenderloin as entrees. Sticky buns began the experience followed with lobster bisque, shrimp pepper pot and a great salad. If you are a Tequila snob, like me, you will have to settle with my favorite, readily available, 1942 as their top shelf selection. \n\nAs a foodie, I am rarely impressed. This place was a solid five stars. Phillip from Iowa lead our wait staff team. He knew the history of the venue, the details of the preparation of our dinner as well as how to politely not interrupt a table conversation. As usual I asked the head waiter to select my entire meal. He agreed and delivered perfectly. Next up...\n\nDouble fudge browny Sunday to finish.\n\nWow!
