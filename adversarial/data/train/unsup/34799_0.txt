Alvin did an excellent job assembling my new custom made bed frame. He went above and beyond helping me get the heavy parts of the bed frame up the stairs. He also helped me repair my old full size bed. Communication wise he kept in touch before the appointment and let me know when he was on his way. He arrived on time. He runs a great assembly service that is worth it.
