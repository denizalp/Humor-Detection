Takara is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Madison and has been for years.  Yes, I've tried Sushi Box.  No, I don't care that the sushi is more 'authentic,' and therefore, 'better.'  I love my Americanized maki!  Put some more avocado and cream cheese on that shit!  ;)\n\nSeriously, though, I am a big fan of their sushi rolls.  I particularly like the Shogun Roll and Spicy Tuna.  I love that their menu says \"Special Roll for Special Customer.\"  :D  They have an excellent lunch special, if I'm remembering correctly.  Their entrees are good, too.\n\nI really enjoy the atmosphere (usually quiet, even if there are lots of people), and the service (friendly, attentive and polite).  \n\nOne day, out of nowhere (and much to my chagrin), a roach crawled up on my table!  Nothing could've blown my mind more, because this place just looks so clean!  I alerted a waitress, who FREAKED out.  She and several other waitresses had a small shit fit and managed to capture the roach and get rid of it.  They apologized profusely and were so embarrassed.  I am *positive* that the roach mosied on over from the ultra-scuzzy Pizza Di Roma next door.  Still, it's worth mentioning, just in case they really do have roaches.  :)  I'd still go back, though!
