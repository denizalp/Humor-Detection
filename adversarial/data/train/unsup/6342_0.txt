As the cap'ain says \"All Aboard\" and the ship sets sail, all there really is left to do is easily pick out the people who are going to New York vs. those who are off to Sudbury.   It's an easy game but you only really have ninety seconds to play it.  \n\nOnce you board the hilariously pointless ferry to nowhere all of the aggravations of travel miraculously stop.  \n\nYou don't need to show up super early.    You don't need to worry about walking thirty miles to your gate.   You don't need to buy a newspaper.     You don't have to talk to some asshole trying to shine your shoes.\n\nYou don't need to dress up to sneak into the lounge.\n\nAn outstandingly easy experience.  Five minutes from downtown.\n\nArguably the best big city airport in the world.
