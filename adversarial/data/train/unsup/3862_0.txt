Good for Lunch after Church.\n\nGone for Lunch a couple of times here but first time going after Church.\n\nHad a few minutes to kill since they don't open till 11 am but as soon as the doors opened, we were immediately seated.\n\nWait Staff was a bit slow at the start but not unusual just after opening but quickly improved.\n\nI ordered the Steak and Lobster Tail with Baked Potato which my wife had her Alice Springs Chicken.  Both were good although the rub they use on the steak could be toned down a bit.\n\nNice fax Aussie atmosphere but still a fun place.
