Ok...I am going to say this...I am extremely disappointed in Sprinkles.\n\nI tried my first Sprinkles cupcake back when they first opened.  (Thank you very much Sarah G) I thought the cupcake was AMAZING!  But, i am now thinking this was just way to suck you in.  The reason why I say this is the last 2 times I had cupcakes from Sprinkles, I did not have the same AMAZING experience.\n\nSimply put.  The frosting was good....I cannot complain there...but I am not a frosting fan, I am a cake fan.  The cake on the cherry blossom and the lemon cupcake was DRY!  I gave my manager at work the red velvet.  She also said the same thing, frosting: GREAT cake: DRY.  Then she asked me how much I spent on the suckers and she was floored.  $ 3.25 for that?  INSANE!
