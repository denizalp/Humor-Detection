Seriously amazing burgers, probably the best burger I've had in this area.  They are a little expensive ($11 for a burger) but the flavor is worth it.  I had the Cuban burger, the combo of beer cheese, mustard onions and pickles was perfect.  And the truffle fries were amazing, not too much oil, just great flavor.  Definitely worth the price for me.
