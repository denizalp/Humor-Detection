I was eating some barbeque boneless wings and half way through the plate I came across what I thought was a bone. I reached into my mouth and pulled out a 1 inch long piece of metal wire. I brought this up to my waitress and she brought out the manager. It turns out that a piece of the deep fryer basket had broken off and became lodged into one of the wings. \n\nThey ended up paying for my drinks and a different appetizer, but at that point I wasn't even hungry. I would say that they got off easy, because swallowing a metal wire could have killed me. \n\nFair warning to anyone who eats here: Be aware of what you are eating.
