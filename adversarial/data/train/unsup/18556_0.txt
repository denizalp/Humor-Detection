First thing I noticed when I walked into this little sandwich shop on Mavis south of Burnhamthorpe - their menu was very similar to that of California Sandwiches. They offer a variety Italian sandwiches, including the chicken, steak and onions, veal, meatball, sausage and onions, veggie, and eggplant parmesan (my favourite).\n\nThe size of the sandwich is great considering the ~$6 price - you're guaranteed to be full. In fact, even their Junior-sized options at $5 or less are sufficient as a standalone meal. \n\nThe staff here will definitely provide among the best customer service you've ever received. The restaurant space is always nicely kept and clean, and there's even a TV to watch while you wait. \n\nThis is the top restaurant of its kind in Mississauga, and I definitely recommend it to those looking for a meal near the City Centre.
