I have been here multiple times and the service and food is amazing! Just come in with an open mind and you will have an awesome experience. They are very concerned about safety and everybody having a great time. I have never been to a restaurant that cares so much about food allergies and making sure everything is perfect. Obsidian is one of the best drinks on the menu! Nothing scary about the food at all. Nothing that crawls or moves! Nothing raw! Tourist or locals should stop by! They seriously do go out of their way for the guests!
