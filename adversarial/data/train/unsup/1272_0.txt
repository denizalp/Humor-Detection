There were MULTIPLE of \"Hidden\" Charges...  Which costed 56 bucks!! \n\nThe online advertisment didnt disclose any information which sucked! \n\nThe rooms were very small and very disappointing.. (Which did not reflect from the online advertisment..)\n\nThe staff was very hard to understand.. The front counter lady had a THICK AND HEAVY accent. Im guessing she just came from a foreign country... Yesterday.... \n\nThe parking... What the actual.... You get what im trying to say.... Ladies.. If your walking to your car at night. Please dont go alone.. Take a friend..... And pepper spray.... \n\nNow.. I understand that Las Vegas is a 21 and over city... But listen here family guys... All of their activities within the Linq hotel are and will remain at 21 YEARS OLD OR OLDER... So with that being said.. If you have that son who is 20... Might want to leave him at home with some money. Or buy him a six pack of beer to stay in the room and be miserable and think why did his parents dragged his ass along in the first place.. \n\nIf you have kids.. Find a other hotel that can accommodate families..
