This girl right here is a BIG fan of the Iced Capp.\n\nI've never been a big coffee drinker but I'm obsessed with the Iced Capp. As soon as I land in Toronto I look for the nearest Tim Hortons. NY has opened a couple of Tim Hortons but the Iced Capp never tastes the same. Not sure why. \n\nThis store is located in Scarborough Town Centre near the food court. There always seems to be a line, no matter what time I go. Employees are incredibly quick.\n\nIced Capp + Maple Dip Doughnut = Sugar Explosion in your mouth!
