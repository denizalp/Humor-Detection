Normally AJ's is one of those places I have to avoid like the plague because it would be too easy for me to go bankrupt enjoying all they have to offer.\nThe one exception to that is their truly fabulous made to order Sunday breakfast special...\n\nOur Sunday morning treat is to have a made to order omelet.\n\n  Served from 9 am until noon on Sundays only this is an awesome deal:  only $5.95 for the hugest omelet ever and two sides.  Three of us at work share this monster.   I don't know how many eggs are in there but my guess is at least 6.  This heavenly concoction weighs in for at least a pound.  Eight inches long, five inches wide and three inches high.  We get it with everything but the kitchen sink; generous portions of two kinds of cheese, sausage, bacon, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, asparagus and zuchinni.\n\nJust writing this review is making me hungry (can't wait for Sunday to be here!).\n\nThis awesome veggie and egg extraveganza pairs ever so nicely with a double side of the most mouth watering scalloped potatoes to ever grace a plate.  I don't know what is in them but I could probably put a way of gallon of these all on my own they are so divine!\n\nIf you find this place as tantalizing as I do, leave your plastic at home and just bring a ten dollar bill; you will be glad you did.
