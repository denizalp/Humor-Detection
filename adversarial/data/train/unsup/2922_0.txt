Had both of my teacup yorkies groomed here today and I'm so UPSET! I specifically told the groomer that I wanted half off the hair and the face round with the teddy bear look. She didn't listen to what I wanted.\n Instead she cut off 75% off their hair and my dogs don't even look like yorkies!  They look like chihuahuas!  One of dogs is almost bald on her head. She had a long beautiful pony tail that took a long time to grow. And it's shaved off! Uuugh!! I'm so frustrated!!! I told the employees that I was upset and not happy with the haircuts and all they could do is give me $5 off. Really?!  Why can't I find a good groomer in my area?! I'm never returning to this place! And I will not recommend this place to any of my friends. I didn't even want to rate 1 star for this place but I had to in order to post my review.
