So the golf games are fun, I do wish that it was more high tech. I had a really hard time following my ball so I with the monitors tracked the golf ball while in flight and not just if it hits the target. Now, we only played the topgolf game for a few fours so other games might do that. The food was fantastic, I had the chicken quesadilla and it was probably the best quesadilla I've had so hats of to the chef, we also had a chicken cob salad which looked good as well as chips and salsa. Maybe just a little pricey, between the quesadilla, chicken cob salad, chips and salsa, 2 beers and a sangria it was almost $70. Now let's talk about service, meh, it took about 10 min just to get water, then about 20 more minutes before we saw our waiter again to order lunch and drinks. The food didn't take to long to come out. I just think that our waiter could have checked on us more often than he did. We would have spent more money with drinks but we never had the chance to reorder. It's definitely a entertaining place, just a little disappointed in the table service. The service counter people that greet you were friendly and helpful.
