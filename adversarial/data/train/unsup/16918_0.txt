Are there that many unattractive men in Vegas that you need have a continuous smoke machine to mask their fuglyness? This place is a blackout, you can't see, it's hot, and dingy. Why do these establishments never reinvest the money earned? Where does a 20 dollar cover charge go to? \nIt's nice to get off the strip, but you still need a little light.
