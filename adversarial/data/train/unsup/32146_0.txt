Went to a work convention here . Loved my suite . Sooo pretty so many options when it comes to restaurants as well as bars. We had too much fun here . Their pool is gorgeous! The only down fall is its so freaking big so we walked a lot ! Their convention center is very nice as well the refreshments !
