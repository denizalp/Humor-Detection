If you want to leave Vegas feeling cheap and ripped-off at the same time, you should come to this nightclub.  I spent one weekend with some friends in Vegas for my birthday and we decided to come here one night.  I was warned that there will be some strippers that will almost force you to buy a lap dance from them.  Sure enough, about 15 minutes in, a couple of half naked dancers dragged us up to the second floor so that they can give us a \"tour\" of the place.  Well apparently they run a pretty tiny club since we went directly to a small room that's only closed off by a see through curtain.  Everything then happened so fast.  My friends paid, left and within minutes I got a half naked Cuban dancer dancing on top of me asking me if I would tip well if he were to show me his pee pee.  I didn't say anything and in 15 minutes it was over... much like a Grindr hookup.  The biggest difference though is that a Grindr hookup wouldn't cost $100 like the lap dance did.  Leaving the barely private room though did feel like a walk of shame so in that sense it did feel kind of a like a hookup.  Luckily I was able to join my friends downstairs for some drinks and dancing so the night didn't end that badly.  When I got back to LA I told the story to some of my straight friends and they said that a lap dance would cost 3X as much at a straight club so I was actually getting a bargain!  Oh you poor straight people....
