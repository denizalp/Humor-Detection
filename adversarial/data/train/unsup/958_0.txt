The door says \"Texas Style Barbecue\" and inside you'll find a sign describing what a smoke ring is and why it's important.  For an Ohio joint, this is an encouraging sign.  \n\nWe asked for the recommendations and were told to try the pulled pork or the brisket so we ordered one of each.  The pulled pork was definitely the winner.  The meat is shredded and without sauce so you can choose from the variety of sauces at the table.  Smoky flavor and crispy ends but a bit dry.  The brisket was less successful in that it was drier and tougher and absolutely needed sauce.\n\nSurprisingly, the sides were the real stars on the plate.  Sweet potato fries were delicious, crispy and served with coarse salt.   For someone who grew up on collards, Rotuno's collards were just right...smoky with shredded pork and just enough tang.  The mac and cheese was thick and creamy.    The Texas Toast was decadent and reeked of garlic.\n\nThey have a kids menu at $4 and the restaurant has a casual takeout feel so it would be a good family choice for a change of pace.  There was a steady stream of pick up orders walking out the door so it's obviously garnered fans in the short time it's been open.
