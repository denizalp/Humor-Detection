I love the matzo ball soup with plain toasted bagel! They have delicious food with friendly staff. It gets busy on weekends around brunch but it's worth the wait. Save room for dessert! They have a delicious array of desserts displayed. Make sure to try the black and white cookie. I've been getting. It as a treat since I was little!
