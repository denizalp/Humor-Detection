The food at this place may well be as good as many Yelpers say, but we never got to find out. After driving 6 mi in search of a great local breakfast joint, we arrived at Mr. Mamas to find a short line out the door. We patiently waited at end of the line for the guy to take our name. Another couple arrived at the curb after us, only to be approached immediately by the balding guy with the clipboard, obviously bypassing us. It's clear that this place only wants to serve you if you're white, so if you're not, don't bother coming to this racist joint. There are plenty other restaurants who want our business.
