Firstly, I came on a quiet Sunday morning for a walk in wax. The reception wasn't very enthused and I guess walk ins are not very typical or welcome there so it's probably best to book in advance. I got a eyebrow wax and the woman who did it was very nice and did a good job shaping. However a day later I developed a huge patch of red, ugly pimples all around my uni brow and above my eyebrow area. It took almost a whole week for the whole area of bumpy breakouts to clear and was extremely stressful for me as I had an important event with picture taking that week. I won't come back for eyebrow waxing that's for sure, and I'm very disappointed that it turned out so badly and I paid $26 for it including tip.
