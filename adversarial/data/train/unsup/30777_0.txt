We usually love this place but last nite was the exception. I asked if they would make calamari and linguine. The waiter asked the kitchen and they kindly oblidged. Whe I was served there was no calamari at all, but rather a white fish that was cubed to resemble calimari steak pieces. I reordered a different entree and was served when the rest of my party was finished eating. No apology, no adjustment, nothing. Thumbs down.
