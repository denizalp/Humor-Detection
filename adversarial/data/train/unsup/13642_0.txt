WOW. I tried this place randomly because it's close to home and I was sooooo impressed! I got the deluxe pedicure and it was the best I've ever had. Honestly, out of the dozen or so places I've had pedicures over the years this one was by far the most amazing! Here's why;\n\n-Their colour selection for shellac is incredible, over a hundred colours for sure\n- They have massage chairs \n- They really do a great job removing dead skin and calluses. They'll use a razor too if you're ok with it, a lot of places don't even have that option. \n- They massage your feet and legs so many times throughout the process. At one point they even used hot stones!\n- They use paraben wax on your feet and wrap your calves in hot towels. Feels like a spa treatment! And they massage you again while you're all wrapped up. \n- Friendly staff, clean place, competitive prices. I got all this for $45 plus the shellac which was $15. \n\nThanks you Chloe's for being awesome :)
