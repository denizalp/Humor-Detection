BEER!!!  BEER!!!!\n\nI love me beer, i love alcohol in general but love a nice cold beer straight from the KEG.  \n\nI don't like Corona (yes I know I am Mexican), Bud Light, Coors or Budweiser.  But give me a cold HARP, Guiness, or Stella any day of the week.  \n\nNine Fine Irishmen has a great selection of beers and they serve it to you in their respective glasses.  They have live entertainment where they bring in Irish bands to play for you at night.,  So if you can come early since there is a cover charge late at night.  \n\nThe decor makes you feel like you are in Ireland....granted never been to Ireland but I am sure that it looks something like Nine Fine Irishmen.  I am only going off what I have seen on TV also.  \n\nI agree with Scot E.  I wish there was something like this in Los Angeles, but until then I will keep coming back here as often as possible.
