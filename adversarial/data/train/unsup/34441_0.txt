This is a very small and cozy place.  We really enjoyed our dinner and our nice quiet time there.  We had the calamari and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers.  Then we shared The Twisted Salad.  We then each had the 10 oz Sirloin.  For desert I had the chocolate lava cake.  My husband had the bread pudding.  Holy Moley!  It was all DELISH!  I had the Dry Rose wine and he had one of their IPAs.  The only thing we would do to make this a 5 star place would be to have a little bit more comfortable seating and table linens.  Otherwise this place is just perfect!  The owners even came over to make sure we were enjoying our dinner and thanked us for coming in.\nWe'll be back!
