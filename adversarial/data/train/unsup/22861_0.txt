I've driven by this place countless times and never gave it much thought. The building was renovated a couple years back and the interior looks great -- reminiscent of bakeries\/cafes out east with dark wood accents and floral cushions. The place is spacious with comfortable booths found throughout and TVs scattered around the dining room. It's not just a breakfast spot either, their extensive menu spans breakfast, lunch and dinner with a decidedly American bent, but plenty of options like Mexican and Italian fare. \n\nTheir version of chicken and waffles ($9.79) consists of four small and breaded, coconut chicken tenders with just enough coconut flavor to taste without dominating the flavor. The waffle was pretty basic, but after pouring syrup on everything, it was delicious. Potato pancakes ($8.79) were pretty much giant hash browns. Three of them nicely fried and crispy. An order of kid's chocolate chip pancakes ($5.69) was massive. Much larger than any kid should eat and definitely large enough for 3 kids to share. The pancakes have chocolate in the batter and are topped with chocolate chips and whipped cream. Clearly this isn't a healthy choice, but fuck it... I have a sweet tooth and so does my kid.\n\nService was less than stellar with a grumpy older lady taking our orders and occasionally checking back on us. For those who don't want to sit at a table or booth, there's a bar area just inside the main dining room. \n\n3.5 Stars
