If this pizza is really representative of authentic New York pizza, then New York pizza is severely overrated. The pizza here is always soggy and on the verge of tasting undercooked. It is even hard to cut for my kids because it is so mushy on the bottom. My parents swear this is their favorite pizza place but I just don't see it. Try floridinos on Alma School for a quality pizza.
