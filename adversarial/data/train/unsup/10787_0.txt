went there on Wednesday for lunch this place is unbelievable, in the fact that their corned beef was so dry it suck up what's left of Lake Mead, on a Reuben. Had no flavor no seasoning no nothing, hard bread and limp french fries. servers decided to ignore me because I was by myself and didn't look like I had enough money. well never fear I won't be back there again
