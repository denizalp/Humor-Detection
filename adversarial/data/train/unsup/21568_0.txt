Location: Santa Fe Casino\n\nWell, I would like to call this place the  \"mini-me\" of MGM's Centrifuge lounge. Its really not that big, smack dab on the casino floor next to the bowling alley. It has a center bar, comfy couches with pillows. A hookah at a every other table. some of the cocktail waitress' were snotty..um ok, there goes your tip.\nLive Dj. Drinks are too expensive\nI guess if youre inclined to dance on the tables I guess you want to.\nI noticed the votives were screwed down to the surface...ummm...ok,  they werent all that fancy, something you can easily replace at the dollar store...geeze\n\nI'd rather go to another place than try to find a place to sit at this joint
