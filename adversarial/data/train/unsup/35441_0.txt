As an out of towner looking for a good meal and some play off football I was pleasantly surprised. First the staff and other patrons were very friendly. The food was really good considering how fast it came and the music that was paying was good. The only thing I would complain about was the lack of good local craft beer on tap. Other than that this place was a fun night out.
