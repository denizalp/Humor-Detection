Good Hungarian wholesome comfort food meal! It's been a while since my college days when we would eat huge cheap Hungarian platters along Bloor at Bathurst. This restaurant falls in line....good, wholesome, tasty, filling, friendly service, simple clean decor and very reasonably priced. They serve from 8 am through til 8 or 9 pm daily. Dinner traditional staples; schnitzel, paprikash, goulash, cabbage rolls, dumplings all simply served, large portions and quite tasty. Dinner entrees were around $14. And fast service. What's not to like? Two thumbs up.
