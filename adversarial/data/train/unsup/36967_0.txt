I cannot tell you enough how much I appreciate Alaskan Home Services. I am a customer from their Tucson location and today my father's AC stopped cooling. This was critical for him as he has multiple health problems. I called the Phoenix office immediately. They sent William out and he had the unit cooling by the time I even made it to my dad's house in Mesa. My dad is comfortable and that meant the world to me. Thank you so much!!!
