Our quest for a quality seafood restaurant in Calgary brought us to Big Fish on Friday and I must say the best description for this place is \"meh\".\n\nThis place as an oyster bar is great  since they were the best thing about it.  The Leslie Hardy P.E.I. oysters were fresh and delish making me eager to sample the 5 other varieties.  However the rest did not match its price tag.\n\nThe steamed mussels in wine sauce were nothing special except for the specially dead one at the bottom of the bowl.  Which prompted a blank stare from our server when brought to her attention.  I tend to be really generous when judging server performance but this lady takes the cake.  She did nothing about our dead mussels and when asked to describe a particular main course she just said \"It's delicious\" with a snooty smile.  I mean this could just be an isolated incident but experience is a big factor in the enjoyment of a restaurant.\n\nAnyway moving on lol.\n\nThe main I had was the blackened sirloin steak w\/ blue crab cake and roast pepper jelly.  Again not worth it's price.  The steak was a tad dry and you can find an equally tasty crab cake in you local frozen food aisle.\n\nIn terms of service, other than that passive aggressive banshy, the rest were pretty pleasant and helpful.  And the setup is rather comfy but a gigantic mirror behind your table is pretty distracting especially for a vain person such as myself. \n\nI know I may have come off as a food snob here, but when ones bill comes to $80, one earns the right to snob it up! lol.\n\nFor now the quest continues....but until then I recommend hitting up T&T market, grab yourself some live crabs, mussels and lobsters steam them up and you've got yourself a seafood feast that can not be matched for half the price. Well in Calgary at least.  \n\nHAPPY EATING!
