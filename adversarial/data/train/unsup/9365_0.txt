pizza pizza!  I have never dined here, but have picked up pizza numerous times.  I like it a lot.  It's better than most other pizza and it's really close to my house.\n\nBelfiore has a restaurant on one side and a deli\/bakery on the other,  the cannolis are really good too.  I have not tried the other treats but I plan to sometime soon ( as soon as I forget my new years resolution).
