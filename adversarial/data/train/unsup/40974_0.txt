I had the pleasure of meeting Rasheen yesterday for a sew-in and let me just say she exceeded my expectations. Rasheen was very personable, professional, and flexible by allowing me to come in earlier for my scheduled appointment with no problem. She did such a great job on my sew in!! I've already received so many compliments and I couldn't be happier with how my hair turned out. I'm sure as many of you already know, it is very difficult to find a good stylist in AZ, especially one that exudes professionalism and good work combined. Im happy to say that I've found that here with Rasheen so I will certainly be back for future sew-ins. Thank you Rasheen!!! I love my hair :)
