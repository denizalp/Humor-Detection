Went in late June. Second visit. The river is still amazing. \nWhat makes me sad is how \"people\" continue to trash the river. =(\n\nGroup of 5. Tied 6 tubes together, the extra was for our beloved Mr. Ice Jiggly Chest (Yes, I named \"it\") packed with WATER, beer, sandwiches, watermelon, misc. snacks, & zip-locked away: water camera, sunblock!!, lip balm, wet naps, napkins and trash bags.\n\n-Not a necessity but i recommend wearing water shoes.\n-Bring strings if u want to tie your tubes together or whip someone who pisses u off! J\/K =) \n-Bring a sheet or towel to drape over your tube. Trust me.\n\nIt's definitely worth a try if you haven't.. Just imagine, floating down the river lazily with a beer in one hand surrounded by beautiful scenic desert accompanied by your wonderful friends...\n\nminus floating marshy, weird drunkies, and floating objects..\n\nBLAST!
