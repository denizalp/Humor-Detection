Once again this buffet more than meets my expectations for a budget-priced buffet. All of the offerings are extremely fresh, there are some made-to-order stations & the selection is huge. Actually a nice place to take an out-of-town visitor if you don't want to spend an arm & a leg. You won't find shrimp or crab here during lunch, but there's always a nice fish offering on the Asian station. I was sad to see my favorite salad, bleu cheese & walnuts & cranberries, was no longer premade for me. They had all the ingredients in a separate area but I put too much salad dressing on & it didn't taste at all like my old favorite. Ahh...my other go-to, the red bean sesame balls, were still there, fresh out of the fryer, or wherever they come from.\n\nOnce again I was lucky enough to have a 2 for 1 coupon which made our breakfast\/lunch $8! Gosh, taking that into consideration they deserve 5 stars!
