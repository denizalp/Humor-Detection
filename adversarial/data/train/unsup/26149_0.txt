This is a pretty decent sandwich place. I don't know if it's someplace I'd go to often, but they seem to have quality ingredients and a few pretty good sandwich choices.\n\nI had a BBQ beef sandwich with havarti on sourdough. The bread was nice and buttery, and the overall flavor was pretty good. The included cookie was an unexpected plus.
