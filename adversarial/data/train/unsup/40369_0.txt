Pretty good burritos and Quesadillas. Hits the spot at the end of a long day.\n\nThe ingredients are fresh. Their Fish Buritto and steak quesadilla are pretty good.\n\nJust an interesting ingredient I once tried:\n\nOne time I found a strand of long blond hair in my Burrito -I'm not blond-. I was initially giddy with excitement but when the 3rd one came up I just had to ask for another Burrito. The server looked at me accusingly as if I stole his fellow server's hair using a burrito harry potter spell and stuffed it in the Burrito myself -or perhaps he thought I wasn't appreciative of the extra exotic ingredient-. Needless to say, the cashier was apologetic and wanted to give me another one and a refund. My stomach was still um..\"recovering\".. so I just asked for a refund and stuck to the college street branch instead which -much to my chagrin- doesn't serve the La Blonde burrito.\n\nI hope they improved since I last tried it but I'm sticking to the College branch.
