The Eagle truly soars!  Amazing quality, service and variety blew us away.  I loved it that the odor of tobacco was practically nil!  We love sushi and they delivered, with extremely fresh and properly served seafood.  Tuesday nights are sushi nights at the Eagle and they did not disappoint.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers I stopped in the office and registered for their \"Players Card\".  All that was needed was my drivers license.  Showing this card to the buffet cashier got me a $4.20 discount for that little effort.  The sushi buffet dinner is $15.50 per person and well worth it. There were nigri with salmon, tuna, and 2 other fish, as well as octopus, 4 kinds of delectable sushi rolls, fresh fresh and perfectly cooked and seasoned enormous salmon fillet that was delectable!  I ate the most amazing fried cod, moist inside, crispy outside and hot right out of the deep fryer.  The pickled ginger slices were the best I've tasted in years.  Once we had consumed our delectables from the sea, we headed inland so to speak. I sampled their fried pork belly in bbq sauce - heavenly!  (I'm ashamed to admit it was the highlight of the entire evening for me!) Then a carved slice of roast pork loin which I smothered in brown gravy accompanied by whipped potatoes and freshly cooked green beans.  I skipped the cod vera-cruz and the lovely assortment of Mexican dishes and condiments, the succulent carved roast beef .  There were a myriad of more beautiful dishes calling out to me, with no more parking space in my stomach, sorry, I couldn't slip another new taste into the mix.  Two large dessert tables called out as well, loaded with brightly colored pasteries, pies, puddings, the makings of a soft freeze sunday.  I had to try some of them and discovered they were 3's and 4's rather than that food already consumed 5's!!!  Nothing could detract or subtract from the 5 star rating I awarded the Eagle.  There is NO WAY I will not return, and hopefully soon.
