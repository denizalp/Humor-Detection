After climbing the rather steep street-walk-over-bridge stairs from The Cosmopolitan, I was needing some food. My reservation at Nobu was three hours away and I didn't think I was going to make it without grabbing a bite somewhere. Letting my hunger drive my instincts in this new geography, I ended up at Pin Up Pizza, which is just a few feet from the street-walk-over-bridge stairs. \n\nHere's the thing that is great about this stop: every vacation should have high and low elements-- and, if you are prepared for it, this is the low end. Dinner at Nobu and $6 pizza, within hours of each other, seem to balance my Las Vegas preferences perfectly. So, I thought this was a good sign. Then, I took a good look around... Pin Up Pizza had cashiers in child-sized, dirty red sweaters and there were A LOT of drunk dudes. The pizza-making man couldn't seem to get ahead of orders and blank pizza pans are the ultimate sadness trigger for inhibreated bros.\n\nThe Yelp reviews looked consistent enough and I was hungry, so I ordered anyway. I was pleasantly surprised by the price. At $6, my margherita pizza slice was twice the size of my head and tasted pretty good. I ordered the margherita because there were only two pizza topping options when I got up there. \n\nWith fake show girls taking pictures with anyone and everyone inches from where I was trying to stuff down a disproportionately-sized slice, I knew I needed to head out quickly. This is not a place that I would intentionally stop, but is a place that I would categorize as In-Case-of-Emergency-Break-Glass-and-Order-the-Pizza.
