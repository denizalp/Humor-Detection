Formerly the Dermatology, Vein, and Laser Institute, this cozy little office now falls under the umbrella of \"West Dermatology\". Well, even if the practice was gobbled up by a larger conglomerate, it hasn't lost any of its  charm. I've been going here for 10 solid years, getting this icky thing popped, that icky thing lasered off, and that lumpy bump cut out. Jason Arnett, a physician assistant, is hilarious and gets a great deal of sick pleasure out of aggressive pimple popping. Plus, he's never booked out for four months like your average M.D. (but just as experienced and knowledgeable). \n\nThe office could, admittedly, use a face-lift, no pun intended. However, we don't go to the dermatologist for the scenery, do we? I would go see Jason if he practiced out of a cardboard box in the parking lot. And that's coming from me, who is exceedingly picky, and a physician myself. I would recommend this practice to anyone!
