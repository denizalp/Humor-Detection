Got the groupon and did a couples massage with my friend for his birthday. He had never really had a professional massage so this was fun and funny. \nThe spa is neatly decorated and we both really enjoyed our services. We went on a Sunday and there was some loud music noise coming from the church next door and I was worried it would be bothersome but it wasn't once we got back to the room and settled in. \nMy friend had a male (I can't remember his name) and I have Julia who was fantastic...she really worked out my knots and was great at communicating with me. I enjoy a therapist who isn't shy and really gets into the spots that need work, including the glutes. \nVegas spas can be tricky and not that great unless you pay top dollar so I highly recommend Ageless Day Spa!
