The BF and I came for lunch. \n\nHe ordered the Fat Greek Gyro w\/ fries. He thought it was pretty good and surprised at how plentiful the meat was. Fries were crispy outside and still fluffy inside. He originally wanted to get falafel but they were out, so next time.\n\nI got the chicken shawarma w\/ Greek salad. The chicken was pretty juicy and the hummus in it was good and plentiful in meat and toppings. Salad was pretty basic, but very fresh and crisp. \n\nWe got a baklava to share since it just got out the oven. This would have been pretty good of a pastry but the nuts tasted a little bit burnt so it was toasted a bit longer than it should have been. \n\nService was friendly, but a bit slow. This though wasn't because the server wasn't doing his thing, but he was the only server with two big parties and 3 other tables. There were other people prepping and who I think is maybe an owner sitting around, but no one helped him out. \n\nOverall a pretty decent lunch spot.
