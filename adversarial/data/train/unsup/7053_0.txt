One of the smallest bars that ever was, Scarlet Bar is worth checking out if you are in the Palms and looking for a craft cocktail in a sexy red dress...I'm just not sure I would go out of my way to end up here.\n\n3.5 Stars for drinks, crimson concept, and vermilion appeal...a little less for the size and place.\n\nScarlet bar is the cardinal guy that talks a little too often about how it's not the size of the ship, but rather, the motion of the blood-red ocean that matters.  SB is tiny small and their drinks don't rock my rusty boat quite enough to make up for it.  They are however leaning towards the more elevated craft cocktail style that is vastly superior to what the ordinary bars in the Palms are spitting out.  They have a couple of inventive\/playful shot combinations for couples looking to play around with sanguine, rose, cinnamon, or cherry drink options.  These are more about the idea of doing something clever with a significant other than anything else and I can certainly curtail my snobbish drinking tendencies enough to embrace this.  \n\nThere are certainly better options around town though--even N9NE right next door has the ability with their wider variety of bottles to put out better drinks, but SB is a room as red as the female cochineal, that invites you in for an experience.\n\nFor the record I was told recently that it may take a while to get from New York to London in a large vessel, but it takes even longer in a rowboat.
