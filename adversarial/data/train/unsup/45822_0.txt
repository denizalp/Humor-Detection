Golden Donut is our kids favourite place after their musical class Saturday morning. They love the donut holes and seem not to have enough every single time. Coffee is good here too. I personally love the fresh and soft boba, YESSS you heard it right, they make the boba in house!! Another plus is the customer service. Owner always is happy and greets us with big smile. They gave my kids free donut holes sometimes too. 5 stars place for sure!
