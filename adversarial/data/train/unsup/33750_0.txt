I've been going to Lucky's since it opened in 2008.\nI have had better luck with the take out than the eating in.\nA few times the the food was awash in sauce and not that great, other times it was fine. \nA typically decent Scarberia Hakka restaurant.\n\nHowever, there is one dish they do an excellent job on.\n\nThe Singapore Rice Noodle.\n\nThis is an outstanding dish and in my opinion as good as it gets.\nI always order this as a takeout dish,  with tax it's $9.80 and worth every  penny.\nFirst of all, the count: It's a mountain high pile of noodles, enuff to feed a family of 4.\nThe flavours: It's full of green onions, sweet spanish onions, lots of chicken and shrimp, shredded carrot, red pepper and cabbage. \nIt comes with 2 tiny sides of hot sauce, a roasted oil chilli and a green birds eye chilli in case you want to jack up the heat.\nThe spice: A very tasty complex gram masala mix heavy on the cloves and cinnamon. Nice!\nThe textures: Singapore Rice Noodle is s'posed to be on the dry side with lots of texture and theirs doesn't disappoint. Lots of crispy veg and firm curried noodles provide a great backdrop for the layers of spice and heat. Tr√©s Yummy.\nYou dig in with gusto. Soon you are reaching for a napkin, the sweat beads begin to pop out on your forehead, your nose begins to run, the endorphins begin to kick in... you're now in a state of spicy bliss.\nWash it down with a ice cold beer, then stagger to the sofa for an afternoon nap.\nPerfect.
