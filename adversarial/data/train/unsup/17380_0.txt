Yes! I am giving it a 1 star. \n\nI think I am a bit biased though because I have had Sweetie Pie's (being as I'm from STL) so I know good soul food PLUS my aunt owns a bakery and is a awesome cook when it comes to southern food. \n\nThis place? Absolutely NOT! The meals should NOT be 15 a plate.. it's not worth it at all. People always put this place on a high pedal stool and I don't know why. Me and my BF decided to try this place on a whim and I was greatly disappointed. I got the smothered pork chops... cold, bland, and looked old. Let's not even get on the corn bread... super dry! I seriously don't think this place is worth 15 bucks a plate. \n\n\nOn the other hand Lo Lo's (DOWNTOWN location) it's GOOD! So good when my cousin was in town for a day I suggested this place of ALL places I know. And she is a harsh critic but she approved! I know for a fact she would not approve of this place. Neither do I. \n\nThing is... this place is owned by Ms. White and Lo Lo's is owned by I think her grandson or something so you would THINK the food and the way it taste would kinda coincide.
