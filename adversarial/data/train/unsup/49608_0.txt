This bagel place is in such a good location and the staff is destroying it. I have been to this location so many times just because its the nearest place from my house and they mess up my order every single time . Today they reached the limit , I ordered a veggie hummus sandwich bagel to-go. And guess what,  I see there is absolutely no hummus in my sandwich !! how anyone can forgot putting hummus on a veggie hummus sandwich is plain beyond me!  And since I was at work, I can't go back again just to get it fixed.  All i had was bagel and onions in them and literally nothing other than that :(\n\nAlso, they don't give you  any sides unless you explicitly ask  for it ! The other day my colleague brought over three sandwiches and didn't even know that they come with a side !\n\nIf I can deter even a single person from coming to this location, my last one hour of typing this review would be successful !
