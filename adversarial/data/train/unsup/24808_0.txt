Had a good meal at Heidi's and would make a visit again in the future. The menu options are many. Today, we tried the Bronx bomber (pastrami and egg salad), Reuben (corn beef), and a chicken noodle soup bread bowl. The bomber was tasty but for me, the bread was the best part of the sandwich. The Reuben was the best sandwich and full of flavor. Again, the bread used with the Reuben was awesome. Lastly, chicken soup bread bowl was good, but didn't love the bread as much with the bowl then on the sandwiches. Overall, good sandwiches at a fair price and really liked the amount of sandwich options.
