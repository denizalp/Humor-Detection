This place has to be the armpit of the LCBO chain.  There are a couple of creepy staff guys here, like the one who says he swiped your Air Miles card, when you know he didn't.  Or better yet, the other staff dude who says it doesn't matter if they don't swipe every time bc if you don't spend at least 25 bucks, it doesn't show up!!!      Well, that is bs and more importantly, why would you say something like that?       If it's just wine you're looking for, head over to the Wine Rack at Loblaws, where they always seem happy, glad to see you & even know your name & what you drink.  As different as day & night. & you don't have to deal with bums out front.
