Called because they had a great price on a tune-up.  Needed three houses looked at.  The person showed up on time and did what he said, but it was not a tune-up, it was a verbal report.  One house was fine, one house needed the coils washed and one needed a complete AC unit. \nSent me a quote for $$$$$$ for the new AC unit and nothing else was done; no follow-up, zero.\nCalled about a month later and said, do you want to do business or not.  The person was very apologetic and said someone would call within 48 hours; that was a month ago.\nThey start out well but the follow up is terrible; I am sure they are losing a lot of business.
