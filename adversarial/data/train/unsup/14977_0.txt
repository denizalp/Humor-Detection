Popped in for an impromptu order of nachos with my lovely wife last night. The nachos were tasty, the servers friendly and efficient, the music was good and at a reasonable volume which allowed for conversation. The place was clean, if not a tad clinical and lacking in atmosphere. A safe bet if you are unfamiliar with the bars on the Danforth.
