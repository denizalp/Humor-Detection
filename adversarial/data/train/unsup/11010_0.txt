This little, and I do mean little, ice cream shop is easy to miss if you aren't familiar with the location.  It sits back off of Elizabeth Avenue, between Carpe Diem and Customshop.  It's a great way to cool down on a hot summer day.\n\nWhen you walk in, you are immediately greeted but the case housing +\/- 20 flavors of handmade ice cream.  Pick your poison!  Now, how many scoops?  Cup or cone?  Plain waffle, or chocolate dipped?  \n\nThe place is quick and quaint.  They take cash and card.  Due to the limited bar seating, be polite and move along after enjoying your tasty treat so as to make way for others when the line is long.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give these guys a full 5 stars is because I saw the man in the little back room making fresh waffle cones.  Sounds harmless, but the problem was that he kept eating bits of cone.  Still not a big deal, but when he took his hand straight from his mouth to a cone that he was rolling, I got a little skeeved.  In the end, not a huge ordeal, but not a great business practice either.
