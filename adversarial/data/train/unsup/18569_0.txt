Zone is a mini chain that's originally from Montreal, with stores now in Ottawa and Quebec city. I wish there was more of an emphasis here on locally made design, but they do private imports so you can sometimes find things here that aren't elsewhere, and the style is certainly chic and very Montreal with sizeable discounts in the post-holla season. Pillows, throws, coat hooks, mugs, and other tableware, lamps, lots of white, black, and grey. Contemporary chic with quirky moments and certainly an easy place to while away some time and marvel at your disappearing ducats.
