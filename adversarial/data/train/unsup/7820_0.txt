I like this store, I really do! But sometimes it's a hit or miss with their produce section. Maybe it's because I come after midnight and all the good selections are gone?  I should start coming here during the day and see if the variety of apples are better.\n\nI finally got to try their rotisserie chicken and it was good... very tasty and juicy!  I believe it was only $3.99! So definitely cheaper than their competitors!\n\nI still come here for the cases of bottled water! Cannot beat the price anywhere! Seriously!
