This place is one of those best kept secrets of the west side.  Every meal I have had there is \"your mom cooked it\" good (assuming your mom knows how to cook).  They always have an elaborate pastry selection.  The black-and-whites are addictive, and the Cheesecakes are trouble-on-a-plate.  Everyone there has always been friendly, service superb, and prices really very reasonable, especially for the quality of food.  Several dishes for under $10, a few that are $11-12.  My survey of the price range is $$, because you won't get out of here without buying enough pastries to feed everyone at work the next day.\n\nThey have a deli as well, but I have yet to take advantage of that.  My personal dish of choice is the Brisket and Potato pancakes.  I have tried and tried to make those Potato pancakes at home, but can't seem to nail it.  So until then, I will have to dine here, and resist the pastries.\n\nI reserve 5 stars for only my favorite haunts, and this is one of them.
