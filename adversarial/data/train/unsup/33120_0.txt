Just wanted to update my prior comments as I discovered management reads these Yelp reviews. Let me start by saying that they apologized for a bad dinner experience and sent us a $20 coupon for our next dine in visit and not only that , but did NOT charge us for the meal.\n\nThat is an awesome way to earn our business and look forward to giving this place another try based on the nice way we were treated after an unpleasant experience.\n\nKudos to the mgt..  Will post another review on our next visit.
