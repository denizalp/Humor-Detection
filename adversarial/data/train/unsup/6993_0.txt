I have never witnessed this much disrespect from a MANAGER in all of my life, the \"manager\" here at Sedona Ridge Apartments is absolutely the worst person you could ever have to deal with. My mother - in - law is a tenant in these apartments and she gets absolutely NO respect from this woman at all, let me inform you that she is disabled and only has vision in one eye. She has a service dog that stays by her side 24\/7 and he is very harmless, he is here to protect his family and that's all he does. She threatened to call animal control on him for absolutely no reason what so ever, Janay is the manager for these apartments and she does her job very poorly. She is very unprofessional and she needs to be fired, if you're considering moving in to this place I would think twice !!
