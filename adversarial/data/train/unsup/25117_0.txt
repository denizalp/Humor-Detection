Going to have to go with 3 stars on this one as I feel quality has decreased over the years here\n\nLet me start by saying the upgrades to the theatre may have made the place more upscale, but I am old fashioned and prefer a more authentic movie theatre experience.\n\nBefore when I would get popcorn from here it would be hot and freshly popped, seems like in the last 3-4 trips to the theatre my popcorn has been cold and even at times stale! \n\nThey keep making the drinks smaller and smaller whilst also increasing the prices which is annoying. But that isn't just this specific cineplex's fault. I can do with a price increase but I want my big drink \n\nThe theatre seating is very comfortable and they provide a decent atmosphere. My biggest complaint is the commercials at this theatre! They're all either extremely lame\/sappy commercials or they're commercials in Chinese with Chinese subtitles, didn't realize I was watching a movie in Hong Kong , I mean I understand the demographic they're trying to target but at least keep some authenticity for the experience
