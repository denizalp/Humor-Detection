The food was unreal. This was my fourth time eating here and luckily we were here after the busy Superbowl Weekend. We ate around 7 pm on a Monday and had no problem getting in. My dad and I started our meal off with guacamole, a pineapple mojito, and a peach margarita. As an entree my dad ordered the grilled fish tacos: it came with three tacos that were served in hand made corn tortillas and three different types of rice. I ordered a bowl of tortilla soup without cheese and also the tuna crude. My dad really enjoyed the dish and thought they were surprisingly light. I absolutely loved the tuna crudo. I am a true sushi snob and it has to be amazing for me to love it. This truly was unique, the combination between the fresh tuna, avocado, chipotle essence, and my favorite part toasted quinoa on top to add a bit of crunch. Words cannot describe how unreal it truly is. The soup also is something I highly recommend  as well, the base is very delicious with just a touch of heat added. The avocado in it adds a cooling factor to it though. Overall we were very impressed with this restaurant yet again. We shall be dining there again very soon.
