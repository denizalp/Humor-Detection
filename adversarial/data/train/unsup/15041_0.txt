This place is a great Japanese restaurant from the owners of Ichiza, right down the street.  This is my first time trying Kushiage and it is really good food. This place is amazing service and is very clean and the food is great too. If you enjoy Japanese food and you come to Las Vegas you should definitely come here and have a meal! It is very close to the strip too.
