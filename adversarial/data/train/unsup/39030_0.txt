i came to this place really wanting to like it. i was with a few friends on the patio to have some drinks. first - we ordered some red sangria even though it is not on the drink list - and would not have when we found out it was $40 for a pitcher! even worse after a 25 min wait for it, we were brought white wine sangria.. they eventually fixed it. however, the sangria was not good.. especially at that price. we then wanted some food but they had run out of pizza dough.. so we ordered some calamari which was delicious and a cheese board.. just so you know you get a few pieces of cheese and maybe 3 pieces of break for $18.50. the service was offensively slow.. and i am the last person to complain at a restaurant but the whole experience was just unacceptable especially for the prices they are charging. very disappointing because there is great potential here.
