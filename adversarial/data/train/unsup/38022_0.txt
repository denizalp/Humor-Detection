Ordered the cake batter confetti cake for my birthday from Cold Stone's site and picked it up at this location. I was hoping it'd be a quicker pick up process but there was only one guy working so I had to wait for him to finish up with other customers. No biggie. The cake looked great, exactly like the picture. Overall it tasted pretty good too. My main complaint is that only half of the cake had the two layers of red velvet. The other half had one thin layer of cake and a whole lot of ice cream. Threw the ratio off a bit. It looks like someone lost half the bottom layer of cake and decided to fill it in with ice cream instead of patching it with cake. Had to listen to people complaining to me all night about too much ice cream and not enough cake. If the cake had been consistent I probably would have given my experience a higher rating. Still, of all the ice cream cakes I've gotten in the past, the side with two layers of cake and two layers of ice cream was one of the best I've ever had.
