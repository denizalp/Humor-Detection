You gotta love Vegas as at every turn this place is brimming with cheesy yet fun stuff  to see and do from a  mock volcano explosion to  a slutty pirate show to watching imbeciles potentially being mauled by Albino Tigers, if it's expensive and simultaneously in bad taste, Vegas has it!\n\nYou can even take a ride on a gondola here at the Venetian at the Emporium de Gondola. Me and two GF's were assigned to a quasi-hunky gondolier guy that looked like Bradley Cooper. My GF's were greatly pleased and literally went ape-sh$t over him, but he was pretty MEH in my opinion.  Now if only he looked like Tom Hardy!  Mamma Mia! his oar could paddle my canal waters any day!  \n\nSo basically we were serenaded while being ferried around in the outdoor canal and got about three songs outta gondolier\/opera star \"Bradley\", like the moon hit's your eye like a pizza pie song and a couple other familiar yet annoying Italian songs.\n By the end of it he was beginning to sound like this guy\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uTOTb8FVrlk\n\nI'll give our gondolier credit as he kept a tight ship, and I never felt I was in  imminent danger like the gondola was going to capsize or anything, just a smooth, easy ride on a make believe canal while we watched the sun setting across the landscape of a faux Eiffel Tower\/Pyramids\/Volcano etc.  It was becoming all too stereotypically romantic, until \"Bradley Gondolier\" admitted to us that he was actually an Aussie trying to pass off as Italian, Crikey! \n\n The cost of this thrilling experience was $16 per person for about 15 minutes of musical (torture) pleasure, but Bradley was nice enough to stretch our experience out a bit longer as he was so smitten with us.\n\nAll-in-all we got a good shits and giggles out of the experience. Just make sure your gondolier is busier paddling and singing versus trying to get into your pants, well unless he looks like Tom Hardy that is ;)
