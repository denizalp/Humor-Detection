I bought a Groupon for this place and thought it would be nice to try something new. I'm sure happy I did. The place was nice with fun bright colors on the wall, the staff was friendly and the food was great. They also allow you to BYOB since they don't currently have a license to sell alcohol. \nIf I had anything bad to say it is that the prices are a little on the high side for the portions but the quality of the product makes it worth splurging every once in a while. I was also a little confused about them being out of the Chicken Enchilada special before 7pm. I guess since they have only been open a couple of months, they still need time to estimate the quantity to prepare for daily specials.\nAll in all, I will definitely be back as soon as I can to try more of their delicious food!
