Discount ftw!  Easily 4.5 * (not 5 since they don't seem to wheel and deal on the price as much as they used to)\n\nA couple weeks after getting a flat on a remote trail, I get another flat on a forest road out somewhere between Strawberry and Camp Verde.  \nLuckily, my trusty crappy spare was still working, so on it went and off I went.  A mile or two out, still deep in the forest with no cell coverage, a two inch rock shaped like a fucking triangular arrowhead gashed its way into my spare which then hissed itself to death.\n\nMe, my 13 yo girl [edited from  \"a 13 yo girl\" so as not to sound so creepy!], and two dogs then set out on a moonlit, muddy footed, half hour journey back to the spot where everyone else was camping for the night.  \n\nWe stayed until morning, and with everyone's generosity (campers rule!) ate a hearty breakfast and had a loaned spare tire installed with plenty of help (can I Yelp these guys? Five stars!) \n\nHome now, and I've gone shopping for tires at Pep Boy's (old dude gave crappy cust service - i know you don't only have one tire for me to choose from), Wal Mart (charges extra for everything if you have TPMS), and Firestone (decent price with buy 3, get 1 'free', but warranty can't compare to Discount).\n\nBack to Dicount I go, again, as I knew I probably would.  I'm a loyal customer for over a decade now.\n\nFriendly, helpful, intelligent customer service.  Took the time to explain why their warranty is so different and so much better than the standard or even the extra warranty you can purchase elsewhere.  These guys give free repairs, whether you bought the tire there or not, using the philosophy that it's free for customers, and you're a customer that just hasn't bought tires, yet, but you will be back when you do need them.  Shitchyeah!  That's practically Miracle on 34th Street, right there.
