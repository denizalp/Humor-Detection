This place is tucked away in the corner and not visible from the main street on Horizon Ridge. I forgot there was a restaurant here till I had a random convo with some guy at the grocery store who recommended it.\n\nThe minute I stepped foot inside I said to myself  \"Ooo..I think I love this place already!\"  The decor modern chic, clean and simple, earth tone colors, pretty cherry blossom mural at the back wall, lush green bamboo plants that lined the entryway gave the place a certain calmness. It simply won me over in the ambiance department.\n \nCame right before the dinner hours so it wasn't too busy at all. Just a few patrons at the sushi bar and 3 other families in dining area that surrounded the sushi bar.  My server was the one who greeted and seated me.  He was fantastic throughout the whole time, real pleasant as were the rest of the staff who either refilled my drinks or served my meal.  \n\nHad the Shrimp & Veggie Tempura and Yakitori Shrimp for my appys, Beef Teriyaki w\/Miso Soup for my entree and Exotic Bomba Sorbet for dessert. The shrimp and veggies were lightly battered and decent size, Shrimp Yakitori was fresh and I like the asparagus with it, my entree, the sliced beef was a little tough and chewy, the teriyaki sauce was good, NOT the runny thin marinate kind, it was thicker so the flavors were more intense and sweet tasting.  I give my entree a \"B+\".  My dessert was the bomb!!  Exotic Bomba found here! It's a sorbet with mango,passion fruit and raspberry sorbet  in the middle, and covered by white chocolate. Decadent and refreshing at the same time.  \n\nThe Sushi definitely has the WOW factor so far. I look forward to many more visits and trying out more dishes!
