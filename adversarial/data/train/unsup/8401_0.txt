Rick Moonen (Top Chef Master's contestant and owner of RM Seafood in Mandalay Bay) was spotted in this hole of a wall.\nDespite how low his restaurant ratings are, the fact that he chose to eat at this specific noodle house says a little something something about their food. \n\nTo keep this short and sweet: \n- Friendly service\n- Was a wait around 12:30 (prime lunch time) but still got seated and served within 30 min\n- Tonkatsu ramen= perfect portions. I ended up slurping up more of the broth than the noodles which was very surprising (i never drink the broth)\n- Small fried rice seemed small at first for the four of us but was just the right amount with the ramen. \n- Lots of ginger and garlic sauces for unlimited consumption\n- parking lot big in plaza\n \nI want more!!!
