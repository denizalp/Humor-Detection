Used to come here for best french pastries and good coffee. I can't believe how fast the new ownership destroyed this place. It is pure Junk. I could give 0 stars but there is no option for the degree of my disappointment. The cappuccino made by Chinese server, was scolding hot brownish liquid, the worst coffee drink I have ever had....
