First of all let me start off by saying \"I love Italian food\".  So with that being said, I had the WORST experience at the \"World Famous\" Open Kitchen that I have ever had at any reputable establishment. I had previously been to this restaurant and did not really care for the food, but it was a very late dinner so I chalked it up to that.  Present day and needless to say I find myself here again. But since I had purchased a Groupon, I thought all would not be lost because I would get a discount on my meal.  I ordered the Fettuccine with Shrimp; let's just say Lean Cuisine should tell them to stop using their recipe.  Not authentic at all. Yuck! This is the \"World Famous\" Open Kitchen!!\nSo now we receive our bills and because we are in a party larger than 6 per the menu, we automatically are going to be charged 15% for gratuity for our meals which is customary and we were good with, but we were not charged 15%, we were charged 20% and when we asked the Manager about it he had no real reason for charging us more. And I must also mention that he stated that since we were all at the same table (that they put together, mind you) only ONE person could use the Groupon, although the Groupon states one coupon per visit, per person, not per TABLE! And we had three different groups of people at the table with three different bills. After continuous protest He still would not let us use the other Groupon coupons, which was $17 off a $30 value and my bill was over $60!!\nSo on top of the food and service being substandard we also were overcharged for gratuity and were not allowed to use the Groupons that we purchased online. So if you don't mind Chef Boyardee cuisine in an old dark outdated restaurant where they can charge you however much they see fit, than this is the place for you! But don't expect to see me there EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
