I don't expect much from airport food. It's often no surprise when airport food is overpriced and not that great. Thus it was a real big surprise when I found quite the opposite at Brookwood Farms at the Southwest terminal at McCarran international airport.\n\nIt was early in the morning and I hadn't had breakfast yet. Lines were long at Starbucks, Coffee Bean and at Burger King. The Burger King happened to be right next to Brookwood Farms and I would've easily passed by Brookwood Farms without giving it a second thought but I'm so glad i didn't. I saw nice displays of various different biscuits and gravy on display. They all looked so good that I decided to give it a try.\n\nI asked for the biscuits with ham and gravy. The lady helping me brought out two fresh baked biscuits and proceed to put layers of ham on top. She then scooped up a bunch of scrambled eggs and then drizzled the whole with gravy. The whole time I was in awe. I didn't expect her to pile the biscuits as she did. There were at least three large pieces of ham on there and lots and lots of scrambled eggs. It was more than enough to share. All of this food and it only cost me $5.40 ($4.99 + .41)! It was truly unbelievable the amount food and the price I paid. I would easily have paid double that the neighboring places at the airport.\n\nNow taste wise, it was great as well. The biscuits were fresh and soft. The ham and eggs were just right and the gravy was rich and tasty. The gravy even had little bits of sausage in it. It was truly drool worthy!\n\nIt's not often that I rave about airport food but I have to say I became a fan of Brookwood Farms that day. With it's big portion and very affordable prices, I was one happy traveler.
