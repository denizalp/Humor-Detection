Welcome back Jimmy & Becky!!!\n\nAll restaurants have tough service when they first open so never fair to review based on this until at least a month in business...just my opinion. We sat at the sushi bar downstairs and it's just plain SIMPLE, Jimmy hasn't lost a step. Excellent sushi, terrific vibe and my wife and I are glad to have our Sunday afternoon sushi place back in business in a cool new location. All my Sushi $$$ coming ur way. Cheers and good luck...
