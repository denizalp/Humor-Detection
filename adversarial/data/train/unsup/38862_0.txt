Yea it's kinda pricey and yea it costs extra to add things like cheese, bacon, egg, etc.. But its pretty darn good.. I think so atleast. This location in particular is cool because its open 24 hours.. on the other hand, the employees weren't too friendly and the place wasn't too clean.. But aside from that!! This place has become a MUST for the bf whenever we go to vegas or even tahoe. He likes to get the triple king burger.. or whatever its called. the biggest one! if i'm really hungry i'll get the fatburger with bacon and cheese.. if im not as hungry i'll get the babyfat burger which is a cute little burger haha.. My friends ordered theres with egg and they said it was really good, too. I like the chili cheese fries as well. Yum yum.. wish i could have some right now..
