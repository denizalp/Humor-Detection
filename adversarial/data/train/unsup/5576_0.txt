I am happy to see this company grow.  I remember gazillion years ago, when I lived in FL, I saw the first Rita's.  Back then the store only offered Lemon and Cherry flavors.  I used to love to stop by for a cool treat.  When I saw this store, I wanted to visit it.  Wow, things have changed so much.  They have so many flavors now.  They also have a custard that they mix with the italian ice if you so prefer.  This is a refreshing goody, specially during our hot days.  My little boy likes a few of the flavors also.  We enjoy hanging out at this place savoring out cool treat.
