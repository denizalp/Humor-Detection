AMAZING!!! My wife and I love this place so much. Being vegetarian, we always order the Falafel Wrap - it has been the same taste every time!!! And we couldn't leave without tasting the saffron ice cream and baklava---must try! The staff is friendly and will go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied!
