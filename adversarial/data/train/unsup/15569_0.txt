Started going here a bit more 'cause I'm nowhere near my fave nail salon. Other reasons I went was for its cleanliness. \nPersonalized conversations was usually non-existent for me, plus everyone usually talked to each other in Vietnamese, so I just watched the TV whenever I went. My gel manicures and regular pedicures always ended up nice. \nI draw the line at a nail tech scraping at old nail polish though. Don't worry... It wasn't Peter. \nHe literally used the pointy end of a pushing tool, and dug under my nail a couple times. The tool was NOT from a sealed packet either. \nI had also set up an appointment 2 days ahead so I could get a design done on my ring fingers. Didn't happen 'cause the guy took too long. He only picked up the pace when I finally told him to just paint all my nails a solid coat versus French manicure style. By the way, people (like myself) usually set appointments up if they don't have time to dilly dally. \nBefore writing this, I would give it 4. After lack of friendliness, plus the last experience, I'm just going to stop at 3.
