Pros:\n1.  Good value for the dollar spent.  GOOD, not great.\n2.  A very nice facility.\n\nCons:\n1.  Ok, enough already with the windshield thing.  Yes, I know it won't cost me a dime, but if I nickel and dime my insurance company, my rates will increase and that little chip might \"gravely concern you\" as I've been told every visit, I know your service is there and I'll ask for it if I want it.  Back the hell off, please.\n2.  They're not very careful with your car.  I have a spankin' brand new BMW and watched a worker run over two containers and loudly drag them under the nose of my car to the detail bay.  I held my arms up like \"Hey! WTF?!\" and was shrugged off.\n3.  Check for water spots.  Oftentimes they have quality issues and you've really got to give your automobile a thorough \"once over\" after it's completed.\n\nSuggestions?\n\n- End the \"Sir! Sir! I want to talk to you about your windshield, we're very concerned about your windshield! You need to fix this immediately!\"\n\n- FOCUS ON QUALITY, please, if you promise a \"VIP\" for $6 over the price of a \"basic\", make sure the extra $6 is evident in the quality of the finished product.  I don't go to subway sandwich, order a foot long turkey and expect to get a six-inch cold cut combo.
