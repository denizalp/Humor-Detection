I have received nothing but great service from this shop. The first time I printed with him, the shirts turned out fine. I did pay in full for the first service but I also had a rush on the shirts. He was able to print them the same day.\n\nThe second time we printed, I needed them rushed again and not only did he complete the work but he threw in some samples of other shirt sizes and styles with our logo so we could see what they look like.\n\nIt seems there is a bad review on here but after reading it, I can say that I did not experience any of the things mentioned. Nothing but great service and good printing was received. \n\nThanks again!
