ALL of my relatives ALWAYS shop here when they visit.  Whether they are from Toronto or Northern California, for pleasure or business, this is on their MUST go to place. \nMy son always goes early to stand in line to enter when the gates open.  I am equally satisfied to go anytime.  The staff periodically replenish the racks  throughout the day.  \nThis takes work and tenacity, however, it pays off for the Shopping Warrior.  \nIt's a surprise to find out what special is running the day we shop. Last week, it was bathing suits  (35% off) and sleeveless shirts  (40% off)  Today the boots were 50% off.  \nLoot in our arms and money saved --- we are deliriously happy with our purchases.\nI wonder if my peeps come here to visit me or Last Chance!!
