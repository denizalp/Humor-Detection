Whenever this store gets bad press, the owners always insist that whatever negative things are being said are untrue, that they are really wonderful people who care deeply what happens to the puppies they sell, blah, blah, blah. Well, when I was walking through the mall yesterday, I saw a bunch of signs outside the store that revealed their true colors beyond any doubt. What did the signs say, you ask? They are advertising the fact that they now offer FINANCING!!! 90 days same as cash, if you want to know the particulars. Normally I would never post a review of a place I haven't patronized, but this had me so disgusted I had to put the word out.\n\nSomeone please explain to me how someone who cannot afford to obtain a dog in the first place is going to be able to give it proper care, quality food, regular veterinary care, pay for health emergencies, etc. The simple answer is that they can't. I cringe to think of the impulse buys being encouraged by this and the numerous designer puppies that will undoubtedly end up at the humane society, suffering neglect at the hands of unprepared irresponsible owners, or worse. Anyone who wanted to give the owners of this horrible little place the benefit of the doubt now know the truth: All they care about is making money, welfare of the dogs be damned! It's sickening, and I really hope that someone finds a way to drive these despicable people out of business. \n\nLucky Puppy, shame on you!!!!!! And shame on Marketplace Mall for keeping such a reprehensible tenant. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go make a donation to the Champaign County Humane Society since I imagine they'll need the extra funds in a month or so when all the \"lucky\" puppies start getting dumped on their door step.
