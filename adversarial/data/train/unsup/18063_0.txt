How have I never noticed this place before? \n\nI came here for a quick dinner with a fellow Yelper Avitania since I was craving pho and wanted an inexpensive dinner. We ordered a bowl of pho and the nem nuong, since a few people have reviewed it very well. I'd never had nem nuong before and I really enjoyed it. To be fair, if you pour enough nuoc cham on a phone book, I'd probably eat it. The food was delicious and came out quickly. It was a little more expensive than most Vietnamese places, but the quality seemed to make up for it. \n\nThe service was very good and the whole place looked and smelled like an old Asian person's house.. Asian spices, mothballs and incense with a whiff of air freshener. It transported me right back to being 7 and eating lunch at my friend's mom's house.
