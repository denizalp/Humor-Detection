My experience here has been awful. I have been to this nail salon on several different occasions, but this past one was the worst. An earlier occasion was getting a pedicure with my mother. We had an appointment, but my nail tech started on my pedicure about 10-15 before they started on my mom's so they were almost done with mine when they started my mom's so we couldn't enjoy it together. \n\nThis last experience has been the worst. I decided to get a full set of acrylics for prom. I believe it was the owner of the salon that worked on me. I felt extremely rushed. I have had acrylics before, so I know what they're supposed to look like. The nails are extremely thick and uneven. The acrylic starts too far away from my cuticle and they already look like they're grown out. And he didn't clean up the acrylic that is still attached to the sides of my nails that's cemented to the sides of my cuticles. One nail is even CROOKED!!!! He did not file neatly and I left with acrylic shavings still attached to my nails. The nail polish was uneven also. He also got dirt on my nail polish and put a top coat over the dirt anyway. \n\nHe was also extremely rude to me. I told him I wanted a coffin shape, but I didn't want them to be very long since it's very impractical and he told me that they have to be a certain length. I said that I didn't want the coffin then and wanted to say I want a rounded square kind of look. In the middle of me trying to explain that, he interrupted me and did the coffin anyways. I kept telling him I wanted it shorter than that and he ended up yelling \"oh my god! Why didn't you tell me!\" It was extremely disrespectful. \n\nHe was also hurting me! He was filing my nail so hard that the tip came off on a couple nails. On the first nail that broke he said \"s**t!\" Extremely unprofessional!!! And now my nails are extremely sore and I will NEVER come back here again. \n\nNEVER COME HERE FOR ACRYLICS
