This was our forth or fifth time eating at beef and bottle. Our first visit was amazing but with each visit after it has declined. The first time or two we thought it was a bad night and understood because we both had been in the service industry years ago. But tonight took the absolute cake for worst dining experience ever. Let me start by saying we saw a large table that had arrived 15-20 minutes after us get their food before us. We had been sitting there over an hour when our food finally came after we  finally said something to our server. The servers response when we asked her if they had forgotten about us was \"no, you just came at our busiest time.\" It was like she was blaming us for their mistakes. We had reservations. She was just rude. Our salads were served long before the table beside us but their salads were cleared long before ours and it wasn't because we had not finished our salads before them. I ordered my filet med only to get it burnt on the outside. It had such a horrible after taste that I only ate 2 bites and told the server to just take it back. There was no way I was going to have my food ruined again. I ate maybe 4 bites of my baked potato that was very flavorless. I'm not sure if it was the Caesar salad or the blue cheese crumbles that my fianc√© had tonight but he woke up in the middle of the night sick to his stomach and belching which is an indication of food poisoning. I had lost my appetite and wasn't hungry when we left but later woke up hungry and made myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I'm now waiting to see if my 6 year old wakes up sick to know if it was the Caesar salad or not. Btw they don't normally serve bread but if they do (which they did tonight) then you know that your food has taken extremely too long to serve.
