Ok this an update from my 2016 review.\nSo we dined in this visit. We saw several booths empty and were not cleaned off. The lady who came to take us back to the our booth she was very nice. However, the booth that was just cleaned off for us she still had to swipe food off the seats. She should not have to do this...It did seem a little under staffed...I'm just sorry we didnt see our favorite waitresses...this Denny's use to be busy no matter what time it was, but this time it was empty around \nEspecially at lunch time...please look at your reviews and fix some things
