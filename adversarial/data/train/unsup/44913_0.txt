Max is an amazing place to take your car to. They are SUCH honest people and very well known for what they are doing when it comes to cars. Their prices are amazing and they have helped me out SOOOO much!!! They even let me bring my car in when it's so tight on the days that they are really busy. \n\nThe people that own the place are the sweetest people EVER!! They have dogs too which I loveeeee!! SWEETEST dogs ever!! \n\nI recommend you to go to this company for all your car problems. Trust me you will NOT be disappointed!! They are the ONLY people that I trust when it comes to my car. I recommend them 100%!!! I wish I could give them more than 5 stars because they deserve it BEYOND that!!!
