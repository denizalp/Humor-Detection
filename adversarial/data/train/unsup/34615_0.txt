This place is pretty tasty. I've only ever gotten the custard ice cream, so I can't vouch for their burgers and \"real\" food.\n\nI think the prices were pretty reasonable and the food was really good.\n\nMy complaints?\nThe menu placement in the drive-thru. The menu is RIGHT next to the window, so you end up holding up the whole line trying to decide what you want AT the window, instead of being able to decide while people in front of you are ordering\/paying\/receiving their ice cream... like any other place *ever*. We've made several comments to the employees that they should suggest to their manager that they move this because it's dumb and involved no logical thought process whatsoever.\n\nWhich leads me to my second complaint. The people who work here are... not very good. It's mostly teenagers and all the stereotypical ones at that. It wouldn't be too hard to crack a smile would it? I feel like I'm causing you immense torment taking up your time to get some ice cream. And if I ask questions or mention anything other than my actual order, I feel this vibe of \"OMG just order your ice cream and leave because i hate my life\" emanating from them. \n\nOh well. Still worth going too, though. But doesn't beat Custard Cup in my book.
