It's a very clean minimalist set up with all the noodle types in jars lined up along the wall. Our server used these to point out exactly what style of noodle my dish would have, which was cute. That's where the positives end for me. \n\nThe dim sum cart ladies are obnoxious. One was more obnoxious than the other. Walking up and down the length of the restaurant wailing \"DIM SUM!\" through their noses. We tried to order some dim sum, only to have a long order sheet tossed in our laps as she walked away. Then she sneezed. Big, loud, wet, NOT covering her mouth. OMG so gross. \n\nPot stickers were delicious. I got the Hong Kong Egg Noodle. Meh. Sauce tasted ok but was a nasty snot consistency. I got BBQ pork, suspect it was microwaved. The hubster got Chicken Fried Rice. What appeared before him was more like Uncle Ben's Instant Rice, with microwaved veggie pieces thrown in. Gross. Bland. Boring. \n\nFun fact. The husband spent the night on the toilet. I think my stomach has waited until morning to get upset about this particular meal. Never again. Screw you Noodles.
