I was a little iffy about going here first due to bad reviews, but whats life without some risks for the lulz! \nMaybe it was because we came in here when it was completely dead, relatively late in the afternoon but not late enough for all the party losers to come out. The service was great, our waitress was nice and checked up on us often. We had some questions about the food cause we hadn't eaten here before, and she was great with explaining what \"Irish nachos\" were. \nI felt the food was pretty great for just bar food, the Irish Nachos are tator tots covered in your standard nacho toppings, the chips and dip are a huge serving. For the entree we got a pizza, which was a flatbread with cheese and veggie toppings.\n\nTheir music is a little weird (I could of sworn the name of the soundtrack was 'Worst Songs of the 90's' ) but I'm sure it suits the dudebro patrons that usually come into this place.\n\nIf you like to drink at all hours of the day, like the badass I am, I recommend this place during it's quiet hours.
