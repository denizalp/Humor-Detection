Tarbell's restaurant is a Phoenix gem with innovative food from chef\/owner Mark Tarbell. Part of the menu changes with the seasons and other items remain as on going favorites. Service was spot on by our server Allan and his assistants that helped clean up.\n\nSoup of the day was Butternut Squash. Rich, buttery and silky. A half bowl was sufficient. \nThe Seasonal Chowda entree is chock full of salmon, swordfish, mussels, charred tomatoes, haricot and leeks. A beautiful rendition of Fisherman's Stew.\nThe Center-Cut Tenderloin Filet with Lump Jonah Crab. Haricot, buttermilk mashed, with velvet dime-glace. The crab was served hot and on the side as requested to be shared. The deme-glace was rich and tasty as the perfect complement for the steak.
