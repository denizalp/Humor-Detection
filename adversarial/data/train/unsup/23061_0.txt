Located on the bottom level of GVR, it's easily accessible from the casino and from The District. This is a small theater, but it's always clean. Even the bathrooms are spotless. All the employees we've encountered have been friendly. Everything is movie theater pricing so expect to pay +$20 for popcorn, sodas and candy. This is a Regal theater so don't forget to sign up for the Regal club card to earn points for snacks. Save even more $$ by coming in during matinee hours (12p-3:55p) or showing your student or military ID. And on Tuesdays, tickets and popcorn are only $6! Only reason I docked a star was due to a few squeaky chairs I've sat in. I tend to get fidgety, so the squeak during the movie got a little annoying. Other than that, I'm def a fan and will be back.
