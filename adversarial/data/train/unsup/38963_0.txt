It is very rare that I find a brunch that serves terrific coffee, offers wonderful service and has awesome delicious food. The two dishes I tried were the Nova Scotia (eggs Benny with smoked salmon and dill) and the Fork Scram ( scrambled egg and smoked salmon on puff pastry). Usually when trying two dishes I find a clear winner and a close runner-up. However, in this case, I'm stumped... Which would I order next time? \n\nThe answer is... I don't know... They were both Soooooo good.\n\nThe Benny was mouthwatering both in looks and taste. The hollandaise sauce had a hint of butteriness and a light zing of lemon. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the English muffin was not tough but melted in my mouth with every forkful. So you'd think it'd be the clear winner. But Lo and behold... Along comes the Fork Scram... The light buttery pastry danced the tango with the fresh salmon and the soft moist scrambled eggs (perfectly cooked of course). The fresh sour cream added a perfect balance and the dill helped fuse the dish to new heights.\n\nSo overall, I guess what I'm trying to say is...you can't go wrong. Your visit to the Good Fork will not be disappointing! Just remember the door is a push not a pull!
