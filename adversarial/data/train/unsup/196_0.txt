How this company is still in business is a total mystery. Phone calls not returned, emails never acknowledged, delays without notification. Absolute zero communication. It has taken over a week to get an estimate and I'm still waiting. I call everyday and Chris says he's getting to it and then nothing happens. Miguel says its better for them if I come in to the shop to get an estimate. Really? Better for them if I drive across town for an estimate? Very disorganized, not sure how anyone would trust pre-paying this company for anything. WHAT A JOKE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
