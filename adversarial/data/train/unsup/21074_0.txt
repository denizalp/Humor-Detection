I was very excited to try this place, but I walk out pretty disappointed with all the food. The crispy cod bun was heavy and the bun wasn't even special. Then it got worse. My bf ordered the mushroom ramen and I can say that is not ramen. It was just bad noodles in salty soy sauce broth. I couldn't even eat it. Then the grilled octopus appetizer wasn't even grilled octopus, and it was way too creamy and thick to eat. Fortunately the chicken wings were good and crispy. We asked for the check right away because we couldn't handle the food anymore. The server was great though, she knew all about the menu and attended to us quite often. And the outside seating was nice. I just wouldn't recommend the food.
