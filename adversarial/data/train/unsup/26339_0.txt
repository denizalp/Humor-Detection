This was the worst food I have had from here ever my food was burnt the Mac and cheese was dry and when I called back to have my money refunded they said I would have to come back out tonight to get it and it is 8pm and I have young kids who need to be in bed for school. I am highly disgusted then I was told that if I wanted a replacement meal I would have to come back tomorrow by end of day to get it and I would not be able to do that due to work. I am highly disappointed and will not be eating at either of these locations again.
