Shimogamo ruined my life.\n\nWhy 5 stars you ask?\n\nI can no longer eat sushi anywhere else.\n\nBest sushi I've had anywhere.  And in Arizona no less!  The fish is so fresh - I usually prefer it on its own, not in a roll.  I feel like usually I order rolls because the fish isn't so great so I'd like some mayo concoction to hide the taste of the fish.  Not so here.\n\nEscolar is the best.  Salmon is incredible.  Tuna - yum.  You can't go wrong.  There's a poke appetizer that they sometimes have that is outstanding.\n\nAmbiance is pleasant, staff is nice, but the fish... oh the fish.  Any time I want sushi and I consider another place, I'm like, why?  Who are we kidding let's just go to Shimogamo.  Go - you won't regret it.
