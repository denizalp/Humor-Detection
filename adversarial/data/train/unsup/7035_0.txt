Plus - cabby got me home in record time.  \n\nMinus - it wasn't without a fair amount of drama.  Driver was aggressive to anyone who was in his way or didn't move fast enough, slowing down to give dirty looks to anyone who displeased him.  When we arrived at Aria he almost got in a fight with a limo driver who he mean mugged for no reason.  You have a choice in this town.  i'll turn these guys down from now on.  These cabbies always complain there is not enough work.  Then when they get it, they do this?
