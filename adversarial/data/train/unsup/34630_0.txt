Loved this place. Standouts included some amazing torched scallops, the toro, mackerel with a sliver of pickled daikon, and some totally sublime uni from Hokkaido. The hostess was charming, and the chef was very accommodating - he asked folks about allergies and preferences off the bat, and watching him work was a blast. Pacing was great, and the atmosphere was very relaxed. Our seating wasn't full, but I can't imagine that being the case for much longer. If you like sushi, check it out!
