This was my first visit to this location. It is easy to find on the southeast corner of 215 and Rainbow. \nIt was a Sunday at 1 pm and I had expected a long wait but was pleasantly surprised when, even with a crowd of people in the lobby, we were seated almost immediately. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating to accommodate the crowds. \n\nThe menu is extensive and, even with that, the restaurant is happy to make adjustments to your orders when requested. I had the vegetable omelet and added avocado. It was light, fluffy and delicious. I thought that they forgot the avocado at first since it wasn't on top but there was plenty on the inside!  The seasoned potatoes were quite good as well. I didn't have the muffin that I read all the raves about. \n\nThe service was quick and our server and the manager checked in with us during our meal as well. \n\nI would definitely return when I want a great omelet!
