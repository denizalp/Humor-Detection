Store \"manager\" Nicole needs some serious educating on her customer service & managerial skills. I stopped in on a Friday morning for some crazy bread & a $5 pizza & asked for a bunch of napkins. I got 3 flimsy napkins so I asked for more. She gave me 6 more & said she needed to make sure there were enough for the weekend. I said I was feeding a class full of kids and needed more napkins and she said you only bought one pizza I need napkins for the weekend. So I said maybe you should talk to someone about ordering the napkins not to give me her attitude. She gave me a few more and began to yell at me in front of three other customers that I only ordered one pizza and she needed more napkins for the weekend. I started to leave but walked to the side of the counter just so I could see how many napkins they really had. If she had bothered to eat any of the crazy bread she would know that it is extremely greasy and covered in cheese, requiring the use of more than one napkin per person. She then proceeded to scream at me that she wasn't going to let me come back to HER store. I've been to many other little Caesars in the valley and when I order only a crazy bread I am given a nice supply of napkins without the trouble. I will not be going back to this location.
