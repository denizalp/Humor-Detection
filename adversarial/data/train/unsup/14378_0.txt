I'm scared of heights. I get antsy and sweaty just thinking about going up somewhere high. The glass floor at the CN tower really got me freaked out. However, it was definitely worth the experience. People were jumping, lying down, posing at the glass floor. It is extremely stable and can definitely hold its weight. There will definitely be a lot of tourists at this location so expect long lines. If there is a Blue Jays game going on you can see it from the top. Pretty cool experience in my opinion and definitely worth it if you are in Toronto. I didn't get over my fear of heights after this but it's definitely an interesting experience.
