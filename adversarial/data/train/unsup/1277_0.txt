Potential buyer experience? Not as good. And here's why.\n\nI came here to look at sweet Camaro (I've been eyeing the car forever).. The sales lady (SL) approached me. \n\nSL: Hi, is your Daddy buying you this car?\n\nMe: Uh, no. If I buy it, I'll be buying it for myself.\n\n*looks me up and down twice*\n\nSL: Then let's show you something more affordable. We have great sales on Chevy Cruze. \n\nShe didn't realize that by judging me as \"too young\" or \"too poor\" she just lost a potential buyer.\n\nAnyway, this place still gets a 4-star review because their garage service totally redeems for their daft sales people. I've come here twice for servicing: first time for a overall service during their amazing winter offer which included a full check up and synthetic oil for $50 (what a deal!); second time for a recall. Both times I waited for an hour-two, without hassle as I was able to log in to work using their free wifi. Hurrah for free wifi. That's not where it ends. Free breakfast and beverage too. Isn't that awesome?
