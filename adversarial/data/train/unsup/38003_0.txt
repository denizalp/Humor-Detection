This place was great! It took a while for the food to come out but it was worth the wait. I got the mini breakfast sliders, sooo good! Also tried the Jamaican Me Crazy smoothie & that was really good too! Not too sweet. Prices are really good here too. Didn't feel like I was paying \"Vegas prices\" & definitely got my monies worth. Give it a try!!
