It all seemed so cheap, it all seemed so tempting on Expedia. Spirit airlines seemed like the low cost airline of the future. Yes, the baggage was additional, and I had to pay a hefty fine for them to print a boarding pass $15!!!), but it was still cheaper than alternatives. \n\nI write this lying on the floor of the Las Vegas airport, bodies strewn across the terminal like the climax of the battle of the Somme. Legs are bent at strange angles,  babies crying, the elderly snoring like as asthmatic hippos's. We all lie here hoping desperately that our delayed plane may wander into the airport within the next 6 years.. As a frequent flyer I have just seen my first passenger wrapped in a trash bag, waiting for our mysterious plane to appear, desperately hoarding warmth, knowing we could be here for New Year (it's sept 21st). The spirit airlines staff did their best to allay our fears, but due to their general lack of knowledge or customer service skills no information is forthcoming. They did however inform me my flight, or should I say 'alleged flight' is oversold.. So I guess I'm lucky to be here. I'm dreaming of the day we board so I can sit in my $15 dollar assigned seat and order a $10 diet coke.. I have nothing more to say, it's 2:21am and I'm going to peer through the window of the closed airport bar.
