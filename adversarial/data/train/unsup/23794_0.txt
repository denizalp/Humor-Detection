Indifferent and borderline miserable staff, no custom dish orders are tolerated (e.g. you may not specify \"string beans only\" instead of the normal vegetables), noticeably smaller portion sizes than other China One locations, no brown rice, surprise water chestnut filler vegetable in most of their dishes, and on top of all that's wrong with this particular location, you have to keep your guard up in the parking lot (it's a sketchy area).\n\nAnd a dirty bathroom to boot.\n\nAll China Ones are not created equal. Find another one.
