I would give negative stars if possible. Absolute worst experience ever. I contacted Wardley real estate because I found a house I was interested in while browsing on realtors.com. I contacted the listing agent.  And was linked up with the worst realtor ever Greg Hicks. He was the most unprofessional agent I have had to deal with. Not once during the Three month period of my short sale did he contact me to update me on anything. I had to call him and when I did he never had an answer for me he always said \" I'm going to have to ask the selling agent, I'll get back to you\" but he never would. So I finally began contacting the selling agent Jennifer hill who is the 2nd worst realtor ever!. She was very unresponsive never returning my messages. Finally when my purchase agreement expired I quickly canceled my agreement a requested my earnest deposit back which took them weeks to even get them to get the owner to sign (BS).  They gave me the run around constantly and were full of it. If I ever see a property listed under Wardley I will run the other way. Oh ...and Jeff Sommers was of no assistant as well. Wardley real estate is a complete fail.
