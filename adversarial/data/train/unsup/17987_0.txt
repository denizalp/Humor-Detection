This place is awful. We went on a Thursday night and made reservations. We arrived approximately 20 minutes early and we were seated right away which we thought was great. Our water did not come by for over 30 minutes ( we timed it ). Then, we ordered a salad to split and a lamb entree and chicken scallopini. The salad was great and properly dressed. After that everything fell apart. The lamb was overlooked and tasted horrible and the chicken was absolutely gross with under cooked. The server never came by during the meal to see how everything was. The executive chef was more interested in socializing and doing shots with customers instead of cooking and quality control. Then when the meal ended the ticket machine broke; but instead of letting us know or apologizing, they made us sit there for over 20 minutes with absolutely no explanation. This was BOTH the worst dining and service experience of my life. We are NEVER going back.
