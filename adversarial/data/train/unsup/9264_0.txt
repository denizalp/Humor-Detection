Do yourself a favor and if you're visiting Montreal, don't come here.\n\n\nMy bf and I headed over in our car, armed with google map directions.  We managed to get ourselves onto the island on which the casino is located only to--I shit you not--somehow accidentally drive  onto some sort of closed race track (because there were no other roads).  Unsure as to whether or not we were even allowed to be driving there but unable to turn around, we continued on for a good 20 minutes.  We could see the casino the whole time but couldn't get to it.  Finally, we managed to drive out of the weird race track and off the island.  We were going to turn around to try & find the parking lot when somehow we happened upon a parking lot with a shuttle that took us there. \n\nThe casino is 6 or 7 stories high.  The layout is terrible--everything too close together.  This place was LITERALLY PACKED on a Friday night as in NO PLACES TO SIT AT A SLOT--PERIOD.  ...What??  No penny machines.... Boo Boo Boo, worst thing I saw in Montreal (other than the Catholic church that charged money to enter...just to enter)
