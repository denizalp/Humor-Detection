I was so impressed with the service and workmanship of Best Shoe Repair. I will definitely be making the long trip across town for any future repairs; undoubtedly worth it! \n\nMy favorite pair of wedges finally succumbed to years of wear combined with the Vegas heat and the sole of one shoe completely separated from the wedge. I immediately went to the trusty Yelp reviews to find a shop with a good reputation. When there weren't any shops that truly distinguished themselves, I went with getting a virtual quote. I submitted two; Mario with Best Shoe Repair had the more reasonable quote so I decided to go with them. \n\nThe quote was accurate, as well as the timeline to repair. The were repaired like new and worth every penny to get my favorite shoes back! Not only did they repair the shoe that had separated completely but they also reinforced the other shoe to hopefully prevent the same thing from happening.
