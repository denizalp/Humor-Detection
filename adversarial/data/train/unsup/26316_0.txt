Best sushi rolls in Toronto downtown - ish area. Their sashimi isn't bad but it's not as amazing as their rolls.\nThey only take cash or debit. No credit and not much seating area. But they're pretty quick for take our orders and very convenient for Junction area locals. Their prices aren't too bad either but it is not AYCE. Only menu a la carte.
