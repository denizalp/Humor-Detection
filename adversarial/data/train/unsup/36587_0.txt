I love this place! Dr. Sims is so nice and helpful. He really listens to what is bothering you and does a thorough job of adjusting the spine. I used to have constant lower back pain, but now that I got their membership and see him every week or so, I haven't had any issues. And it's always nice going there because he genuinely cares about how you're doing and the front staff is always so nice and welcoming.
