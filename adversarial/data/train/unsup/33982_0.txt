A great place to get a quick meal without paying too much. \n\nOne of the food places in the Arrowhead Mall. This is one of the two places I usually eat at when I'm in the mall. The portions are very large, more than one man can eat, unless you have a giant's appetite.\n\nI'm a big fan of their Chicken Teriyaki combo meal which is $5.99. Doesn't come with a drink, but for about $1.50 more you can get a medium drink to go with your meal. Meat, rice, veggies and a drink for $7.50 is a great deal, especially since I'm only able to eat about half of it. \n\nThe meat is full of flavor and moist. Veggies are cooked nicely without being overcooked. Rice is steamed, so can't really say much about it other than it's good. I've only tried the Teriyaki chicken, so not sure how the other meats compare. Their chicken dumplings are also well flavored and not too dry. \n\nPeople that work here are always nice to talk and deal with. Food is prepared right in front of you. No complaints here from me.
