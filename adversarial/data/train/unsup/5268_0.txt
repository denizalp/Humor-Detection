I was so excited to go here with my boyfriend after reading all the yelp reviews and I'm such a fan of AYCE sushi. This place was good... but kind of disappointing. \n\nThe restaurant has a great ambiance and feel to it. It's huge and the layout if open. It's definitely a place for a large group of people and you order through an iPad like Spring Sushi which should make it a quick an easy process.\n\nThe downside of my experience was that more than 5 of our orders were forgotten, and the food on the iPad looks much more appetizing than the food itself. I think I gotten a sashimi thing that looked like it was going to be on a taco, but unfortunately it was clearly just placed on a pringles chip. -.- The worst part was that you can completely taste the sour cream and onion flavor which made it more obvious it was a pringles chip...\n\n\nThe glowing thing is white tuna sashimi which was quite a nice change from other AYCE sushi places, but a bit too tacky. \n\nThey do have a whole variety of rolls including some in rice paper instead of rice! I mean what other place has that? It's so cool!\n\nI would come here again if I was craving AYCE sushi in Mississauga. :)
