I've been to a lot of innovative cocktail bars .. Bar Chef has the fun wow factor that surprises you unlike anything else in the city. But the taste of the cocktail is always somewhat of a disappointment.\n\nGreat place to take a date for the wow factor but there are loads of other places to go to for a decent cocktail. \n\nAlso, ask the servers if you want a cocktail that comes complete with the pizzazz of smoke and garden .. there are only a handful on the very long menu list.
