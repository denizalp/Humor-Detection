Ordered a Carrot cake from here for Easter. Despite the original size mistake, they had the correct size in the cake tray so they were able to accommodate our pickup time. \n\nIt was only $14.99 for a carrot cake that fed 8+! Very good deal, will be back for a baby shower cake! :) The staff is VERY friendly too!
