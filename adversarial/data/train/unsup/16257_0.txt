This is the first time I have been to this Palm in LV.  I love this Ameican iconic steakhouse.  I went to my first Palm restaurant in SF when I graduated from college in 1989.    Wow.....that's a long time!\n\nBack to my reality.....\n\nI ordered the rib-eye steak and hashbrowns......The steak was perfectly cooked and super juicy.... The hash browns were shaped like a flying saucer.  Thick and crispy all aound.  I like mine shredded instead of diced, but still very good.\n\nA wonderful meal.....\n\nThis a great Palm.......after I finished my steak, I sat back with my glass of merlot and just enjoyed all the eye candy walk by.  If you eat here, you must get a table on the patio and enjoy the scene!
