I will start with, our server was awesome. She was friendly, completely on top of her game, and made the dining exprience a positive one. The food was meh. we ordered the cold and hot seafood appetizers. the hot came with calamari, coconut shrimp, and fried shrimp. the cold one had shrimp, crab, lobster, clams, oysters. for 30+ a piece i expected fresher, tastier seafood. the fried shrimp reminded me of something frozen out ofva box. the coconut shrimp were overcooked. we mentioned it to the server because we didn't want the cook to continue to send out overcooked, expensive shrimp. she kindly brought out a few more. the clams were gross, and i love raw clams. the bread the brought out was delish. i wouldn't go back. there was way too many places i need to try.
