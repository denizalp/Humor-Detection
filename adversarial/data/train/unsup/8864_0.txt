Went in for service to correct a missing DLC; they fixed it quickly and had me on my way. One of the lead techs worked on Mercedes in his prior job and had great insight on my car and what could be working better. If you have a Mercedes, I highly recommend taking your car here to see if they can diagnose and fix prior to dealing with the expense of changes at Mercedes!
