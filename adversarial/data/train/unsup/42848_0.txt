I had gotten my first haircut in a year and a half at a salon in Gilbert ( am growing my hair out ) and the stylist butchered my hair . I wanted a half inch off everywhere and ended up with three inches off in the back and none taken off in the front . So three days later I did a walk in at Avalon and left with exactly what I wanted . Could not be happier . The student that was working on my was pretty nervous about cutting my hair, so her instructor walked her through my haircut step by step . If I could give 6 stars I would!
