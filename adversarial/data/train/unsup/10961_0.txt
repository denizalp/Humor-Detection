No buffet is going to be able to keep the quality as high as a sit down restaurant. Trying feed that many people at one time is difficult and you are going to loose a little bit of  intimacy and personal attention. That being said, Wicked Spoon was delicious! I loved the little individual servings of pasta, desserts, etc. They had innovative food in a buffet.  Dishes that the average joe might be afraid of and yet they had them out like \"try it, you'll like me!\" :) \n\nI would definitely go back. The only thing I kept thinking was \"I feel bad for whoever has to wash each one of these little sauce pans and dishes.\" :P \nhaha!
