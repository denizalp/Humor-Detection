Was very excited when I heard a higher end nail salon would be opening in this area. \n\nFirst impression of the space is very positive. It's so open and bright with lots of natural lighting and very clean looking which is super important to me. \n\nWhen I arrived I was immediately greeted and was checked in and taken to the area to pick my colour and offered water or coffee. \n\nThe lady who did my nails was very sweet and engaging which made for a nice conversation. My service took a bit longer than the 50 minutes I was told it would take, but I wasn't in a rush and she was just taking her time to do a precise job. I'd rather it be precise and take a bit longer than rushed and not great. \n\nOverall I'm very happy with my first visit to get a manicure. I'll definitely come back for a waxing and and facial.
