Yes, lululemon stuff is expensive. Treat yo' self. It truly is worth it if you are looking for comfortable, well made, stylish work out gear that is meant to fit you like a glove and last for years. Sure, you can buy black yoga pants at Walmart, but I can guarantee they will ride up in all the wrong places, fall down if you attempted to run in them, pill after a few washings, and make your butt look like a drooping disaster. You'll just have to replace them every few months anyway. There's a reason people are such strong devotees to this brand...it's awesome. \n\nThis location is great, nice large store with helpful and kind staff who can help guide you to find exactly what you are searching for. They have all types of running gear, yoga gear, and *bonus!* it's cute enough to run errands in. They even have in store yoga classes and a running club. They also have Men's stuff.\n\nDon't be intimidated. Lululemon is worth checking out, and worth the investment. Treat yo' self!
