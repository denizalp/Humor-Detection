Vince Neal. You son of a b**ch! ! You've got some nerve! There's no way Vince ever ate here, cause either the food would have killed him or he would have killed himself out of shame or retribution to the people who accidentally ate there like me. Better options: Taco Bell in an outhouse, vending machine food at a state prison, or your vomit out of the toilet you just puked in. Instead of incarcerating Vince for this crime on humanity, Vince's punishment should be the Vince \"Neal tatuado experience\": waiting forever, for horrible food, and being forced to listen to his terrible music that was relevant for about 5 seconds 100 years ago.
