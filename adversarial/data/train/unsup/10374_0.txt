Still in love.  Thanks to David S., I got a ride from the SE side to come to the Shavery.  I went with a small Vanilla with egg pudding and mochi, no sauce.  Sauces are free, but the vanilla flavor is so powerfully good and I never had egg pudding so I wanted to try it.  Soooo good.  I honestly love the coconut and green tea flavors too so it is always so hard to choose.  Tien N. graciously shared some of his mango, Tony T. his green tea, and Arvin C. his cantaloupe.  I love this place and look forward to the yuzu debut when the time is right!
