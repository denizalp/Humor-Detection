Came here last night (actually, this morning...) via the \"free limo.\"  Was promised to be let in to the place for free, but like everyone else has said here, they drop you off and up charge you like cray.  After much arguing with the manager about what the promoter promised us, we started to walk out.  Of course the manager stops us from leaving and negotiates with us (typical bargaining move!!).  He agrees to let the girls in free, but the guys have to pay the \"cover\" of two drinks, which came out to $30ish\/guy.  After all the mess, finally our group of 10 went in.  \n\nInside, the lounge wasn't bad looking.  Classy-ish with two areas for strippers.  I wasn't very impressed with the strippers at all.  The club said they did good pole tricks (yes, we asked about their skillz before we went) and we were sorely disappointed.  Strippers here = boring.  And there weren't that many.  The main stage went empty ALOT of the time we were there.  The girls walking around giving lap dances were way cuter. They weren't overly pushy with the dances, so that was nice.  Some were also really sweet.  Drinks were a ripoff.  We'd use a voucher for a drink, but then the waitress would tell us there was an extra charge (ex. Sex on the beach was $1 extra because there were two types of alcohol on it.  Okay.).  Going home was sketch.  We DID get a limo home, but the driver told us he was working on gratuity.  So?  Isn't the club paying you?\n\nBased on  the business practices of the club, this place would have 0 stars for ultimate shadiness.  Girls make this place a 3.
