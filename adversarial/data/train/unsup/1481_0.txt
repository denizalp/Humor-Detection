Literally one of the best pizza places I've been to. Everyone there is friendly and they really treat you like family. Their sauce is homemade, it tastes like they put garlic in their dough, and their desserts are delicious and addiction! Every time I've been there they give me an order of garlic knots, which are amazing, but also really considerate and friendly. There is absolutely nothing negative about this place, even their prices are reasonable! I love this pizza restaurant, I will definitely recommend to friends, and I will definitely return!
