First off, let me address the people complaining about the mixture of smoke and their kids. WTF are your kids going to Las Vegas with you for in the first place? Its not Disneyworld and its not made for your rugrat. Its a city founded on gambling, drinking and prostitution. (and just for the record, covering your kids mouth with their shirt  doesn't protect them from the smoke in the casino, a shirt  is not a gas mask, you just made your kids look stupid.)\nNow, onto the hotel.\nGREAT VALUE! Awesome rooms for the price. The architecture is unique, the beds are soft and the furnishings are modern. \nIts not The Venetian, and its not supposed to be, but the room is nicer than what you would normally get for under $50.00.\nIn fact I think its nicer than Planet Hollywood over on The Strip, and they cost twice as much and charge a \"Resort Fee\"\nStaff was courteous, gambling was good, food was above avg, but not gourmet. The Mystic Falls show next door at Sam's Town is really cool. With a little promotion to the right clientele, this could be a rockin' Hotel\/Casino. Suggestion, market to some younger people, my only beef with EC was the median age of the clientele was around 70, which was weird, because all the neon, modern architecture, hip, modern room furnishings scream younger clientele, but the place is like an old folks home.\nWould be better if they could \"youngster it up\" a bit.
