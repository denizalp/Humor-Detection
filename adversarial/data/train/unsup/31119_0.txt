I just love this place. I started coming in because you can get any size drink for 79 cents. But one thing i have noticed is that no matter how busy it is they always welcome me at the door and they are always in a good mood. There is even a big sign on the window with the district managers name and phone # on it, that reads \"if your not happy then I'm not happy\", so i called him one day to tell him that he must be happy. Keep up the good work.
