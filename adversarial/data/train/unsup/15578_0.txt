Ichiza is one of those places you go to after you've spent the entire day eating at fancy restaurants on the strip and have gambled away some more dough and now need some comfort food that won't break the bank. \n\nIt is an izakaya located on the second floor of a strip mall near Chinatown in LV and it can get crowded late at night. \n\nI've been twice now and had their udon, ramen, albacore sashimi, karaage, honey toast, and most recently discovered that their banana crepe dessert is really good. \n\nThe honey toast was better the first time I came and I think one try is enough. Other than that the udon was fine, the ramen was good, and the sashimi was okay as well.\n\nWhen I visited they had a large menu advertising their cold noodle specials that ran throughout August to combat the desert heat. \n\nOne thing about this place is that late at night when they're swamped, the service takes awhile. Just something to keep in mind.
