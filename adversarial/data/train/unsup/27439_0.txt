Pho Kim has recently added more options to their vegetarian menu, which is very exciting!  I haven't seen another place in town yet who does a vegetarian Bun Bo Hue or Bho Kho.  Both dishes capture the essence of spices in the original dish.  Looking forward to trying the rest of their vegetarian options.
