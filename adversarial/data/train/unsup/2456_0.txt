Yes, 3 years since my last review and this place is the best in Montreal!  Best viennoiseries in Montreal, hands down.  Cheapest, freshest, and it's barely changed since I came the first time probably about 12 years ago!  \n\nPlus as its namesake suggests, it is one of the few places that does the Kouign Amman, and its by far the best Kouign Amann I've ever tasted.  And I've tasted many others in Montreal, New York and France but never found better.  Dammit, I even forked out $5 USD for one at Dominique Ansel in NY but that was mediocre, dry, not buttery enough nor caramely enough.\n\nIf you're lucky and they're not busy and they're feeling nice, they'll offer to heat up your Kouign Amann.  Its heaven!!!  Warm, gooey, crunchy, buttery.  OMG.  Nothing gets better.\n\nThere's a very high quality for the other pastries, but I might as well underline what I feel are specialties that are hard to find elsewhere.  Their little pain au lait; haven't seen them elsewhere in Montreal, plus seems to me in the past they used to flavor them with fleur d'oranger.  So good!  The clafoutis are excellent, but now it seems not so hard to find those elsewhere.  Can't forget the Farz Breton - don't see it often, so better be quick to snap it up!\n\nIf you want to compare, I highly recommend Les Copains D'Abord (Rachel, Mont-Royal, Masson) who also do very good Kouign Amann, Clafoutis and also Farz Breton.\n\nI love the small space with only 3 tables, the older wood decor - they have never renovated in over 10 years!  The staff are often very nice and friendly, plus I love watching the bakers at work.\n\nWhy haven't they raised prices?  All the better, but seems strange its cheaper than other bakeries that clearly aren't even as good as them.
