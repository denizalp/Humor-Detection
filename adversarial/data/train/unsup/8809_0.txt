While I was waiting for my takeout order, there was a party of 4 seniors (non-Asian) leaving with big smiles on their faces.  One of the females then said \"This is our favorite restaurant in town!  Everything is always great!\".  She then grabs all the business cards sitting by the cashier and walks out the door saying \"We have GOT to get you some more business!\".\n\nI stared at the takeout menu for a good 15 minutes.  It's freakin Chinese food!  I know what I like!!  I didn't know what was taking me so long but I ended up ordering the ma po tofu and house special lo mein.  I then think about how I can't remember the last time I ordered ma po tofu to go as I'm driving home.\n\nNOW I REMEMBER why I don't.  Everything in the takeout bag was a total mess of sauce.  I won't make that mistake again.  The tofu dish was great.  They used ground chicken instead of pork which made it taste a bit lighter than usual and the rest of the sauce that stayed in the container was pretty good.  \n\nThe noodles on the other hand were sub par.  I wish I had read Clint B's review before making the order.  I totally agree with his opinion on the lo mein and wouldn't order it again.  Excessive oil.  Chef's gone wild!\n\nI fully plan on coming back for the Peking duck which will most likely change my whole opinion of this place.
