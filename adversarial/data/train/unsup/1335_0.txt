This place is so hard to find, had maybe two other groups lost, walking around Carson St, trying to find the place.. It's located downtown so parking, of course, sucks! \n\nThe place itself reminds of the other restaurant downtown, EAT. only because of the small space and the cool decors.\n\nCame here for quick Thursday lunch with the coworkers and this place was pretty loud, busy and packed!\n\nItem chosed was the Black Rice with Oxtail Risotto - very rich, heavy, and tasty! Don't let the small looks fool you.. I was very full half-way through. I also liked how every bite had a good chunk of oxtail meat.\n\nI really dig this place and can't wait to come back to hopefully try more items on the menu!
