Owned by the same people as Sushi Neko across the street (which is one of my current faves right now), this place was a great change in pace for Korean BBQ for me! All-you-can-eat all day special for $20.95; for lunch & late night (11:30am-3:00pm & 10:00pm-3:00am) is only $17.95... they not only offer a large variety of meat and the traditional side dishes, but also offer a bunch of yummy appetizers. \n\nWe ordered:\n- skirt steak\n- sliced rib eye \n- short ribs \n- brisket\n- beef tongue\n- bulgogi nachos\n- kfc (korean fried chicken)\n- the shit (same one offered @ Sushi Neko!)\n- steamed egg \n- steamed white rice \n- green tea ice cream\n\nEverything was very satisfactory... the food was delicious, service was great, and we left extremely full! Also probably the nicest Korean BBQ restaurant I've been to as well... loved the decor! We will definitely be back!\n\nPRO TIP: Leave a Yelp review & receive a free drink! :)
