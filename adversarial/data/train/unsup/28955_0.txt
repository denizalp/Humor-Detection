I have been wanting to try Mezzo for the longest time and finally decided to do so Saturday night. My best friend and I didn't even mind having to wait 45 minutes for a table because our waitress was extremely nice and the ambiance of the restaurant was so fun and exciting. Even though it was loud, it was fine. First, our water came out warm; but we didn't complain. We were so excited to get poutine since we haven't had any from Canada in almost a year. Once it came out were were extremely disappointed. The fries were covered in mozzarella cheese, not cheese curds, and the chicken gravy was chalky as if it was powered. My pesto spaghetti portion was extremely small for the price. I don't think I'll be returning, unfortunately.
