They charge you an arm and a leg but the brunch buffet is fantastic. It was like sensory overload with the various breakfast options (made to order omelets, made to order congee, pancakes\/waffles, croissants, yogurt with homemade granola, bacon, eggs, dim sum  etc), lunch options (sushi, prime rib, pizza, cerviche, pulled pork sliders, salads, etc), and of course dessert options (cakes, cupcakes, cookies, gelato, etc).\n\n I wish I wore my sweat pants instead of my TAJ (tight ass jeans)!
