4.5 stars. I like Baku so I had high expectations and it did not disappoint. What a great addition to South End and the light rail corridor. Get here before everyone hears, I anticipate lines to get in here in the near future. The Miso Hungry was almost perfection. The noodles were nice and fresh with a chew and the broth had a deep flavor. Egg was just right. I added the pork chili and really recommend it if you like a little spice. Only thing that could have been improved for me is if the pork belly had a little crispness, not sure what the authentic way is though. Everyone was really friendly. Our waitress recommended the strawberry basil soft serve they had on tap that day...it was one of the best ice creams I've had. Can't wait to go back.
