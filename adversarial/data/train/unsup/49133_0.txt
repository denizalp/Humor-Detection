I have been taking our dog, Hattie here for over a year now and we have not had a single bad experience or thing to say about them. She has a ton of skin issues which brings us to them quite frequently to stop the itching and scratching and to try to figure out what could be causing it. They always get you right in for appointments, give great advice and always follow up with the appointment a few days later checking in on the dog.  I have found them to be VERY reasonably priced as well. We are very happy with the care we have received at Piper Glen!!
