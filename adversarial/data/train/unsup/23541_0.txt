If you live near Central Phoenix or Biltmore, no Chinese place beats King Wong on value.  Great portion for excellent price.  To top it off, the interior of the restaurant is like you've just stepped into modern China!  What else can you ask for?\n\nHere are some signs that you've walked into a LEGIT pick up Chinese food:\n1) 80 year old Grandma is working the front, and confidently speaks zero English.  Check.\n2) Refrigerator is stocked with 1.5L soda bottles.  Check.\n3) Cleaning supplies and stacks of to-go containers. Check.\n4) Manually hand written receipts. Check.\n5) Restaurant seats 3 people.  Check.\n6) SUPER FAST, well portioned CHEAP Chinese food!! CHECK.\n\nWe even ate here the night after my wedding a few months ago.  I served this to my own relatives.  That's some major vetting right there.
