We came here for lunch today on a cold wintery day. We arrived at around 2.30pm and the place was virtually empty.\nWe ordered a fattoush salad, beef manakeesh, mezza plate, chicken shawarma wrap, mixed grill plate and a chicken & beef shawarma plate. The fattoush salad was good. The beef manakeesh was delicious, like a warm flat bread\/ thin pizza. I would definitely order this again. The mezza plate was so so. I found the tabbouleh much too acidic. The chicken shawarma wrap was gobbled up fast, by my son. So I presume it was quite good. The mixed grill plate, we ordered with fries. The strip loin beef was too dry and tough. The chicken skewer was ok. The kafta skewer was the most moist, out of all 3 meats and the best tasting. The fries were quite good too. The meat on the mixed shawarma plate wasn't good at all, the beef being the drier of the 2. I wouldn't order that again, but I personally hate dry meat. With a fresh mint tea, the total bill was just under $80.\nThe service was ok, the lady checked on us a few times but she didn't refill our water glasses until towards the end of our meal. I wouldn't come back to order any shawarma meats or some of the skewers but the manakeesh are worth returning for.
