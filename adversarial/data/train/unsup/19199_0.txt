Arrived in Vegas 4\/7\/11 @ 10pm, and upon check-in, I was informed that they were going to hold $500.00 on my credit card for incidentals, which I thought was OUTRAGEOUS, but I rolled with it...Well when i got an text notification to my account, it was held for $1300.00.BEYOND LIVID!!!!!!!! I went back to the front desk to inform the hotel rep, and she stated OOPS!, I will get it reversed (NEVER HAPPENED, I AM BACK IN LA, AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS) \n\nThe hotel room was nice, but for the price, it was just AVERAGE. I usually stay at the Venetian, and I get alot more for my money. \n\nThe only reason I gave this place 3 stars is due to the fact that the staff was very polite, and I like that they called me by name, whereever I went.\n\nOTHERWISE, I will not visit this place again.
