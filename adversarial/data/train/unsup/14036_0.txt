Met some family for lunch and tried out the Nick and Ben's Pizza. Overall, enjoyed our lunch and look forward to grubbing here again.  We all selected the $9.99 lunch special that included 2 slices, 6 wings, and a drink.  The pizza was fine, did not blow my socks off but was flavorful.  The honey barbecue wings I really enjoyed. They were perfectly crispy, just perfect and the sauce was decent and plentiful.  I look forward to trying the medium next time. The staff included a young gal behind the register, who also served us and she was very helpful and out going. Overall, a nice lunch and will be back when in the area.
