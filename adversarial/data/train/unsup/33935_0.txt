Horrible customer service. Their food is just as bad. It's definitely not authentic or nearly close. I ordered a chicken kabob, the chicken was chewy and dry. I had asked them if they had fresh jalapeño and if they can grill it and they had said yes. What came out??? Geilled Pickled jalapeños. Smh!!
