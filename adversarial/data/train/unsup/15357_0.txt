Vaqueros serves monster sized burritos. 1 burrito is big enough for 2 people.  And the burritos are always served super piping  hot. Let it cool down for 5-10 minutes or you'll burn all your taste buds off and won't be able to taste all of the deliciousness.  I recommend the ham & egg, the bacon, egg, potatoe n cheese, and the shredded beef burritos.\n\nThe food is good, cheap, and plentiful. The service however really sucks.\n\nTip- grab a large horchata.\n\n You're welcome.
