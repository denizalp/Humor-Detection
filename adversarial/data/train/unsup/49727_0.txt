This was a spectacular meal. Eggspectation has one of the most extensive pun-filled menus I've ever seen and it was a sheer delight to have dined there.\n\nThe space is quite large and open. The waitstaff was helpful and cordial. I ordered an iced cappuccino and the Eggstravaganza, which were both excellent. The Lyonnaise-style potatoes are definitely worth trying. For 14.95CAD, it's a steal!
