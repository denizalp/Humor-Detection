I love Freshly Baked Tees! I've been coming here for several years to print shirts with memes I photoshop to include my brother's face. It's always a quick and easy process, and the service is great. $30-$40 for one shirt is on the steep side, but it's worth it for the quality of the tee and print plus the convenience of the on-the-spot job. Lucas helped me out this week and he was awesome.
