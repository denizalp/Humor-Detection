I love Laura.  I've known her since she attended cosmetology school, and she has not stopped learning since.  Barber school, microblading...She is constantly bettering herself, because she loves what she does.  You can tell by the way she takes time with your hair to make you look your best.  I've never been unhappy with her work, whether on my own hair or my kids'.  Plus, she is friendly and funny.  Go see her for anything, she is a pro, and you will not go wrong.  You will love her, too!
