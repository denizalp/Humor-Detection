The chopped salad was really nice, but the pizza we had with mushrooms and leeks was really bland. The dough needed salt or something, and the toppings were so-so too. We waited forever for our waters - the beer we ordered came sooner than the water - and I only got a refill when I was already finished eating. Good thing BF had beer, I could drink his water. Oh, that beer btw was $9. It was Hoegarden on tap, but still. And I don't mind paying the price, but the service was just sucky. I ended up with two lattes on the bill, and when I brought it up, the waiter was a bit pissy about it. I ended up getting a double latte in exchange. My suggestion, btw: give me another latte -didn't ask for double- that you already charged me for, so you don't have fuss with running the card again. They don't seem to have to-go containers for liquids, I had to carry my latte in a lidless soda cup. Fun.
