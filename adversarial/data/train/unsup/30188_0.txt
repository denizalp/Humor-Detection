Who knew Spoon is a gin bar (insert heart eyes)!! While I assumed all of the food was good, which it definitely was, learning that the restaurant is also a gin bar was a nice surprise. Our waitress was very helpful when it came to all of our gin questions. The drinks were awesome and very unique, as was the food. We started with carrot pirogies which were more of a pot sticker but seriously high in flavor. I then had ravioli with roasted tomatoes and mushrooms with creamed corn. It was awesome. I can't say I will be back often, but it's good to finally cross Spoon off my \"go eat here\" list!
