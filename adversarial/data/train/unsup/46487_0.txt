Went there yesterday around lunch time. Expected it to be busy but it was not. Yay! But that is where my Yay ends. Ordered cheeseburger well done. Got my burger & it was really big but also very messy & hard to eat. The meat the buns the toppings were just thrown together without a care. It was hard to grab as the meat & buns were sliding making it impossible to get a good bite. My first bite...all bread .second bite...all bread.. Then finally a bite of the meat &...wait for it.... It was NOT well done with too much pink for my taste. So upset & disappointed that my request was not given importance. Sadly I was out of time & could not get a new one & this one hit the trash. \nThe dining room was small & made even smaller bc they had pallets of something blocking 1\/4 of the room making so seats unavailable. Most of the remaining tables were dirty & in my time there no one came out to wipe them. As a matter of fact, I had to wipe my own table. That said, not worth coming here when you pay $7+ per burger alone( much higher if you add fries & drink) & not get a clean space or food the way you ordered it.  Yep, this place is off my list- will not return.
