My hairstylist is normally off on Sundays and is located in Chinatown. I was on a time restraint and have not had a chance to get a clean up in some time. I was desperate and starting to look like a hobo. \n\nI have been to a few places around my area and just wanted to see if I could find an alternative in case I was in dire need. Luckily Fantastic Sam's is a viable option. All I usually need is a shave along the side, clean up my sideburns, and a few snips on top. They did all of this without complaining about the mess I looked like after the gym.
