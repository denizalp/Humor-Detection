Came for the famous $5 lunch special. In hindsight, I guess I was being unrealistic, because I thought it'd be a regular portion. It was only a leg and a rib along with a smaller rice and peas portion. Not bad, but still on the light side. The taste of the jerk was really nice, but it could've been heated a bit more. I went to get another piece, and went to try the fried chicken. They actually gave me a free thigh! It had nice taste, but again the freshness was a bit off and consequently it was a bit oily. The festival fried dumpling was really cheap and what you'd hope for, and I saw that other sides like fried plantain are really cheap too. The chicken soup looked good and the guy eating it was raving about it.\n\nKind've a funny interior. They almost literally have a small fenced in area in the middle for seating. The colours make it seem more dated than it is. HUGE kitchen, makes me wonder if they do catering.\n\nReally friendly service - and that's not only because I got a free piece of chicken!\n\nWill certainly go back when in the area. It didn't unseat Jamaica House for tops in the city, but still good and great prices.
