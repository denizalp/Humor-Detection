I ate at T-Pot tonight for the very first time.  I was a guest at a  Chinese Wedding Banquet.  Accordingly, it was a set 13 dish menu, which was selected for us.  The service was very quick.  The food was plentiful (very large quantities).  I didn't eat everything because there was a lot of fish\/seafood that I just don't care for, but what I ate, I certainly enjoyed.  The staff worked quickly.  Certainly no complaints about the food or the service.  And because I was a guest, I have no idea if the prices were high\/low\/\/reasonable, so really can't comment on pricing.\n\nI am giving only 4 stars instead of 5 stars because I visited the ladies room 3 times while I was there and it really needed attending to ...  badly!  Also, the microphone\/sound system  that were provided for the speeches etc. were poor quality - it sounded like a \"tin\" feedback of some kind.  \n\nI would definitely go back.\n\n(I took various photos of the food which I will post on here if I can figure out how to do so, because the dishes were impressive - especially the lobster!)
