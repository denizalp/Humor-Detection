I bought my Mustang at Sturman & Larkin back in 2010. The salesman (Lew Dowdy) was really nice and helped me to get all the student and new car rebates I was entitled to. I also get the car serviced here and have had good luck with that as well. It's possible that your mileage will vary and it sounds like Rob T. had a bad experience there. However, I wanted to balance that with my experiences, which have been mostly benign.
