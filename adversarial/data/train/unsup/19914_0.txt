i was a cutomer of their competitor for a long time and had enough of them not carrying the same products consistently so I switched it up. I live close to this location and I buy a lot of household goods here. They have great selections and prices are reasonable on most items. They even have a gas station outside for members. the only downfall is how busy they always are. With just a few locations in the valley it get crazy here at times so plan accordingly.
