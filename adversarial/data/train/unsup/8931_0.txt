Avoid this place at all costs.\n\nBooked this hotel for $164. When I checked in, they told me I need to pay a $100 deposit that Otel.com didn't mention. \n\nAfter the manager checked Otel.com, he came back and told me that the $100 deposit was in fact mentioned on the website. That was a bad lie, because I pulled out my phone and showed him the website so that he can see that it really isn't.\n\nAfter I asked him to show me where it says I need to pay the $100 deposit that I didn't have in my checkings account, he said they don't have Internet lol.\n\nAfterwards, he told me it wasn't my fault but I wasn't going to get a room. Well, I eventually figured out how to get the money, but that wasn't the end of it.\n\nWhile Otel.com says I only needed to pay a $13.99 fee, they ended up telling me it was $13.99 PER NIGHT. \n\nSo yeah, they really know how to screw you over with the fine print\/no print. \n\nAvoid at all costs.
