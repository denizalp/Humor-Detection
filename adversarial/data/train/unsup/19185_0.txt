I've been here like a zillion times! Not just because it's the best Silver Q location, but because it's been a consistently good experience for the better half of a decade that I've popped in. Seriously, I was such a regular that this is where you would assume you could find me if I didn't pick up my flip phone. Yeah, me and the Q go way back like that. \n\nAnyway, I hadn't stopped by for like a year, probably the longest I've gone without a check in, just to see if it was good as always. It was better. \n\n-The clientele aren't a bunch of rambunctious 18-20 year olds anymore. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I just don't wanna feel like an old man. :-p\n\n-The three projections on the wall next to each other are freaking awesome. Rumor has it that these can be utilized for gaming, which would only further confirm the score I'm giving it. \n\n-The hookahs are way better than they used to be. The owner makes them correctly, arguably better than anyone I've encountered in the valley. And I've been to a LOT of these. :-o\n\nI could go on, but this somehow manages to be a BETTER establishment than what I remember. Play some pool, watch the game, have some Starbuzz or something. No regrets.
