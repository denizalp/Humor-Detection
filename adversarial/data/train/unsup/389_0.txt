We came here because Rosebud was in town and bless her heart, she is always down to try whatever new food spot we have discovered on Yelp.  The space is large, new, and clean, but the seating is either high stools and booths or couches, which are fine for relaxing with drinks but not conducive to meal consumption ,so we opted for the high booth, which was pretty comfortable but had Rosebud squirming over the relatively small table for our party of four.  It was overcrowded with condiments and featured a candle that was annoying her by its very presence. Mysteriously, about 10 minutes in, it fell off the table and shattered (not unlike a certain incident involving the notorious leg lamp in \"A Christmas Story\"), but the very nice waitress took care of the mess and pointed no fingers, so points for customer service. \n\nThe menu had all kinds of intriguing options, and it's hard to choose because you always regret what you didn't get, but sometimes you regret what you did; in this case, the fried chicken skins. \n\nI guess we were expecting something like the crunchy, brown, greasy, delightful stuff you pull off the outside of your extra crispy KFC, but these were more like very thin pork rinds. Very pale coating on white, chewy pieces of what was obviously , well, skin. And the flavor was of slightly chicken-tinged oil. The accompanying sweet, tangy dip was great, but we were happier licking it off our fingers.\n\nReally liked the eggplant caprese sliders, and everyone was happy with their entrees (I believe taquitos and the Hendertucky toast were in the mix).  \n\nNice place, good service, just too far out of my way to make it worth it, but a great option if you're in the neighborhood. Or like to eat  skin.
