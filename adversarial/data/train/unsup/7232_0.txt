I grew up a Home Depot guy, but when I moved to the Dale, Lowe's was super close, so I had to try it out. They have this cool thing there, it's called \"Customer Service\" Here is how it works. If you have a question or need anything, they have friendly employees who will help you and more shockingly- know what they are talking about. It's crazy- right?\n\nI needed to buy a new front loading washer, dryer, and French-door, bottom freezer fridge. I shopped around like a madman, and I researched like crazy- and learned that Samsung got top marks by Consumer Reports in pretty much all areas. I went to Lowe's and discovered they had 10% all appliances over $300. I also had a moving coupon from the USPS for an additional %10 so I got %20 off!! That adds up when you are buying $5,000 worth of appliances. Justin was amazing in the appliance dept. Super helpful and funny- he made the experience really easy. Here are some tips I learned:\n\n-If buying front loaders, spend the extra dough and get the pedestals. I am 6'4 and every time I use my machines- I am grateful for the investment.\n\n-Buy the four year protection plan. Even if you have a home warranty- it's still better to go through Lowe's because there is no service fee.\n\n-Do your homework, shop around. Find out what is going to last a long time, what is highest rated, not just what is flashy and looks cool. For example, Electrolux stuff LOOKS really cool, but when you research it you discover they break down A LOT. I suppose if you're loaded it doesn't matter as you are made of money- but for us commoners, it's nice to buy quality.\n\nHappy shopping!
