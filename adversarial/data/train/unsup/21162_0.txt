Here's the deal. $15 for buffet food and soft drinks. I went on a Monday at 715 pm and the place was dead. Granted, this is Pittsburgh and almost every place that isn't a pure beer hole is always dead. But like some other buffets it is startlingly obvious when the place is 80% empty \n\nThe food here is atrocious. I know it is a buffet. So I'm not expecting Hunan Bar quality food. But all the food tastes like it has been frozen and simply microwaved and sauce poured on. They do have three sliced meats like turkey breast etc, but the guy behind the kiosk was so damned stingy. Literally last 30 minutes the place is open and I am one of the 10 customers there. And he gives me the tiniest half sliver of meat. I asked him for a bit more. He tells me I can't double dip. WTF man. You close in 30 min. The food is gonna be thrown out.\n\nUnless it is used again the next day. Which wouldn't surprise me.\n\nDon't bother with this place. Yes $15. But wasted $15. Instead go to Hokkaido or Tokyo Seafood. Or anywhere else.\n\nThis place sucks.
