I'm reading these reviews and thinking some of y'all need to read up on what a \"convenience store\" is...if you're expecting a supermarket selection and walmart prices, then it's nobody's fault but your own when you're disappointed. \n\nI live right next door to Pinkus. They always have what I need when I'm cooking and realize I'm out of that *one* ingredient, be it an onion or a bottle or Worcestershire  sauce. They also have a great wine selection and a whole bevy of snacks and desserts to satisfy any corner store cravings.\n\nPerfect place to stop before, after, or during a trip to the park!
