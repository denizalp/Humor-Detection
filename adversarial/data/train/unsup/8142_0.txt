Everything on the menu tastes the same. Seriously, I think if they blinfolded me and lined up every dish on the menu in front of me I would have no idea which is which. But I guess that's okay because it all tastes pretty good.\n\nAlso - they have chipolte tabasco sauce and a nice variety of iced teas.\n\nI like it.
