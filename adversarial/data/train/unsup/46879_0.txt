this place is absolutely amazing. (good) italian vegan food is hard to find and this is the place to go. i had the veggie balls and the vegan baked ziti and added mushrooms. every bite was amazing. good for sharing bc the portions are HUGE. I've never been able to finish anything from here in one sitting.
