I like Liverpool House (LH) but, in my opinion, their stuff is quite hit-or-miss. One Fact: The food there is heavy (this is not a criticism in any way - but one should be aware of this before going there!!!).\n\nMy go-to dish at LH is their \"Cote de Boeuf\" special. It is meant for sharing: enough quantity for 2-3 people and it includes some seasonal sides (cost: $110). I like it so much that, usually, I only go to LH when I can ascertain that my dining group will want to order this. It's always GREAT!!! If I just consider this... 4.5 stars.\n\nMore generally, they do their \"meats\" quite well (including seafood). The other dish components and items are a mixed bag. For instance, at my latest visit, scallops w\/ risotto were ordered. The scallops were excellent (!!!) but the risotto was bad (thin rice, watery, underseasoned). This is just one of several examples I've experienced over the last couple of years here.\n\nOdd Fact: They charge for their bread and butter ($2.50 for 3 or 4 slices of bread and one pickle). I guess that's fine - but I can imagine that this would annoy some folks because it's not particularly special bread.\n\nThe restaurant itself looks stylish and has a unique charm (they have a canoe hanghing from the ceiling... and it stylistically works!). I'm less favorable about the service. It isn't terrible but it is definitely well below average.
