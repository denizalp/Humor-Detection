Everything here is amazing! The food is delicious!! You start out with complimentary chips, salsa and refried beans along with grilled jalape√±os and onions AND soup - all free!! The entries are huge! ~$25 for two for chicken, jumbo shrimp or steak fajitas served with a plate of rice and beans for each person. And their margaritas are good too! Family friendly. All around good place.
