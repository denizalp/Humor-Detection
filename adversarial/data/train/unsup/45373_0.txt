Great tasting spring rolls and garlic dipping sauce.  This was my first visit so it was difficult to  decide which one  of the chef's special dishes to order.  I chose  the shrimp and broccoli and my friend ordered the lemon chicken.  Our servings were large enough to share at least half of a plate and we still had leftovers to take home. The lemon chicken was an excellent choice and we were very pleased with the preparation of both meals.  Light oil and not overcooked.\n The dining room is large and comfortable and they also offer seating along the sushi bar.  The owner and staff were very friendly and welcoming.
