Come for the bubble tea and affordable snacks, stay for the videos, but leave for the annoying green laser lights (that strobe across the room and blind you when you least suspect it).  \n\nIn sum, I recommend the taro bubble tea with bubbles.  The snacks are tasty and light on the wallet.  I believe there's free wifi, so feel free to bring your laptops, but BEWARE the LASER!
