Slap me with coffee bean and keep me grounded. I cannot believe I get to be the first review for yet ANOTHER one of my love children. I swear, I have embraced my inner Starbucks whore. \n\nI have such mixed emotions about this location. I am sort of having a slight Cybil moment. On one hand, this is a convenient location in an area that needed a Starbucks. On the other hand, they couldn't have picked a plaza with worse parking or a more confusing drive thru. I smile and then cringe when I see this location.\n\nThis used to be the old Peet's Coffee location. Tiny little plaza on the corner of Clague and Lorain. The parking here is like trying to fit a herd of cattle in a Baptist Church sanctuary. Can it work? Maybe. But it sure is a shit show!\n\nThe inside of this location has a nice finish and a decent amount of seating for a smaller Starbucks location. Not some place you'd like to bring a large group, but a m√©nage a trois would work! During the nicer weather they actually have a rather large patio outside. As long as you don't mind staring at the front of Billy's Buick...the parking lot is right there! Nothing like a little exhaust with your espresso right?\n\nThe staff here is always nice and they really get stuff out in a good period of time. Gender neutral restrooms, a nice food selection and a decent sized retail area as well.\n\nA nice place to stop. Just bring a dose of patience for the parking lot.
