For my money and taste buds, this is the best Jewish deli in town, or at least on the west side.  It's located in an office complex off Rainbow and Summerlin pkwy, with plenty of parking.  They make all their own bread and bagels in house, the brisket is delicious, and their deserts are ridiculous!  I mean, their cookies can be bigger than your head!  Who doesn't like that?!\n\nI can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here, at worst, a mediocre one every now and then.  But honestly, they carry all the traditional NY deli that you just hope to find somewhere else.  They also do a good matzah ball soup, knishes, and have good lox, which is key.  My grandfather was a fan because they had a bunch of the Dr. Brown sodas.  Personally, when I want some good soul food, this is where I go.
