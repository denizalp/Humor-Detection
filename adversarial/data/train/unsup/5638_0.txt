I tried to order the Kale Salad advertised on the electronic menu at the front of the restaurant. The waitress told me they don't serve a Kale Salad and that Cadillac Lounge has no electronic menu at the front of the restaurant. I told her she was wrong. She said I was wrong. So we left. On the way out we double checked and confirmed that there is indeed, an electronic menu outside the restaurant AND it contains Kale Salad. SO I don't know what the hell is going on there.
