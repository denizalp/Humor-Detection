Longnecks of Bud are cheap and cold! I like this little bar because it has the right mix of random bastards that you can drink with and punch in the head when you're feeling rowdy.\n\nThey got some damn fine hot wings here too... especially the honey chipotle flavor. Do yerself a favor and scarf some down rightquick! Yah!
