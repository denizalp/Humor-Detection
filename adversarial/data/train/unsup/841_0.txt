Aria is gorgeous, smells like a fat kid's paradise (vanilla and sugar), clean, and modern. Seriously, we had one of the FASTEST check-ins (read: no line on a Friday afternoon) ever. But I can't give this place 5 stars because...\n\nOne bedroom suite:\n- No balcony\n- No pull out sofa\n- Cramped living room area\n- 2 bathrooms with only ONE shower (but the master bathroom was freakin' gorgeous, and had a pretty big tv positioned next to the tub)\n- I hate when technology fails--and Aria's rooms are armed to the teeth with techy stuff. From the light switches, curtains, etc. Too many remote controls...too much partying...short tempers...basically, a bad combo. Our main tv and media hub was broke even after TWO tech guys \"fixed\" the problem.\n- Hallways are SUPER RIDICULOUSLY long...it look almost 3 mins of walking from the elevator to the our room.\n\nBut the hotel has a bunch of food options, is pretty, has a decent enough club downstairs (Haze, which is good for a night you're not trying to go balls to the walls in Vegas) and doesn't smell or look like grimy Vegas...so me likey but a bit too expensive for the likes of me.
