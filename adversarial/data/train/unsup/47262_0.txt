Been here a few times since moving to the area 9 months back and have never been disappointed.  Reasonable priced, well-crafted sandwiches for lunch and real yummy entrees for dinner.  The old bank-type building it inhabits provides a nice atmosphere and the service has been excellent.  I am not much of a foodie but my wife and sister are and they both love it too.
