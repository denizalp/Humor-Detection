This place is awesome. I brought in my wedding dress over a year after my wedding (tsk tsk, I know...) after discovering I never got it cleaned. Shame on me... Serves me right, because I also discovered in that time, my dog had somehow marked the bottom of the bag it was in, so now there were pet stains on top of the dirt and grime. Without judgement or questions, Edwina was on top of it! She quoted me way more than I expected, but then helped me out a lot through some coupon offers (Yelp has an offer, and check those little coupon books you get in the mail) with the cost of preserving my wedding dress! They actually got it done much earlier than expected. I was out of town, so they held it for me until I got back. Once I went to pick it up, the bridal part was closed, but the cleaners next door were open until 7pm, so I asked if they had it, and sure enough it was right there waiting for me. Thanks for the easy, prompt, and helpful service!
