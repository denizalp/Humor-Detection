I've come here for the better part of a year now and have no intentions of leaving. I checked out David Barton which is closer to my house and while its nicer and only allows adults... its completely inadequate and poorly staffed. \n\nLifetime has it all and then some. Plenty of space, every machine you could want, lots of free weights, great classes, a spa, med spa, salon and good trainers...\n\n... Then theres the KIDS. They are everywhere. I'm single, gay and 25 so I have no kids... Im not opposed to them, but typically when I go to the gym, I'd prefer not to trip all over someone else's. When I enrolled in our $200 per month plan, I was told they were only allowed at certain times... I can't seem to get an answer as to why they are now there AROUND THE CLOCK. \n\nAnyway, its a great gym, if they manage to get a handle on this downside it would EASILY get 5 stars from me.
