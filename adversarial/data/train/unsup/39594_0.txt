I watched this show in Dec-08 and was not as impressed with this show as I was about Mystere and \"O\".  Those shows rock!  LOVE definitely is not the show for you if you enjoy acrobatics (what you think Cirque is famous and\/or known for) and thought that this show was about acrobatics dancing to Beatles music.  I was very disappointed and did not LOVE this show.  My husband, however, enjoyed the show (even though he is not a Beatles fan--not because he doesn't enjoy the music, it's just that he wasn't born in that era)--that's why the 3 stars.  Overall, I would only recommend this show if you are a true Beatles fan.  If you're watching a Cirque show for the acrobatics, your money will be well spent on Mystere or \"O\".
