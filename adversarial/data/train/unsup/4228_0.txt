This place was extremely unremarkable. Although the staff was great, the food was lame, the beer selection stinks, and the place is a major dump. While the menu items sound great and creative (typical hip \"new takes\" on classic Italian dishes), it was not well executed. We ordered an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks and spilt a half order of Mac and cheese. $60, and if the food and atmosphere are great that price would be fine. Unfortunately it was not. This feels like a new restaurant, and I hope they read this review and know that to warrant their prices they can't get away with delivering food this poorly put together. All the menu items sounded good in theory, but did not translate into quality dishes. For example, the Mac and cheese with smoked Gouda should be phenomenal, however what we got was essentially a bowl of extremely salty cheese soup with penne pasta. My date and i both agreed we could have gotten better food at the Olive garden (which is not saying much) at a third the price. I would not recommended this place to a friend.
