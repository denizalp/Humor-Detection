Last night I went to Flower Child and spent $40 on dinner for two. It's not that I can't afford it, but who wants to spend $40 on take-out for two people? My boyfriend didn't even get anything to drink. \n\nDoes no one else think this place is overpriced? I can get food to-go at Essence, LGO, AJ's, the amazing new Whole Foods, etc. for less than $40. I mean, come on. They are ripping us off, people. The meal was fine and I appreciate the unique veggie dishes, but it wasn't worth the price. I might as well grill up some wild Alaskan salmon from Aj's myself. We really need someone to do this at a reasonable price. I feel like this is just an experiment to see how much white people are willing to pay for quinoa.
