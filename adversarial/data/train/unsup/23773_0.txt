I just wanted to leave a review on my wonderful experience I had with this company. So for all the people who don't live in Vegas and want to order stuff online this review should help confirm your purchases. So I was shopping around for a roland electronic drum set that was portable mainly the td4kp model. And after I confirmed that's what I wanted I looked everywhere online to find the best deal like most people do right? I ended up coming across clsmusic.com where they had the set I wanted $40 cheaper than anyone else. But since they didn't have many reviews I didn't know if it was a scam site or something maybe they are a new store? Anyways so I decided to do the online customer chat to talk about the drum set and kinda feel them out. The lady I spoke with \"Ashley\" online was more then helpful and told me everything I needed to know and answered all my questions. She ended up telling me about a promotion where they threw in sticks, a drum seat , and some cheap headphones for free! How crazy is that? So not only were they cheaper but I got an extra $70 worth of extra stuff I needed. Anyways so I placed my order she told me it would arrive in 4-5 business days to Southern California where I live and that seemed totally reasonable on time wise. The set ended up showing up in 2 days I was beyond stoked. Needless to say I will order from these guys again in a heart beat. And for all you online shoppers feel free to order away these guys are legit.
