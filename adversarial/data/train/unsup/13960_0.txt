I don't know how this place got such a good rating as they severely lack in Customer Service.  Called them to have someone check out my unit... the guy at the other line sounded like he was doing me a favor by just picking up the phone.  After a number of sighs and complaints that it's a busy day for them he asks for my phone number and says that I would get a call that day or whenever they happen to be free. \n\nThat call never happened and needless to say I took my business elsewhere.
