My wife and I went to Outback with the hope of getting a good steak dinner. She order the bone in rib-eye and I got the boneless rib-eye. Her's had good marbling and flavor, mine did not. I kept cutting slice after slice expecting to find some flavor and never found it. The only flavor came from the rub and the Marinade. If this was actually a rib-eye steak, it was the lowest quality I've ever had. Most likely, it wasn't even that. For $26 I would think they could have found a better quality than this. I've had better steaks at village inn!
