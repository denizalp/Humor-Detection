I don't know why some people are giving this show a bad review and being so harsh. Can you dance and do flips and still look damn sexy on stripper heels? Do you have tone legs, flat abs, and perky tits? Are you gorgeous AF, performing in Las Vegas? Then shut the F up. Burlesque is whatever you make it and you can interpret X Burlesque as being different and not your typical burlesque show. This was sexy, sensual, stimulating, and fun. What do you want, people?  Please tell me. There was dancing, there were costumes, there were beautiful girls, and there were tits. Perfect combo.  \n\nI'm only giving it 4 stars because the room was chilly and I didn't like my seats. And people who paid for VIP not only got better seats but the ladies interacted with them and I think they should have done that with randoms to make it fair. We did all spend money.
