I have purchased two cars from Metro Lexus and they will be my last because of the rude service at the car wash. Employee started yelling in my face that I almost caused an accident when driving into the carwash. I believed he was waving me into the carwash but  he says he was waving another car in. Employee seemed to have some anger issues and certainly did not treat me with respect
