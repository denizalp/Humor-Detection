Absolutely horrible service. Waited in line for about 5 minutes before the manager Yaneth came out. She spoke to a former employee while I stood there. She glanced at me twice but said nothing. Finally, Gio - another employee, came to take my order. I had looked at him a few times as well while he looked away, so I was surprised he was finally taking my order. When I mentioned the lack of professionalism, Yaneth started to argue with me about how she thought I was with the former employee. I clearly was standing no where near him. Never once apologized. Just an attitude of here your food, now get out. Disappointing! If customer service is not something you're good at, then maybe you shouldn't be in that industry.
