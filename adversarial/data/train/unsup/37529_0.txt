Somewhat rude service, I think because you can't see the employees faces in the window it takes away needed contact to give good service. Got s key lime milkshake that was expensive, tasted like plain vanilla and under filled cup by about two inches. Disappointing, they're regular cones are well priced and seem to be the best thing to get.
