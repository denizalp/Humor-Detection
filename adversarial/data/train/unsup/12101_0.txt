Lets just say im big on customer service. And honest, I dont care how shitty the food is, if the customer service is good, I might try this place a second time. Im sitting here waiting for my food order because I payed with my card already. I planned on leaving cash tip as my order comes. But forget about it. This little girl in the front counter is rude, short with words, and cuts her eyes at you as your order. To top it all off, she is too busy yelling at her co worker and barking orders and throwing her hands in the air that she cant hear me calling her. Maybe shes ignoring me. Or maybe shes too engrossed in yelling at the poor guy behind the counter regarding his training and what he should have been training in. Honestly, I dont care anymore. This little heifer needs to learn some manners and some common sense. The only saving grace is that the food smells good. Im sure it tastes fine. Aloha, please get rid of your rude cashier\/trainer\/ankle biting guard dog and hire another student who I can give a tip to.\n\nEdit: spam musubi was awesome. Kalbi plate cause some annoyance. The kalbi were thin slices of short ribs that were burned because it was so damn thin. Had no flavor. I didnt know that it came with katsu which was great, and chicken..... the chicken was gross. So gross even the neighbors pitbull wouldn't eat it. The best part of it was the side of kimchi it came with. So sad. If you have any suggestions to a better hawaiian bbq place. Please let me know! \n\nA thought on that waitress, im sure after all these crap reviews about her she should have been gotten rid of.. BYE FELICIA!
