The Miso ramen was tasty.  I received only 2 slices of pork belly & hoped for more.  The cabbage or scallion that was part of the meal was like a huge broccoli stalk end that I navigated around.  I would hope for a little more in the way of corn or the veggies in the ramen.  At a certain point, it felt like a huge bowl of miso soup w\/noodles vs. additional items.  The soup was slug slow to come out.  I'm wondering if that is to steep the flavors or some other reason.  Sitting outside & it started to rain.  For the exposed tables on a busy Fri night there wasn't enough room to seat everyone inside.  Luckily, I had completed my meal so I was able to leave vs. stick around for the mania that ensued trying to accommodate the other patrons.  I'll try this again & maybe a different dish vs. ramen.  The buns the table next to me had looked pretty tasty.
