Heirloom was participating in this year's Queen's Feast aka Charlotte Restaurant Week. As well, being listed as one of the Top 50 Places to Eat in Charlotte https:\/\/www.yelpblog.com\/2016\/12\/yelps-2016-top-50-places-eat-charlotte, they've been on my list. So I brought my lovely wife here for dinner.\n\nChicken and dumplings to start was excellent. Lots of tasty vegetables in there. I can't remember the last time I had rutabaga. Yummy. The sweet potato soup was also good.\n\nRibeye steak (a $12 upgrade) was a terrific piece of meat. I loved that they trimmed the steak *and brought the trimmings on a separate plate!* Great cut and grilled perfectly to the medium rare we requested. I chose the crab cakes and they were excellent. Very well loaded with crab and little filling, a very nice taste and texture. Perfect crab.\n\nDessert was the only imperfect course.  I chose the apple cake and while the cake was very good, being topped with a rather hard ginger cookie made it difficult to eat. The deconstructed elderberry cheesecake that Mrs. chose was the better option.\n\nService was top notch excellent. Very, very good attentiveness, sincerity and appreciation for us choosing their restaurant. I love that Heirloom is focused on local sourcing and North Carolina vendors. From the meat to the sauces and the beers\/wines. I wish more places did this.\n\nWe'll absolutely be back.
