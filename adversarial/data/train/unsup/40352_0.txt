Store was clean and very organized. Lots of selections and offer great multiple discounts. All the staff were so nice and friendly. They were all happy to assist you and would compute each item you were interested to buy so you would know the exact price after multiple discounts.  The salesperson who helped me was Jack and he was excellent. I went there there to just look around but after 5 minutes  I ended up buying a huge leather travel bag.  I was happy with my purchase and so with the excelled VIP service I received.
