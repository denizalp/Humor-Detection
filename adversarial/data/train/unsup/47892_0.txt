An Amazing place....the food is off the hook, authentic Mexican food like nowhere else in the town.  Open late Friday & Saturday, full bar and if you have ever been to Mexico and had real food, this place is the real deal.\n\nFresh made tortillas, any kind of taco you can imagine, burritos and more.\n\nAll I can say is the food is great, the atmosphere is great, the staff are amazing and if you have not been here you are missing out.  This place is a must try.
