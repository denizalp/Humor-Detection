At first upon joining everything seemed on the up and up.  Clean gym, lots of equipment etc.  However, if you're thinking about personal training, think again.  I say this for two reasons.  \n1. The contract you have to sign.  We recently moved far away from this gym.  We did what the contract required as far as giving notice.  But, they still are going to draw another payment for the upcoming month.  I have contacted the customer service department and have even talked to someone at their parent company, Titan Fitness.  No one is able or willing to help us understand this.  What the contract \"states\" and what they say it \"means' are not the same.  \n2.  The trainers seem to come and go rather quickly.  My hubby had three different trainers within 3 months.  I had the same trainer and she was great.  But I understand she is gone now too.\nThe management throughout Fitness Connection and Titan Fitness apparently only care about the almighty dollar signs$$$$$$\nNever again will I sign another contract to belong to a gym!!!
