New location, big problems. It may well have been due to high foot traffic on Xmas Eve; however, as far as I could see, only my order was botched. But it isn't just that.\n\nCoffee was 'meh', order took 10 minutes because it was missed on the system (whatever that means). But my biggest issue was with drive-through cashier. She had gloves on,but was eating her own food, whilst working, and then handling other orders, and that's not cool. That's what break time is for lady - cut it out!!!
