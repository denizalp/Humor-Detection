We really had a positive experience with this company.  We had a leaking, 23 y\/o a\/c unit that needed to be repaired.  The tech that came out was friendly and efficient - he told us exactly what the problem was and what it would cost, so no surprises.  He repaired the unit and recommended we consider replacing them.  Considering the age of our a\/c units, we decided to move forward with getting a quote on replacing them.  The gentleman that came out the following week thoroughly inspected our setup and gave us a detailed estimate.  Ultimately, their estimate wasn't the lowest and contained limited options so we went with somebody else, but overall we were happy with the service we did receive from them.
