Q: Where can you find...church goers, hungover peeps, masses of kids and some of the quickest, delicious breakfast in all of Charlotte? \n\nA: Original Pancake House\n\nYup, it's a smorgasbord of hungry folks and it's tasty. And yes, it's a chain, but I can't help but express my love for this particular OPH. If you're looking for breakfast, early in the mornin' or late in the afternoon, I highly recommend dropping by here. If you make this particular breakfast run on a Sunday, be prepared to run into a line of hungry folks. But it's ok, really - don't you fear. A very long line absolutely flies into the restaurant in lighting quick speed. I don't know how many cooks OPH has working, but those guys\/gals are really, really fast. Thus the tables turn really, really quickly. \n\nNo joke, as soon as hubs and I are seated we are out of there in 30-40 minutes at the longest. I usually order the French Crepes - perfectly cooked, delicious, thin crepes stuffed with fresh strawberries accompanied by a side of strawberry sauce. I typically order only two as the regular order comes with three and I just can't handle that much delectable goodness. Make sure you try the turkey sausage too - it's pretty amazing. \n\nIf you're more of an omelet fan, OPH makes them the size of footballs. They.are.huge. Oh, and they come with a side of pancakes, so be sure to come hungry. This particular joint is a staple for me as I'm always craving those damn crepes. Thanks, OPH!
