How I love you Waffle House....\n\nWhen I see your awkward plain square yellow letters...W...A...F....F....L...E.....H....O....U....S...E....I truly light up inside.....you have been my inspiration to continue driving on many of my road trips.....I just keep going and going and going...from one waffle house to the next through out the whole country......sometimes I am unfaithful to you and swing in to Cracker Barrel...but you always get me first..they get your sloppy seconds......Yes I can see your sign in my mind right now.....\n\nI swing in and almost sprint inside....I force myself in between to fat smelly truck drivers at the counter...and then I wait for the oh so ugly staff with the lazy eye and missing teeth to ask my for my order.( I wonder if having a lazy eye is a job requirement at Waffle House ).....no need for a menu...I know....I always know.....I want the cheese egg special that comes with raison toast ,apple butter and yummy ass hashbrowns ( be careful in some states it comes with nasty ass grits ).......sometimes I get a double order of eggs......and a diet coke ofcourse.....\n\nThen I watch as the even uglier sweaty cooks go to work on my breakfast...my mouth waters...not even the stench of the fat truck driver staring a my tits next to me....can stop my excitement...my tongue waits to lick the plate...greesy cheesy goodness....no need to have any class here....as I look around at another truck driver picking his nose in the corner.....\n\nI dream of Waffle House.....and my 3 dollar breakfast...its the first place I stop as soon as I leave California.....God how I wish we had one in my State
