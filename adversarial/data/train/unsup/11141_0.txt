This is a sweet little shop. Pun intended. It's a no frills, sorbet and ice cream store with some creamy, delicious  unique flavors such as balsamic vinegar and chocolate hollandaise. All of their smooth, packed full of flavor sorbets are dairy free and they do offer a taste of any flavor you may wish to try. \n\nThe man dishing up the goods, I believe is the owner and is an absolute doll! Barely spoke English but we were able to convey what we wanted without any issue.  \n\nThere are no seats inside but a few benches outside which were good for people watching. \n\nThey're open late and this was a great choice for a post din, almost midnight night treat. \n\nCash, credit, debit chip. \n\nThere's something for everyone here.
