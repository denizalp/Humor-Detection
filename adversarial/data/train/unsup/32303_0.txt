Victory Cafe is not really a pub, but not really a cafe either. Its a once-house-turned-restaurant which gives it a nice cozy feel. I kind of had the feeling I was over at a friends place for dinner - relaxed atmosphere, tasty (& somewhat local) beer, great conversation and amazing comfort food. The mac and cheese, nachos, and grilled cheese were all great. I'd also recommend sitting either outside or upstairs if you can.\n\nI'll definitely be back!
