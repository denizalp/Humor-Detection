If you want to go shopping without buying anything,\n\nIf you want to feel depressed,\n\nIf you want to feel like you are lost in a bazaar in a far far away land,\n\nCome to Malvern Town Center.\n\nMaybe I was lucky to be here during their Side work Sale... even on a weekday afternoon this place was crowded... Not because it was full of anxious bargain shoppers, just all the stores have all their good out in the middle aisle and I just kept on bumping into everything (I know I am clumsy....)\n\nI know I am in Scarborough... but I don't really want to shop in the dozen of dollar\/bargain stores that all has similar products or do I want to buy tops here that  looks the same for $10? \n\nI was looking for food, but all they have is McDonald's, Pizza Pizza, KFC, Taco Bell, Panda but I guess at least they are typical fast food and make a quick cheap meal.\n\nI think I will skip Malvern Town Centre, it is just not for me!
