I've been to the Boardwalk Billy's near UNCC a few times but this was our first time here.  It is an average place with average food, but our waitress was very nice.  We though this place would be packed for the AFC Wild Card game but it was pretty empty.  This location is also much smaller than the UNCC location.  There was nothing inherently wrong with the food except maybe the slaw having too much of a vinegar taste to it.  Fried shrimp, steampot, and fish tacos were all par.  They don't have too much craft beer on tap except for Fat Tire, but that's better than nothing.  We may go again if in the area, but also may not make a special trip to go.
