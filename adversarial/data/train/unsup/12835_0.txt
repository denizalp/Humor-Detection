I'm still fuming over a day later about our experience at Grand Cafe.  We just moved into the area, and had absolutely nothing in our fridge...and the babes were HuNgRy to say the least.  We decided to just grab a quick bite at the coffee shop because it was close to our house.\n\nAfter waiting nearly 15 minutes, and watching numerous servers walk past our table, we motioned to another server who said \"our\" server would be there soon.  Another 5 minutes went past, and our baby was ready to throw a fit and crayons were only doing so much.  Our server, who's name has escaped me, finally came to our table to take our drink order.  \n\nI politely asked for a coke and a water with lemon, an apple juice for the baby, and a hot chocolate for my 4 year old.  He repeated back a coffee, and for you sir.  I politely corrected him and he then asked if Pepsi was okay?  I said, no I will just have a water with lemon.  He then rolled his eyes and asked my husband for his order.  At that time the baby let out a scream and he stood there rolled his eyes and sighed extremely loudly making a scene over our crying baby.  He was obviously annoyed and less than enthusiastic, and annoyed by our children's preference.\n\nMy husband stood up and was irate over the way we were treated after our baby started crying because we had waited over 20 minutes for a drink order.  We spoke with the manager, who was even less helpful...and finally walked out and went to Panera to feed our babies.\n\nNeedless to say I've never been treated so poorly by a server who's main source of income is from tips.  I will never step foot into the Green Valley Ranch Resort because of the lack of care and concern from the management.  My friends are coming in to town for the weekend, and after the experience we had have canceled their rooms. We ran into a friend who was waiting to be seated, and he left as well.  \n\nMoms and Dads beware!  The bald server is a JERK and the management is less than helpful!
