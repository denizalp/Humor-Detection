This was the worst going out experience I have ever had, for the following five reasons:\n\n(1) Upon arrival, the owner and a bouncer were removing a disorderly woman from the club. In the scuffle, I was shoved against the wall and stepped on by the owner (short guy with a mohawk). No apology was provided.\n\n(2) I paid the fee and checked my coat (mandatory coat check) inside my friend's bookbag. He left early, and I attempted to put my coat with another friend's. The coat check woman was unbelievably rude and demanded I pay again, despite having already paid. I tried to dispute the point; another friend of mine offered her the money in my stead. She refused the money and had the owner throw me out.\n\n(3) My friend did not receive his coat after handing the bouncer his voucher. When he realized he did not have his coat, he was told that he would have to return at 3:15 to retrieve it after the club had closed. At the time, it was 1:20. When we pointed out to the bouncer that this meant freezing in the cold for two hours, he merely laughed and pointed at the space heaters, saying, \"That sucks for you.\"\n\n(4) After unsuccessfully attempting to get the coat, we walked away. As we left, the owner and bouncers clearly said to one another, \"Fucking French, they're so fucking cheap.\"\n\n(5) At 3:15, when we went to retrieve the coat, my friend saw the same coat check woman rummaging through the pockets. He immediately said, \"That's it! That's my coat!\" She responded, \"How do I know it's your coat?\" My friend said that he had a silver iPod nano in the pocket. The woman visibly removed the iPod, then told my friend, \"There's no iPod here.\" When he pointed out that it was in her hand, she looked embarrassed and handed it over. \n\nIn other words, the people that worked at this place were indescribably rude, unprofessional, and borderline criminal. I was physically assaulted, verbally abused, and my friend was almost robbed by the staff at this place. Do not go here. Ever.
