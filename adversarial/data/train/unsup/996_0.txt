Very entertaining show and Mat makes it interactive, engaging the audience by asking for volunteers to help him make his magic!  The show is about 90 minutes long, no intermission but he gets you engaged in everything he does and he has you saying \"oooo\"  and \"ahhhh\"  and \"wow how does he do that\" or \"that is amazing\".   A very entertaining show and well worth the tickets!  The theatre is rather intimate as we sat in the 3rd row in the front.
