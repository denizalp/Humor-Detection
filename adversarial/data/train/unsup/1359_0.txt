Still one of the best hotels and casinos in Las Vegas.  Can anyone imagine the Las Vegas strip without Caesars?  If you go to the other casinos out here, there's a little of Caesars that has been adopted into their casinos.  Just a bunch of biters out there. \n\nI don't get to Caesars too often anymore since I now live here, but was a regular when I wasn't local.  I love how Caesars didn't sell out with its looks, feel, and ambiance.  I still like the modern casinos that were built in the last 10 years, but Caesars is a staple in Las Vegas.  Overall, they can't be touched. \n\nThe only reason I would visit Caesars now is for the Forum Shops.  The Forum has stores within everyone's price range.  It's also a good break from the heat and gambling.  \n\nParking is easy at Caesars.  You can self park or valet to their Forum Shops or Casino.  I still prefer to valet when I visit Caesars.  I don't gamble much, but the gaming is still live with a lot of action on the weekends.  There's still ton of eats, shopping, and sightseeing in Caesars.  If you've done Caesars, you know what I'm talking about.  If you haven't, then it's time for you to pay a visit.\n\nPS: Caesar never lived here. I didn't think so either.
