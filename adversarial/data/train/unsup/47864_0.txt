It's been about ten years since I last visited.  It remains one of the best.  The friendly and prompt service is an important factor that makes this place great.  Their ability to prepare the steak exceeds expectations.  The numerous side dishes accent the entrees whether they are steak or seafood.  The homemade desserts are delicious.  I had talked the Cabin Club up to my wife and her reaction was that I under sold it!
