Love this place! Great quality; great prices; super friendly. I never really had a go-to place for alterations before. Now every time I am about to put an item of clothing back in the closet because it's too big or missing buttons or the lining is torn, I take it to the folks at Sun - a couple of days andâ€‹ a couple of dollars later I'm wearing my favourite stuff again!
