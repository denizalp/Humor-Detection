Another Coronado neighborhood gem.\n\nLove it here.  I'm currently finishing up my yoga tasting and can't wait to get back from vacation and throw myself in with a membership.  THe varied classes are amazing.  I think Meagan is my favorite instructor.  She has such a wonderful vibe, and she remembers your name.  For that matter, so does Rebecca (owner)!\n\nI've tried yoga and pilates over the past few years, and nothing has given me the workout SuTRA gives me.  The barre pilates class is a dream and skullpt is incredible.  By the end of any class, my body has been worked but I feel amazing!  Usually when I leave the gym I don't feel amazing, just beat.  SuTRA is such a great boost.\n\nAdditionally they have various activities going on at the studio.  They have local artist artwork displayed and a little reception on their own version of first fridays.  Yogavin is coming up, and I can't wait to try it.  They also have massage therapy which I'm itching to utilize because summer in Phoenix is rough and stresses me out.  \n\nBut if you come here, don't expect to do relaxing yoga, expect to sweat in the most amazing way possible :)
