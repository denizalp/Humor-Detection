We received a BOGO coupon for staying in the hotel so this was the first buffet we hit on our trip and it was just as good as I remembered it when I stayed at Treasure Island two decades ago. The pepper-crusted prime rib at dinner was so juicy and fatty and perfect that I went back for seconds, and my boyfriend was so impressed with the pasta bar that he instantly regretted filling up on pizza (which was also impressive). Best of all, there was no line! The only drawback was the Keno woman who lied about bringing back our keno cards, but the food is what counts so we will definitely return!
