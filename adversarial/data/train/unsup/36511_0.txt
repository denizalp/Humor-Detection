By far the worst experience I've ever had with any company. Changed the model of car 2 different times on us, then gave us a car missing hubcaps and scratched all up. DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY. I PROMISE YOU, LOOK AT 2 STAR FEEDBACK, THIS COMPANY IS HORRIBLE! To the business manager who responds to all the people giving 1 star, you dont even deserve to have customers. You don't deserve a single customer.
