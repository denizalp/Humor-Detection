This restaurant is beautiful AND so is the food!  I was with a Meetup group for lunch today.  Everyone ordered something different.  Every meal was beautifully plated.  I had the cabbage rolls.  The person across from me ordered the pot stickers with pork belly.  Someone else had pot stickers that had (what looked like) a mushroom gravy over them.  One woman had the sauerkraut soup.  She said it was delicious.\n\nI think the one disappointment was another member of the group ordered the duck kabobs and it came as a gyro--not what he expected, but he said it was good.\n\nSeveral people had the crepes for dessert.  I ordered the perogies with chocolate whipped cream.  All desserts were served on slate plates.\n\nService was sketchy, but the waitress was new and working our table of 8 by herself.  She really needed help.  In spite of this, I'm still rating this restaurant 5 stars.  I would definitely go back if I lived in the area.
