Kiry has been amazing, she knows what I like and always does a great job! I've been coming here for about a year now. It's very convenient to where I live. \n\nTina does my toes and is mindful of my sensitive toes. She does a deluxe pedi that is relaxing and leaves your feet very smooth. I got my toes done with white diamond which is gorgeous . I recommend that for a wedding or special occasions or to just dazzle your feet.
