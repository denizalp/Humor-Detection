Diane and I took advantage of a 2 for 1 deal to play miniature golf at the KISS indoor course during Yelp Spring Break, and had much fun on the short but challenging glow in the dark, 18-hole course.  KISS music played throughout and KISS figures were stationed all over the course.  The toughest hole was the 18th, where I learned it was better to accept extra strokes to move in for a straight shot up Gene Simmons' red metal tongue, because trying to get the ball into this hole at an angle simply will not work.\n\nAt the end of our play, for narrowly losing to me my wife was given a free pass for another 18 holes whenever she wants to come back.  It was cool inside on a very hot day.  The staff was very friendly.  The only problem we encountered is that the restrooms stank and a urinal was marked \"out of order.\"\n\nKeeping with Mr. Simmons' philosophy of licensing as many products as one can contemplate, much merchandise was available for sale.  I bought an orange KISS golf ball and a KISS refrigerator magnet after I mistook a KISS Kondom for KISS chocolate.  The condom was quickly restored to its bin, and once I found true KISS chocolate I didn't buy any, for it was being retailed for $2.50 a piece.  That's too much for what appears to be an unremarkable small piece of chocolate, albeit in a fancy wrapper.\n\nA solid 4-1\/2 stars overall!
