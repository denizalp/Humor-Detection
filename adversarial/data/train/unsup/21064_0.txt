While housesitting for my folks, their backdoor latch ceased working.  I cried, lit up fireworks, streaked and used the sewer grate as my toilet.  You don't want to know what I used the squirrels for.\n\nHaving located a neighbour whose lights were on, I knocked, borrowed a phone and contacted these folks.  The gent that answered said he would be about 30 minutes and he was about that long.  I pointed him to the lock, explained what had happened and he got to work.  He wasn't exactly friendly but got the work done.  \n\nAfter getting me in, he was paid and I was off frolicking in the house and talking to the cat.  It's only then that I decided I would start drinking.\n\nAll in all I'm happy with the efficiency though I think the driver should try smiling once in a while.  Maybe he just needs to talk with a cat.
