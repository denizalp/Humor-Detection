Paid around $41 including fees to see this show (Front row, far right aisle seats on a Thursday night). Entertaining. Funny. Good value. Impressive dancing. Stuntlike movements. Cool costumes. Worth the money. Great variety of music --These guys can dance to ANYTHING! It did get a little repetitive for me towards the end though but overall very enjoyable and would recommend it. \n\nIf you want to get picked for audience participation, opt for the main floor, center aisle seats, probably in the first 10 rows or so. Higher chances of getting selected to go onstage if you fall into one of the following: 1) \"you fancy huh?\" type female...high heels\/short dress\/hair done, nails done, everything done 2) dorky guy dressed in collared shirt, sweater vest and slacks 3) young, well dressed, good looking couple. Be on time, the audience participation segment is in the very beginning of the show.\n\nThere are actually 12 Jabbawockeez, but most of the acts only has 7 of em on stage at a time. They all took off their masks at the end except one guy.
