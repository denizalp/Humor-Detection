Due to the fact that they are taking your hard earned money, I'm sure they treated you well.  Just wait until you have to deal with them about a warrantied item.  I bet your feeling will change, just like mine.  They will find every fictitious reason why the item is not covered under the warranty.  I have been done wrong by these people twice now on different items.  I WOULD NOT recommend Dana Playground Equipment to anyone for anything.
