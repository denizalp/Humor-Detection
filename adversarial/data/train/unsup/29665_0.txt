My husband and I decided to visit this Red Robin ready for some burgers and football watching! The location was very busy (around 8:30 PM on a Saturday night) but we were seated within 5-10 minutes.\n\nOur server was friendly and helpful, and we were able to watch several football games on different TVs while we waited for our food. The only reason this review gets four stars instead of five is because we waited a pretty long time. When the food came out, I realized I had ordered the wrong burger entirely (my mistake!) and they immediately offered it to replace it for me for free. Thank you Red Robin!\n\nAnother thing I liked about this location is the little iPads at every table. You can either pay $1.99 to play trivia games throughout your meal (no thanks!) or pay right at the iPad by credit or debit card instead of waiting for your bill (yes please!). \n\nI'll visit again.
