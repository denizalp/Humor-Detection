After reading the good reviews from this place I finally decided to try their Pho. I ordered my usual house special pho that came with an assortment of meats. They had a large menu which made me tempt to try something new. My pho came on a serving tray covered in water. The teapot lid was broken (?) and my tea ran cold before I started eating. The soup was made with too much fish sauce, which I've never encountered before after visiting a number of Vietnamese restaurants. It was early in the morning and we came right when they opened so we were the first customers. Little did they know that I was with someone who understood what they were speaking loudly in Vietnamese and told me that they were trying to rush us to pay and leave a few minutes after we finished our meals!
