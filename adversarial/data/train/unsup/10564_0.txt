I was excited to try this place out, lots and lots of great reviews; the place is within the Golden Nugget and right across from the shark tank.\n\nWe had a reservation for a party of 14, and they were able to accommodate us, our server Denise was chatty and friendly, she asked where we were all from, it was an even split between California and Arizona. She even remembered most of our names, and she told us she was 63, man she didn't look it at all! Life has been kind to her.\n\nAfter glancing over the menu 1st thing that caught my eye, damn this place is pricy, for a bowl of spaghetti and sauce was 20 bucks, that stuff better be amazing!  Also on the table they brought out fresh sourdough bread and oil with spicy herbs, that was pretty tasty too, the bread was delish!\n\nSo after the sticker shock, I went with the Pollo Romano and small Caesar salda (additional 4.99 charge). The Caesar salad had crisp romaine lettuce, garlic croutons, a great tasting Caesar dressing and was blanketed in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. It was a great tasting salad,\n\nThe Pollo Romano, on the menu had great potential, it Romano-crusted chicken scaloppini with artichokes & Roma tomatoes in a white wine sauce served with penne sugo rosa for $19.99, I guess I should have really pay attention to the scaloppini part of the chicken, man my chicken was small, almost to the point of not being there, it was 2   pieces about the size of a half dollar and as thin as a sheet of paper, super small, piled on top a heaping mound of spinach with 1 artichoke heart cut in half propped to make the chicken appear bigger and to the side of this was a huge mound of pasta with minimal sauce, so very disappointed in my dinner, did it taste good, yea the 2 bites of chicken was great in flavor, the white wine sauce was thin and sparse, the mound of spinach felt like it was never ending, and the pasta was cooked all the way but was very dry. I do not feel this meal was worth the price. Everyone was under wowed by their meal, but had a great time enjoying everyone's company.\n\nSometimes you can't believe the hype of a place, and I feel this place falls in that category.
