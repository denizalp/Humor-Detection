Terrible. If I could give 0 stars I would. I placed an order from Vancouver for my friend who was not feeling well, she lives in Toronto. I thought I would give instabuggy a try - I placed my order and selected delivery for between 6-7pm EST. I put notes on the order for them to call my friend upon arrival. I asked her to stay at home so she could receive the care package. She never received a call, and didn't receive the items. I have emailed insta buggy 3 times, and have tried calling 3 times as well. Their voicemail can not hold any more messages. All three times were the same. I haven't received a reply to my emails. For a service that charged $20 for delivery - this is ridiculous.
