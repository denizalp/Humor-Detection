This place is pretty awesome. Honestly, I had no idea what a Cornish pasty was coming into this place and I was somewhat reluctant to enter until I was convinced to give it a try. I mean, a pasty is something like a calzone but with a flaky crust similar to a pot pie in texture. You then choose from their several selections of fillings and after not too long this wonderful breaded masterpiece arrives at your table. Pair the breaded deliciousness with a pretty good beer selection and a pseudo hipster vibe to get yourself a real unique winner for lunch\/dinner. \n\nLegit-\nUnique and delicious \nThe flavoring was near perfection\nFairly prompt \nGood beer menu \nFriendly staff \nInexpensive \nLots of parking \nNice decor inside \n\nMeh-\nNot the best location \nNot much curb appeal
