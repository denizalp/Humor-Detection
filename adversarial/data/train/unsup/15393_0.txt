This place is great for fast, cheap and very delicious indian food! I took one of their thalis and a potato filled samosa and they were both fantastic! They have a variety of curries to choose from and i took the lentil curry and butter chicken. Alongside the curries, there was a small salad and some naan. Everything was delicious--the naan was warm and soft, the curries were perfectly spiced and the samosa was crispy but I do wish they had given the samosa with some chutney. Aside from that, the meal was still very good and pretty cheap as well!
