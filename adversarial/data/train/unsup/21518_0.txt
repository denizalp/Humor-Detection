Blaze, why did it take me so long to find you when I only live 10 minutes away?\n\nI'll skip all the \"I came here for dinner one night\" nonsense and get straight to it. The concept is like a Subway, but for pizza. You order your crust and sauce first, then move down the line for cheese, meat and veggies. You pay for your meal, which comes out to be under $9 for a personal pizza that lasts 2 meals for most people. \n\nThe ingredients are always fresh. You can ask for more of whatever you want if they get skimpy with something. Like, who puts 3 basil leaves on a whole pizza? You better believe I asked for more. I've never had to wait long for our pizza to bake and have never had to fight for a table. Although I can imagine the cluster f**k during peak lunch and dinner times. \n\nThree small things I don't like about this place. One kid butchered my name when he wrote it on the paper lining. \"Mearie\" as he spelled it. Nice one guy even after I spelled it out for you. I don't like their ranch at all. Idk what it is, but it's absolutely disgusting. And their agua frescas taste like nothing. \n\nThey still get 5 stars from me because their pizzas are effing delicious!!!!!
