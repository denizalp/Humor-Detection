Last Friday ,I went to this Starbucks with my family.Most of the time,I like there.We feel relax with  tasty drinks.The staffs are nice too.But We found something make us feel disgusting.The huge amount of dusts are hanging on the pictures on the wall.Looks like it has been there since they open.\nThis isn't employee's fault.I could see the staffs are  cleaning. But the problem is no one check the wall.I hope they will add a wall for cleaning checklist.\n\nwe will visit there when they solve this problem.Because It isn't comfortable to drink with this environment.I mean come on, We want to enjoy the tasty drink there with family.\nI uploaded few photos of dusty pictures.Check it out.\n\nI hope owner can understand our feeling and will consider to do for more honest service.
