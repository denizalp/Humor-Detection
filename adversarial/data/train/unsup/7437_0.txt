This review is based on the $3.99 Lunch Special.\n\nThe New Caribbean Queen Jerk Drum has this island vibe and the island price to match. Lunch specials are served with homemade fruit juice and available 11 am to 4 pm Monday to Friday.\n\n$3.99 your choice of chicken and a drink? I would eat that every other day for lunch. Now the decision is Curry, Jerk, Fried or Stew?!\n\nChicken was tender, moist and well seasoned. Might it was cooked in a drum instead? But for that price, I am a happy camper!\n\nSkip the Dish drivers was busy doing their pick up during the 30 minute or so I was here on a weekday afternoon. https:\/\/www.skipthedishes.com\/the-new-caribbean-queen
