We went for dinner my fianc√© and another couple.  I am Mexican and I am a very picky eater but the enchiladas that I had were delicious! OMG they were so good!  I will definitely go there again! The food was full of flavor and I felt like I was at home.  Costumer service was friendly and very attentive.  Best Mexican food in town!
