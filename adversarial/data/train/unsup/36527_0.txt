I had originally given this gym an ok review on FB, but I don't know that it deserves it ( I am going to remove it) my family Signed up in Nov 2015, and I patiently waited for the swimming pool to open (suppose to open Feb 2016, but was delayed due to inspection and construction), got sick for a month and today finally got a chance to check out their pool to lap swim. EXTREMELY disappointed. Pool was too warm and murky. None of the inset pool lights were working, which would require draining the pool to repair. Lane markers were painted, and not tiled. Not all the lane separators were installed. The gross part though is another person was using the pool when arrived, didn't realize I was there, and this guy blew snot into his hands 3-4 times and then rubbed his hands all over the pool deck!!! The showers are gross too. One area drain for 6 showers, no water pressure and the hot water took 10 minutes to even get warm. I heard they are opening another location but they need to give this location some TLC. I was trying to be optimistic for a local owned gym, but very disappointed in this place. Pool rating should have negative stars, but I am giving it 1 star for variety of equipment, and another star for having batting cages and gymnastics, as most gyms don't have. The place needs better lighting, and an interior designer to give it a facelift. Also forewarn, while they provide child centric gym classes, be expected to run into a group of kids running around the upstairs if you try to use any of the exercise equipment.\n\nThey are taking FOUR days now to cancel my family's membership, quite disappointing. I'm still waiting for a cancellation confirmation. Bad customer service! Now they deserve no stars.
