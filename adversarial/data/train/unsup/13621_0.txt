Made of short rib, brisket, and ground chuck, Bar Code's burgers are served up 24\/7 and full of flavor. We came in on a Friday night around 8pm and Lisa promptly greeted us and gave us the lowdown on the menu. I started with the Jade Buddha drink, a refreshing citrus drink with Absolut citron and muddled kiwi and lime.  My burger choice was the Big BBQ Burger with applewood bacon, Vermont white cheddar cheese, and blueberry BBQ sauce: delicious!  The fries that accompanied the burger were tasty as well, but I didn't care for the sriracha ketchup, instead opting for the Heinz variety.  Service was attentive and I liked that the bar wasn't smoky or too noisy.  \nIf you're looking for a bar with great food, check out Bar Code soon.
