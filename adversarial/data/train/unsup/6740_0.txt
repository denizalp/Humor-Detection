I went here last night with my girlfriend.\n\nThe Staff:\n\nThe woman at the counter was clearly put off by the fact we chose to eat at their establishment. We came in without a \"hello\", or a \"welcome\", she walked up the counter and stood there staring at us silently, waiting for us to order. We had to look at the menu first, which took about 90 seconds, she was visibly annoyed. She took our order and money without a word, or even a smile. On the way out the door I even said \"thanks much\", and still she remained silent, instead looking up briefly with what I can only call contempt, as if she was doing me some favor. \n\nThe Food:\n\nI had the spaghetti and meatballs. The only way to describe it was sub-par. There was almost no sauce, and the meatballs tasted like they had been soaking in a Sun City hot tub since the time of biblical creation. The bread was burned, and not just a little, it was black on 3 of 4 sides. \n\nThe GF had the veggie pizza, and she said it was good. I didn't try it. \n\nConclusion:\n\nI won't be giving my money to them again. Reading through the other reviews, I have to agree with Joseph S. You can get better food for less money from people who are happy to have your business. \n\nIn all, the experience was so bad that it prompted me to write my first Yelp review, but I don't know, maybe I'm just a jerk!
