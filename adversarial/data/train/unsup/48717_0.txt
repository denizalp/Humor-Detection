I've always wanted to try out Stand Up Paddleboarding; super happy that I found a deal for a first timer lesson with supgirlz. With the summer ending, it was the perfect time to try it out. \n\nI booked our Friday evening lesson online with no issues. The lesson is based out of Kew Balmy Beach; we were instructed to meet by a park bench and our instructor showed up early to bring out the boards from a place nearby and to set up. The first-timer lesson started with basic verbal instruction on dry land, then we proceeded onto the water. After the quick on-water lesson, we had free time to play around on our own. \n\nThey also have sup yoga, socials, etc. Overall, a good place to try SUPing.
