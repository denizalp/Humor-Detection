WuTai is usually the first place that pops to mind when I am in the mood for vegetarian Chinese food. Given that it is associated with the Cham Shan Buddhist Temple, not only is the restaurant meat-free, the five pungent vegetables (onions, garlic, chives, green onions and leeks) are also excluded from the menu. Despite all these dietary restrictions, there is still quite an extensive (not to mention, delicious) menu.\n\nTonight, we opted to get the Dinner for Four ($88) and added on a Steamed Whole Eggplant with Black Bean Sauce ($19.99). The set dinner had seven different dishes plus dessert which was a steal given that there is an extra 10% off when you pay with cash.\n\nThe course of the night would have to be the Pumpkin and Corn Soup. The soup was thick and hearty and extremely flavourful. I loved that they had tulipbulbs in the soup which added a sweet milky flavour and a crisp texture. I thought it was a brilliant idea and will have to start incorporating those bulbs into my own soups at home!\n\nThe Marinated Tofu, Tofu Skin and Sweet and Sour Gluten is another favourite as is the Braised Mushrooms with Greens. The Avocado and Truffle Fried Rice is aromatic and filled with yummy goodness such as veggies and mushrooms. I was also really glad we added on the eggplant as it was cooked to a perfectly so that it was soft but not mushy. The blackbean sauce added to it was really tasty.\n\nI've always said, if all vegetarian food was as good as it is at WuTai, I could easily go meatless!
