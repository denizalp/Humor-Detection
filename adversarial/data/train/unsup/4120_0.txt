My 1st and last Mario Batali restaurant I will ever go to.  \n\nThis was probably the single most expensive meal I have ever spent on myself.  We ordered the Black Fettuccine and the Porterhouse for two.\nThe waiters did not offer us any seasoning (i.e. pepper), and we found the dish to be quite bland.\nThe Florentine porterhouse was the dish that drew us into this restaurant in the 1st place.  We have been to Florence and the best steak I think I have ever had was there at a restaurant called il' latini... Mario's steak was advertized to have been marinated with rosemary and olive oil, etc.\nWell when the steak finally came (after us sitting there for a heck of a long time) the waiters took the steak, cut if off the bone, and sliced it up. ..  at no point were we asked if the meat was done to our liking, when they set the plate down before me, I had to tell the waiter that I would like the steak brought up to temperature as rare was not how I ordered it.  (the 1st \" of the steak was well done, then the inside was rare) we had ordered it medium.\nThey then argued with me about what \"medium\" is before taking my plate to the kitchen to either toss in the over or microwave.\nMy wife was so dissatisfied with the meal she actually filled out the comment card.
