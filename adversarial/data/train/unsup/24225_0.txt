We've been here twice. The first time it had only been open about 2 weeks and was really good, the second time was about a week ago and was awesome. I'll be focusing on the second trip because we were able to try more items off the menu.\n\nWe sat at the bar in the back while waiting for a table. While we were waiting we ordered the squiggle nutz which come in a chocolate dipped bacon covered waffle cone* and chicken and waffles* to start. I also had an oatmeal stout which I thought was very good. It reminded me of Left Hand Milk stout more than any oatmeal stouts I can think of but it may be because the nitrogen smoothes it out so much and most oatmeal stouts I've had were from bottles.\n\nOnce we were seated we ordered Torched Diablos, Steak and Papaya Martini, Beer Cheese*, Bruschetta Pizza and a couple of burgers. All were very good. I especially liked the beer cheese which was a little thinner than I expected but, that could have been partially because it was somewhere around eleventy billion degrees when delivered to the table. Even after a hot pockets level burn to the roof of my mouth I enjoyed it. I also had a dubbel and red ale with dinner which I thought were also pretty good.\n\nSo, there's my review. Now please don't go here because I plan to go back a lot and I don't like waiting for tables. \n\n*Warning: there may also be angel tears or crack in these dishes because holy shit they were really really good. Please avoid if you have angel tear or crack allergies.
