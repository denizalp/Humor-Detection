Employees with attitude. A forgotten order that was then rushed through. Food that was undercooked and unappealing. Told it would be 10 minutes. Found the absent management after 22 minutes. Pointed out to them that 22 was significantly more than 10. If you only have one machine then you probably shouldn't make promises you can't keep. Heard an employee make a rude comment about the  22 minute wait. Avoid, avoid, avoid.
