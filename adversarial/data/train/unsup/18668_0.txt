Really surprisingly good! When someone says \"burgers and sushi\" it doesn't instill confidence that either will be good. Well, they were both amazing! The wife got  salmon sushi which she said was some of the best she's ever had. She loved the strips of ginger that accompanied it. \n Due to my seafood allergy, I had a bacon burger that was big, juicy and cooked perfectly. The fries were twisted potato slices that were golden, crisp and delicious.
