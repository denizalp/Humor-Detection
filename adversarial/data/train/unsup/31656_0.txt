We've been here a couple of times and the poor service does not disappoint.  I'm not sure if they're understaffed or the staff has tables inside and out that causes them to be so slow but both times the service has been painful.  The food is average at best, bar food and not good enough for us to come back.\nThe bar itself seems like it could be great.  They need a lot of improvement to beat the competition that's right next door!
