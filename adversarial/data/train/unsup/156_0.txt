**This is a small movie theater so don't expect to find all the regular movies here!** Luckily they were showing Rogue One here so I didn't have to drive all the way to Galaxy! But remember to buy your tickets online and early so you have a better chance with seating! Unfortunately me and my hubby just winged and there was literally nothing but the VERY front row (which my husband was willing to do and I was like HELL EFFING NO. And you'll understand why once you actually get into the theater because the seats are pretty much touching the big screen!) but we ended up just catching the next showing. \n\nThere is a nice waiting area with a full bar, concession stand, tables and chairs and a couch in the middle. The actual theater itself was very clean and I wish I had brought a blanket, because seats are really comfy. I even saw a few people wearing onesies haha. All the seats are recliners and have moveable tray tables attached on each side. They are also nicely spaced out so you don't feel crammed at all even with a full theater.\n\nOverall, if they have the movie you wanna see here I recommend trying this place out because you really do feel more comfortable here compared to the regular cinemas!
