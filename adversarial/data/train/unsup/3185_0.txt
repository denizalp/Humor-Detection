Went to Mor furniture to look at furniture and wound up buying furniture instead. Tim greeted me with the utmost professionalism and respect. Not once did I feel any pressure to buy anything but he actually found exactly what I was looking for.  I will recommend all my friends and family to shop at Mor furniture. Thank you Tim for a wonderful pressure free experience
