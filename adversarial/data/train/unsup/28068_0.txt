Came here for happy hour: the flatbread and wine we had were reasonably priced and very tasty. Great to find a spot with high quality wines at reasonable prices. Service was impeccable: our waiter was attentive, but also was attuned to the tone of our conversation and found appropriate times to interrupt. Sad to lose Players, but will definitely return to Sarita!
