My girlfriend and I had a good first experience here a few weeks ago but after going tonight, we will not be back.\n\nWe walked in tonight and the lady ringing us up had a horrible attitude for no reason. We asked a couple questions about the menu and we got one word answers and a glaring stare.\n\nShe made us feel really uncomfortable and unwelcomed in the restaurant almost as if she didn't want us there.\n\nKind words to the business owner, have a sit down with your cashier and tell her to find another job if she does not want to represent the front of your restaurant in an appropriate way.\n\nAll it takes is one bad experience for a customer to not bring you their business again, and that's all it took in this case.\n\nI'll opt for Chipotle next time as I know exactly what in getting every time I walk into one of their restaurants
