What a great Sashimi place. Lots of traffic usually means a good business. To-go orders and dining in. People waiting outside on a Sunday evening.\n\nI ordered the signature Sashimi Napoleon and was a little unclear on how the fried wonton was combined. They use it like a chalupa tortilla to stack the sashimi. Wonton, four thin slices of sashimi, wonton, four more slices, and so on. Great combination. I like a little crunchy with my sashimi and the fried wonton stayed crispy down to the last bite.\n\nI could have made a meal of of the bacon-wrapped scallop yakatori appetizers. Mmmmm!\n\nI didn't try any sushi but I was sitting at the bar watching them prepare them and their rolls looked great too. The chefs really packed them tight and all of the ingredients were fresh.
