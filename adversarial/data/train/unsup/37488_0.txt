Went for breakfast on a Thursday.  We were staying at the Mirage, so I figured we might as well try their buffet at least once.  While it was decent, we probably could have gotten a better breakfast somewhere else for the $18.99 per person we spent at Cravings.\n\nNice thing was it wasn't crowded.  Only two people ahead of us in line, so we got seated really quickly and off to the buffet we went.  Lots of the traditional offerings, but none of them great.  Bacon was okay, sausage was bad, hash browns pretty tasteless, eggs benedict got points for eggs with yolks that were actually runny, but points off for being otherwise bland.  Breakfast burritos tasted decent, but had been sitting out in the warmer tray way too long.  Ham carving was outstanding the first time - moist and flavorful.  So good I went back for a second piece, which this time was dry, tough, and lacking in taste.  Smoked salmon was pretty good, but with about 20 minutes to go before lunch, they had taken all the bagels away.  Scrambled eggs were disgusting - definitely powdered, and swimming in water.  The lady got an omelet and said it was good, but the line was just too long for me to make an attempt.\n\nBeverage selection was decent, and the coffee was good.  I wasn't sure if beer and wine were included for breakfast, and wondered who would drink at breakfast anyway.  Then I saw someone from the table across from us come back with two beers and announce that they were free.  Immediately, the rest of the party gets up and comes back, each with two beers of their own.  I forgot - this is Vegas!
