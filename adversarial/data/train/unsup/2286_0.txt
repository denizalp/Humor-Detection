Should have listened to the bad reviews but NO.  I had to find out for myself.  Talked to an attorney with the personality of a dead fish.  He was not very helpful nor was he nice about it and he really didnt care which is why I am writing this review :-)  He said your case is not one we would take and when I asked why he dodged the question so I asked him 4 more times but he continued to dodge the question.  He gave me a # to a referral service.  You pay $40 bucks and they refer you but I can pick up the phone for free so thanks for the help.
