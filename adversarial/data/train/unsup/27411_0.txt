I've had Indian food three times in my life. All three were awful experiences and I swore it off.  I do like chicken vindaloo and had a hankering for it tonight.  So I gave this place a shot. It has redeemed Indian food as a whole! The chicken vindaloo was amazing.   Also had the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka Masala, raita, and paneer pakora.  The only thing I didn't like was the pakora. Everything was great! Oh and the garlic naan.   Make sure to order two!
