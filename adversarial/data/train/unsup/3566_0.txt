I could've sworn I wrote about this place already...It's one of my fav Chinese spots in town.\n\nI was very wary coming here because it was deserted. I actually thought they were closed the first time. The crazy part is that the dining room is pretty big but don't be surprised if you are the only one there. Normally this is a very bad sign that the restaurant is awful but I took my chances and I'm glad I did.\n\nThey have some off the wall plates and I was in a daring mood so I decided to try the Bird's Nest. Sounds crazy but it's just seafood and veggies in a chow-mein-ish bowl. The chow-mein\/noodle is made into a dried cracker bowl and the seafood just sits inside it. Just in case this was a bust we ordered a \"safe\" dish in orange chicken.\n\nThe food was amazing. The Bird's Nest was very enjoyable and fun to eat! The bowl soaks in the seafood juicies and the crunchy bite into the chow-mein is so satisfying. The orange chicken tastes really good but not over the top with flavors. They give you a ton of rice + hot tea so I really enjoyed the service.\n\nI don't know how they stay in business when they are empty all the time. I've been there three times now and the most I've seen is 1 table besides us. I've been thinking...Perhaps this is a secret hideout for the local Chinese gang and there is a basement beneath the kitchen where the mob players poker, sip on tsing tao and plot their next big heist. The whole restaurant is just a front for their scheme. Hmm, maybe but I could care less. HA! I will be returning in the near future.
