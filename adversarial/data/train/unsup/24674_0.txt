This is a very nice and clean coffee bean & tea leaf store,the staff was friendly and helpful, this one has a fire pit in the patio,a drive thru,and you can customized your drinks,we had Cinnamon rolls which they warm them up for us and was given to us in real plates with plastic fork and knife,she had some kind of tea (forgot the name) that was good I just had some naked OJ. will return when back in the area.
