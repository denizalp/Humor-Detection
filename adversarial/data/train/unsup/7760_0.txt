I took a business lunch at Sushi Too.  How adult does that sound?  \"Business lunch.\"  Man, I'm a cool graduate student.\n\nDisclaimer:  I have NO IDEA what this place's hours are.  Yelp shows that they close in between meals, but we lunched straight through from lunch to dinner.  I'm sorry if they do close, but Yelp needs to see if the hours listed are correct.\n\nService was great and continued to check on us throughout our four hour meeting.  Some of the reviews were lackluster so I played it safe and stuck to Chicken Lo Mein ($15).  It was not memorable, and fairly small for the price.  But there was nothing wrong with the meal, making it an A-Ok.\n\nWould I be opposed to coming back?  No.  I just think there are other more exciting options in the area.
