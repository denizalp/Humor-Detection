Wow! Super impressed with this restaurant! I chose it because it had a lot of gluten free options for my mom, but would recommend it to anyone and will definitely be back in the future! The lemon chicken was probably the best chicken I've literally ever eaten. Arepas were outstanding. Truly fantastic food!
