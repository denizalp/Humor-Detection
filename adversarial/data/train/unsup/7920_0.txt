Vietnamese cuisine brings fondness to my heart and stomach. The delicious, home cooked dishes, combines all flavors to my palette. Mixtures of spicy, sweet, sour, and salty within each bite epitomize authentic Vietnamese food. During my latest adventure, my perpetual hunger led my friends and me towards Saigon House. \n\nArriving in the midst of a cold, winter night, my friends and me were greeted by a waiter. We sat at a table booth. The d√©cor was simple, as the floors and walls were covered with white tiles. The sauce and eating utensils were placed at the end of the table. The chairs were averagely comfortable. Despite the basic design, the focal point was the food.\n\nPerusing the menu, I decided to order the Chicken Pad Thai. I seldom order Thai cuisine at a Vietnamese restaurant, yet I was compelled to branch into new flavors. My friends decided upon Bun Bo Hue and Pho. \n\nEach dish arrived steaming hot. The Pho, to my surprise, arrived quickly. My friend said the pho was delicious. The noodles were perfect texture and consistency. The soup was brewed perfectly, infusing the noodles and beef. \n\nThe Bun Bo Hue arrived next and my friend quickly indulged in the spicy noodle soup. The noodles infused the flavors of the soup perfectly. The broth was brewed with perfect seasoning and spices.\n\nThe Chicken Pad Thai was disappointing. The sauce, which covered the noodles and chicken, was too sweet. Adding chili sauce balanced the flavors. The chicken itself was bland and did not infuse any flavors of the sauce. \n\nMy journey towards food greatness at Saigon House was disappointing. The Pad Thai, was too sweet, and lacked any innovation or creativity. Despite my disappointment, my overall rating is 4 out of 5 stars (my friends experience included in rating albeit less weight factor. And my past experiences were amazing). If hunger strikes, venture forth, and bestow your hunger with amazing food.
