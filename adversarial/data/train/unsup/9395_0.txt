Hands down the WORST night club (or whatever you want to call it) that I have been to. I actually went way back in April, but didn't remember that I wanted to review it until recently.  Tank Tops, flip flops and \"Don't Stop Believing\" is not my idea of a good time! Don't make it to Charlotte that often but Will NEVER go back to this place and would NEVER recommend it to anyone else!
