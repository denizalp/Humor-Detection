After my bad experience at the Kohl's on McKellips, I returned my blouse to this Kohl's in hopes of a new experience! I drove way out of my way just to avoid what I endured before.  I was pleasantly surprised at the great choices they had and huge inventory. I was a little shaken when o went to customer service and there were police there and a hysterical customer. Yelling that she had been treated wrong and they wouldnt return her item.  You could see the stress in the faces of the employees. They shuffled me in and out with my return no problem.  As I was leaving to look at other clothing, an employee named Shelly came up to me and asked if she could help find a replacement blouse and wanted to make sure I was ok from the experience in customer service.  I was very impressed with her.  She was young, yet she knew how to treat a customer.  I was very grateful I was able to see the difference in both locations.  Thanks Kohl's on Baseline and Shelly for following up like a champ! I will gladly drive out of my way to this store from now on!
