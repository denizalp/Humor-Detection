every time i have been to the Rose and Crown it was a quick in and out..kinda like risky sex.\n\nthe last two visits i was able to experiance this place for more then a quicky and i have to say..i kinda like it. \n\nPros, awesome french dip slider sandwich thingy, Fish and Chips (everyone knows i hate fish, but this was tasty) average beer selection, outside Patio and wrap around seating area.\n\nCons, bathrooms..umm no beuno. specially after a guy dumped a duece..i was forced to breath ass air and it was not a good experiance. another Con is the somewhat inexperiance bar staff. if i ask for a Beamish..i expect the first person to tell me \"no we don't have it\" not the third person. size..it's kinda cramped on a busy night, and not enough room around the pool table.\n\ni would have give 4 stars, but the cons kinda outweighed the pros.\nspecially since my nose hairs are still curled from the experiance. but i doubt that is a every day occurance..
