Orange bang, the reason I was ok with being subjected to their shit show of an ordering process & limited menu, has disappointed me. The drink is no longer sweet, thick, & creamy; on Sunday, it was literally a watered down version of its former self. No taste, no sweetness, no deliciousness. WTF happened there?! \n\nI finally ordered something other than fries -- cheese quesadillas. For $2, two strips of flavorful cheese is browned on ONE corn tortilla & folded over. I basically got a cheese taco (that sounds horribly wrong :-\/) Aren't quesadillas, especially ones using small corn tortillas, usually made with two tortillas? I guess not here. \n\nDowngraded to 2 stars because I don't like being jipped.
