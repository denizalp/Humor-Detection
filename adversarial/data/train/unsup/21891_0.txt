We stayed here for a few nights for a conference. Got a Mediterranean Suite to share with 3 others. It was pretty nice.! Two separate king bedroom, living room, dining room and an outdoor patio with a fireplace. It was a great room! \nThe people there were all very friendly and helpful. \nThey had a great outdoor pool with a San box for the kids. Actually, this place seemed like a very family-friendly resort and casino.
