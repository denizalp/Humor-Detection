I have been coming to this bakery for 30 years.  I can't say that one thing is good, because EVERYTHING is delicious.  The breads, the sweets, EVERYTHING.  If you have not been there you should go.  If you go hungry believe me you will come out with a lot of delicious items.  Reasonably priced as well.
