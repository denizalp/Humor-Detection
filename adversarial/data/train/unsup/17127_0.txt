We were smashed.  So, take this with a grain of salt.  The food was very very good.  Service was very very good.   I don't know how much the alcohol played into all of this.   I know we were obnoxious, we showed up before they closed, we were loud and demanding.\n\nBut the food was very good.   I'd go back next time I'm in Vegas - sober - and see if this review still holds true
