Met up with Mr Kent P and Michelle to check out this new spot and grab a quick bite to eat before a film. \n\nSeeing that I was already late for dinner, I ordered hastily something I thought would be quick (gourmet mac and cheese) and would arrive at the same time as the others.  It took more than 45 minutes for my party's food to arrive, and then nearly another 15 minutes for mine to arrive - Wait staff guaranteed it was coming in less than 3 minutes. Unfortunately, their slow pace made me so late for the movie, \"Bridesmaids,\" I opted not to go. Of the movies I wanted to see this year in theatres, Bridesmaids was probably #1.\n\nEither way, it was a really long wait for a restaurant that had about 10 patrons. The gourmet mac and cheese was absolutely delicious but so rich I could only eat a quarter of it. It would have been better suited as a side to some chicken or something. Also, their tardiness might have been excusable if they prepared the noodles from scratch, boiled them, and then added the cheese, but I think they just warmed up a cold plate of mac and cheese (to be expected).\n\nThanks Mugshot Tavern but you ruined my only chance to see Bridesmaids in the theaters, now what am I to do? WHAT AM I TO DO!!
