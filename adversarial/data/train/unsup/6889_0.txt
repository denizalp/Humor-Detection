My husband has been coming here for a while now and I have had the pleasure in accompanying him at his last 2 visits. We came on a weekend and they were busy but that's always a good sign. He put his name on a list and was called no more than 10 minutes after we sat down. A lady (don't know her name) cut his hair and also shaved his face. She did an wonderful job and really paid close attention to detail in both his haircut and with his shave.\n\nThe other barbers were so friendly not to mention funny. They offered everyone waiting a bottled water since it was so hot out. We will definitely continue coming here! The atmosphere puts the icing on the cake!
