Local family owned business (husband and wife) that anyone with AC issues should use.  Our AC stopped working in the middle of the night.  My husband woke up because he was hot and starting to investigate.  Having been in the AC business in New England before retiring and moving to Las Vegas he knew there was a problem and that it was with the air handler in the ceiling.  We have 3 dogs and my elderly father living here, AC is a must.  I started calling companies at 1:30 am that claimed to have 24 hour emergency service.  None of the big companies had availability before 8 am.  I found MD Air Heating and Cooling on YELP with great reviews and took the chance.  It was just about 2 am and to my surprise and delight a real person answered the phone and that real person was the owner of the company. I explained my issue after apologizing for calling in the middle of the night and he graciously agreed to be here by 7 am.  They arrived at 6:30 am, identified the problem in less than 5 minutes and replaced the bad part.  All-in-all they were only here for maybe 30 mins.  One of the best aspects was how nice they were and how clean and organized their work van was.  You are crazy if you don't use them for your needs.  WE ARE COOL AND HAPPY CAMPERS!!  Thank you James and Robin!
