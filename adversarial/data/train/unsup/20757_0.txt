Show me the meat! \n\nThis is where you need to go in Vegas to get all of your carnivorous cravings satisfied. Yeah, it's a little off the beaten path, but follow Google Maps and you should be A-OK. Don't let the exterior fool you, either, 'cause this place is legit.\n\nWalk inside and you'll be handed a menu and will most likely have to wait in a short line to give your order. Or call ahead and they'll have packaged and ready to go for you. It's basically a giant meat locker with a friendly staff behind a counter ready to chop, grind or whatever else you need them to do to your meat. \n\nSo many choices, too! We got several things, but what sticks out in my mind was the sweet sausage. Yeah, I said it: sweet sausage. Make all the jokes you want, 'cause I don't care. It was tasty.
