Yum Cha is a new dim sum restaurant across from International Marketplace. I came across Yum Cha on Yelp in the Hot & New category. So I decided to try it out with my dim sum-crazed friend, who had introduced me to every other decent dim sum restaurant in Las Vegas. \n\nUpon walking in, it was pretty late in the afternoon and the dim sum carts had ended at 2pm. After a few minutes of waiting (and they weren't busy at all), we were seated and chose our selection of dim sum from the glass display. \n\nOur orders:\nThree orders of har gow\nThree orders of cheung fun\nOne order of Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce\nTotal price: $29\n\nThe FOOD took some time to come out, but came hot and good sized portions. The shrimp in our dishes were plentiful and filled us up. The SERVICE from the woman serving us was very nice and went out of her way to offer extra toppings for our dim sum and kept our waters filled. Overall, I think Yum Cha is one of the better restaurants that have filled this space which seems to have a history with high turnover. \n\nAt the end of our meal, the woman (maybe owner?) gave us a description of each dessert and I almost laughed because it felt like home when your mom makes you eat a lot of food. But in a good way. So, welcoming space and hopefully next time we'll come in to try the regular entrees for dinner.
