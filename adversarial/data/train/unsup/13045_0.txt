What a cool concept! Hubby had actually told me about this place, sound so cool, and it was around my birthday I got to try the place with another Yelper and good friend Stefany. She and I got there and the staff was so nice and attentive to us. Was a nice change, but I know since most of the place is all on the revolving track or robotic car that brings you stuff they do mostly drinks, refills and picking up lids because you keep your plates til the end. \n\nThe track of sushi has a good range of sushi being offered from appetizers like endamame to desserts like tiramisu. The range of rolls is good, very fresh and quite a diverse bunch. One of my favorites is the little sushi tacos, salmon is always a favorite of mine and to have it as a little taco was yummy. Each small plate is $2.50 ea. Prices vary on menu items from a tablet style on each table. I just stuck with the little plates got to try more that way. Instead of being stuck with a whole roll of the same kind it's 4 pieces which was nice and not to filling. \n\nStefany and I definitely finished off a good pile of plates but enjoyed everything we had. The staff, sushi and ambience definitely wanted me to go back.
