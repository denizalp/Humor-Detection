Waited a few months before coming near this place as the initial lines were hours. Finally had a chance to come here for lunch on a weekday (got here just shy of 11:30AM opening - picked up a buzzer) and had no wait time! The restaurant is huge with plenty of seating inside and on the patio.. but it did fill up pretty quickly (no real wait though - which was good).\n\nAs usual, served with fresh warm bread and butter to start.\n\nWe ordered the Chicken and Avocado Salad (lunch size ~$16?), Portobello Mushroom Burger ($18) and the Pasta Da Vinci (lunch size ~$16?). The portion of the salad did seem a little bit smaller compared to American portion, but delicious nonetheless and the Pasta Da Vinci lacked a little bit of flavour compared to the many times I've had it in the States.. not sure if this was a one-off or what.\n\nFinished off with a piece of Celebration Cheesecake ($10) which was delicious! Pricing is more or less the same as in the States - not bad!\n\nService was great, food did take a little time but that's normal.\n\nOverall, would definitely come back if there was no wait.
