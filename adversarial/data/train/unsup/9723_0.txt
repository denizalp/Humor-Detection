Really enjoyed this show!  \n\nDon't expect her to sing or for you to see her face--for some reason (perhaps b\/c she's not singing live) there's no jumbotrons for you to get close ups.  Show is exactly an hour and a half long, so it's perfect for still 'going out' afterwards. Ticket prices on Ticketmaster were reasonable, we paid $112 but like 3 months in advance; however,  on the day of the show they skyrocketed to almost $600 each.\n\nGreat way to start your night in Vegas especially if it's a 'girls trip'. She also redid some of her old songs to new melodies and they were pretty incredible.
