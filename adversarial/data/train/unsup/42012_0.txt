Hub and I went here for dinner because we had bid on an auction that included a gift certificate to Waverlys.\nWe entered promptly at 5 PM for we had a show later at the Southpoint.\nHub and I ordered a bottle of MoÃ«t to start.  Our server Derrick was spectacular and brought the bottle over to start us off.\nThey also delivered a bread basket that had the best lavosh I think I have had in Vegas.\nWe did not order apps, for we do not normally eat large portions so we went straight to the main course and both ordered 8oz Filets, mine medium rare and hub straight medium.\nThe steaks arrived and they were Excellent!  Perfectly cooked and just full of flavor.....how in the world do they get that great flavor?\nWe both had mashed potatoes that were not saturated with butter.  You could actually taste the potato....and they were delicious!\nManager Todd came by and asked about our meal.   I immediately let him know how pleased we were.   I think it is particularly nice when a manager does this, but you can tell he really has his heart in it when he speaks with customers!\nWe finished off with a small taste of Port that finished an absolutely wonderful meal.\nThis place is GREAT.....find a way to get here.....just a beautiful experience with beautiful food!
