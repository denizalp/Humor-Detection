Not a fan.\n We stopped here randomly. The service was terrible, our waiter was pushy and wouldn't help us with questions. We never got water, but they did give us tea. My Mixed vegetable chow mein was ok, but the veggies were very bland. They were out of the pork dish my friend ordered. Also, when my friend asked for sweet and sour sauce and the waiter said they didn't have any. Then we asked someone else and they brought it. \nThe staff (managers i'm assuming) were sitting near us talking very loudly the WHOLE time. Annoying. \nFinally we got our check it was completely in Chinese(I think) the only thing we could understand were the numbers. They even had some weird math going on, but we just said screw, paid and left. Not going back. \n\nMoral of the story: there are a million other places to go in a .5 mile radius. Choose somewhere else.
