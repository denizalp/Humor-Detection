We ordered a pizza at BOGO tonight as we have many times, but we had a pretty bad experience.  First, the order was incorrect.  We'll give them a break on that because my wife thinks he may not have repeated it back to her correctly and she didn't catch that.  That said, the guy behind the counter (TGBTC) didn't offer to re-make the pizza.  We didn't much care because we were coming home from a trip and just wanted to get back to the house.  WE also ordered a salad.  It was as bad as can be.  When I opened it, the tomatoes were so old they were nothing but mush and water.  The lettuce was worse.  It was easily a couple of days old.  These things happen and we understand, but when my wife called to lodge a complaint, mostly so they don't serve any more of these to anyone else, TGBTC argued with her that the salad was made today and therefore was fine.  I decided to bring it up to him so that he'd understand that he was selling some pretty nasty stuff.  When I showed it to him, he agreed that it didn't look, but insisted that it was made today and therefore was fine.  He then changed his story to \"it was supposed to be made today\".  I was able to get him to grudgingly refund my $5.  Sorry guy behind the counter, I know my wife said we wouldn't write a negative Yelp review, but you blew your opportunity to make things right with us.
