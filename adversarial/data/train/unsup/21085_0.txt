If pigging out at casino buffets is wrong, I don't wanna be right. My favorite casino in the area, there is a really good buffet called Wandering Horse, a swanky lil piano bar, and of course, the pool club. Fun for all ages, and great for out of town visitors.  I literally had to pry my parents away from the penny slots- they just love it here. \nJust a couple of downfalls.  I have recently attempted to come for the breakfast buffet, but to my dismay, it ends at 1030am, and I came right around 10:37, so I was out of luck... TWICE! Grrrrrr.... Also,  the crowd can be a bit iffy sometimes. Other than that, It's all good!
