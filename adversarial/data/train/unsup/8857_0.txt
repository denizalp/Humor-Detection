After reading other yelp reviews of this restaurant, I just had to check it out.\nMy friend and I went for lunch the other day and were VERY pleased with the food and service.  We shared the prosciutto pizza and mozzarella, tomato and basil salad.  WOW, soo delicious!  The pizza was soo fresh and the crust was amazing, very light, almost flaky.  We were stuffed when we left, vowing to return!!
