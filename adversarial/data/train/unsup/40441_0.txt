Amazing. On time. Fast. Went out of their way to accommodate my busy schedule and squeezed me in last min when another carpet cleaner had cancelled on me right before I needed to move out of my condo. Whatever they did to my carpet was magic. Seriously looked brand new. Won't be using any other carpet service in the area besides Carpet Monkey. Really kind folks too.
