This place opened up about a year before I left Vegas and I didn't get to try it before I moved.  So on our most recent visit, we decided to stop by and give it a try.  When you walk in, you have to \"check-in\" with a nurse.  She explains that you have to put on a hospital gown to eat, no exceptions.  It was kind of cheesy, but we decided to go through with it.  We put the gown on and got seated.\n\nThe place is unapologetic about the calories, fat content, and \"unhealthiness\" of their food....I love it.  It's decorated with items that pay homage to the Burger and fast food in general.  Great atmosphere!\n\nAfter browsing the menu, we decided to order:\n\nSingle Bypass Burger w\/Chili, $8.33 w\/Bacon add $.92\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=uj3i3yx8JLKs3lPRgX-DPg#uj3i3yx8JLKs3lPRgX-DPg\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=QQIixogPUXOCtbBApuY8uA#QQIixogPUXOCtbBApuY8uA\n\nDouble Bypass Burger w\/Chili, $10.18 w\/Fries add $1.85\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=iMGyagPk5P5CEFeL-i2MTg#iMGyagPk5P5CEFeL-i2MTg\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=d9VovEyM0XKeZtaXLsxx-g#d9VovEyM0XKeZtaXLsxx-g\n\n24 oz Old English 800, $4.62\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA#XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food, we saw some people getting spanked really hard with a paddle by their nurse server....what the heck is going here?  We soon discovered that if you didn't finish your food, you'd get spanked really hard by your nurse....LOL!  You can't make this stuff up!\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=cUc5xHa4bttx2mE06C8WAg#cUc5xHa4bttx2mE06C8WAg\n\nPeople were getting spanked like crazy throughout dinner....some people did it just so they could get pictures taken and posted on social media.  In case you don't have a social media account, they have a camera that takes your pic while getting spanked and posts it on their account for you...genius marketing tool.\n\nAfter a short wait, we got our food order.  The 24 oz can of Old E came in a paper bag that says \"Feeling Ghetto?\"....LMAO, yep I sure did.  Hilarious.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA#XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA\n\nI bit into my Double Bypass Burger....it was very good.  The Chili reminded me of Tommy Burgers back in LA....the Burger is large and heavy....but very tasty.  The Fries are large Steak-Cut Fries....also very good.  This thing had to be a ton of calories....but it was worth it!\n\nWe both finished our meals because we didn't want to get spanked.  It was a lot of fun and I would recommend trying it at least once.\n\nReturn Factor - 85%
