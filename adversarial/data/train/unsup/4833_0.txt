Two words: pad thai.\n\nTwo more words: secret patio.\n\nA bunch more words: the Queen Mother is a gem.  The decor, atmosphere, service and food are all awesome.  Honestly if you go here and don't have the pad thai, I am going to hunt you down and kill you.  I kid, I kid - but it's that good.  Not sure what they make the sauce out of, but I think it flips the same switch in your brain that makes crack addicts so addicted.\n\nAnd for dessert, a fine selection of Dufflet cakes will make you fat - and sassy.\n\nOh and did I mention secret summertime patio?  Accessible only by an underground passageway, you'll feel as if you're going through Fred Penner's hollowed-out tree and arriving in Mr. Rogers' fantasyland, except with better service & food and fewer hand puppets.  Surrounded by trellis'd foliage and flowers, it's a great place for an afternoon drink.  In the evenings the patio lanterns come on and the ambiance is exquisite - perfect for a post-movie dinner with your love.\n\nHighly recommended!
