OoooWeee!  If you're not following me on SnapChat (CaliChiVgs) then you are missing some epic moments. The beauty of having younger family members is that they teach the OLD i.e. ME how to use social media the right way.\n\nI'm not saying I'm past my prime, but ,,,you know what nevermind, TMI :-) I'm 27yrs old, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.  Anyway, this place stays CHARGED UP all night.  Beer pong tables sit on the perimeter of the bar, tables in the center of the bar (craps, cards, roulette, etc) stage for band and\/or DJ depending on the evening.  \n\nFYI: UNLESS NOTED PATRONS ARE NOT ALLOWED ON THE STAGE!  They will politely escort yo' a$$ off the stage and if your dunk a$$ gets back on stage you will be escorted out of the bar.  I've witnessed it, it is very funny.  Yes, I'm that one that will laugh at you, don't be that person.\n\nback to the review...\n\nDrinks are reasonably priced, 16oz. draft $6, bottle $8 depending on brand, cocktails $8-$11.  I guess specific night it was CALI Night or something, OMG the DJ was so on point.  It was so good, I never got off of the dance floor.  The DJ played to the crowd and he even dropped in some SWEET HOME ALABAMA, yes he did!  It was so much fun, I kept saying to my friend... \"ok, when he play a bad song we'll go get drinks\"  HA! that never happened, Tricia left my as$$ on the floor, I didn't even know she went to the bar until she came back and handed me a drink.  The is the ULTIMATE sign of a great DJ, I wish I remembered his name...I'm sorry Mr. DJ, I'll get your name the next time I see you.\n\nAs for the drinks:  Nice pour on the cocktails, you can actually taste the alcohol in your drink.  If you ordered a vodka\/cran you get and TASTE the VODKA and cran.  Not the other way around, lots of juice no alcohol.\n\nThis place is for all ages, the night we were there a variety of people all shapes, colors and ages.  When the crowd mingles well, it makes for an awesome night.  That is the kind of vibe that O'Sheas give, but this is just my opinion, go check them out!
