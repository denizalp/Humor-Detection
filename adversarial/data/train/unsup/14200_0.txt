We really enjoyed Nosh. It is great to have a nice, new restaurant so close to home.  We LOVED the atmosphere - a smallish lounge area with really pretty high-backed chairs and comfortable dining chairs.  We liked the view I to the kitchen, too.  We also had really nice service by the bartender - Tom, I think.  I really liked this blueberry martini he made.  The wine list was also great.  I enjoyed a really good cab.\n\nWe started with beet salad, a roasted tomato salad and tomato soup with yummy grilled cheese.  I loved the pops of flavor in the salads.  I am not a tomato soup lover, but I tried it, and it was good.  The grilled cheese was really good.  Then we had a goat cheese and fig flatbread - double yum!  For main courses, we had the Elk, which was served with a butternut squash risotto and short ribs (or is it spare? I always get them confused. It was the ones that melt in your mouth!)  served with mushroom risotto. I did not try the elk, but the mushroom risotto was excellent!  Then we had a berry empanada - really, really good.  \n\nWe will definitely return!
