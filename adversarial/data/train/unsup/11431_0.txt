What's not to love? On a Wednesday night you can throw down $20+ tip for 10 yuenglings and 100 pierogies. Where on earth is there left where you can get such a deal. The vibe is awesome and the cook spot-cleaned a tray with a dirty rag when I asked for one. If you're a generally non-fussy person, this place is a gem.
