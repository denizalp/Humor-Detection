Field trips to Heinz Hall for the purposes of boring the shit out of me and making me damn near fall asleep were a yearly tradition for us city schoolkids from grades 1 through 8. In the past decade, however, I've only been to Heinz Hall on four occasions, and three of them were to see rabidly, righteously sarcastic professional malcontent\/comedian Lewis Black. The other time was to see Bill Maher.\n\nWhat's that tell you about me? \n\nLast night, Mr. Black pointed, shouted, snarled, melted down, gathered his composure, and melted down again in front of a full house comprised largely of the flaky, middle-aged Pittsburgh theater crowd, the breed of folk hipsters will morph into 20-30 years from now, and yes, some of the nu-bohemians were there as well. \n\nHow could I not give this place a full 5? It's ornate, there isn't a poor seat to be found, the acoustics are phenomenal, the seats are lush, and any type of show you catch here instantly takes on an air of regality and gravitas. \n\nHeck, where's my monocle?\n\nOh, some hipster three rows back snatched it out of my back pocket. \n\nMr. Black of course took all of that pomposity, flipped it over a hill, and then flipped the bird at Sarah Palin, Donald Trump, The Tea Party, The Religious Right and all others who make society dumber and more ridiculous. For that I love him like a saint. I even wore the Lewis Black t-shirt I bought the last time I saw him, proudly I might add. \n\nSwitching gears, having Opeth play Heinz Hall would be one majestic Nightmare At The Opera! Someone must make this happen! Progressive death metal is high art! \n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=L82GrFnXsoA&playnext=1&list=PLB826D0C31A6F9007
