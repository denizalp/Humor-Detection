Man, this place is the real deal. I love their wings. We always get a larger Honey Gold. The sauce is a honey mustard, and the way they do their wings along with the crisp of the chicken is amazing. Feel free to ask for more sauce if you want more flavor.\n\nWe also shared a Numero Uno flat bread. It was good.\n\nCan't say anything bad about this place. Food is always consistently good.
