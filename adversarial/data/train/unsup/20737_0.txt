There are several buffets on the strip- some more expensive, another nearby that's the same price. \nI gave The Buffet at Excalibur only 3 stars due to the fact I ate at a very similar buffet a short walk away (I can't remember exactly where it is) a couple days earlier that was very similar in their offerings, however, it lacked some of the higher-end menu items such as crab legs, and a nicer carving station. They do, however, have a nicer dessert selection, which gave them the 3rd star. Overall, I was disappointed that I paid the same price for a better buffet just 2 days earlier. \nJust do your due (or is it \"do\") diligence, and ask around for recommended buffets. The ones I know are either the exact same price, or twice the price.
