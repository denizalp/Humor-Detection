I am not sure why people like this place.  I have tried several locations and have dis-liked them all.  If I don't like a place I don't usually give it a second chance but  because I like to support local businesses and so many people rave about Macayo's I did try several locations.  Everyone says the one off of Mill Ave is good.  But I have wasted enough money at their restaurants.  It boggles my mind how a chain of such low quality can exist.  Any one of the numerous Mexican restaurants usually ending with \"o's\" is better than this place.  \n\nThe reason they have big margarita's is to distract you from the horrible food and hope after you get over your hangover the margarita is all you remember. Everything I have tasted is bland and seems like it came out of a can.  This chain helps perpetuate the stereotype of Mexican food being of low quality.  I am Mexican-American and used to changing people's mindset when I have them over for dinner.\n\nThe only nice quality of this location is the building is unique it looks like a mesoamerican  pyramid.
