Love this place!\n\nPROS:\nModern Mexican food\nCounter service\nGreen chile pork - tasty and not overly salty\nSweet and spicy cornbread - interesting way to have it in your enchilada, original!\nLove all the salsas and toppings...pickled onions, crema, different levels of heat for the salsa\n\nPay attention and reiterate your order when they take your meal out of the oven, there was a mix up with mine and accidentally added toppings to another person's order...
