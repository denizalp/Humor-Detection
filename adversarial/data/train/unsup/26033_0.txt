The service was slow and we couldn't understand the employees. The food is extremely spicy. We were never told if anything was spicy or if a sauce was spicy before it was added to our chicken kabob bowl. I'm very disappointed since it's so spicy we can't eat it. The grape leaves were good is all I can say....
