Hearing more Chinese and Vietnamese than English means this spot is legit in our community. I was surprised to see so many people after 7pm on a Sunday night. Get your money's worth by feasting on the crawfish and crab, both very popular items. Stand your ground and fend off hungry asian mobsters. Don't let their age fool you, those grandmas\/pas will attack you with the serving spoons if you are in their way. \n\nMost of the other food items fall between OK to good. However, there were a few questionable-lookingitems that I preferred to leave in their serving trays. Several sushi options, typical americanized chinese options, soups, meats, seafood, a Mongolian BBQ station, and self-serve ice cream freezer.  The advantage of this buffet is obviously quantity over quality, so come with that in mind. The price is $17 for a dinner weekend but you can bring the coupon from their website to save a little bit.
