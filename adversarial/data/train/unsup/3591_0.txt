Whenever I fly into Las Vegas... I get super excited. Maybe it's the digital noise of \"ching, ching, ching\" coins, or all the slots that greets me at the airport. It's fun to watch people too get all excited rushing to get to their hotel. I met a couple who told me they were here to enhance their marriage. Well... I guess it's true that everything stays in Vegas? Hahaha...\n\nOne thing for sure that I love about this airport is how easy to fly into and out.  I love their monorail service since it is very close to the gates. You don't have to walk far to catch them. There are plenty of transportations here too. Super shuttle is big here, lots of hotels also offers their shuttle pickup, but if your company uses limos.com, it's a great service and makes you feel special!\n\nUntil then, Cheers! ~ :p
