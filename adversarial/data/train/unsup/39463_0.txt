Kaya is another offering from Big Burrito and if you're familiar with their other restaurants (especially Mad Mex), you'll know what to expect from the vibe. It's a pretty dark space, heavily style with an island flair...both in decor and menu. The menu is pretty small, but all of the items that I've tried have been pretty good, and the service has always been really good, whether sitting inside or outside.\n\nWe absolutely love their black bean dip, but fair warning: it's pretty spicy if you're not good with heat. The burger is good, as well as the cuban sandwich, but my go-to is probably the fish tacos. I tend to think they overdo it on the cream sauce, but otherwise, they're excellent. The red sangria is also delicious! I wouldn't say the food will blow you away, but I doubt you'll be disappointed, either.\n\nIt's warm vibe and good service means it's good for both casual meals and for a nice date night spot. The strip district can be insane at times, so while you may have luck grabbing a table or seats at the bar on a whim, I'd advice making a reservation to save yourself a wait. Enjoy!
