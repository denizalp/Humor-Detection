Great little restaurant we always go to on our way back from hiking at Red Rock.  Lots of TV's to watch sports, nice ambiance and delicious food.  I usually get one of their salads which are all delicious and big. My BF gets a burger and fries and loves it.  Sunday is 1\/2 off steak day-- i don't think i'll ever order anything else their NY steak is soo good!  It comes with a large salad and was perfectly cooked.  Me and my bf brought home the leftovers and ate it for dinner.  Huge yummy steak at $13 bucks since it was 1\/2 off... we'll be back after our next hike!
