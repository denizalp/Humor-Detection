Have been waiting for this restaurant to open for months now they are finally open and have been for about a month now. Glad they are here.\n\nIt's in a re purposed old house on S. Main Street just south of the intersection with Catawba Ave.  Not the first restaurant in this location because a BBQ place was here previously but they did not last long.\n\nWe walked in for Saturday brunch and were immediately seated and what used to be the front porch.  It's very attractive and make good use of bold vibrant colors to create a warm atmosphere.\n\nOur server was excellent and he attended to our every need and request in very professional manner.\n\nMenu is somewhat limited and this is especially true of the breakfast items.  I had the biscuits with gravy along with sausage and added hash browns as a side.  Biscuits were nice and flaky and while the gravy had a great texture, it was very bland. The sausage patties were way overcooked and it was hard to even cut them. The hash browns are not what I expected and were really cubed as opposed to shredded and also overcooked as well.\n\nMy wife had a grilled cheese sandwich off of the kids menu along with a side of fruit.  Nothing spectacular here and very middle of the road.\n\nI suspect that if we had tried some of the items from the hearty menu items such as the grilled chicken sandwich, our results would have been better.\n\nI also suspect that the dinner menu is somewhat better as well. This evening special was Shepherd's pie which is one of my favorite.\n\nTill I get back and try the dinner menu, I going to just have to go with an OK rating. Food is average but what makes this place stand out is the atmosphere and service.
