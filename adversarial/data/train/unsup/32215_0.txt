I recently purchased a new to me club chair and ottoman...I had no way to move them home.  SUPER JUNK to the rescue!  Not only was Eric very fast in replying that my job wouldn t be too small for him..he moved it the very next day!  Very affordable,  being alone he made me feel like family..I highly recommend Super Junk for a job well done.  THANK YOU
