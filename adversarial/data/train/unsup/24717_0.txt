I really liked this place it was dark and cozy, not loud at all. It was Saturday kinda late I suppose 12 or 1 am but it wasn't busy at all! I would have much rather come here instead of Chez No Dont period. The menu looked awesome I'd love to come back and try every libation they have to offer! The music was iffy but everything else made up for it. Server was totally pleasant everyone seemed friendly.Too bad its in that mythical land of down town that's so far from me. Thanks to Arik B. for making the good call.
