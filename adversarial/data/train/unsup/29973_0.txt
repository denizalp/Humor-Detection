I just moved to the area and decided to give this place a try.  I usually make the trip to Burrito Boyz and heard that this place was opened by one of the previous owners.  I ordered a regular pulled pork with everything on it.  The flavors were good, the meat was soft and tender. The only problem was the burrito was very soft and mushy which made it very hard to eat.  I will give them a second try just maybe asking them to keep it on the grill a bit longer
