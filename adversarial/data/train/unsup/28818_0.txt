They have five different grilled cheese sandwiches! And they are all very delicious! They rank in the following order:\n\n1) Perfectly grilled cheese\nAlso 1) Bacon & jalape√±o (I can't decide which one is better. This one is gooey and has the perfect amount of spice)\n3) Pesto\n4) Grilled goodness\n5) Mushroom melt\n\nAlso, the sweet potato fries are so good. I don't even like sweet potato fries and will always choose regular fries over them, but not at Perfect Pear.
