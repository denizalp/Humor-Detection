Upscale sports bar with an eclectic menu. Unique Happy\nHour specials - $4 @ 4pm, $5 @ 5pm, $6 @ 6pm and $7 at 7pm. The edamame appetizer was delicious and the shrimp po'boy sliders were AMAZING! In addition to a great menu, the craft beer selection is pretty impressive. If you're hungry for a great sandwich and a cold beer, Tom's Urban is a good choice!
