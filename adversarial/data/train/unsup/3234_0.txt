I had 5 star hopes for this place, and it was good... I ordered the chicken plate with feta fries, and everything was great except I think the chicken tasted a little funky. I don't know if it was the seasoning or marinade they used but i wasn't a huge fan.... I ate it all, but probably wouldn't go back just for that reason. The salad however, was delicious and I he tomatoes were bright red and beautiful.  One other thing I might add, that was kind of annoying (our lunch for 3 people and 1 child was around $60) When we were sitting down, asked for a small side of hummus, and they brought out a very small side... and also dropped off a bill for $1 for it. I hate when restaurants nickel and dime...
