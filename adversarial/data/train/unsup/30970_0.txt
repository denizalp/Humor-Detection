Paulina is incredible! She's super organized, professional and intelligent. Her attention to detail is unparalleled. She made my experience amazing. If it weren't for her my day wouldn't have been as amazing as it was. I am forever grateful to her and Katie. She's very accommodating and perfect for a destination wedding. She responds right away and makes you feel at ease. My family and friends all complimented on how wonderful she was. Her attitude and positivity are great. Shes very helpful with suggestions and knows Las Vegas well. Do not look anywhere else, hire Paulina!
