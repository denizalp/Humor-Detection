I fell in love with Rice Paper the minute I walked in. It is a small historic house converted in to a quaint and hip dining area. There is a large patio in back that I am sure will be heavily used come cooler weather.\n\nOur servers name was Derek and he was funny, attentive and personable even though the place was packed. \n\nThe food was amazing, and to name a few favorites:\n\nFirecracker Shrimp - Lightly breaded and tossed in a spicy aioli sauce\nEnlighten Me Roll - Tofu, asparagus, jalapenos, jicama, crispy rolls, and sriracha served with peanut hoisin sauce\nShaking Beef - Holy deliciousness! Fillet mignon seared with soy, garlic, and onions served sizzling with steamed rice that was topped with mushrooms (see pics).\nCurry Tofu - Tofu, asparagus, shitake mushrooms, baby corn, and onions. We ordered it spicy and it was phenomenal.\n\nI also had the Ginger Fizz drink and it was pretty tasty. I can't wait to go back and try the pho!~
