A great Korean bbq spot. They have sushi as well and although it's not bad I would not recommend ordering sushi. \n\nWe have been there a number of times and ordered the ribs, bulgogi, and beef bimbop and they were all consistently fantastic. \n\nThe service was good, overall this was the Korean Bbq we have been to in Toronto.
