This is such a fun experience for old and new bingoers! It's so easy to play with the electronic equipment, you won't miss a number! Basically you have the electronic (a black box against the wall), a stationary (a monitor), and then paper bingo. I think the cheapest u can get in with an electronic is $15 but it's worth it. The drinks are complimentary and if lady luck is on your side then it could be an easy $50 or $500! Some people have even won $10,000! Plus you'll know if you've won because your machine tells you when you're one number away and sings if you get a bingo! I took off one star bc it can be pretty addictive and I didn't win squat! The staff is very helpful (especially to noobs like me) and the cocktail servers are very nice! Oh and... bingo happens on the odd hours!
