Grew up coming here and I love every time coming here. Someone complained that it wasn't that good because their meal which consisted of a side salad was not that \"great.\" Are you kidding me? Who the heck grades a Mexican food place based on a side salad? Whatever. My enchiladas were great, the sauce was excellent and my rice and beans were of excellent moist and flavorful quality. I have always found the rice at Filiberto's to be dry but the rice here is very moist due to their being more tomato sauce in it and a compound called salt. \n\nTry the bakery, there are many excellent pastries to try and the salsa bar has more variety than you can find at the more common walk up Mexican eateries. As for all the comments on the parking lot being shady, honestly in the evening many families come in here to grab something to take home or to have a family meal. Seriously people, the parking lot was clean and well-lit, everything looked freshly painted and clear of trash. Come down off of your high horse and enjoy some good food.
