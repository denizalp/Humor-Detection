Even though I thought I had pressed the 'place order' button on GrubHub, they let me re-place my order in the store when I went to go pick it up without charging me. When I got back to my computer, I had put incorrect credit card information in it! So I placed the order again. Thank you guys for understanding that I made a mistake! Even though it was my fault, you took ownership of it, and made it right. Talk about customer service! On the other hand, I have never had a cheesesteak sandwich, and this was the BOMB! I will be back, many, many times!
