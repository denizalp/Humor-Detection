My wife and I are new to the area and stopped into this place hoping to find a local lawn and garden center to use as we started sprucing up our new home. The facilities are large and can be somewhat daunting and the maps that are provided are of little help. When we approached some staff about certain plants, we were told where to look and sent on our way. When we returned with more questions, as obvious novices, we were again pointed in a direction and told to go. Multiple staff members were pretty unwilling to move from their hut and walk us through the selection. It was quite off-putting as first time customers as we felt like we were disturbing the staff with questions. \n\nWhile the grounds are large and the section is pretty good, the staff were enough to keep us away for good.
