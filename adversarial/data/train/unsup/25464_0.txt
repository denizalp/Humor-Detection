Greeted nicely by all employees at the range. Overall a great place. If I could make a critique, I would only have 1. A local resident price would bring me here more often. Typically I'm only here during the week for 30 mins and I'm out. 15 bucks is a little steep for just a quick session after work. Membership options would be nice. A plus is you can use your own ammo, your not stuck using range junk ammo.
