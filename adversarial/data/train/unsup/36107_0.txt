Have been here three times - each time better than the last!\n\nA stunning view of the city at night from some of the tables and a wait staff that is always there to serve. A fully stocked bar with an extensive wine list and very capable bartenders. Reservations absolutely necessary.\n\nThe menu is extremely diverse and the portions large. The meals are exquisite!
