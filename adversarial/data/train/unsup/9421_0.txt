I bought the Travelzoo deal for this place a while ago, and finally got the chance to try it out recently! \n\nAmbiance: My first impression of this place is that it's a very clean and similar to a traditional 50s dinner. I love the wall decor! \n\nFood: For drinks, I got the mocha and my boyfriend got the latte. The mocha was very delicious, and my boyfriend said the latte was a bit bitter. For entrees, I got the beef hash. It was very yummy! I love the contrast between the salty meat and eggs with the sour cabbage :) Contrary to what other yelpers have said, I thought this was a huge portion. My boyfriend got the 3 omelet, which was also a huge portion and quite delicious! Make sure you try their hash browns! Very unique flavors because they season it with rosemary :) For side, we ordered the seasonal fruit cup. This was totally not worth the $6 as listed. \n\nService: Very nice servers! They kept checking up on us to make sure we're doing all right :) \n\nOverall, great place for some traditional American food. I gave it 4 stars because 1) it took about 30 minutes for the food to come out after we had ordered and 2) I would probably never eat here if it weren't for the Travelzoo deal because the prices are a bit high.
