The worst scheduling system of any barber I've ever experienced. Unless you can make your next appointment more than 2 weeks in advance you will never get a 2nd haircut. I've been going here for 4 months and it never got better or easier. Don't waste your time falling for this place just because they offer you a free beer while you wait. It's not worth the hassle! They will also try to fool you into buying expensive products every time you sit in their chair, no matter how much you insist you are not interested.
