With bright orange walls - the place looks like Kam's. OK - don't get turned off yet. Since it's open late night - you can go there after Kam's. Wait, why are even you at Kam's?\n\nThe food is actually good and inspired by some of the top Chicago dog joints. In honor of the Weiner Circle in Chicago, Big Mouth uses fresh melted cheddar cheese for your fries, beef or burgers. Similar to Hot Doug's in Chicago, BM names their combo meals after relatively famous Big Mouths. And just like Superdawg, BM serves up their Chicago Style Dogs with neon green relish. \n\nI'm still not sure what I think about fried Twinkies dipped in chocolate.  It looks the same as how it'll exit your body at the end of the day. Yum!
