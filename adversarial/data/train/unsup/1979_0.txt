This place knows BBQ! Ordered the platter which allows you to pick 3 meats with 3 sides. That was hard since there was so much I wanted to try. Ended up choosing the ribs, sausage and brisket with mac and cheese, coleslaw and shoestring fries. \n\nRibs and sausage were amazing. The best I've had in the city so far. Not even a huge fan of sausage and I wanted more. The flavour is enriched with smokiness and cooked to perfection. I like how they give you a brush so you can control how much BBQ sauce you want to have (homemade sauce BTW).\n\nCant believe the service in this place. We were given samples of the pulled pork and smoked pastrami. I almost died it was so delicious. All staff were helpful and friendly.\n\nIf you haven't eaten here you're definitely missing out.\n\nTips:\n- sit at the bar, here you can watch the food being prepared and talk to the cool staff\n- don't order coleslaw as a side since it comes with the sausage\n- bring cash since this place isn't hooked up with machines yet\n\nOnly flaw: cocktails are on the sweeter side\n\nInside scoop: brunch menu is coming at the end of he month. Can't wait
