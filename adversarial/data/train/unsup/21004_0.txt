Wow! It's almost impossible for me to find a good breakfast place that also has good coffee. This place is it! Both breakfast and coffee was spot on.\nAs you walk in, you are greeted by a tray of pastries filled with free samples. It's not tiny pieces either. The muffins were quartered and given out as samples. It looked delicious, but I wanted to save my appetite for my breakfast. \nYou order at the counter and go sit and they do the rest. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and my friend ordered a Flat Tire breakfast (breakfast burrito). My sandwich which was made with English muffin was amazing. It was tasty without feeling greasy and the English muffin was perfectly toasted. The side of wedged fries came out very hot and paired nicely with the sandwich. The breakfast burrito was tasty as well. It was perfect with salsa that it came with. The portion sizes were big too; we both had leftovers. \nDid I mention the coffee? They have full selection of coffees. They had Irish coffee but I will have to get that next time as it contains alcohol :). \nThe restaurant was very clean and cozy. The staff was friendly and they also offer bags of coffee beans and souvenirs for sale.\nThis is my new spot for good breakfast. I'm so happy I tried it today .
