Ooooowooogaaaa Ooooowoooga!!! I felt like the wolf in Tex Avery's Red Hot Riding Hood. My tongue fell out and I had to roll it back up. Ok, back to the review. The show started out with some shameless plugs, local and big time celebrities on the big screen saying how great Frankie is, is it corny? Yea probably, but is it supposed to be taken seriously? Not sure, but it was funny. The band is incredible, it is loud, and I see some other reviewers complaining about it, but it's a live band! And they're AWESOME. Frankie is truly an entertainer, he engaged the audience, (at one point he was passing out shots of Crown), he had moves, and he's got an amazing voice. He writes his own material, which we were treated to a couple of his songs, but he also included covers of big names like The Beatles. \n\nI am totally loving this show! Right down to all of his manery (that's man jewelery, lots and lots of it, bracelets, necklace). I wish them nothing but luck, and I can't see him being at the Stratosphere for long. Too much talent!
