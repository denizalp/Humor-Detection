Worst service at the Tire?department. I was told it takes to replaced 1 brand new tire for 15 minutes cause I was the only client. It took almost 2 hours. The other guy was attending the in coming clients while the other one was just roaming around. And I asked if my car is done. He replied he cannot work on it if the other guy can't help him. Gosh it's a small tire he is not going to lift it. And they said that they're are going to attend the walk in first than the first come first serve basis. Horrible never going to go back. I rather go to Arroyo 215.
