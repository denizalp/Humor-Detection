If you are serious about Pizza your journey begins and ends here my friend. Affable owner, Stefano Fabbri will welcome you with open arms.  To experience Pomo is to experience pizza completely faithful to the vision that was nourished on the slopes of grand Vesuvius.  His new market is also laden with the finest Italian imports.  Close your eyes, listen to the music of Eros Ramazzotti in the back ground, and take a deep breath. It might look modern and sleek but it is still Italian to its core.
