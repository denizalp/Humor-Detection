The food here has become to commercialized and is no longer real Mexican food. The wait time to be served is ridiculously long. I waited a solid half hour for a simple tortilla with butter. I had to ask twice. By the time they gave it to me, our meal was done. I asked for a refund and they wanted my receipt & card so they could credit it. The girl had taken my ticket the 2nd time I checked on it & said she'd bring it out. We won't be back and I will not recommend this to anyone else.
