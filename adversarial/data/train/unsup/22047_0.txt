Mediocre and overpriced sushi.  $7 for regular rolls, really?  Also, when you pull up the place on yelp it says you get 25% off on a bottle of sake, but once you actually check in, that is only valid on Valentines day, kind of a bait and switch.\n\nI was quickly sat down, but right next to a group of extremely loud guys in an otherwise pretty much empty room.  Our waiter was nice enough to recommend a $95 bottle of sake, lol.  After ordering a few rolls and some sashimi I did get a small $30 bottle of sake that was recommended as well.  Our server was pretty good at keeping our sake glasses filled, but not so much on my water.  He just kept forgetting, which was kind of a problem when one of the rolls I ordered was especially spicy.\n\nI know, it sounds like nothing but complaints, but there was nothing really compelling about this place to me.  If you live in the area, maybe $7 rolls is the norm, but I don't seem to ever have to pay that much in the Charlotte area.  And with that extra money I would hope for extra special service, but not the case.  I only tipped 15% on pre-tax, not my style at all, but I'm sure he did well on all the other people he paid more attention to.
