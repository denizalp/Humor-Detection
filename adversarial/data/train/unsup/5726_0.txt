Been here twice now, The first time I ordered a burger (simpleton) and some appetizers with a group of friends.  The food was all decent , the burger was tasty though not worth 11 dollars by any means.  The duck poutine was kind of lousy and bland.  Overall the food is not worth what they charge (small portions too).  But the SERVICE.   \n\nTHE SERVICE IS SOME OF THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  \n\nBoth times I went , both waitresses seemed like they had no idea how to serve, and were completely wrong on many things on the menu.  They straight up didn't even know half of it, and were trying to surcharge every single thing we asked for.  I don't go out to eat to get nickel and dimed to death for every little thing.  Servers seemed 'sort-of' nice, but were clueless about how to really deal with customers.  They blamed things on us, and asked who was managing last time we came because our vegetarian wanted to sub a veggie patty instead of meat on a burger, she told us \"no substitutions but we'll do it once\".\n\nOrdered mid-rare burgers, they come out well done or raw.  Loud annoying music, awful service.  The food is OKAY.  I honestly would rather eat a five-guys burger, let alone b-spot, flipside, or any number of other true good burgers that are priced this high.  \n\nAVOID.
