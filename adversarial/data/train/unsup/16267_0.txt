FRAUDULENT BUSINESS - LIARS, DO NOT TRUST!!!! Their \"free\" 14-day pass applies to the franchise as a whole (when you sign up via Facebook compared to just their website where you get a 7-day pass) hence the branch I visited said they would only honour 7 days (which I felt was acceptable) BUT, she then tells me they charge $21.95 for the 7 days, how is that FREE??? I had to walk out while the woman was still talking I was so angry. AND they are NOT CHEAP! They cost the same as Goodlife and more than Markville Fitness ($25 a month) which has staff, classes and respectable business practices that keeps their customers coming back year after year.
