This passed weekend I went to Vegas for my sister's bachelorette party and Vegas All Nite helped me make it an unforgettable weekend! We got bottle service at Marquee Friday night and a green hummer limo Saturday night all thanks to these guys. The girls in my group had so much fun and LOVED the limo. My sister was so happy and so surprised that I was able to find a green limo, which is her favorite color. Thank you Greg, Jeff, and everyone who works for Vegas All Nite!! I'll definitely contact this company for my next vegas trip.
