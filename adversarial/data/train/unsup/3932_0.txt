Detailed decor and ambiance?  \nLive mariachi band?  \nExcellent service?  \nAuthentic Mexican food? \nFresh, delicious seafood? \nFresh, hand made tortillas?\nReasonable price and value? \nBest Molcajetes in town? \nWe never tire of this place. Come early or stay late on the weekends because it gets super busy, crowded and loud- so much fun! We are always so tempted to try something new,  but are so hooked on our favorite Molcajete Trio - Large grilled shrimp, tender grilled chicken, marinated juicy steak, cactus, cheese, tomato, avocado all in a delicious broth that stays hot forever in that big stone bowl. It is served with your choice of corn or flour tortillas, and rice and beans. We get the small and always have leftovers! Thank you, Leroy, for always taking such great care of us. See you again soon.
