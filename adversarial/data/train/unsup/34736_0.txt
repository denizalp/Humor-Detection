I was looking for a professional tint shop and couldn't afford to take any chances.Took my brand new Passat in for an estimate and saw all brand new high end cars brought by the dealers for tint and stoneguard protection.Richard was very friendly,even waited for me when I was running late.The tint was amazing,and stoneguard was applied professionally.My next car is going to Thornhill Tints for a top quality job.
