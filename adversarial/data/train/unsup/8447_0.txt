Compared to other casinos that I've been to in Arizona, Lone Butte does not have a very wide range of tables. However there are plenty of slot machines. Personally I'd rather go to Wild Horse Pass if I wanted to play some card games. \n\nHowever, what brings me here is for their late night Bad Bingo. They don't have a free photo booth like Casino Arizona but they do provide my friends and I with some luck, as a couple of us, myself included, have won some type of Bingo! \n\nDabbing the bingo sheets keeps you on your toes with the adrenaline but I personally prefer purchasing the electronic games. You get a higher chance of winning as there are 36 \"sheets\" per game. Just sit back, enjoy the jams, and it'll tell you when to yell \"Bingo!\"
