Snack size, bite size, mini street tacos. I have heard about this place for years. Some real fans of street tacos have told me how this place sells killer street tacos for 75 cents on Wednesday's. Well I went on a Monday and my bill was super cheap. All I ordered this time around was some street tacos as I was not hungry. They were amazing. This is their newest location. The service was great everyone is super nice.\n\nPros:\nBig restaurant\nIndoor and outdoor seating\nInexpensive \nFit for a family\nVariety of options\nFull size bar\nTV's\nCook to order\n\nCons:\nCan't think of any
