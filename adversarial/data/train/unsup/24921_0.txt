\"You shouldnt use a discount card if its not yours\"\nSaid the sweet girl TRYING to be bitchy, even though she ran off as soon as she said it.\n\nBut its all good walmart, you have taken a years worth of my savings so me swindling about 1\/10 of it away with an employee discount card before it expired is what we could call \"an eye for an eye\"\n\nAnd you're everywhere, and I'm not. How is that not fair? How is the universe not collapsing?
