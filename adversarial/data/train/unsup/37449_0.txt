My son was head down and low my entire 9 month pregnancy, so his head had a flat spot on the back when he was born. When he was 3 months his doctor pointed it out to us and referred us to a physical therapist (who's also awesome but that's a whole other review!). The physical therapist assessed his head and recommended he get a helmet to correct his misshapen head before any developmental delays took place. His insurance unfortunately doesn't cover this service as they deem it \"cosmetic\" (yeah... Ok!) so Orthopedic Motion actually helped us out and instead of paying $3-4K out of pocket (typical cost), we only a fraction of that! He got his helmet in March of 2016 (being 6 months) and within two weeks his head went from a 15mm difference in the opaques at the top of his head all the way to a 5mm difference! And he's almost done with his treatment now, 4 months later! The staff are all incredibly nice (at least any I've met). Dr. Stryker is super friendly and available when you need her. The experience of my son's head being misshapen was terrifying but they have helped us so much along the way! Would recommend without a doubt.
