There's a freaking terrarium in the bar.  Ooookay.  I can dig that.\n\nI can also dig the eclectic juke box.  Willie to Rush to LFO.  Alright, I don't know if LFO is really on there, but I would't be surprised if they did.  I'd jam to \"Summer Girls\" given the chance ... follow it up with \"Pancho and Lefty\" and we're golden.\n\nAnd no one seemed to mind when I was drunkenly playing their PBA Bowling Arcade Game by rolling the trackball with my ass [hey, it got a cheap laugh].\n\nCheap drinks to boot.  I'm surprised that I kinda forgot about this place.
