ATTENTION LAST REMNANTS OF OLD VEGAS DEALS\nJuly 2017 and I can still get ice cold Michelob Lager in the bottle for only 1 dollar.    5 stars.   PERIOD...  Now will the bartender be a dick when I don't tip him for opening a beer.  hahahaha Maybe.   But I just say hey.  When Vegas goes back to the old days and stops charging me for fucking parking and loading on bullshit resort fees for my room, I will then tip you for the 1 second of effort to grab me a beer.  Till then Corporate Vegas makes no apologies for their rip off fees and says it is just business, so me saving money by just paying a buck for my beer with no tip is just business too.   \n\nI will seriously post up here and drink dollar beers all day and all night.    Last great deal on the Vegas strip.   Reminder of the old days.
