If you read my early morning review of my security experience at Dulles today, well the fun didn't stop when we went wheels up on my AC Jazz flight direct to Pierre Trudeau-Montreal.  Uneventful flight, really, hardly a bump felt even though we knew we were going to be landing in snow and wind.  that's where the fun ends....\n\n1 hour 15 min airport to airport...not too shabby and because I'm so schedule driven I had already mapped out what I would have done by lunchtime.  Uh, insert screeching tire sounds here....evidently the airport recently let 40 grounds crew go (economy issues) which meant there wasn't anyone to offload our flight.  When that occurs the humans aren't let off the plane if the luggage can't get out of the belly of the jet!  Yeah, 2 hours later someone rounded up a couple of guys to take the luggage out and let us out of our giant sardine can with jet engines too.  So much for my productive day, eh??\n\nGetting inside the airport and experiencing the efficiency of customs, the arrival of your luggage when YOU arrive at baggage claim AND the ever ready line of cabs melted the entire crappy morning away...there are miracles left in this world  :)
