How do you rate a place that you love for its diviness?  I've stayed there for $16.  I live in Las Vegas but if I can have a good time on Fremont street and then not have to worry about driving home or getting a cab... ... for $16? I don't really care how nice the room is (it's pretty sucky).  The bar is dark and the patrons resemble the aliens at the Mos Isley bar in Star Wars.  I have met a washed-up ex-WWF wrestler, several strippers from next door, tweaky meth addicts, and a plethora of assorted drunks.  The dealers are pretty nice and I've had a great time playing craps there.  The cocktail waitresses can be pretty pokey, maybe they don't have enough of them.  They put in a \"no crap\" craps table recently.  DON'T PLAY IT! Your odds are better on a regular table.  Let's see what else... Good breakfast cafe, slow elevators, dancers are mostly cuties, I always lose at the \"Fetish Pit\".
