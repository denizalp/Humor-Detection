The nearby Gross-eria Mere-ant is pretty Gross and is owned not by a human, but by a mere ant. It's not as good as the Groceria Meerkat, which was featured on Meerkat Manor. However, this establishment - Groceria Merante - is better than both of them, despite actually being owned by humans.\n\nWhat to get: proscuitto, capicola, hot sopressata, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, and hot fried peppers.\nWhy: Because Meghan and I told you to.\n\nI have to thank Meghan, because it was her review that led me to order that exact sandwich (which you can see pictured below), and it's one of the best Italian sandwiches I've ever had outside Hoboken, NJ. That's not a joke, btw. Hoboken does make the best in the world - try Fran's and Andrea Salumeria.\n\nBut here in Pitt, where sandwiches are a huge big deal, this is the best of the best. Forget all that Primanti hype, and come and try one of these. The peppers certainly are the best part, although the prices are damn amazing too. Huge cheap sandwich that will fill you up - a half is more than enough - with nice, typically Pittsburghese service, on a tiny little back street in Oakland that seems a world away from the hustle and bustle of the nearby college campuses.\n\nOne of the best sandwiches I've ever had.\n\nSorry to Rante about it. I'm just going to shut up and sit here on my Gross Rear until you go and try it.
