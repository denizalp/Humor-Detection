We went here on a groupon and were quite impressed.  The service took awhile but the food was fresh and made to order.  The meat was tender and plentiful in one dish and the vegetables were fresh in the other dish.  The Thai hot was hot but not crazy hot.  We also had a nice spring rolls appetizer that was very good as well.  For the price, portions, and taste, this place was terrific.
