We visit Las Vegas at least once yearly, and each trip always includes multiple viewings of the fountains at Bellagio. The first time I saw them, I was so impressed! The next trip, my husband proposed to me here while they played \"Your Song\" by Elton John. \n\nThank you Bellagio for the wonderful memories. See you soon!
