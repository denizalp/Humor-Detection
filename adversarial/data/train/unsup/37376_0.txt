Anyone who gave this place above two stars does not have taste buds. I know Indian food I grew up in Asia. Indian food is one of my favorite cuisines.  I went to the buffet. I received bland, room temperature food  with undercooked meats.  There are good indian food restaurants in Arizona this place is just not one of them. Go to The Dhaba which is just up the street
