Chase Field is a pretty spectacular ballpark!\n\nI visited Chase Field for the first time last week for a non-baseball related event and have to admit I was really impressed, this is one clean ball yard. The event I attended was held in the Audi Club located on the Suite level of the park overlooking the field itself and offered magnificent views. The Full sized bar kept the crowd in high spirits throughout the evening. \n\nI was able to get down to the field itself for a brief glimpse which only made me wish that I was attending a game all the more and I cannot wait to return to Chase Field for some beer and baseballl.
