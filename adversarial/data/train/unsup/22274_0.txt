Despite the near-inaccessibility of this In-N-Out location, you'll still find it packed to the gills with tourists looking to find out what's so special about this burger joint. \n\nI don't have to tell you it's worth it.\n\nBecause of this location's proximity to the Strip you'll be hard pressed to avoid a longish wait time and find a place to sit. Wait it out and you'll be rewarded with a tasty burger (and fries and a milkshake... you ordered all of those, right?). It might be one of the better hangover cures you'll experience in Vegas.
