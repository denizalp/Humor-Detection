I have always been a fan of Ms B and when I got free tickets I was all in!  We got a room and chilled for a couple nights eating good food on the strip.  So the show was not a total wash....\n\nHowever when we went for the show we stopped at the bar to have a few drinks near the entrance.  So we got to watch the show of girls going into the show was very entertaining.  In all actuality it was was probably as much fun as watching the show.  I hate to say that, I was hoping for a great Brittany comeback.  So the show starts and there is a lot of action lots of movement and lights and action.  I was happy, but as the show moves along you begin to realize that she is not singing and she so choreographed that her dancers are better then her.  I have been to many concerts in my time and this is by far the worst.  She dose not sing, she does not dance ( I thought she was known for her dance) She is good at walking around the stage!  she had 0 personality besides what is written down for her.\n\nI have seen a lot of shows here in Vegas this is by far the worst most choreographed show.  BTW choreographing is not bad but when your dancers are better then you you may have to rethink things.  Brittany you rock, I love you but your show pretty much sucks\n\nBoHooo
