Went here with my girlfriend on a Friday night, made reservations for 6pm. Sat at a 4 top which was nice. Chris was out waiter, he was awesome. Knowing this was our first time there he gave us some suggestions. Atmosphere was good, family friendly too. We'll definitely be going back with a couple of our foodie friends soon. Oh, and the margaritas are on point too.
