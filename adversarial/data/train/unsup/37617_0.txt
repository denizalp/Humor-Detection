DO NOT USE this cleaner unless you want holes in your clothing.  I have been a customer for a couple of years now and took a coat in to get cleaned that had gotten dirty. The coat had been cleaned by them before with no issued. I picked it up the first time and they didnt not even attempt to clean the stain, after the second try I noticed a hole in the coat and still the stain. Spoke with the employee showed them the stain and the hole and was told the manager or owner would give me a call. Third attempt the stain was gone, but no call from the manager or owner other than to tell me the coat was ready. Picked up the coat and again mentioned the hole and lack of customer service I have gotten. Manager was not informed, knew nothing about the third attempt. Hell she is even mentioned she cant get the owner on the phone. \nFinally, the owner called me and he would not take any responsibility for the hole, tried to blame it on my car door or the sugar from the stain. Told him I am not going to play the \"what if\" game with him. He even asked me what I wanted, but I am the customer and he is the owner he should be coming to me with a solution. He said he would have to think about it and get back to me, still waiting for that phone call 2 weeks later. I wore the coat yesterday and guess what??? I found another hole that matches the other one perfectly. These holes were not in my coat prior to dropping it off and no the holes were not caused by the sugar in the stain, nor by my car door, etc. For those of you who live in Aspinwall, O'hara, FC, Sharpsbur, etc there are plenty of better options, so use them.
