Came her the other night when looking for something to do downtown. There was a bit of a wait for a table and the guy taking names said he'd text us when a table was ready. I like this system I think its a lot more efficient then having a bunch of people waiting in the store section of the cafe. We got to walk around Korea town for a bit while we waited. Snakes and Lattes was super busy since we waited around 20 minutes this was expected all the tables were full but there were still tons and tons of board games available.\n\nThere are a lot of board games and many different varieties of the same board game so chances are if you're looking for a specific game you'll be able to play some version of it. The games are all in good conditioning not missing enough pieces to make tan issue when playing.\n\nI ordered a salted caramel latte and this was delicious, I'd definitely order it again. I noticed Mac and Cheese on the menu so I'll be back to try that as well. Overall this is a great little place to hanging out with friends and play some board games. I'll have to try Snakes and Lagers soon as well.
