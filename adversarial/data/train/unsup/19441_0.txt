We stumbled upon this place after watching a movie at the nearby movie theatre. The restaurant is clean and surprisingly very cute. You walk up to the counter to place your order, sit down and the food is dropped off. The cashier was very friendly and welcoming. \n\nWe ended up ordering the chicken and ground beef kabob platter with rice and salad. It was enough for me and my hubby to share and the taste was good. We practically ate everything on the plate. The reasons why I give four instead of five is that they were out of a few items that I wanted to order and the price is a little on the high side. For one combo platter and one drink, we paid almost $20.
