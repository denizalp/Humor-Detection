Oh man. Words can not describe how happy I am that we finally have a Chronic Taco. \n\nNot only is this place a cool place, the fish tacos are so GD good it makes me want to slap your mother. Two Beer battered fish tacos, baja style and you're ready. \n\nDon't miss out. What else are you gonna do? Eat at Del Taco. Go ahead fart knocker.
