I totally enjoyed going up in the Eiffel Tower.\n\nEven though I have seen Vegas lights from a Airplane and from stratosphere, the big wheel and a few other places, you can never get enough of the Vegas for night views.\n\nTo me it is so pretty to see how many lights there are. And how many more from the first time coming to Vegas over 30 years ago as a tourist.\n\nWhen up at the top you have a fence to make it secure to feel safe.\n \nThe view is very nice up here, if Bellagio fountain is going off you will get to enjoy that or just to see all the way around the valley. \nOf course day time you will be able to see what your looking at if your not familiar with the hotels.\nI totally recommend this to do if your visiting or if you live in Vegas and have never done it.\nCheck it out when you go to the Paris Casino & Hotel.
