OH EM GEE GOSH GOLLY GAD DANG it was good.  If not good, at the very least a whole lotta food in a great looking restaurant with a very very expensive bill at the end.  \n\nIt is by far the most expensive dinner I've ever had.  It's also, I think, my first tasting menu.  The appetizers were very yummy, the sides were very good as well.  The mash potatoes were so creamy, it melted in my mouth.  The Kobe Beef Tartar was really excellent.  I couldn't stop eating it.  \n\nAnd then came the beef.  Too much beef!!  I could barely get through two slices before I was full.  I knew I shouldn't have kept eating that tartar.  Good thing we took it to go (and we did only to have it locked in our room's fridge, blah).  \n\nThe dessert was a series of sorbettos and a few other things actually.  It was a lot of dessert.  The stand out here is the orange and basil sorbetto.  It.  Was.  Fabulous.  \n\nIf I come back, probably wouldn't shell out the money for the tasting menu.  Too much food anyway but good to try once.
