Funny that this got ROTD right before I was going to update it.\nI JUST went with my friend- and brought two extra friends to try the ROTD experience with me. \nLest ye be looking for that ROTD experience- it is no longer there- except for the hot staff..they are still there.. \nBut the grilled cheese was underwhelming.  Before it was the most excessive amount of buttered bread and overflowing cheese you have ever seen.  Now?  it's grilled cheese.\nAnd the ridiculous amount of samples, I was told, are on crackdown.\n\nI hate it when high expectations are set, met and then landslide after all the ruckus advertises a place as being amazing.
