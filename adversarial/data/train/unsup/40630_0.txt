This company came out to clean my pond about a month ago, since their visit my pond has been leaking a tremendous amount of water. I called Tranquility Ponds and they asked me to shut the pump off to determine if the problem was with the pump or the liner. My pond continued to leak and I asked for someone to come out and look at my pond. The owner would not send someone out unless we paid $149 service charge. When I stated that I should not have to pay a service charge, as my pond didn't leak until her employees came to my home, she said that a leak is not covered in their contracts. This company does not stand by their work and the owner is extremely rude and difficult. I do not recommend them for any of your pond needs as they are rude, disrespectful, and do not warranty their work.
