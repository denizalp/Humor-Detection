Rice to Go is a little hole in the wall type of Chinese fast-food. Located just off Decatur & Spring Mountain, it caters to just about anybody for that quick fix. There is nothing really special about that place that screams come on in. The parking area is small & entrance can be hard to get into and out depending on traffic since it is close to the traffic lights. Inside of the restaurant is bright white, yet easily points out how sticky icky the place could be. It is what it is, but one thing this place does serve up is flavorful and good sized portions of pork siomai.  They are a hit  especially at parties or pot lucks. One of the guy at the register, didn't get his name is very friendly though and happy to have customers of course. Sparks up conversation and very informative and funny. He speaks mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog and Spanish. Not sure if I would try any of their other stuff. Food doesn't appeal to me much, but I may come back just for the siomai.
