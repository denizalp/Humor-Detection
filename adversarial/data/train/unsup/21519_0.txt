JUST GO. This company consistently makes some of the best island food that I've had in the lower 48. Every time I come to Las Vegas, I actually get excited to eat Island Flavor again. This is their quickie express version with counter service and a few tables. \n\nFirst things first: haupia cake. It's perfect in texture, and the haupia flavor is subtle and beautiful. I ate dessert while waiting a few minutes for my plate lunch. (The cream on it isn't particularly special, but the rest of the cake is PERFECT.) \n\nNext: unless you are Michael Phelps or the god Maui out of the movie Moana, these meals are filling enough for two people to share. Holy hell, there's so much fatty, delicious food that it's surely grave to your health on a regular basis. It's all good quality and done with great flavors. They are on the sweet side, but my favorites are the furikake chicken and short ribs. \n\nLike Durango's location, the service here is so unbelievably kind that you can't help but wish the whole world could live life like that everyday. (To the lady working today, THANK YOU. So much aloha in your heart that the world must be a better place because you are in it!) \n\nThey have daily specials posted on the wall when you walk in and everything legit Hawaiian on the menu, including all those glorious Pacific Rim fusion meals. \n\nI'm at McCarran waiting to go home and packed my leftovers in a Tupperware. I even had to tell the TSA guy to eat here when he did a bag check for me. This is one of my favorite local businesses to support!
