We went to AZ Kabob House using a Groupon.  We had never been before and I cannot say enough good things about the food and service!  Absolutely delicious chicken (tender and flavorful) and lamb kabobs and generous portion of rice with a small side salad!  We also got a yogurt\/cucumber\/mint dip served with Pita bread which was wonderful!  Very attentive and friendly service, and very clean.  Highly recommended---we will be back!
