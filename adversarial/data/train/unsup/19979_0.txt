Third and final stop of my car parts check today, O'Reilly does not seem any better and no worse than the other major chains along South Blvd. As near as I could tell, the prices looked to be about the same, the stock looked to be about the same and the service seemed to be about the same.\n\nAisles of cleaning and engine chemicals and oils, filters, accessories, parts, tools and a lot of stuff behind the counter for replacement parts.
