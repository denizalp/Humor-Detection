I went for my birthday yesterday 05-31-17 with my friends and family and completed the Hanzel and Gretel room with 53 seconds left. This is the 6th escape room I've done and it was by far my favorite. To start we encountered a car crash right in front of us before we arrived. We pulled over to assist as we had a CICU nurse in the car with us. I called the escape room to let them know what had happened and the gentleman on the phone was more than understanding. We ended up being 30 minutes late, but he still let us do the room with no penalty. Once there the man, Conner, was very nice and enthusiastic about the room. The room itself had more locks to figure out than any other room I had done previously. It took all 8 of us to escape just in the nic of time. I would highly recommend this room to anyone who enjoys a challenge. Thank you Conner, and escape room Mesa, for making my birthday great!
