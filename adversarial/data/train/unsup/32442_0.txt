First off, not a seafood fan, but still found plenty of great options here to eat.\n\nStarted off with the sampler of Dragon Broccoli which was great! Super crispy with a great tasting breading on the broccoli.\n\nEnded up getting the pre-fix menu option which was soo worth. For $21.99 the meal included a vegetable soup, a ceasar salad, a cajun chicken alfredo, and a brownie with ice cream for dessert. All the food was amazing. \n\nThe staff was also amazing and super accommodating. My cousin ended up getting a full lobster which he wasn't a fan of since it was a tad over cooked and tough, so they took it back and offered another or something else. He tried the lobster tail which was the same, so he ended up just saying it was fine and he didn't want anything else. The staff handled the situation with great customer service as they comped his meal since he wasn't satisfied with the food he was served. No fuss or anything, unlike other restaurants who simply apologize but don't do much about it. \n\nOverall, great experience and I'll definitely be back,
