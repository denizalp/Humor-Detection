Meh food, but probably one of the nicest delivery guys I've ever met. \n\nI'm of the opinion that Thai food in Toronto is sort of like Chinese food in a small town: all chicken balls and chop suey. This place is no different. They have the standard cashew chicken and other stuff that I imagine Thai families don't actually make at home. I knew this was the case going in, but no one at work wanted to drive to get food, and the places I usually go to nearby were all closed due to the Jewish holidays, and this was the only place that delivered so we ordered from here.\n\nIt was honestly not bad. I had the Spicy Eggplant, which wasn't the best I ever had, but was pretty good. The sticky rice I had on the side was really great, and came with a nice peanut sauce. My coworkers ordered the mango salad (a little mealy and sweet, not spicy at all) and the Shanghai noodles, which were actually these clear, broad, tangly noodles that I've never seen before. It tasted good enough, but it wasn't anything to write home about.\n\nLike I said, the delivery guy was super nice. All smiles and thank-yous. He came with a debit machine in hand, which was cool. I'm not sure if I'd ever order here again, maybe if I were having a craving for fast-foody pad thai.
