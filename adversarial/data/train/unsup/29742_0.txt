Both of my daughter's headlights were out so she was driving around with her brights if she had to go anywhere at night. Her husband hadn't gotten around to replacing them in the two or more months they'd been out.  I looked on YouTube to see if it was something she and I could do and after watching about 5 short YouTube videos I decided that we could do it. \n\nShe said she already had the bulbs so I had her stop by my place after work. She popped open the hood and we got started but when we went to put the first bulb in that she had bought at Wal-Mart, it turned out to be the wrong bulb. It was the H11 but she needed the H11B. We jumped in my car and drove down to AutoZone which was just a couple blocks away and looked over their selection. At first they only had one guy behind the counter so we couldn't ask anyone questions because he was busy with customers. Then a second guy came out and took the next customer and a third guy came out and started to help us. We asked if that was the most reasonably-priced both they had and he said it was so we bought two of them at $21.99 each. Without my asking he gave us a 10% discount so they came closer to $20 each which was helpful. I don't know if it was because I was a senior or because we said it was the first time we had been in that store, but it was nice that he offered that. We took the bulbs back, got them installed and I felt better knowing she wasn't driving around with her brights on.  I hate when other people shine their brights in my eyes. Plus now I don't have to worry about her getting a ticket. \n\nThank you to the guys at AutoZone for helping us out and saving us a couple dollars.
