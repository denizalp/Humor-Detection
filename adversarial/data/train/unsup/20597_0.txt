The gyro plate and feta and everything is so good that I can't help but fantasize that I am some secret agent ready to take a bullet for Sofia's Cafe.  I keep a steely hawk eyed stare at all times to protect her and I utilize brutal forms of open handed combat inspired by the wild boar in order to better defend her honor.  The grape leaves are really good and the yogurt sauce should just be called yogi sauce since it activates my deeper inner realms of enlightenment with the sheer yum yum of it.  The baba ganoush woops some bunghole too!
