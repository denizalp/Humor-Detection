The location and the atmosphere is inside the casino, with dim light, very comfortable for family or romantic mood ;)...and they still open late after 10 pm (score!) plus they have a very nice setting bar aside. \nCrispy calamari was great, crispy, not salty or oily, although no dipping signature for this menu.\nBlack Orchid Ahi, is my new favorite here! the sauce was tasty especially if you sprinkle lemon before you start eating.\nThe service is great, fast, helpful, and friendly. Although they don't have ponzu sauce, they replaced it with sliced lemon and soy, quite close :).\nOverall, I had a great experiences here, I would like to go back to try something else.
