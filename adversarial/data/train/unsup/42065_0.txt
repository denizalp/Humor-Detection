I stopped in during happy hour on a Monday. The place has a nice location with a beautiful patio.  There was a decent amount of people for being a Monday.  We had the ceviche, and I had the plantain bowl.  Between the rice, beans, onion, bell pepper, and corn, it created a nice combination of texture and flavors.  The staff was friendly and nice to look at, which always helps...This would be a great place to stop in for a few margaritas or tequila flights on the weekend!
