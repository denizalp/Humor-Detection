Cookies are good and it kinda taste like rice crispy. It's $4 each for cookies and it's not even big. \nChocolate truffle my favorite, chocolatey inside and the outer cover taste soo good but I\ndon't know what it is. It just super good. \nCrack pie is small, pricey and tastes okay.\nThe crack pie soft serve is good too. No need for toppings.\n\nI had a hard time deciding and reading their menu.\nThe two ladies was like rushing me.
