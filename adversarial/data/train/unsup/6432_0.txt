Look, I hate tapas.\n\nI hate it so much.\n\n\"It's a series of small plates, so you can try lots of different things!\"\n\nAwesome!\n\n\"Since the meal isn't served in one big push, it's easier to chat!\"\n\nSounds great!\n\n\"Everything's meant for sharing!\"\n\nWait... But you said...\n\n\"...Except the portions are tiny, so the moment you find something you like, you can't have any more of it!\"\n\nErr...\n\n\"And all the dishes are EXPENSIVE!  Often as expensive as a regular entree!\"\n\nTha' f*** you just say to me?!?\n\n\"And frequently, half the dishes suck!\"\n\nLET ME THE HELL OUT OF HEEERE! ;_;\n\nSo yeah, that's why I hate tapas.  It's also why I love, love Bar Isabel; none of those problems exist here. Devastating food in a great atmosphere, with incredible service, in portions that are fit for sharing at a great value.\n\n...Did I mention the food was devastating?  \n\nI walked in with the intent of getting 1 cocktail and 4 dishes.  Instead I had 3 cocktails and 9 dishes.  At one point they took my menu away, but the joke was on them because I'd been ordering off a copy on my phone all night anyways.\n\nSuckers.\n\nArbol Chili Chickpeas & Snow Pea Leaves - I could write 5000 characters on this dish alone. The thing about Bar Isabel is that whatever's written on the menu only partly describe the dish.  Here, there was no mention of the tart lemony notes that flitter about the snow pea leaves, surprising the tongue in perfect contrast to the heat of the chilis.  This was one of the best things I ate all night, and it was 6 bucks.  Ridiculous.  \n\nDevilled Duck Egg, Salt Cod, Morcilla, Hollandaise - Like a mini eggs benedict, but deeper in flavor without being overly rich.  The creamy blood sausage mixes with the hollandaise and the yolk of the duck egg, creating a silken amalgamation.  Tasty.\n\nMussel Escabeche & Pan Con Tomate - This was delicious, albeit you'll definitely want to share it; my little pot of escabeche deliciousness was packed with 10 or more mussels, and while mussels 1-3 were delicious, mussels 8-to-however-many-damn-mussels-were-in-this-thing had me wondering just how many mussels these people thought I wanted.  I was wishing there was a half-portion by the time I was finished.  How often does that happen at a tapas place?\n\nRoast Bone Marrow - Served with toasted sourdough, the bone marrow takes on different dynamics when you avail yourself of the accompanying sea salt and\/or chimichurri sauce.  \n\nI'm trying not to use the word \"silken\" again.\n\nChorizo Verde & Octopus Skewers - I came here wanting the Grilled Octopus, but as I was dining solo I decided to just stick to the smaller-and-on-a-stick version.  \n\nGood decision.  The chorizo verde is beautiful, without a hint of grease, rich in meaty and herbal flavors.  It imparts those green notes to the perfectly-cooked bits of octopus, the two difficult to separate when eaten together.  Micro greens adorning the top of each brochette play with texture.  Incredible, especially with the Arbol Chickpeas.\n\nSubtle and brilliant.\n\nOriginal Tongue on Brioche - This is one of the most lauded items on the menu, and yes, the rumors that it can be a meal in and of itself are true.  Melt-in-your-mouth tongue on soft and crispy brioche tastes of deep brining, drizzled in a creamy sauce with herbal notes.  The accompanying purple mustard adds a delicate tang; I can't understand why such a decadent dish doesn't feel heavy at all.  Worth going back for.\n\nPatatas Bravas - Wow, this is one of the saltiest things I've ever eaten: a mountain of perfectly fried pieces of golden potato, dressed in a bunch of stuff I honestly can't remember, the mission is clear - this is drinking food, and enough of it for several people.  I got to this when I was three drinks deep into the evening and it was right on the mark.  This isn't subtle, but it'll keep you from waking up with a hangover the next day.\n\nBasque Cake & Sherry Cream - Another big-hype dish that delivers, it's rich without being heavy or overly sweet.  The crust is crisp, the center gooey and delicious. The generous portion of sherry cream seems imposing, but imparts no weight to the dish, only serving to dress all sides of each piece in further depths of heavenly sweetness.\n\nAnd the drinks were pretty great, too!\n\nA Woman Scorned - I'm a huge boulevardier fan, and this is a bourbon cocktail in very much the same vein, but with light fiery notes of heat and romance.  My favorite drink of the evening.\n\nLast Word - The best Last Word I've ever had.  Sorry, Harbor Room.\n\nIsabel Fashioned - The lone disappointment of the evening, this was indisinguishable from an Old Fashioned anywhere else.  Sidecar's version has this beat.\n\nReputable people have been saying some ridiculous things about Bar Isabel: phrases like \"they're killin' the game\" have been used un-ironically, which would normally be inexcusable.  But believe the hype: Bar Isabel is the tapas restaurant you've always imagined.  Just incredible.
