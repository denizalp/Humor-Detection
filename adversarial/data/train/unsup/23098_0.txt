Dude this place is the shit! The fastest way to ruin your business is to mix \"scary bikers\" with sports bar patrons. Guess what? Everyone just wants to have a good time and a couple cocktails. I have been coming here for over 2 years and I yet to see any type of confrontation. From coming here every Tuesday, where they feed you for free while featuring the show \"Sons of Anarchy\" theater style. (The owner rides a motorcylce after all, that's where \"Represent MotherFucker\" came from I'm told) Even coming here Sundays for football! It's a lot of fun and the best thing about it is Baseline Sportsbar is a family owned and operated bar. The girls are really cool, and each have their own style. Don't be a dick or a douche and you will have a great time here! Support local, small businesses who support the community. \n\nP.S. My phone died while I was writing this review and not knowing, out of nowhere, the bartender \" Jillian\" I think, asked what type of phone I had and offered me a charger....that's service!
