Pretty typical Irish pub with a nice little outdoor seating area and there was a good live band on Friday night. Overall, there arent too many options when at Lake Las Vegas, and this place seemed to be the busiest place down there. The whole Montelago village is a nice area to wander around in, and If I'm down there again, I'll stop back in.\n\nOk, I'll be honest...I cant remember this place very well...too much whiskey...but I think what I wrote is accurate. And obviously I had a good time.
