The good:\n- The food was incredible.\n- The prices are very reasonable. \n- You can order anything, and it will be amazing. There's a limited menu, which makes ordering a lot easier. \n\nThe bad: \n- took 2 hours of standing, waiting for my pre-ordered take out! 2 HOURS! (i still can't believe it ..) \n- the service. yeah, there is none of that here. Good luck getting a table if you're submissive or overly polite. It won't happen, as the staff doesn't know what's going on either.\n- prepare for a 'couples' fight', if you're unprepared for the uncomfortable 'don't know what's going on' factor. During my wait, I witnessed 3 couple-fights over, 'go ask what's taking so long!'. If you and your significant other end up arguing at IKEA, then stay far away from Sukho Thai.\n- Watched 4 tables get completely incorrect orders. Food was moved around for a good 15 minutes, up and down stairs, back up stairs again, that food had seen all corners of the very cramped restaurant. \n- 2 tables left, after not receiving drinks after 35 minutes. \n- When other reviewers stay this place is small, they're not kidding. My 6'5\" boyfriend had to wait outside, as he was (literally) hunched over in the main area of the restaurant. With that being said, the ceiling are low! \n- I watched so many ethically questionable customer service actions during my 2 hour wait, I'm not sure I'd ever return. \n\n\nBut it was so tasty ... \nBut the service was sooo terrible ...\nWhy must you tease me, Sukho Thai :(
