July 2011\n\nNever heard of Arepas?  You aren't alone.  This was a Yelp find by my girlfriend and we just had to try it. \n\nPros:\n +  i Love Arepas !\n + Open late\n + Friendly staff\n + Awesome Hot sauce\n\nCons:\n  -  N\/A  \n\nOverall:\n  I'm not a Venezuelan expert or anything, but the easiest way to describe it is a Venezuelan version of a taco.  I don't really know how else to explain it ha.  You just gotta try it for yourself!  I'm sure you won't be disappointed.\n\nThis place is addicting.  I personally loved the Lengua Arepa... Tongue for those who do not know.  It's located on the north end of the strip.  It's just a little stand with a few tables for seating, but don't judge the book by its' cover.  This was a pleasant surprise!  Next time I go, I'm going to try one of their Fruit Juices... I hear they are pretty good.\n\nTips:\n -  I didn't know how filling 1 Arepa was.  I ordered 3 Arepas thinking it was equivalent of 3 tacos at say Don Tortacos, but I was wrong.  Arepas are a lot heavier than a taco.  I'd say 2 and your good to go.\n\n-  If you like spicy hot... try their hot sauce.  It has a good kick to it.\n\n-  Don't forget to grab some extra napkins... you're gonna need it.\n\n-  They take card so don't worry if you don't have cash.
