The smell they pump into the air in this hotel makes me insane.  I'm usually here for a week when I come and it's like a weeklong headache.  Please, please, please Venetian - turn it down, just a little.  I can smell it before I even enter the building.\nThe suites are lovely.\nThe room service food is meh.  Why would you be eating in your room anyway though, right?\nService is good.\nI'd give it four stars but I just CANNOT stand that smell.
