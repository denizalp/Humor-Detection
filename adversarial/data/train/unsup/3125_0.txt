Tony F took me to Ding Tai Fung before our big trip to Walmart to try on DD bras and look for red one-piece bathing suits.\n\nThey gots some delicious dumplings here! My favourite was the wontons served in a spicy oily sauce. We used to the remaining sauce on all the rest of our dumplings, yum!\n\nWe also tried one of the soup dumplings, green onion pancake and a some different kind of shui mai that had rice packed on top.\n\nThe soup dumplings and green onion pancake were both really good. The rice shui mai was very bland though, wouldn't recommend ordering that. Meh.\n\nThe service was okay, but I was really quite offended that the server asked if I wanted a fork. Listen lady, I am an egg! Give me some credit, please.\n\nOverall absolutely delicious food, but the atmosphere is kind of lacking. High ceilings and large sterile looking decor which resulted in a kind of cafeteria-like dining experience. \n\nWasn't the cheapest dim sum I've eaten, but the price is fair given the quality of the food. Would go back often if it was downtown ;)
