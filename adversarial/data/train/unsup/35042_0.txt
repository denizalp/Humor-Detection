Came here on a Saturday night with 8 girls and 7 guys. One of the girls knew a good promoter who was able to get us on the guest list and even the guys got in free, despite the not-so-favorable girl-guy ratio. Tip: get here early!!! We left around 10 from the Cosmopolitan hotel area, got here before 11, and got in around 11:30-11:45ish. So total wait time was about 45ish minutes, even with being on the guest list! I can't imagine waiting in the general admission line. That's the only reason why I knock one star off: one of the guys working in the front LOST our slip that indicated comping 8 girls and 7 guys. That ate up another 10-15 minutes of wait time. Once inside, the club itself is very nice (it's the Encore Beach Club during the day). I like the crowd at the Wynn-Encore hotels because they tend to lean on the classier-side. The best thing about the night was that girls got in free with wristbands that allowed us any vodka drinks for FREE until 12:30. Free cover, and drinks?! I like free. =)
