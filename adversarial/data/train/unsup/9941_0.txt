One of the most reviewed and highest places to eat in Vegas, OFF the strip count me in!\nIt was pretty busy for dinner, but we got a great table just a few minutes later.\nService was nice, though they were busy, they got our order right and food came out quickly,\nThe menu is very different from any other burger place, takes a while to take it in and narrow down the selection.\nFor starters we had the chili fried chicken LOVE, so crispy, sweet and spicy, perfect!\nOnion rings and salt and pepper garlic fries, also excellent, piping hot and crunchy with great flavors, win!\nKids meal, a great value at $9, full sized burger, fries and a side of fruit and veggies, score!\nI had the Caesar with Baby Romaine, Avocado, Tomato, Parmesan Reggiano, Organic Jidori Chicken Breast and Spanish Anchovy \nNot a fan, basically a plate of cheese, killed the lightness and all other flavors, cold chicken and I tried my way through all of their dressings, liked none and just didn't eat the salad, no bueno.\nMuch better was the No meat here burger with Wheat ,Red Bean, Shiitake Mushroom Patty, Japanese Eggplant , Mixed Greens, Tofu, Chili Lime Vinaigrette\nBasically 3 veggie burgers in one.\nThe breaded eggplant I can do without, but that Mushroom patty was AMAZING!\nThere was so much going on, so many flavors, so many taste buds that had never been tickled like that!\nMy husband had the The \"Banh-Mi\" Burger with Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass Pork Pate. Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli Pickled Vegetables, Nuoc Mam Sauce and liked it though, all the different meats in one burger got to him after awhile. \nPortions are not huge, but the flavors are so intense, that everything is served in perfect proportion.\nCan't wait to be back, something to look forward to next time I am in Vegas!
