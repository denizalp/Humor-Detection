I should note that in my head, all Starbucks with a drive-thru automatically earn 1 extra star.\n\nI have decided I don't really like Starbucks' coffee very much. I think the baristas are awesome and I appreciate that they are everywhere, ensuring I can get my caffeine fix from a place who's consistently mediocre product I can rely on.\n\nI KNOW that Starbucks' \"bold\" coffee tastes burnt and all their flavored drinks will taste like syrup. And yet, when there's no Blue Bottle or Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf to be found nearby, I find myself being drawn to that green logo.\n\nEspecially when it's AWESOME ENOUGH TO HAVE A DRIVE-THRU!
