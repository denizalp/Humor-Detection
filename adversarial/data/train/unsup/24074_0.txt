Forget Subway's $5 footlong. The Vietnamese sandwiches here are twice as delicious and they're only $2.25. No, that's not a typo. Each banh mi costs a twoonie and a quarter. No other food offers that much deliciousness for so little coin.\n\nI've tried the roast pork banh mi and shredded chicken banh mi. Both are good but the pork was more flavorful. The lady at the till will ask, \"You want spicy?\" The correct answer is yes.  Then let the sandwich elves behind the counter work their magic.\n\nWhen you get your sub, you can park yourself on one of the five tacky chairs in the rather charmless joint. Then brace yourself for the explosion of flavors and textures you're about to encounter: crisp-airy baguette slathered with buttery mayo and filled (but never overstuffed) with savory meat, cool cukes, crunchy shreds of pickled carrots, refreshing cilantro sprigs, and a few chili slices to keep it sassy.\n\nOh, man. Banh mi are so good I lie in bed at night thinking about eating these sandwiches. (Er...oops, was that an overshare?)
