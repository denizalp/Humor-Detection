If I could give 3.5 stars, I would. Great service, great Groupon, and the pizza was pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. My husband and I shared the Sausage Caramelized Onion Pizza and the Pesto Chicken Pizza. The waitress did not mask her shock at the fact that two slender adults were going to devour two whole pizzas, but she was nice, and apologized at the end of the meal for doubting us (we took two slices of my Pesto Chicken Pizza home, but the rest was gone). The service was very quick and pleasant, and the price was right. The Sausage Caramelized Onion Pizza was very flavorful, and I enjoyed the combination of the sweet onions and the salty sausage. The Pesto Chicken Pizza was not particularly flavorful, despite our addition of sundried tomatoes. I thought that the pesto could have used more garlic, or salt, or parmesan, or something. And the soggy tomato slices on top did not add anything positive to the pizza. \n\nBut on the whole, it was a pretty good meal, and I would go back to try some other items on the menu. Especially if I have a Groupon!
