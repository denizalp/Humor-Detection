Oh yeah - now we are talking....so after a long night that had involved many of the seven sins, including gluttony, we came here at oh-dark-thirty to round off the night, as we needed some more food and drink to keep us going.\n\nGreat service, great food, great fun place where it seemed like everyone had the night we had and were starting the process of recovery.\n\nI would give ti 5 starts except I had a breakfast item whose description ran to about three paragraphs - maybe it had Joe, or Francisco or something like that in the name, and I just felt i had to have an item that had a two word name and a two paragraph description on the menu.\n\nLet me rewrite the description for them : \" This looks and tastes like deep fried vomit.\"\n\nIt was truly excrable but it did not turn me off this great place.
