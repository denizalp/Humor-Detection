Went here for our sons baseball tournament for the memorial day weekend. Check in was great being that we paid for an early check in. The room was ok size but the furniture showed many signs of age. It was pretty easy to navigate thru the hotel and the beach and wave pool was awesome. The kids loved it. Of course this place is a tourist trap and they charge for everything extra amenity. But you should already know this going into Vegas. Overall we had a great experience and would return again if the price was right.
