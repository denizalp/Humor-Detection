This place is like a little piece of Las Vegas history.  An older gentleman serenades you with the accordion and a song that is relevant to your table...he's adorable and talented.  You get FREE (really) house white wine and red wine with your meal, as well as a house salad or minestrone, and after your meal, you get \"cappuccino\" which is more like hot chocolate with whipped cream on top.  I didn't have very high expectations for this joint, as my father was born in Sicily, so I get the \"real deal\" at home.  But, I had the cannelloni - and it was pretty darn good!!  Came with a side of cheesy, creamed spinach.  My husband had Cioppino- which had half a lobster tail, chunks of salmon, mussels, and scallops - a big bowl of good seafood in a mildly spicy tomato broth.  And every table gets unlimited garlic cheese Italian bread.  Portions are huge- taste is good-service is spot on.  It's as close to the real deal for those prices as you will ever get!  And you are privileged to dine in a nostalgic place, where the west was once wild, albeit Italian.  That's Amore!!!
