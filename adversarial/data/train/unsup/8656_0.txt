My date was over half an hour late (story of my life) but the wait staff made sure I was very comfortable.  I was served water and bread to keep me occupied and also asked if I wanted to order a beverage while waiting.  I liked the acknowledgment, but also liked that they didn't bother me too often.\n\nBy the time he finally showed up, I had studied the menu and wine list cover to cover.  We both decided on the Pinot Noir and shared the Antipasto Fredo (cheese, meats, olives, peppers, salmon and salad).  I also ordered the calamari to start and my date had the soup of the day - carrot with something.  He wouldn't stop talking about how great the soup was.  I loved my calamari as well.  The Antipasto platter was fantastic - a great variety of meats and cheeses, all very tasty and beautifully displayed.\n\nFor my main dish I ordered the gnocchi with pears and walnuts.  I forgot how filling gnocchi is and only finished about half my dish.  I had hoped there would be more pears in the dish, but enjoyed the bits that were there.  I also really enjoyed the texture of the walnuts in my pasta.  My date enjoyed the lamb shank (another special of the day) and had only great things to say about it.\n\nI didn't think I deserved dessert after not finishing my meal, but we ended up ordering a tiramisu (Ã  la mode) to share.  It was a tiny portion, but more than enough for me as I was overstuffed by this point.  The tiramisu was rich and creamy.  A great way to finish off a fantastic meal.\n\nWe were dining inside as it was drizzling rain on and off, but the patio out front is fairly large and would be great during the day for drinks.  There was also a live band outside.  They kept the door open so we also enjoyed the music, even though we couldn't see the performers.
