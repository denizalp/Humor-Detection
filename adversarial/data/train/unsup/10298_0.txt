This club is the mecca of all clubs. Grandest, biggest club and better than any Miami or London club I been to in the past.\n\nThe line is long, but it goes quick. If you bring a gatorade bottle full of your favorite mix drink and chit chat with the people in line, you will be at the door in no time. Walk in this place and you will surely notice, it is grand. Half indoor and half outdoor with a ginormous pool in the middle. Go go dancers on poles and attractive, sexy people everywhere. This is how a club should be.\n\nThere was even drama within my group and all I can say is I still think this place is worth it. Just realize any cash you come with will be gone by the end of the night and your bank account will take a nice hit. You might wince in the morning from how much you might spend.
