First time getting my wash done here and I have to say I am impressed. They take their time and are very detailed. Every wash gets checked by a manager to make sure it looks maculate! They also offer free water and fountain drinks that make it a little better for the wait.. I have found my new car wash place! Definitely would recommend this to anyone who is willing to pay a little extra for an amazing wash(:
