$15 bucks to get train wrecked for the whole night and you get a novelty cup to show your friends how much of a fruitcake you are? I'm in.\n\n190 octane plus 2 shots of 151 (or do they use Everclear? Who cares, AMIRITE?) will be more than sufficient. Did I mention the extra shots are only a buck each?\n\nMake sure you mix it up real good. If you don't, you'll be chugging pure 151 towards the end.
