I dropped by this location about an hour ago. I was greeted promptly once I got to the counter. My take-home order arrived quickly. Order was correct, chicken was prepared well and tasted good. Rice, beans and tortillas were good. A great overall take-out experience. I did read some of the reviews before deciding to order from this location. As far as some of the negative reviews go... I took a quick look at the reviews they leave for other establishments. Consider the source in some of these reviews. They seem to have negative experiences no matter where they go!
