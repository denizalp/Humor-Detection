If I call and say \"is my dog ready from being groomed\" and you say \"yes she is\", then I come to get her, wait while you are on the phone, pay you, then 3 other customers come in, pay, get their dogs, leave and I'm still waiting for you to bring out my dog after waiting 15 minutes since paying, something tells me you customer service skills are really shot to h***. Not bringing my dog here again. Let me also mention that all 3 previous customers were not black and were serviced and left immediately.
