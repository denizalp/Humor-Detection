Rebel has good prices, this location still offers 100 Octane.\n\nThe Rebel at Trop and Pecos never prints receipts at the pump, which I always take, so I have to go inside for a receipt. Not normally a problem, but I don't want to reek of smoke just to get a receipt.\n\nThis rebel doesn't have smoking inside, so if the pump happens to be out of paper (which is rare at this location), it takes but a moment to go inside and get a receipt.
