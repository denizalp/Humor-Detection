DJ Emporium was the in house DJ at the Royalton where we hosted our wedding a few months ago. We decided to keep them because the switching costs were really high and because they generally got good reviews. From our experience the price they charge is not worth the value they provide. We got the package with both a DJ and a host, yet for the most important part of the wedding - our ceremony, they didn't play the right music at the right time, even though they had everything spelled out in advance as to what song plays when - getting this wrong was a huge let down. Also, they promised their stage would have a black backdrop, which we had particularly requested and put in the contract, and they didn't have it on the day of our wedding. The host was off schedule and skipped important events on the agenda also provided in advance. Overall they did an okay job with the music (literally couldn't mess it up though because we provided on USB basically every song we wanted them to play given it was a multicultural wedding) and we liked their bongo player. Also, the host did make things very lively and I liked how they handled our reception entrances. However, I would not recommend them when there are better companies out there that charge a fraction of their price. Before you book with the Royalton, or any venue where they're the in house DJ, make sure to factor the switching costs (a lot more than $450 if you want to use all their built in lighting, pin lights, projectors, surround sound equipment and mandatory technicians) into the price negotiations with the venue.
