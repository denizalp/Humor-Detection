Stayed here for 2 nights with friends.  We booked 2 attached rooms - 1 being a regular king, and the other a 1 bed suite.\n\nPros:\nBoth rooms were clean and very nice.  Interior and decorations makes you feel like you in a high rise condo, and also makes you want to start the party early.\nStaff was professional and friendly.  Housekeepers greet you with a smile.\nKitchens are fully stocked with everything you need - plates, silverware, dishwasher, paper towels, etc.\nThe fridge in the regular 1 bed was a mini one.  The 1 bed suite had a full fridge (w\/freezer) and even a filtered water and ice dispenser.\nGood location - hotel is attached to miracle mile shops.  Plenty to do, see, eat and shop.  It is about a 5 minute walk to Planet Hollywood (through the miracle mile shops).  It is an additional 15-20 minute walk north to the Linq Hotel.\nThe couches in both rooms had pull out beds.\n\nCons:\nThe parking garage is shared with the miracle mile shops.  It's free, but it's a bit confusing to get to.  The signs are vague, and at one point I had to stop and ask an attendant for directions.  It is about a 10 minute walk from the parking garage, through the miracle mile shops, to the hotel.  \nBest thing to do is pull up to valet\/bellhop, unload your bags, and go park your car.  Or, you can valet it for $15\/day.\nTV was slow to respond to controller and had to reset on its own a couple times for it to start working properly.\nThe bathroom sink knob for cold water in the regular 1 bed was tight and had some corrosion.  Toilet paper felt like 1 ply and was rough on the behind.\n\nTip: If you are ordering uber\/lyft, push in the physical address for your location.  Don't pin it.  The pin took me to the hotel across when I thought it had pinned Elara.\n\nOverall, my friends and I had a nice stay and we would stay here again.
