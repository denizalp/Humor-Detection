Overload of yarn matey's!\n\nCrickey where to start with this place, I am a kid in a candy store, I get so excited when I enter this place. My body wants to go in about a zillion direcions at once and so do my eyes...zooooom\n\nEven though I can't knit or crotchet to save my life, well I could if I had too.. It just be a really long freaking scarf. Or a freakish sweater that I would try and pon off on a friend as a gift, much to their horror.. and then guilt them out for not wearing it! \n\nMuhhhaaaa! \n\nKnitters beware you will spend money here!
