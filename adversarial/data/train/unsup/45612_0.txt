I came here because of  the high praise people were giving it on yelp. Sadly, I'm  starting to wonder if people  writing on this page know the difference  between  good quality sushi and bad. To be blunt, it is not good sushi. We came for dinner which was $18.99. The sushi we got was falling apart even before we had even touched it. The fish was not fresh and our Kalbi  (beef ribs) looked like it was cooked on low heat with day old oil. I don't mean to sound like a sushi snob but i don't want others  to come here duped like me. The restaurant was served by sweet older Asians so i feel a bit bad about writing this review. However, they need to improve the quality of their sushi in order to keep their customers. \n\nMy favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in Whitby is Tatemono near Brock and Consumers road. It's about  $26 for dinner but at least I know  I'll enjoy my dining  experience. For those looking for a good place to eat sushi in Whitby, i hope this helps.
