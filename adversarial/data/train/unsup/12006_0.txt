Found a flyer stuck on my door the other day for Mafia Mike's pizza. Normally I find these things annoying and just trash them, but I happened to be hungry. And lazy. And they deliver.\n\nSo I ordered up a \"Big Buffalo Chicken\" pizza. Buffalo style chicken chunks (spicy, but not too much so) with a ranch dressing base instead of traditional tomato based. \n\nAnd I devoured the the entire pie (with help from two teenagers who declared the pizza \"Effing AWESOME!!)\n\nThe wife got some Hawaiian style. Personally I find fruit on pizza to be fundamentally wrong, but she said it was fabulous.\n\nGrab the cheesy crusty bread things too.
