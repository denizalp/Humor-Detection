I went here with a friend and I found that the food was good. The place got crowded very fast. We showed up around 11:45am for lunch and we got a seat right away but 30 minutes later, there were people waiting to be seated.\n\nUnlike Sushi St-Jean a few blocks away, there is plenty of parking in front of Matsuno.\n\nMatsuno is an AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi place where you pick your tickets from a piece of paper and they bring the items to you. I found the food to be good but I wasn't overly impressed with the service since we had to ask for our items (soup at the beginning and ice cream at the end) a few times before these items were brought to us.\n\nI found that the food was very good. Excluding the fact that we had to ask for our soup (at the beginning) and our ice cream (at the end) multiple times, I didn't have any issues. If they were better with bringing the items, I would rank them 5 stars.
