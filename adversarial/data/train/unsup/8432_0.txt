It's unfortunate to have to write a bad review but I need to warn the veggies out there.\n\nI ordered a veggie burger tonight and there was a piece of meat on it :(\n\nI picked up take-out, brought it home, and didnt want to return to fix it. I did call to let them know and the manager was very curteous, even offered a comp.\n\nHowever I did learn that they grill the veggie burgers on the same grill as the meat. That's how the meat ended up on my burger. If this concerns you I don't recommend eating here.
