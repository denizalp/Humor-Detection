Over all I liked the place.i ordered the beef sandwich with the dipping sauce. I got to say it wasn't the best ,in fact it tasted funny.ibwas only able to take three small bites.i brought this to the attention of the server.he sent the manager ,and said he would take care of it with a discount. I paid 9.50 for three bites of a sandwich ,I know that I won't be back.
