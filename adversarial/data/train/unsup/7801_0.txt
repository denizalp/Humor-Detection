Are you really, really rich?\n\nThen you should shop here on the regular.\n\nFresh Market is less than two miles from a Harris Teeter and a Trader Joe's- very bold Fresh Market.\n\nI was impressed with some BOGO offerings and stocked up on Pro Bars that my boyfriend loves but overall their meats and cheeses are muy moolah. Nothing compares to the cheese price and selection at Trader Joe's just a few steps down the block.\n\nWould I come for speciality items or if I wanted some expensive candy to impress my boss or something? Probably yeah, but unless this store is running a 50% off sale there are places to buy similar quality with a larger selection (this store is tiny) and less money.
