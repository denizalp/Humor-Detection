Great looking chapel. We had about 40 in our wedding and it was a nice, cozy setting. No Elvis or other Vegas flare. \n\nJust an elegant setting with attentive staff. Flowers were better than we expected, as was everything else. The photographer was also great. \n\nOur ceremony was 10 minutes long, which is just right as far as I'm concerned.
