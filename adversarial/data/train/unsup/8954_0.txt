As far as food is concerned it is good. As far as what we got for our reunion \"Chinese banquet\" dinner -- not so much. However, having said that, it is tough to organize a banquet for a large group and I felt we were jipped in price for what we got. I know if I went to the restaurant myself and ordered the same dishes, it would've cost much less.\n\nStill, our dishes were good. We had:\n\nSalt and pepper calamari -- your standard Chinese restaurant fare, good with tons of garlic\n\nFried veggie rolls -- I would've preferred these rolled in beancurd sheets, but what the hell\n\nShrimp with broccoli was nice, shrimp were plump, large and snappy.\n\nPeking duck -- this was sad as there was a measly piece of duck in a huge bao \n\nBlack pepper steak with portabello mushrooms -- strange combination but what the hell, it was good\n\nSteamed flounder -- okay I mean I order this dish often and it rarely runs more than $10-$12 a pop so don't sell it as something expensive PLEASE!\n\nStir fried green beans -- this was done really well with bits of preserved turnip greens in it. LOVED it.\n\nBraised duck E-fu noodles -- okay, epic fail because these were not E-fu noodles. They looked and tasted more like regular egg noodles. I was so damn disappointed because I love E-fu noodles and these were not it.\n\nAt the end of the day, this meal did not constitute $50\/head even with a few bottles of wine and beer thrown in. PUH-LEEZ! Only about 30% of the people had drinks. I think I was more upset that it was $50\/head. I know if we had just gone in ourselves and ordered this menu, we would've easily walked away paying no more than $25\/person tax and tip included.
