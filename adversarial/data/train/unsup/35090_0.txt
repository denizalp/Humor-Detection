This place is really awesome. I had a Groupon and my tech was Kelly. She did an impeccable job on my pedicure. I wish she hadn't rushed thru the massage and scrub portion of my service but that was the only complaint about the pedicure. I chose a regular CND color but they do carry Shellac as well. I had my service right before they went on a business trip and didn't have many colors to choose from so that was a bummer.\n\nMy manicure was a different story - I wanted an almond\/rounded stiletto shape and my nails were uneven due to 2 breaking. I think I was really excited about my service so I didn't really notice til I left.  The polish I wanted was all on my toes so I had to have a glittery polish. I wish she paid as much attention to my hands as she did with my feet.\n\nI had a great chat with Diana the owner and was pleased with that. The salon was in excellent condition, well maintained and I'll be back for that reason. The price is higher than most salons in the valley but you do get good quality and it is very clean.
