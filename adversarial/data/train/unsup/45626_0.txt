Love this store! Location is perfect - connected to the subway and the path and its a little removed from the chaos of the Eaton Centre.\nI recently discovered the home section of the Bay and it has been great! This is one of the few places that actually offers proper sales on their furniture pieces. They are a little expensive, but you are getting actual quality as opposed to plywood. Their warranty options for fabrics are absolutely incredible - they cover basically everything! We can stain it, rip it, burn it - everything is covered for 7 years. We never have to worry about the Bay going out of business either and their customer service is just great.
