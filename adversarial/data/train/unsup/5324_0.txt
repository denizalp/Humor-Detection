If I had to stay here again, I would. Especially if you're on a budget. I was in Las Vegas for business and we stayed here Tues - Fri. I thought the Monte Carlo was great place for a basic room!\n\nGOOD:\n+ Bed was comfortable\n+ Food court had McDonalds WITH a $1 menu. I stayed away but I thought this was unheard of in Las Vegas!\n+ 24 hours subway\n+ Close proximity to CVS & Walgreens (next door!)\n+ Great Bell Desk people! I lost my luggage ticket and they were sweet about it\n\nBAD:\n- The main light next to my bed didn't work\n- The water took forever to drain in the shower (had to stand in there while I showered!)\n- TV volume was acting crraazy (either too loud or too quiet)\n- Only extended my late checkout by 1 hour : (\n\nGood place for a budget stay, especially if you're on this end of the strip!
