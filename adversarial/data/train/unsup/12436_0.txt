2.5 Star\n\nWhenever I come by this relatively new plaza on Midland just North of Finch, I always got a little confused...\n\nI might visit one and write a review a few months or even weeks ago... and then it kind of disappeared and switch to something else but with similar menu and they even keep most of the interior deco.\n\nRain & Sunny Restaurant is one of those. This unit used to be Da Cheng  http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/da-cheng-chinese-cuisine-scarborough serving home made hand shaved noodle. And now with a new sign, a new name and a new layer of paint it is now Rain & Sunny.\n\nMenu is really similar as it is too specialized in Northern Chinese cuisine and hand shaved noodle.\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle Soup ($6.50) has the chewy, rustic hand shaved noodle that I like. The broth though is really light with not much taste of meat nor spices. There were only a few piece of overcooked beef in my bowl, but I guess it was not too bad as they were not too good?\n\nFrom reading their menu, seems like their speciality is Hand Made Lamb Noodle Soup in a milky lamb broth, I might give it a try one day.\n\nCash Only.
