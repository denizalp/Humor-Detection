Home Depot rocks!  When deciding between Lowe's or HD, I usually prefer the latter.  The store is nicely layed out and employees have always been friendly and knowledgeable, especially in the paint department.  I feel sorry for the workers during the Labor Day sales..it gets crazy at the paint desk. Lol Their Behr paints are pretty good..Maybe 2nd behind Sherwin Williams.  I bought some Behr deck stain this summer, so hopefully it holds up through the harsh winter weather.\n\nHome Depot does carry Toro, Honda, Ariens, and Cub Cadet lawnmowers and snow blowers, all very good brands.  I'm partial to Toro and Honda myself.\n\nTheir appliance selection is great...Samsung, LG, GE, Whirlpool, etc and their prices very competitive.  They will price match competitors too...just bring in the ad!\n\nI love walking through the lumber section there...the smell of the pressure treated wood is just intoxicating...mmmm...\n\nOh and if you're a veteran or active military with a valid ID, you can save 10% off any purchase, excluding labor!  My dad hooked me up with a discount on a hot water heater recently and saved me $48!\n\nOh and the self-checkout kiosks are awesome.  Never had an issue with them.
