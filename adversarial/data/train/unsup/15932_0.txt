I don't think I've ever had a bad time at Carnaval Court on any of my Vegas trips. Even after losing a $100 bill there last night. Like I literally dropped it on the ground at some point. \n\nMy favorite thing about this place has to be the fact it's not filled with a bunch of pretentious dbags. The age of the crowd is pretty varied. There was this old dude up front going all out who must have been in his 70s. But the average is probably 30. \n\nI was stuck with a hotel reservation alone since my friend got sick, so I hit this place up a few times and didn't feel uncomfortable chatting with people or dancing (though I was quite a few drinks in at that point). \n\nThe drinks aren't cheap (avg $12), but they make them strong. The bartenders are chill and fun to talk with and watch them do the flair thing.\n\nOut of the many times I've been, last night was the first time I've seen a cover. Usually it's free. But on a crowded Friday night I think it's necessary. It was only $10. \n\nAlso I like that they have blackjack tables inside! \n\nIt doesn't really get busy until 11pm. It was still going pretty hard on a Thursday at 4am. \n\nKnocking off stars for:\n-No outside drinks \n-Security guards have an attitude \n\n\nPS: If you found my $100 bill please message me :)
