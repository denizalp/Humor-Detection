This was my 4th time going and I usually get seen by Leo or Lee who do splendid and beautiful work, them two are the only reason I'm not leaving a 1 star review. Today I was seen by another gentleman that did very poorly left my nail polish chipped and nails uneven and sharp edges and wasn't too friendly either.
