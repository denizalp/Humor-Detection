I was the original owner of Best in Show in vegas. ..we had an upstanding reputation  and with that being said I would recommend lilac more than anyone in town. ..the only reason she wasn't working for me was because she was to busy becoming my competition. .she is an amazing person and groomer. .has patience of an angel. .will listen and deliver to your expectations...don't look any further she is the best. .trained with show groomers and had worked for many reputable shops...now has her own without all the flaws of others!
