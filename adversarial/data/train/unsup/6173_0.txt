The pharmacy service is so bad. I don't know how they function. It's almost unfathomable to consider the number of times their incompetence gave me unnecessary hassle. It's not just one... It's the majority of workers. Specific problems:  failed twice to process script requests when made in person. They couldn't find scripts on four different occasions... Until I went in person and they 'found' it in the computer when I insisted they double-check. Their response? \"Stay well\"
