After reading good reviews, we stepped Cosmopolitan and went searching for this pizza place. Walked up and down a couple of times, one end to another, but couldn't find it. We were almost about to give up, when we asked one of the folks who works there and found the way. A narrow passage leads to Secret Pizza.\n\nWe got two slices of pizza, one is white pizza with different varieties of cheese and another one was with veggies and pepperoni. I liked the white pizza, although I thought both were too oily. I liked the pizzas, but nothing extraordinary about them. Also thought they were on the pricey side.
