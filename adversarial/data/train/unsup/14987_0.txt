Granted I came here on a busy day but no need to be rude or have a snappy attitude.  I was at container park for my race packet pick up and ordered a brisket & pork and 6 rib bones with a beer and wine.  Hefty price but it was good eating.  Really good rib bones might I add!   \n\nBut when I went up to ask about our missing rolls I got the biggest attitude in the world and they were sure it was on our plates and can't do anything about it.  I was like wow, okay.  Not the biggest loss and I wasn't going to hold up a line stretched out the door.  Good food, but horrible under business pressure.  I'd come again
