Who knew there was a booze district in Henderson? Watch out Ireland and Tennessee. Las Vegas Distillery is about to put Nevada on the map! \n\nThe Las Vegas Distillery is a one-of-a-kind spot in the desert. The setup is eye-catching from the column stills to the bar and gift shop. The owner, George, is an entertaining guy from Eastern Europe who will drop some serious liquor knowledge on you. Most impressive was his hard work and persistence to chase the American dream and build this distillery from the ground up. \n\nIf you have some time, the $15 tour and tasting is worth it. Lasting about an hour, George took us through the process of making different types of distilled alcohols including vodka, gin, rum, and of course whisky. You get a chance to taste every type of alcohol produced on-site. Everyone had a great time and George made this one of the most memorable stops for my buddy on his bachelor party weekend.
