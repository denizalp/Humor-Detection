I really like Scramble. I take my Dad here whenever he is town to visit. I love how you walk up to order at the register and pay, but then your food is brought to you. They offer loose leaf tea, which I am a huge fan of..I always get the chamomile. It's not an overly greasy place, like many breakfast establishments are, and overall, it's very charming. The staff is very friendly, all healthy looking themselves, and they run an efficient ship. It's always a little busy when I go on the weekends, but it's never been an unreasonable wait.
