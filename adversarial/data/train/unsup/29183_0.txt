The quality of the bowls are very good. It has a calm vibe inside and a lot of tables in a small space. The bowl was tasty. I got the peanut butter bowl. They don't mix it in here just plop it on top. I am a big fan of acia bowls and was on this side of town and had to try here. I think they are a bit more of a smoothie stop and I noticed most patrons were drinking them so maybe next time I will try that. As for the bowl it was good and as for price vs qty it's a bit pricy. Thus the reason for my 4 stars and the crew as not super friendly However i would go again maybe an off day.
