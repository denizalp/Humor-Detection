My husband and I were in Vegas over the weekend and decided to attend Drai's for the Trey Songz event. There were so many people that I was concerned that we might not get in. However, we finally made it and it was well worth the wait. The club is beautiful and I love the indoor\/outdoor layout. Unfortunately, there were a couple of instances where people started to get a little too rowdy. Security was next to us apologized and said he would move us close to the stage before Trey came out. He kept his word and escorted us to the front. The show was awesome! I really had an awesome time and I look forward to coming back. Next time we will be doing VIP though :-)
