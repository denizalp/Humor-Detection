My fav place for 17 years.  The servers remember what I (always) order; it's ALMOST embarrassing.  Almost.  lol  \nI recommend everything but my fav is #42 - yellow curry with shrimp, it's almost like dessert.\nThe manager WILL let you know if you have overstayed your welcome.\nOtherwise, the service is consistently very good, the food is of high quality and there is plenty of parking. I have never had a mediocre meal and can't wait to return.\n\n(I haven't had the pho; poorly rated in a previous review - I cannot speak on it.)
