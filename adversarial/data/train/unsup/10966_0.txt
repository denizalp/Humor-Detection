Sometimes, one feels like eating a home cooked meal which is why I go to Nanay Gloria's once awhile in Las Vegas.  It's not like mom's home cooking but it has some comforts of home.  The expectation of maintaining a healthy diet shouldn't be in your mind when entering this restaurant too.  It is, of course, Filipino cuisine--lots of fried and greasy goodness.  The restaurant is small and serves a buffet style fare for only $7.49.  Seating is pretty cramped and limited so I wouldn't advise on bringing large groups.  Once you find a table get your grub on.  It's Filipino style, first come first served.  The most popular items usually run out, like oxtail, although I did not see it there when I went.  Dig on some of the different types of adobo (way of cooking food in the Philippines), pancits, and some lechon kawali (crispy pork).  Whatever you decide to eat here, don't forget to bring your heart monitor.  The food here is a cardiac arrest waiting to happen.  Don't forget to pay the cashier when you finish your buffet, and please leave a small tip in the tip box.  They do, of course, have to clean up your table's litter.
