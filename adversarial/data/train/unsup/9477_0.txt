I get around...and not just in the sexual sense ;) \n\nI also get around to bars. Many, many....many bars. (I love drinking and socializing, sue me!) So for whatever that's worth, I'm awarding this particular bar five stars because they nail it on all counts....vibe, decor, music, cocktails, food, lack of pretension.\n\nActually it feels like an NYC bar (think East Village\/Lower East Side etc)...and I only say that about bars with a certain 'je ne sais quoi' coolness factor. This place has it in spades.\n\nTo be honest, we only ate charcuterie (cheese\/meat selections) and veggie potstickers, but both dishes were done exceptionally well. Cocktails were great too. \n\nNext time I'm getting around (tonight perhaps?) I'll be back.
