As locals, we were waiting for the hubub to die down to experience the newest casino on the strip. We watched as the facade evolved and we were really excited to see the beautiful transformation from the old behemoth that had been the Sahara.\n\n As we drove up with out of town guests we all marveled at the  fresh snow white exterior in the dark desert night. We walked into the front entrance being dazzled by the \"lit\" floors and the sparkling giant glass entry.  As we stepped out of the bright contemporary well lit entry we hit an immediate disconnect on the casino floor. It looked like they ran out of money for the casino. The pipes and conduit are exposed like an old warehouse painted black with the ceilings which makes it look like you stepped into some seedy old dance club in NY.\n\nAs we wandered around looking for games, we discovered a tiny casino floor with limited gaming options and horror.....NO POKER room. WTH!? Restaurants were trendy and cool looking with the exception of the odd \"Griddle\" coffee shop. We did not eat in any of them nor had any inclination to do so after touring this odd place.\n\nAnother strange addition was the staff uniforms. The security were dressed in \"forever plaid\" dorky jackets that made them look more like a barbershop quartet than anything called security. The \"monkey\" outfits that the dealers wore were some kind of bizarre joke and it must feel a bit sad to have to wear that joke all day.\n\nAll in all, a very big disappointment. The vibe is bizarre and is definitely NOT a place I want to hang at. I can't believe the elite owners from Beverly Hills took such a gigantic misstep. Sadly, this place of long ago grandeur adds nothing to the sad north end of the strip. Still looking forward to new development to transform this seedy area.It is pitiful that the famous SLS Beverly Hills group will not be the one(s) to do it.
