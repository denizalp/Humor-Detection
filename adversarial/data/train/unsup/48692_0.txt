Traveled to Matthews often and never had tried it place.\nIt's a cross between chipotle and Asian hibachi.\nNot much really but it's fast food.\nI had a few things and you can pile high.\nThe staff is nice.\nThe cook went out of the way to help out and explain what sides you get.\nIt's ok. \nSolid 3 stars.
