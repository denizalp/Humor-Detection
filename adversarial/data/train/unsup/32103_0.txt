THIS particular nail salon FOCUSES on the DETAILS, it definitely stands out amongst the competitors in Waxhaw and neighboring cities. Here is a few examples as to why they are leading the way...\n-They offer their patrons wine or a cold beverage :) \n-One picks out their own lotion scent and their are many scents to choose from, I recommend the green tea or the lavender. \n-They offer Butter for a $3 dollar charge, I LOVE this line for it's durability & luster! #worthy \n-The proprietors are on top of their customer service and it shows. I had a not so great experience a few weeks ago, I communicated what occurred and they listened and ensured my granddaughter and I had a phenomenal experience this time around. \nThings will always go wrong somewhere (life was NOT intended to be perfect, hence people are not robots) as long as they are corrected all is good! \n\nI wanted to thank the nail technicians that made our day ...service awards go toooo Linda & Lam, their customer service and hospitality went ABOVE & BEYOND! Not to mention they are meticulous, they take pride in their work and that was evident in the outcome, gorgeous nail salon:) \nDaisy (pedi tech) Marie (neck masseuse) were also pretty great as they assisted and made our overall experience that much better. #bonus \n\n*NOTE\nDon't get turned off by a few negative reviews, our mani's & pedi's were amazing!! \n\nENJOY :)
