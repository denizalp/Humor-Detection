This is probably the most expensive treat I've eaten. I went in for an ice cream and ordered a \" blueberry waffle \" . Thinking I was ordering a waffle cone with blueberry ice cream and blueberries. Nope. It was a slightly warm waffle with blueberries and whipped cream. It tasted great but for 10$ I expected a lot more. Staff was very friendly if slow. All in all I won't be going back.
