I would love to have hung out and tried one of their breakfast items but I was in a hurry so that wasn't an option. Instead I got a chocolate croissant and an iced mocha. The mocha was fine but not memorable. The croissant was gummy in the middle. \n\nBut the thing that really got my attention was that I only got part of my change. The bill was $8.57 or something like that and the girl handed me only bills. I looked at my change then back at her. \"I think you forgot 40 cents or so.\" She then explained that she could \"totally give me my change\" but that they usually round their prices up or down to the nearest dollar. \n\nWell that's weird. \n\nIf you're going to round to the nearest dollar than don't bother to tell me that the price was anything except your rounded price. I've never heard of any other place that does this and there was no sign describing their rather unusual policy.\n\nThe 43 cents doesn't matter. But clearly communicating to your customers...THAT matters. Especially when you do a really uncommon thing with their money. Then it REALLY matters. And on that front this place failed miserably.\n\nPassable coffee, mediocre baked goods and very poor communication. Total Fail.
