Yo, axe me why mans gotta charge like a 19 dollar for a sample appetizer plate.  Mans get samples at Costco for free fam.  They brought out like a bento box ting with like 9 little bowls.  Yo, they put a cucumber on a small plate with a little yellow mustard sushi ting and told mans \"this ain't Japanese food mans can get around here.\"  Around where dawg!  Yo, you put a cucumber on a mini plate and you're telling me I can't get no cucumber from no grocery store? And they charge a 19 buck for it.  Rasssssssss.  I ordered a spicy ramen ting too.  Yo, on the real, they brought me the wrong ramen.  BUT.  I was cool wid it, y'know? Dun kno mans was deeeeeeealing the ramen but YO, the fire alarms go off.  And mans come to me like yo, don't worry, there's a fire in the next building but we're safe here.  YO!!!!! Dawg. They told me there was a fire in the NEXT building but we were fine.  Say word we're fine yo!  Say word!  Yo, if you go to this restaurant then you know it's on the second floor of the building.  IF there's a fire, you ain't fine dawg, you ain't fine on no second floor!!  Eventually they're all like, yo you gotta leave, take everything and bounce.  So I'm like what about my ramen dawg?  Y'all gonna let go cold or what?  Yo all in all imma give this place a 2 star.  One star because mans can appreciate a good ramen, y'know?  Like a nice soup with the noodle.  But yo, I ain't about no 19 dollars for no sample plate ting.  Y'all don't need to eat at this Japanese place, I ain't payin no Tokyo prices for no Markham sushi, go grab yourself a beer and a movie at the Cineplex VIP.  Trusss me danny.
