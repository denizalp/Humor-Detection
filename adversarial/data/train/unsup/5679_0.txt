Be careful here. You don't have any rights due to this being a Indian casino. This place took my mom winning away from her. My mom went to dinner there with a girl friend and after went and played a slot. After about 30 minutes of play a casino employee came over and asked for her ID. Once the employee had her ID he told her that she needed to come with him. After ask him why several times he finally answered. They said some lady had money in the machine my mom was playing. Witch I don't get why if someone had money in a machine why would you walk away from it? My mom put $40 in and after 30 minutes got it up to $200. Once they got into some room they took her to. They gave her two options witch were give the money back, or they would arrest her. My mom has never been in trouble and was very scared. This place must be going broke if they need to scare little old lady's and take them in a mafia style back room and press her to give the money she won far and square. Shame on you. If you want to go to a place that will make u give back the money you won and were you have no rights then go to this casino.
