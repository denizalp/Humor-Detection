Yes! I have completed my mission to watch all the Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas! And I got to complete it with Hubby on our anniversary and special day. Very fitting that we saw the show named after Love. I planned it that way of course.\n\nWe had pretty good seats, and both Hubby and I agreed that we liked the layout of the theater. It's different from other shows because the audience is seated all around the stage instead of only facing the stage in a half circle. Furthermore, it practically ensures that everyone gets a good view of the show. Because of the set up of the theater, I felt physically closer to the performers and as a result I felt more connected to the whole performance. I also really liked the fact that there were parts of the show that involved participation by the whole audience.\n\nOverall, I really liked the show. The only con is I love seeing acrobatics, but this show has less acrobatics than other Cirque shows, such as Mystere.
