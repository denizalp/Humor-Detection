I was scared.  I wanted to go here, but I was scared.  I was scared of the location, I was scared of the menu, I was just... scared.\n\nLast night changed though.  Something inside me gave me the courage to step into this establishment.  I don't know what I was expecting, but I was definitely surprised.  I was greeted with a big smile, instructions to sit wherever I wanted and my drink order taken right away.  \n\nI went with the chicken breast, waffle, scrambled eggs, and fried okra.  Needless to say, it was delicious.  I really can't say anything negative about this place.  I came, I ate, and I will be back.
