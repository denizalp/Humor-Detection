We stayed at Days Inn just for one night after landing in Calgary late in the night. There is complimentary shuttle service from the airport and we gave them a call from the phone by the shuttle parking zone. I think since it was very late in the night they asked us to take a cab and said they'll pay for the cab.\n\nCheck in process was quick. The room was pretty spacious and neat. Just enough to have a good night sleep.\n\nThey offer complimentary breakfast - yogurt, boiled eggs, bread, bagels, cereals, oats, bacon strips, omlette with cheese, coffee. Can't complain.\n\nEnterprise car rental is just a stone's throw away from the hotel, so was very convenient to rent a car nearby.
