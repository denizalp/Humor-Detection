When I saw those 30 minute parking spots in front of Java Joe's.. and then I hardly find any electric outlets inside the store too.. I know I would not have like this Java Joe's as much.\n\nThis place remind me of a Second Cup... though it might have more food options... but the set up is kind of uninviting. \n\nJewellery and Accessories on sale in a glass display case? In a coffee shop?\n\nThe last draw is when the barista frowned when I ordered an Americano ($1.95)... thinking why I don't just order a brewed coffee...\n\nMy drink is not bad...\n\nA lot of seniors hang around here as the Thornhill Seniors Centre is just around the corner. So if that's your scene with TV showing CP24... you will enjoy your experience at Java Joe's.\n\nFree Wifi just ask for the password.\n\nBTW, Thornhill Library just around the corner if all you need is some internet time or just to chill... they have electric outlets everywhere! :)
