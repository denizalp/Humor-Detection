$51 for an oil change, need I say  more?  They claim they did The works but there is no possible way they could have done everything they said AND rotated the tires in that short amount of time.  When I asked the service writer how he could possibly do everything they claimed in that short time he replied \"I had my best guy on it\"  U ever get the feeling u were just got screwed and can do nothing about it, well I just felt it.
