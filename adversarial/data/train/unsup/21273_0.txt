Decided to give this place a try based on it's yelp reviews and it's current yelp offer....A mani and pedi for 30 bucks! \n\nI was greeted by the owner, who assigned us our nail techs and he went back behind the computer. I thought it was an usual exchange because he was so into his computer screen, and I quickly saw why, he was deep into a computer game. \n\nMy nail tech was Donna, she shared her nail experiences, stating she had owned seven previous salons and was tired of being the boss so now she works under someone else. You would think that she has tons of nail experience right? Well, whatever she used under the polish, caused my manicure to chip the DAY AFTER! I literally lost half the paint on my nails two days after my manicure. A total waste of money! \n\nMy pedicure? It seemed to be holding up... That is, until about day 5, my toes started chipping too! I've never had this happen post pedicure. Maybe two or three weeks later, not 5!\n\nIt took over an hour and a half for my mani and pedi... My nails are not bad to begin with, they were just so slow and no one else in the salon so they kept stopping to talk, answer their cell phones, etc.\n\nAnd here's the kicker.... Upon payment, the owner took our cell phones to redeem the yelp offer, and asked us, on the spot to leave a yelp review before we pay him and show him the review. \n\nI will never return. Poor quality. Took too long, asking to review a yelp review before payment is not professional.
