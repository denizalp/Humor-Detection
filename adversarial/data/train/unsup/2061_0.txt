Who would've thought a small tiki bar located right outside the exit of the Bally's escalator would be one of the best bars out there?! This is the power of Vegas! \n\nThis wonderful island style bar is about the length of two tall guys' and a short girl's combined arm length, and has reggae and island music playing in the background. It is completely open so you see the wall, sink, and pineapple soft serve machine all in one glance. Usually a gentleman will be announcing you can get 2 for 1 drinks and it really is a treat. They make island concoctions like mai tais and other sweet drinks and of course, Dole whips. The best part? You can get one of those drinks and save the free second one for a later day. I bought a drink here on a Monday and got the second one on Friday. \n\nI like this place because it has quick service, generous pouring of alcohol, a chill atmosphere, and great deals. This tiny bar is the tits.
