Meats, veggies, fruits, sweets....All I can eat!!  Came here to this location a few times with a old coworker of mine.  \n\nThis location, look just like the other locations I been to, same food, same everything.  The workers were all friendly and kind and attentive.  They did their best keeping the tables clean.  The stacked clean dishes were a little dirty, pieces of food can be found stuck on them.  Had to shuffle through 20 of them before finding a clean one.\n\nThe food is like the other locations.. a great variety of foods from meats of many choice, soups, corn, friend chicken, ham, scrambled eggs and sausages, meat loaf, beef stew, rice and potatoes of many kinds, apple pie, ice cream, jello, bread, tacos, a salad area, spring rolls and teriyaki chicken looking food.  They have it all.  All good and tasty!  You'll never grow bored.\n\nAte so much food had to use the loo.  The restroom was clean, the toilet was of decent power slightly better than a common house toilet.  Overall a good experience, don't see why I wouldn't come back.
