I bought some gorgeous and tasty catfish here last weekend, which Kay and I are finding all sorts of uses for that included BBQ this evening. Their produce section is still the tops as well. They also have an army of cashiers on hand so that the lines move quickly. A nicer GE would be tough to find.
